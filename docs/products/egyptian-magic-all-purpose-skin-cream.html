            <li>Myself and my two sisters are using this now.. very happy girls</li>
            <li>I think that the best way to prevent wrinkles is to keep my face moist.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely excellent for the face and neck area.</li>
            <li>Everything that I was hoping for, excellent for anything and everything.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful all purpose cream.</li>
            <li>Used together these two products make the perfect team.  </li>
            <li>Especially great for the winter time.</li>
            <li>The best way to prepare is to use an Indian Healing Clay mask--mixed with apple cider vinegar--first.  </li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>You can wear it during the day, but I found that it&#x27;s best to put it on, pat away excess with a towel, then put makeup on.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>

            <li>Great on cuticles!</li>
            <li>The best stuff the allergists/dermatologists can come up with is Eucerin, which gives doctors samples by the bucket.  </li>
            <li>Best all around skin emulsion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>

            <li>Love this product!!!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a night cream and love it!!!</li>
            <li>This product smells very nice; just like honey!</li>
            <li>,  THE PROTECTION IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>But what a nice salve to come home to!!</li>
            <li>However, I did have very good luck with using the product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when people started telling me that I didn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li>a very good all-purpose cream.</li>
            <li>THEY SAID IT&#x60;S VERY GOOD   </li>
            <li>it was very good.  </li>
            <li>and it is ideal for the face.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, this application worked incredibly well for me in terms of healing and preventing recurrence of the eczema rashes on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It also works great on fly aways/frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>My face and hands never looked so good...!</li>
            <li>Good Stuff!</li>
            <li>before you buy it test your skin if you are suitable for it!!</li>
            <li>Once this cream is applied my skin is so radiant, even, and beautiful, that the Acne doesn&#x27;t matter or bother me.</li>
            <li>Gives a beautiful boost to my skin.</li>
            <li>it tames the fly-aways beautifully.</li>
            <li>good product!!!!!i love it!!!</li>
            <li>, the ingredients are great.</li>
            <li>, it can be used all over the body (which is great for me, I don&#x27;t like the way it sits on the skin, so I&#x27;m going to use the rest of my jar as a scalp treatment, who knows,</li>
            <li>This is a great product for skin care.</li>
            <li>I read great reviews on it and thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>I find this is especially important in the winter when everything dries out from lack of moisture.  </li>
            <li>But it is not that great at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use on your hands at night.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this after hearing great things about it.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>my son has eczema and it works great for him too.  </li>
            <li>It has helped with my acne greatly.</li>
            <li>this may be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have acne prone skin but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>It is great on elbows and feet as well.  </li>
            <li>This is great on your chest and on any scars.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>and well wasnt happy...</li>
            <li>Now I use it around my eyes and or over any scrapes I get as it has great healing properties.</li>
            <li>Great for just about anything.</li>
            <li>my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>This cream is a great way to eliminate problem areas on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just great.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation:  I&#x27;ve found that it is best to use it an an overnight cream for the face during any kind of weather.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Great for heels, lips, elbows, even the face.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect solution in Rose Hip Oil, by LifeFlo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to hear that there&#x27;s a MC cream here</li>
            <li>Great for preventing premature aging.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my skin takes a beating when i fly from all the recycled air and this protects my skin without causing it to break out.  </li>
            <li>Great, great product</li>
            <li>This is great for a night cream and for the winter giving me a lot of moisture in my skin.</li>

            <li>Egyptian Magic had the best reviews.</li>
            <li>A delightful skin treatment, whether it works magic or not.</li>
            <li>Should do my own account!</li>
            <li>She says, Egyptian Magic is wonderful, skin looks and feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t discovered Egyptian Magic yet, this skin cream is marvelous.</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>Nice !</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for many problems.  </li>
            <li>It holds curls in place really nicely!</li>
            <li>I have fairly severe eczema in my hands and have found that Egyptian Magic is the best at keeping my hands hydrated.</li>
            <li>The cream has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>If not it is still a great product, I love the way it smells too!</li>
            <li>using on feet really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but would rather recommend BioOil or Eight Hour Cream depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li>Based on the good review I bought this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product to use in winter.</li>
            <li>This is GOOD stuff.</li>
            <li>good product..</li>
            <li>great product....works really nicely ......</li>
            <li>good deal.</li>
            <li>So I knew the product will probably be good.</li>
            <li>Also good as a hair pomade.  </li>
            <li>This cream is turning out to be a really good buy.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the good news...</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>IS IN GOOD SHAPE,  AND IN WINTER IS UNBEATEABLE</li>
            <li>I think that it might be good used as a heel cream</li>
            <li>Also, EM is a good makeup remover and helps with moisturizing.</li>
            <li>good luck.</li>
            <li>yea dont think thats a good idea</li>
            <li>What can grow in oil and water without a preservative can kill you, or leave you deformed for life (MRSA is a good example).</li>
            <li>According to my wife, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>so I guess I can&#x27;t blame the product for that which is why I just gave it 3 stars to be fair.</li>
            <li>Plus amazon gives a good price.</li>
            <li>It is called Good News in Milford, DE.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I use on my face for eczema instead of steroids.</li>
            <li>I find it greasy &amp; it work as good as putting baby oil on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good for the hair too.</li>
            <li>However, it makes me feel good when I wake up in the morning after I use it every night.</li>
            <li>The cream worked well with the Weleda Calendula Cream I was using as a night cream, and made a good barrier to protect my rash from the elements.</li>
            <li>I just loved it for my boys</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking a good 10 years off my skin.  </li>
            <li>A good friend had tried this cream and recommended it to go with my perfective ceuticals</li>
            <li>Good skin product.that is not greasy.not greasey</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in two years.  </li>
            <li>Loved it and ordered again</li>
            <li>All is good except that its too oily.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been 2weeks and my skin looks really good</li>
            <li>The product feels good going on and lasts throughout the day and night if applied as directed.</li>
            <li>so the 4-oz size is a good value.</li>
            <li>Good for the skin and makes my fingernails stronger.</li>
            <li>Will make good use of it anyway.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be good for people with skin problem.</li>
            <li>I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;REALLY GOOD FOR:&lt;br /&gt;acne</li>
            <li>It was so good</li>
            <li>It is way too oily for me, if you applied this at night, good thing is that it does absorb in the morning,</li>
            <li>I loved this skin cream.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>This can be a good thing for some people because it makes it easier to apply</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this must-have product that i used to loved!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizing balm - I&#x27;ve been using it successfully for a couple of months</li>
            <li>A must have for beautiful, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Exceptional product.</li>
            <li>surprisingly, it this Magic Cream worked for her!</li>

            <li>Heard this product has great function, works for many types of fucntions.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is great and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>After checking with the site and reading here, I&#x27;m sure that those who aren&#x27;t happy had bought counterfeit goods.  </li>
            <li>He was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for a couple of weeks now and have been happy to see improvement in texture and reduction in wrinkles and scaring.  </li>
            <li>I read great reviews about this product an how so many celebs were using it.</li>
            <li>Egyptian a very magic cream..</li>
            <li>For all skin problem.. I really really love this product and proud to use it  ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for feet that are always in boots, I would know :)</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic works great all over body</li>
            <li>I am a very handsome dude</li>
            <li>Okay, nothing great about this product.</li>

            <li>Amazing magical balm!</li>
            <li>I use this product for almost anything and it has amazing results.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I have to say, it has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>those women have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have any amazing results, but</li>
            <li>Works great as moisturizer under makeup and does smooth the skin with continued use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great around the eyes at night and helps smooth your lips.</li>
            <li>So smooth and great results....</li>
            <li>If this product works for you, this is a wonderful plus as in the end, it will be very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By that time, I am good to go and my skin looks healthy and glowing, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>but if that was the case, there would be no reason I would have this kind of a reaction to it.</li>
            <li>it is a good hand/foot moiserizing cream, but nothing magic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of in a block in the tub.</li>
            <li>I used it on a some cuts and scrapes, which helped it heal nicely.  </li>
            <li>It does not however, reduce scars of any kind.</li>
            <li>an excellent beauty product that really smooths and sooths my face and neck.</li>
            <li>After seeing so many good reviews raving about how amazing this it.</li>
            <li>the good thing is this cream is effective in refreshing your skin, if you could bear your oily skin all night.</li>
            <li>Kind of</li>
            <li>really nice cream for the growing tummy.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY picky about what goes on my face, but this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>so,  I tried using a clay mask to get rid of the spots, and I noticed that no oil of any kind came from around the breakout area.</li>
            <li>It kept it very hydrated and works great!     </li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin is nicely hydrated (a miracle in our climate).    </li>
            <li>I have used this product and liked it....</li>
            <li>Warm it in your fingers so it will spread well.</li>
            <li>I was kind of greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li>The rest is a nice mix.</li>
            <li>I know that some people say that it should be oily in consistency when you warm it with your hands.</li>
            <li>but if you keep the usage to a minimum it is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li>The cream felt nice on my hands</li>
            <li>for buying it: buy it from a store/ trusted and reliable seller, preferably their own website.</li>
            <li>Since fakers also change their approach, do check their own updated guide on how to spot fakes:</li>
            <li>Equally effective for heels, elbows and faces</li>
            <li>Instead it kind of smells like honey bees.</li>
            <li>but when I got the product, it really was great!</li>
            <li>I use it as lip balm because it hydrates and adds a nice dewy sheen to my lips, which eliminates the need for a lip color product.</li>
            <li>It feels nice for hands before going to bed (it&#x27;s too waxy and oily for daytime).</li>
            <li>which is really nice.</li>
            <li>but it gave my skin a nice glow and translucence.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a youthful look to your skin.</li>
            <li>There skin is so  nice  </li>
            <li>I like to absolutely look my best at all times - even if I&#x27;m just going to the market.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of greasy</li>
            <li>Used it for burn, excellent, no scars, healed fast.</li>
            <li>My scars are healing nicely, pores shrinking</li>
            <li>just make sure you have a really good cleanser</li>
            <li>a kind of test, I started putting it on a wart.  </li>
            <li>The cream is nice, but oilly.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so nice, and moist.</li>
            <li>an absolute wonderful product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>To each their own just make sure you&#x27;re giving it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The original product is great and does wonders on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li>(NEVER have to use it there anymore); soaks into the skin rather than rests on the skin like lotions; makes my whole body and face GLOW bright and beautiful; gives my dry-dead-ends (hair) a conditioning affect; firms my skin; and leaves my skin silky;     BUT don&#x27;t use this cream as a cure for severe acne, it won&#x27;t cure acne; it will relieve acne of stress if you put it on at night, and it will moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a very strong scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is excellent, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizing, great for winter dry season.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great as a lotion for dry skin, and the best tattoo healer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;good\\&quot; version has a nice consistency, spreads into oil easily, smells like bee products (beeswax etc), and is a good face creme.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great full body moisturiser, scar treatment, night cream or for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased thank you Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li>My best friend took one from me and I gave another one to my boyfriend, they all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>On time with nice package and good quality of cream with cheap price.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is so much better!</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is truly magical!</li>
            <li>I am so glad i did, after a couple hours the knee was looking and feeling so much better!</li>
            <li>Best face lotion/make-up remover for sensitive - pimple prone skin!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really smell very good</li>
            <li>By far the best cream out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps over time, it will fade acne scars; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised, the ingredients are great!</li>
            <li>Best product on the market that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and  have nearly perfect skin</li>
            <li>Why many people liked it?</li>
            <li>Then, the most amazing thing started happening.</li>
            <li>Can I say, radiant, soft, and beautiful looking skin!!</li>
            <li>My face is soft and flawless.</li>
            <li>I heard amazing things about this product, and it is really interesting.</li>
            <li>This egyptian magic was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t rush out to buy more.</li>
            <li>Best night cream ever, all natural ingredients,</li>
            <li>but soo far da best....</li>
            <li>My smile lines have diminished greatly and I think this may be the cause!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased Egyptian Magic at Costco for its assertion of being effective on eczema.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic however is amazing.</li>
            <li>I read about this product on line but especially loved the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I had heard about this product from a friend, and she raved about how good it is, but the packaging was off-putting and looked cheap.</li>
            <li>Still, Egyptian Magic is a good product and does a nice job keeping your skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I just love love love it!</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell too great, lol.</li>
            <li>I am so far really enjoying this cream and feel that it is the perfect moisturizer during the winter months.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying the ingredients on your own and getting much more for your hard-earned money.</li>
            <li>it didnt do anything special for me but the moisturizing and mosquito bite comfort is good.</li>
            <li>It was great the first try on my eyelids, but that was it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li>all in all, pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very smooth</li>
            <li>- Packaging is very cheap looking   </li>
            <li>The packaging is very cheap.</li>
            <li>My face is very smooth and moist, and I think it improved the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li>They said although it&#x27;s feel oil but skin feel very comfortable after use it.</li>
            <li>I will sure recommend this product to anyone who isn&#x27;t allergic to BEE&#x27;s, a person with stretch marks, a person with the bumply stuff that I have, and a person who just wants beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, lovely scent, beautiful radiant moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I bought this with Sweet Bee Magic, can&#x27;t tell any difference, both are good for my skin.</li>
            <li>However, it must also be said that the Egyptian Magic has a more pleasant scent than real, pure, unbleached shea butter, and also glides on with greater ease.  </li>
            <li>Have used Egyptian Magic for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>It leaves oily stains on most</li>
            <li>It also appeared to be more even-toned.</li>
            <li>I am using Egyptian Magic on my face (including eyes), neck, hands, body, heels of feet, etc.  </li>
            <li>However, it has rave reviews so it must work miracles for most people.</li>
            <li>Its lovely</li>
            <li>So many people were warning customers; folks, this is a night cream, don&#x27;t expect to wear this under makeup.</li>
            <li>This is more like a scalp oil.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why so many people endorsed this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any magic when I use this, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li>and I love how Egyptian Magic makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this would not work for all skin types, but for mine it does.  </li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic helps to balance it all out.  </li>
            <li>I was able to put on eyeshadow that day and did not feel any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic has erased scars, healed rashes and burns, and cured virtually everything I&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried Bee Magic</li>
            <li>i love the way it absorb into my skin...</li>
            <li>, u&#x27;ll love the way ur hair would feel after wash.</li>
            <li>As an alternative I bought Bio-Oil, I recommend that over Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>More like ointment, but it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use egyptian magic all over...</li>
            <li>I was able to apply this to my dermatitis while at work, and no one was the wiser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both Mama Medicine&#x27;s Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and I expect that this cream will keep it looking fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find the perfect cream and cleanser because I have absolutely no facial regime</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>but over all quite pleased.........</li>
            <li>and since I am a scuba diver 5 hours or more a day of salt water immersion.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any difference so the cream did not work magic for me.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I did and read so many reviews by others.</li>
            <li>I rumb the magic into my palms like stated in the directions</li>
            <li>I ordered it for many reasons.</li>
            <li>But best of all it saved me $$ for not purchasing a product to use on my recent permanent eyeliner (tattoo).</li>
            <li>so simple but, soooo AWESOME!</li>
            <li>This cream has made the qulaity of my life so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this Cream and will buy again</li>
            <li>It is also very moisturizing and great as a night cream.</li>
            <li>When I received the jar of Egyptian Magic Cream</li>
            <li>While it may look like petroleum jelly, it is much more healthy for your skin than petroleum jelly would be.    </li>
            <li>I guess it is Magic in that sense.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and have given a jar to two of my friends and they love it too.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, I even have mu husband use it.</li>
            <li>I started using Egytian Magic every morning under my makeup.</li>
            <li>but many many people ...</li>
            <li>I did not know if this was because of the Egypian Magic or the Coco Butter goo that I was using.</li>
            <li>Then, I ran out of the Egyptian Magic and stopped using it for about a month.</li>
            <li>B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>I purchase this magic cream just for a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years-</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better now.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Well, my hands seem to need more than just Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>Oh yes, you may want to wash Egyptian Magic off your hands before you touch your hair.</li>
            <li>I was told that there are some counterfeit Egyptian Magic dealers on Amazon and packaging</li>
            <li>..way overpriced based on claims of Magic.</li>
            <li>you cant even see it any more, this was with me using it twice a day</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I started tring it for more than 3 weeks, nothing improved for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;No comments for this product.</li>
            <li>I think I will not buy it, unless he made magic</li>
            <li>Her skin would puff up and look literally cracked in some areas and Egyptian Magic worked for her.</li>
            <li>though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week.</li>
            <li>But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it works like magic</li>
            <li>I received my Egyptian Magic in the mail yesterday, tried it and this morning</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s many purposes.</li>
            <li>and I love how it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t magic for me, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li>I use this as a night cream and love it.</li>
            <li>I still use my favorite moisturizer and then apply this on top.  </li>
            <li>Many stars use this</li>
            <li>It is truly magical.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years..  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am definitely satisfied with this product for my uses.  </li>
            <li>Hand Moisturizer  - Heal scars (works best on recent scars from what I&#x27;ve seen)  - Eye cream  - Treatment for ends of hair       </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with break outs and even though it has olive oil in it, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out more.  </li>
            <li>so thanks amazon for this great product .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay.</li>
            <li>I read all these rave reviews about Egyptian Magic and had to have it.  </li>
            <li>It melts into a lovely beeswax-honey scented moisturizer and barrier cream, as well as - if all claims are to be believed - magic cream.   </li>
            <li>My face drastically cleared up after using this product :)</li>
            <li>This cream has changed my face... for the better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, even the most $$$ supposed &amp;#34;ACNE FREE&amp;#34; creams.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to put the formula out, but if you read the container it&#x27;s all the ingredients listed in descending order.</li>
            <li>Which means it&#x27;s mostly Olive Oil A and Beeswax.</li>
            <li>I think the Egyptian Magic Skin Cream is overpriced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this because I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it.</li>
            <li>It gives a really healthy looking glow, I can&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products, and this one is truly MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels with this cream on it.</li>
            <li>B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]]) to eliminate bacteria in my pores.</li>
            <li>I love this cream because of its ingredients and what it does for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things but nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like a balm (like the consistency of Tiger balm or petroleum jelly)</li>
            <li>And, quite frankly, I like my product better.  </li>
            <li>i just keep finding more and more uses for this cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s should be egyptian magic all purpose</li>
            <li>I have been only using it on my face, and it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of a friend recommendation.... and as its name, is magical what happens with the skin after using it....</li>
            <li>And I have been itch free ever since!  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>love, love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t buy the Egyptian Magic sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I fell so in love with this.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect all year, and a jar seems to last forever!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Peace, Divine love, perfect health, internal, eternal wisdom and infinite blessings unto you,</li>
            <li>Then by morning my skin feels and looks rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li>I will return it for sure.</li>
            <li>It works and has so many uses....cuts, scrapes, burns</li>
            <li>It is not a cream, more of a balm but absorbs well and leaves your skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>Ive used it through two pregnancies and it works better than any moisturizer ive ever used, but doesn&#x27;t leave any grease residue on clothes.  </li>
            <li>So with that in mind, I&#x27;d rate Egyptian Magic cream as 3 star/</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li>today offer way better alternatives for testing ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister had given me a sample size of Egyptian Magic, and at the peak of my struggle with nothing to lose, I smeared this evenly over my face one night and hoped I wouldn&#x27;t be horrified in the morning.</li>
            <li>Yet, this product has been the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think that this product will help me keep my face moist for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It turned my raisin skin more supple and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Cant say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Better off buy Loreal skin care products.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Even though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week.</li>
            <li>But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic know there are a lot of fakes of this product on Amazon and have this in their FAQ if you go to the Egyptian magic website and look at their FAQ</li>
            <li>make these checks when you get your jar or buy from a reseller that does not carry fakes and make sure you return this to</li>
            <li>I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>But my rashy areas feel more supple and they haven&#x27;t re-rashed up.</li>
            <li>It works better than the prescription steroid cream my dermatologist gave me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product applied \\&quot;thin\\&quot; still lays on the top of the skin</li>
            <li>I  love what this product does for my face.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I got the Egyptian Magic 4 Ounce from Amazon factory, and then i figured that the expiration date was erased.  </li>
            <li>I love the results it gives me when I use it as an overnight cream.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>It works better at night before bed, as it it somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li>I received Egyptian Magic as a sample in a skin care pack.</li>
            <li>My best friend&#x27;s wedding is next month</li>
            <li>The color was much much better</li>
            <li>She said she&#x27;s been using Magic cream for about a months now</li>
            <li>and when i woke up my face was so smooth, radiant and rosy!</li>
            <li>I have acne and would not consider using Egyptian Magic alone.  </li>
            <li>After the mask, this product reintroduces healthy oil (eliminating my skin&#x27;s need to produce sebum) and the honey acts as an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>skin is healthier than ever and so much more</li>
            <li>This cream was a good moisturizer and absorbed quite well.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been three months and every day my skin keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>My skin was more even toned and my wrinkles under my eyes had smoothed out.</li>
            <li>While my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s much better than before when I did use all kinds of different cleansers, toners, and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>One SB and then the slightly better EM.</li>
            <li>I hope someday (the sooner the better)</li>
            <li>I love her with everything I am.</li>
            <li>If I need more, I repeat the process.</li>

            <li>it is better for women.</li>
            <li>With the price tag of this product I was sure it would impress.  </li>

            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>My wife really love using Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I love my Egyptian magic.  </li>
            <li>but this product makes me even more confident in many</li>
            <li>More like Vaseline or aquaphor.</li>
            <li>Great cream that works very well.</li>
            <li>but when I wake up I wake up with a baby look like face :)</li>
            <li>Will buy more when winter comes.</li>
            <li>I purchased another Egyptian magic cream from its official website.</li>
            <li>It is more than 38 dollars.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels more protected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It is more like a vaseline (vysleen) petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>We always make sure that we have one of these in our house at all times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Medicine Mama&#x27;s Bee Magic too, and like that, but I love the Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I love what this product does for my skin, but it is oily and needs to be put on an hour or so before applying makeup because of that.</li>
            <li>It does not absorb into the skin but sitting on top and feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I can buy a better lotion for a fraction of this price.</li>
            <li>it is great for normal skin too!</li>
            <li>but my skin has never felt better so far so good!</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face , which is very sensitive and it makes your skin look and feel beautiful.</li>
            <li>Also, though it feels very rich, the cream is not greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This Egyptian magic is awesome for all the dry spots and face, hands, elbows, knees and etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, and is a great consistency and spreads easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the REAL product is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>The product smells sweet with the honey in it and royal jelly is amazing for your skin as well as a nutritional supplement.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin and is the only product (and I&#x27;ve tried many!)</li>
            <li>I thought it might be wonderful because Egypt has long history and</li>
            <li>Pretty darn good</li>
            <li>Well, it would be pretty good if it did not immediately melt into a liquid.</li>
            <li>The seller was also great promptly sent me the product, I received it quickly and began to use it right away.</li>
            <li>In my experience, Egyptian Magic has been effective and economical.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend trying Egyptian Magic skin cream.</li>
            <li>and it was supposed to be the best cream ever for any dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>However, if a person has dry skin this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed into my 30&#x27;s that my skin dries out a bit more easily</li>
            <li>Perfect if you have dry patches and are travelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is so easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also awesome for women who have really dry skin, as I apply it to my lips to moisturize and heal up cracks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be excellent for the dry winter.</li>
            <li>this magic cream isnt really cream but a greasy (in a good way) substance.</li>
            <li>U&#x27;ll love this balm, not just becoz its cheap, but also the magic it does.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my face, it was a rough winter and everyone knows that moisturizing is best for your face.</li>
            <li>Great that it&#x27;s all natural too!</li>
            <li>Excellent, replaced many other products with this one.</li>
            <li>an excellent moisturiser for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>so-called lightly spread this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; its totally more of an oil, on my face around 9pm...</li>
            <li>This works really great as a night cream; my skin feels so soft  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and natural.</li>
            <li>I have only used this on my hands, because I find the product to be incredibly greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use the Sweet Bee magic every night and I use the Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>It also works great on my baby&#x27;s sensitive cheeks and nose to prevent chapping when he has a runny nose, or is drueling a lot.</li>
            <li>works great on my daughters sensitive skin to help keep moisture locked in.</li>
            <li>This product is a great all natural solution for all of my problems.</li>
            <li>I read through a bunch of reviews before buying this stuff and it seemed to be a great natural moisturizer, which is what I needed.</li>
            <li>It is great and all natural, and you can use it on your hair and body as well.</li>
            <li>I always wondered what this was as in many beauty magzines the write ups were fantastic and now I know why.</li>
            <li>But...it softens wrinkles and makes your face feel smooth and more youthful.</li>
            <li>It is great for mature and baby skin.</li>
            <li>this review was useful, have nice day and peace out.</li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews...I was so excited to try this cream.</li>
            <li>Perhaps best used in connection with wearing gloves to bed at night for extreme treatment.  </li>
            <li>Dont let the cheaper price fool you ...go with the original Egyptian magic...</li>
            <li>and she remarked excitedly how it magically healed up her blister.    </li>
            <li>surprisingly it didn&#x27;t, which is one thing that impressed me because this cream...more like wax...seemed very thick and oily.  </li>
            <li>easily put 7 to 8 coats of moisturizer on my face after cleansing to relieve the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one does not become oily so easily even after rubbing it between my hands.</li>
            <li>you have to dip your fingers inside, so make sure they are clean.</li>
            <li>it liquefies and can be smoothed into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply if you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my face, I apply this cream after using my clay mask and makes my skin soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It also helps heal scratches easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not supposed to be creamy, and it&#x27;s not supposed to have a strong, chemically enhanced smell.  </li>
            <li>Works really like magic for any kind of skin irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li>This kind product is real magic and usefull for dry air</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>heard about Sweet Bee Magic and thought I would give it a try becasue</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this &#x27;cream&#x27;, you can feel completely safe and confident about absorbing all of them through your skin into your body, with no toxicity at all.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it for myself after reading all the reviews on amazon and other web-sites and I can honestly say it is a great multipurpose product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 6+ years, as well as trying competing products and blending my own.</li>
            <li>I understand that this items has been compared to the cheaper version - Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tried and true and called magic for a reason.</li>
            <li>Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this cream is better than sweet bee&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This stuff (which is really a solid that melts to an oily consistency on contact) works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order the cheaper alternative Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic to see if it works just as well.</li>
            <li>At first he liked the cream.</li>
            <li>Just buy normal Nivea Creme from the supermarket for $4 just as good.</li>
            <li>It has incredible healing ingredients;great for scrapes,dry skin, minor irritations,you name it</li>
            <li>My skin was looking dehydrated and had fine lines.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and even adds shine.  </li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>check to make sure it authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li>I have fine hair by the way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to start with a small amount and add more if you feel it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>For wintry dry skin it is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth and easy to apply....and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine</li>
            <li>the color is fine, looks just like it does it the picture online.</li>
            <li>Super softening and smells like honey :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer, but it leaves me looking like I&#x27;m super greasy-</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this product!</li>
            <li>I tried many products that worked for everything else but would not start the healing process for my sores but the very first night that I applied this stuff...</li>
            <li>Thanks, Egyptian Magic!  </li>
            <li>It is good if you have sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it magic but it does work great for my dry, flaky skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>I started using Egyptian Magic, and now my heels are super smooth.</li>
            <li>i love this product works great for dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li>and I can tell I&#x27;m receiving the best moisturizer ever, and my skin is as clear and soft as ever!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff,  works very well !!  </li>
            <li>I broke out in huge pimples both days after applying, I&#x27;d blame it on the cheesecake except I KNOW a greasy face for hours equals pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel and see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>but I have notice a huge difference already.</li>
            <li>If you get even a drop of water in this whether making it, or buying it, you are just giving out a huge invitation to germs and molds to ruin it.</li>
            <li>While she still has to deal with it, this cream has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>After two weeks i caved in and spent the money on this stuff after hearing many great things.</li>
            <li>One application and a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>After one use on my feet I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all &#x27;round excellent product.</li>
            <li>this product is chemical free; they use it as a diaper rash cream, body  balm..</li>
            <li>But the wax softens almost immediately once you&#x27;re rubbing it on your fingers, and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>smooth my scar</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my skin so smooth, stains have practically disappeared.</li>
            <li>It smells lightly of olive oil and moisturizes my face like nothing ever has.</li>
            <li>Even though it feels greasy at the time, I awaken to smooth and moist</li>
            <li>I did end up using a teeny bit rubbed over both my hands to smooth my hair</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and luminous.</li>
            <li>My thoughts were that if they liked it that much, then perhaps I would as well.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Its not to oily feeling and goes on smooth and absorb in the skin.  </li>
            <li>, so I would never use it under makeup for daytime, but putting it on at night it really soaks in and my skin feels amazing when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to know</li>
            <li>This is the best trouble spot moisturizer ever.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for a few weeks now and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Ok, i expected something miraculous and magical since i&#x27;ve read so good critics about it</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for 3 weeks -- but think it is great - get compliments</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>Felt comfortable and reduced the rash and inflammation.  </li>
            <li>genuine product is unscented.  </li>
            <li>I also have wound up using it everywhere else including my face, the upper arms (keratosis pilaris), and scalp and have been really happy with it with no issues.</li>
            <li>It clears acne and smooth skins.</li>
            <li>i want to have a smooth skin like hers.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit heavy, however my skin absorbs it perfectly.</li>
            <li>It softens my skin and my skin feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t know what my cousin paid for the jar she gave me, I thought that paying about $20 here on Amazon for a jar that lasts the better part of a year is worth it.</li>
            <li>Wife uses it every day and says it is well worth the money and says she will buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>The seller was kind enough to send me an email when they shipped my Eqyptian Magic explaining how to use the product, how to know the product was authentic and contact information in case</li>
            <li>if u have light blemishes on your cheek and wanna try getting rid of them u can try but this also didnt help get rid of any acne.</li>
            <li>It smells lightly of honeyed wax.</li>
            <li>honestly, it is very oil, however you can warm it until melt, I use nothing but the oil cream after washing my face at night.</li>
            <li>Great formula, I use it on the body, too (especially arches of the feet, hands and elbows - and don&#x27;t forget the neck).</li>
            <li>) Wash your face well with warm water using gentle, organic face wash.</li>
            <li>and I ended up giving the entire tube to her LOL.</li>
            <li>I also found another great use for it - on my last trip</li>
            <li>Its light and greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>Some people said &amp;#34;oh you can use it as pre-makeup cream to smooth your skin.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>free shipping tho.</li>
            <li>They are both oily to start with, but for me, Egyptian Magic absorbs more readily.  </li>
            <li>Prescription creams, gels and pills have been used with good result, but Egyptian Magic is an ultimate soother.  </li>
            <li>So it is good for getting better looking and healthier skin, but it is not going to have the same effects as a scar cream like Mederma.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and goes on nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend also laughed at the hilarious packaging (Lord Pharoah Imhotep AmonRa is listed as the CEO), but became a believer when he saw the red dots practically disappear within a week.</li>
            <li>There are so many recent good reviews, that my   curiosity was peaked and I had to try this out.   </li>
            <li>I like the idea that it is all natural and is good to fend off skin infections from cuts and burns.</li>
            <li>I like it because it hydrates well, smells good, and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this after seeing so many reviews of people swearing by this product...</li>
            <li>it feels good and makes your skin soft too.how</li>
            <li>This product is okay for the most part, it didn&#x27;t really improve my skin</li>
            <li>For me, Egyptian Magic worked AWESOMELY when I apply it at least 3-4 hours before bed time.</li>
            <li>There are other products out there that fade acne scars, Tea Tree Oil is a good example, anything anti-microbial probably would and most of the ingredients in Egyptian Magic are</li>
            <li>A week later I absolutely love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>Very economical night cream</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have super super sensative skin</li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot;, but it didn&#x27;t turn out to be so magical for me.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite product!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses Egyptian Magic and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a better thing to keep the environment from drawing the moisture out of my skin, which is GOOD since dry skin is often wrinkly skin.</li>
            <li>This is my second order for this amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>I am totally hooked on this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>After my first use my skin was much more hydrated feeling and looking.</li>
            <li>Well worth the results, too!</li>
            <li>When I got my first container, I thought it would be greasy because it looks more like an ointment than a cream.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about the Egyptian Magic from Youtube.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first jar from another website and that one was way better than this one I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to try it as a hair balm as well.</li>
            <li>Next morning I found the cream is totally absorbed after the whole night and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>But this one was REAL! :)</li>
            <li>&quot; my skin much at all, it kind of sat on top of it, even after a whole nights sleep</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell fragrant and nice like normal cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Even used on my dogs hot spot...healed it and it was ok for him to lick.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say this product is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>That \\&quot;crepe-paper\\&quot; look on my face is GONE, and people are forever telling my these days I look so FRESH!  </li>
            <li>Any skin product must go through vigorous standard procedure of absorption through skin in almost all the ethnic group with successful absorption results in order to get drug approval.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and additives and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my face and hair after reading reviews online.</li>
            <li>, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Great product that helps retain moisture in dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Its cheaper, and product absorbs nicely into the skin faster, and I saw further improvements in my skin faster than Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>Great on dry skin-hands, arms, legs.</li>
            <li>Really great cream for dry hands, nails, and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>After I clean them at night, I use this product and it works well.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a natural product made with mostly olive oil.  </li>
            <li>Keeping my skin clean from the inside</li>
            <li>love it  Natural ingredients and magical results.</li>
            <li>I still love the rose hip oil I mentioned earlier and use that during the day.  </li>
            <li>and I started using this because of a person who uses it religiously with the most amazing skin.</li>
            <li>It works great on my dry &amp; cracked heels.</li>
            <li>it worked great on my feet and kept them from getting dry...</li>
            <li>Thanks for having many products available to purchase</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for older,terribly dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>This works really great if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for dry cracked  hands, lips to face.</li>
            <li>Probably great for really really dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and beautiful and my eyes look normal again.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the smell is not that pleasant.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really give a good review yet because I have not used it much.</li>
            <li>I generally have very good skin and don&#x27;t use any sort of product on my face, but I now use Egyptian Magic if I see I&#x27;m starting to flake or just look</li>
            <li>I ordered EM from Amazon after reading so many positive reviews about the product.  </li>
            <li>I developed a charming case of dermatitis right around my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer,it made me a little lighter wen</li>
            <li>Worked great on my son&#x27;s dry arms and legs!</li>
            <li>Great product, heals dry skin and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li>I thought to myself this product must be special and one that I should try.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS SPECIALLY AROUND MY EYES EVERY NIGHT</li>
            <li>I have yet to see anything special.</li>
            <li>I did not find anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice anything special.  </li>
            <li>I got the set at Costco and it works great on my face and hands, which tend to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>This product works great on my rough feet.  </li>
            <li>but the area was still swollen and bright red (and embarrassing).</li>
            <li>I received this product recently and at first I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>Also great for my rough elbows and under eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I got and its incredibly greasy, there is no scent which that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, and it takes a long time to absorb, I put it on before bed</li>
            <li>Two, let&#x27;s spread this baby more thinly, I&#x27;m not letting you do this to me again.</li>
            <li>Replenishment effect of this product is good, but not obvious to the scar.</li>
            <li>Being a skeptic, I asked Whole Foods store to give me a sample of this \\&quot;magical stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It really absorbs into the skin and does keep my cuticles and feet in better condition.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wake up to greasy pillows or a face full of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin nice and soft and helps keep my acne under control when I use it.</li>
            <li>the glide and consistency of this stuff is good enough that you could even use it for giving a massage, if you wish.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched many years for a cream or lotion that really keeps my skin moist and prevents scaliness and fissures during the winter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have true wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my face at night and my skin feels so good the next morning.</li>
            <li>Honey is a good humectant and in low levels is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Well, I love it so much that I plan on \\&quot;gifting\\</li>
            <li>She seems to like it and wants more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft moisturizer and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>Not the real egyptian magic.</li>
            <li>I was really psyched to use this because I wanted a better night moisturizer</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t having much luck with steroid creams and I suggested he try the Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I did not buy this cream through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and you didn&#x27;t notice it as much as before, so a plus on that aspect of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m not one to write reviews... but Egyptian Magic really has been a godsend for my skin, so I figured I should share my experience with others who suffer.</li>
            <li>It is an intense moisturizer &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Gently rub 2 fingers in Egyptian Magic in circular motion 5-6</li>
            <li>And it is effective for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>good for EVERYTHING skin related...</li>
            <li>I used this product on my face every night after washing for a full two months.  </li>
            <li>The one from Pro Therapy supplies doesn&#x27;t taste sweet at all.</li>
            <li>and when I wake up the next morning my skin looks healthy, bright, smooth and CLEAR!</li>
            <li>it is the best product by far for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>using half jar ，found can make skin more healthy：） good to use as night cream do not use in the day time to oily</li>
            <li>There is less of the good stuff and more water.</li>
            <li>But other then that, its a great lip balm.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is an amazing product, lasts a long time and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I read in reviews that this product was good for acne and acne scars but apparently not for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it is on scars, because I do have acne scars and it hasn&#x27;t reduced them much, but it is definitely amazing with dry skin.</li>
            <li>First two days were fine.</li>
            <li>Within one use, my skin was super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably start using EM more as I get older</li>
            <li>and if anything extraordinary happens I&#x27;ll post another review.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t seem to soak into the skin, but more just sat on top of it.     </li>
            <li>The starts out as a cream and you rub it quickly in your hands to make an oil.</li>
            <li>This is super emollient and you shouldn&#x27;t  put it on your face..</li>
            <li>They absorb quickly and you see a difference with your skin after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have issue with mild to severe acne and scars that stays on my face like forever...</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients, and makes your skin so soft and smooth...a great value.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly and without any irritation or burning sensations.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Super super greasy.</li>
            <li>and my skin is glowing like a pregnant woman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK, it really does not feel or smell good, did not do anything to my dry hands.</li>
            <li>My skin always feel more supple when I wake up the next morning after an application of the Egyptian magic cream the night before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;6) Quickly apply the oil to your forehead and spread it</li>
            <li>Quickly apply the oil to your cheeks in upward movement</li>
            <li>This is an all natural product that&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does heal cuts quickly too.</li>
            <li>This stuff works super on my desert feet.</li>
            <li>Got a super deal at a warehouse store.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with high hopes but like so many before it</li>
            <li>So, I had high hopes for Egyptian Magic.     </li>
            <li>Better than the really high end stuff.</li>
            <li>Which is what it did the very first time I bought some.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but after becoming trained as a formulator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for an evening moisturizer and for winter skin; I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge difference from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help keep skin clear and smooth, it also works great as a leave-in hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I bought my very first MC then</li>
            <li>After the first week, my skin already felt smooth and plump, and it cleared up my complexion and my acne scars were no longer visible.</li>
            <li>I am 42 and work out consistently, which means the free radicals speed up, which age you faster.</li>
            <li>:) The ingredients are all natural, just olive oil and all the good things from bees you can possibly get.</li>
            <li>Great for other skin issues too!</li>
            <li>and I am determined to have the clear, smooth complexion a 30 year old should have, and now that this wonderful facial cream is in my life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased I purchased it, not because the product is a new fave of mine</li>
            <li>I have no idea about this product since I noticed my new co-worker who had a vey smooth, rosy skin without a make-up on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, per previous feedback, and it works great for my curly, sometimes frizzy locks.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe they had whipped it into a very creamy oil that would sink into the skin easily, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li>it is good for dry skin but use at night because it feels oily when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin that gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>her face will clear up entirely, but until then this stuff helps keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;She is a beautiful woman.</li>
            <li>okay so i been using this for about 2 months straight every night and at first i saw no difference</li>
            <li>Ok hi I was really iffy on this product at first</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR DRY HAIR, TOO.</li>
            <li>My face was very moisturized, and I appreciate that the product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, and it&#x27;s easy to carry when traveling, too.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and most skin creams and makeup products make me itch or break out.  </li>
            <li>The oily appearance did go away, but my other moisturizer, Korres Wild Rose 24-hour Moisturizer, worked alot ALOT better than Egyptian magic.     </li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>I did not try it on the face because it really looks oil!!</li>
            <li>great thing about this, if you have severely dry skin, is that it really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>It makes the skin on my cheeks super soft and I use it on my dog&#x27;s flea bites too :)</li>
            <li>The best way to review this product is to explain what all it has done for me: clears up my bruises (immediately!); deeply moisturizes my face; cured my dry elbows and knees</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the whole body including the face if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great non-toxic creme that really works on dry and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect dry skin cream that actually heels it and not just temporarily.</li>
            <li>Dry patchy, flakey, itchy red, or even spotty skin but best of all</li>
            <li>Even if I can&#x27;t get it to the bruise site right away I will apply it 2-3 times a day and the bruise goes away quickly .</li>
            <li>will see how it goes long term, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>, I was very fortunate to purchase from a authorized seller, there are so many fakes, you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>So, I am so happy that I didn&#x27;t get ripped off for   a little jar of grease.</li>
            <li>As described this product is a little greasy but works great to apply at night.</li>
            <li>feels great a little getting used to as has a coca butter texture</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be great, but too heavy to use in the mornings for all day wear.</li>
            <li>Well, it is actually amazing for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a great night cream (too heavy to use as a day cream).</li>
            <li>My hands have literally never been this smooth, moisturized, and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - I HIGHLY recommend this for any fellow eczema sufferers out there!</li>
            <li>It is amazing how glowing my skin is the next morning and throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, I use it on my entire face as a moisturizer, body for eczema, and hair as a styler wax.</li>
            <li>my thoughts, it should be absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use many products on my legs because they are sensitive and react to a lot of lotions.  </li>
            <li>and I found that most natural....</li>
            <li>But when I get up, it can be totally absorbed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Now, it looks bizarre, like a wax mass that&#x27;s even more solid than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>so I think its well worth the price.</li>
            <li>All are 100% natural and safe.</li>
            <li>I say this as someone who was a professional massage therapist for many years)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>My face , for the most part, was finally CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about it being a petroleum product.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think this cream is worth $30.00.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an anhydrous product and will stay fresh for a year, or so.</li>
            <li>they are gone!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
            <li>This cream is definitely worth using.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It is probably worth $5 instead of $36.</li>
            <li>Having a sensitive skin, most creams don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t like the natural scent of those products, don&#x27;t buy egyptian magic and expect something like lavender, roses and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It gives me a soft glow, smells good and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So far I love it</li>
            <li>My callus is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it is all absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It may be on the pricey side, but it is so, SO worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely rave about a skin product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its all natural</li>
            <li>if its worth the price</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin produce more oil naturally as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really useful to my acne.</li>
            <li>I hope you guys find this useful</li>
            <li>was told to be useful</li>
            <li>Too greasy and no cosmetic value at all, there are far better products out there.  </li>
            <li>Worth twice the price, and then some.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nice and is very oily, it did however make my skin feel soft, until I got the cystic acne anyway.</li>
            <li>did find my own personal pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in some home-made lotion bars with beeswax, coconut oil, and cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>...ESP for the people that didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you have been looking for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy, but the product absorbs pretty quickly into the skin, and it does not sting the eyes.  </li>
            <li>At first try, it may seem too greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves a radiant glow.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first, but it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy at first but then does soak in most of the way, however you still have a bit that does get left on the skin, which for some may not be ok.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is like no other!  </li>
            <li>Worked super fast and super well.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the other customers if I didn&#x27;t tell my experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>I read some other reviews thinking it&#x27;d be a good scar cream.</li>
            <li>this is a good smelling all purpose moisturizer that I have been using on my face and other areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even good as a body cream , due to the stickiness factor.</li>
            <li>I was excited to read some of the reviews about this cream, but I tried it for 30 days and really didnt see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel right about having opened a product then returning it...</li>
            <li>The price was right on this one</li>
            <li>Got delivery right away and started using it on my legs, feet and forearms.  </li>
            <li>You have to work to find the right amount for your skin</li>
            <li>Even if yours does say the right label.</li>
            <li>and when I do this the bruising is dramatically reduced right away .</li>
            <li>When I was in my teens I just assumed it was the right of passage</li>
            <li>I have psorasis on my right foot</li>
            <li>THEY ARE RIGHT  .  </li>
            <li>You have to remember to rub it between palms before applying and do it right after washing  your face to avoid the greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is not the right color.</li>
            <li>The one on the right howver is what I still paid 4o bucks for.</li>
            <li>it you applied it right before makeup, it&#x27;s almost impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were right.  </li>
            <li>My dear cousin first introduced me to Egyptian Magic because she thought it would clear the acne scars (from poking and prodding) from my face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated/</li>
            <li>i bought this for my friend and he likes it very much, and i guess it is useful for him.</li>
            <li>softens my dry skin so well and the softness lasts for days... smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I use the product primarily under the eyes, where the skin tends to dry out the most.</li>
            <li>I also have many more raised black head</li>
            <li>:) Less is more.</li>
            <li>Feels oily at first, but absorbs into my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but this product appears safe and gentle on my skin - no breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product feels greasy for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but then is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes a good lip balm but not worth the price just for that.  </li>
            <li>She claims it helps her with her skin especially on new tattoos</li>
            <li>My best friend actually told me that I looked a little haggard.</li>
            <li>While the price is a bit much, the consistency makes it last long since it spreads nicely once you warm it on your skin.   </li>
            <li>Beeswax is a great sealant but the composition of this particular product is too greasy, if there was less Olive Oil maybe...</li>
            <li>It may be really oily when I put it on at night, but after two nights, my skin became more mosturized and soft and even my friends and family noticed it.</li>
            <li>Recently I got brave enough to start using it on my chest and neck and no breakouts...</li>
            <li>Excellent product for my 17 month old &#x27;s delicate cheeks.</li>
            <li>A lot more even, not dry, and it  has a glow to it.</li>
            <li>I came in contact with EM after a huge battle with my skin and being made fun of and even went home early from work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and effective for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub between your fingers before applying, I noticed a big difference in it&#x27;s effectiveness, rather than just applying a glob right to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To my surprise it helped very much.  </li>
            <li>If I consistently rub a small amount of this into my nails and cuticles at night, I have nice nails - strong even.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t do any good, or the next day my face would get super oily.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing but little bit oily.</li>
            <li>The cream was new and originally packed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 big blemishes are almost completely healed over with significantly reduced swelling and tenderness; redness in my formerly rashy spots is diminished and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m finding that pure shea butter (and I mean the real unadulterated stuff from Africa, not some lotion that claims it as an ingredient) absorbs and moisturizes better.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about getting this magic lotion for my very dry and old looking hands.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At first I was putting it on my face but it seemed like every time I did, I would throw up.</li>
            <li>I recently read a celebrity interview in a well-known beauty / fashion magazine where Egyptian Magic skin cream was mentioned as a</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li>It worths the money!I will buy it more in the future.</li>
            <li>I feel like I look much better without makeup actually.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is DEFINITELY not Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I love this and have gotten several friends hooked too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the face if you have oily skin, BUT it did work pretty well on my hands/cuticles.</li>
            <li>oh and use it as a hot oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li>Love this for all things especially for my grandsons allergy dermatitis.</li>
            <li>And then my coworker pulled Egyptian Magic out of her purse and told me her entire family swear by it.    </li>
            <li>I can only use Bee Magic if I&#x27;m covering my hands and going to bed; otherwise, it ends up all over everything.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The cream is very oily, and it even feels oilier than Vaseline on my face!</li>
            <li>This is my second jar of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>The actual cream looks more like petroleum jelly than cream.</li>
            <li>BE AWARE- if you are allergic to bees</li>
            <li>I read in a magazine article several years ago that many movie stars (Madonna included)swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like I was breaking out.</li>
            <li>You may break out at first.</li>
            <li>Prescription creams did not remotely help as much as egyptian magic did.  </li>
            <li>At first,  i was disapointed with the vaseline feel and greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all perfectly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling extra hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not my first time that i used this product</li>
            <li>If you like it, look at the dates to make sure you are buying a jar from the same date as the sample.</li>
            <li>Last year, my sister&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Egyptian Magic to her and she tried to sell me on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, I got it from Hip Apotheca</li>
            <li>After only 4 days use, 3 or 4 times a day, the redness is already notably better, and it&#x27;s healing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this way it&#x27;s really not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>I got the first jar as a gift</li>
            <li>and they are all pronounceable, readable, understandable, and recognizable.</li>
            <li>used as a lip gloss and hair tamer and both work out pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for this winter problem and this works for me, just remember to apply it daily and the skin will not crack, working out doors in the winter dries my the thumbs</li>
            <li>First, it smells like lard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do also like that this item is fragrance free, lasts forever and can go on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>also use this on my kids, since the ingredients are safe and nothing extra is added.  </li>
            <li>not when I first read about it in a health and beauty magazine and would not be without it.</li>
            <li>Could see improvement the second day of using Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I most definitely have to stack up on this product.</li>
            <li>It is pretty greasy</li>
            <li>I first read about this product in a celebrity magazine.  </li>
            <li>&quot; More likely someone&#x27;s husband looked at her grocery receipt and got upset by the $30 price tag.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a solid vaseline &amp; too oily to use as a day cream for me</li>
            <li>For this reason, I went back to Costco to get two packs more since I am moving</li>
            <li>My doctor gave me hydrocortisone cream fro it initially but that made it more inflamed and it continued to spread.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m hoping it gets even better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product first at Costco after reading about the cream in an advertisement.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my entire face, but it required a lot of work to emulsify between my hands, and even more to work it into the skin.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer out there, simple ingredients</li>
            <li>I also put some Egyptian Magic in my hair, just at the tips, and i didn&#x27;t even use a lot of it, only a 1/4 inch circle, and it looked like i didn&#x27;t wash my hair in 2 days.</li>
            <li>At first I thought she&#x27;s born with it</li>
            <li>At first, the product scared me because how greasy it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The problem is that their skin is not properly prepared for Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff and can&#x27;t go a second without it.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li>I love this product and have ordered it multiple times.</li>
            <li>And even though it goes on oily at first, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li>this stuff truly is magic cant beleive i didnt know about it until i dated an egyptian if i had only known</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face in the morning with anything but hot water....</li>
            <li>Now, I only have to use Egyptian Magic once a day - before bed, I put it on my hands and cover them with cotton gloves.</li>
            <li>When I used it consistently, the scars faded over time, leaving me with clearer skin and a radiant glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I apply, I cover the first digit of my index finger with cream, and then I spread it across my fingertips (from index to pinky.</li>
            <li>Not so magical but only the price tag.</li>
            <li>I just had to go out and buy an acne cleanser for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>(The cream smells funny though)</li>
            <li>It has fixed all the cracks in my fingers and has made my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had purchased Egyptian Magic ages ago.  </li>
            <li>I consistently used it for about a month.</li>
            <li>my first month in</li>
            <li>the first week i wore this i broke out and thought i would never try this cream again.</li>
            <li>Everyone in my house wants to use it, I have to hide it!</li>
            <li>And this material has no frightening laboratory chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product whole heartedly!</li>
            <li>Most skin products out there can only help you in one of the affected areas.</li>
            <li>Then my cousin recommended me to try Egyptian Magic as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, the cream didn&#x27;t work well when I use it after I applied my Face Shop acne facewash and toner.</li>
            <li>I cannot praise this product enough, although I do wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be an actual business but more of just an answering service, some marketing and distribution.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Absolute Skin miracle!</li>
            <li>My mother initially bought this and did not like the feeling of this, considering it&#x27;s more of a balm instead of a cream.</li>
            <li>Jackson, SC is so brilliantly hot and sunny in May-August!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this product, I will always use it for all of the above uses because I am attracted to all-natural balms.</li>
            <li>(I bought my Egyptian magic at a big warehouse store that rhythms with</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about one month now and really FEEL as well as SEE a difference!  </li>
            <li>I will not be using anything else for the rest of my life - my skin feels naturally lubricated and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember where I got my first jar, but I always used it for my feet.  </li>
            <li>It really helps all sorts of skin ailments, I use it a lot!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 27 ;)</li>
            <li>Although it is probably good for your hair, if you plan on going out, it can make it look and feel a bit greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>The best part is getting beautiful skin without all the chemicals and bad stuff in other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I like the cream specially for my feet at night, it makes it nice and soft since I have pretty dry feets.  </li>
            <li>but the first ingredient listed on the bottle is always the greatest quantity in the product, so a less oily effect shouldn&#x27;t be expected.</li>
            <li>it is not a typical fluffy, emulsified face cream; it&#x27;s more of a semi-solid mixture of oils that you have to warm up on your fingertips before application.</li>
            <li>Also works great for extra moisturization for my face, hands, and hair on dry winter nights.</li>
            <li>The real EM has helped me tremendously for years with my rosacea and made my acne disappear as well as make my skin look very youthful.</li>
            <li>It really absorbs right in with no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>So, I definitely recommend Egyptian Magic, but only if you have a good enough cleanser!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of the frizzyness without using a flat iron, curling iron, or some heat-appliance for hair</li>
            <li>how incredibly soft ur face feels in the morning after everything is absorbed by your skin!</li>
            <li>I use it as a face and hand cream and comes in handy for burns, rashes and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>I will have to wait for the hype of this product to die down, then I will hopefully get it a fair decent price again.</li>
            <li>When I got it I was super excited and it definitely lived up to its expectations...</li>
            <li>I clean it off completely at night with a mixture of baby shampoo and olive oil...</li>
            <li>we rely on good, natural products like this one that sinks in yet doesn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li>My advice- buy a good bottle of extra virgin olive oil and use it the same way you use this product.  </li>
            <li>the real one above the use by has 0000 on top of the use by date and this one does not</li>
            <li>I honestly believe the makers of this product are taking full advantage of the reputation it had in the past.</li>
            <li>the one on the left is real Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>and since i&#x27;ve started using this balm i haven&#x27;t had a single breakout and my skin looks so bright and fresh in the morning, my pore size has shrunk extensively....</li>
            <li>This product is worth the rather high cost.</li>
            <li>Helped mine quickly and it&#x27;s not excessively greasy like coconut oil is.</li>
            <li>yes, it is greasy, but, once it sets in, that feeling goes away and your skin feels super soft!</li>
            <li>I got this item after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to use this for the rest of my life so long as they make it as is or better.</li>
            <li>I usually use argan oil but when somebody left a jar of Egyptian Magic at my house I used it and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>love that is has a minimal ingredients list and is all natural and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>First of all, my face looked SO oily, my whole face was shining.</li>
            <li>I reluctantly bought this at Whole Foods the first time for $45.  </li>
            <li>She says it works good, she usually hates creams.</li>
            <li>You know, right in time for my high school reunion.  </li>
            <li>This cream is silky smooth and heals up dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I had better luck on my scars, mainly on my hands, one knee, and on my back.</li>
            <li>jar is huge, and I only use a tiny amount on my eyes now, so this jar should last a good while.</li>
            <li>Instantly my skin felt smooth and healthy, and my breakouts and old acne scars began to clear almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I just use it for my face (or little irritations like heat rashes) and it works its magic!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this for my face in the long NY winters!</li>
            <li>I add about two-three drops of Argan Oil to just a small (pea-sized) dollop of Egyptian magic and smooth it all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>(my skin&#x27;s starting to dry out and scars more easily now),</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my skin super soft,</li>
            <li>I am very particular about what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My wife bought it for me, and now&lt;br /&gt;no more dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and love this</li>
            <li>I love this stuff in the dry winter.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for chapped lips, dry wintered skin, de-frizzer for hair, etc.,</li>
            <li>and I mix he egyptian magic cream and aloe gel together on my skin and that worked so well, neither oil or dry</li>
            <li>I bought this cream to use as a moisturizer for my dry, aging, wrinkly face because Egyptian Magic doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>My skin had started to become a little more loose and \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot;, and after a week, I would say it is 80% better!</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I found  it was so large</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certainly a believer in this product.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing positive for my skin.</li>
            <li>The texture of the skin on my cheeks was also very bumpy, and completely unrecognizable compared to my normal smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry and this cream helps me so much!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for ten years - I get sun rashes, suffer from acne and have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that has smoothed out my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Really delivers and pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I instantly bought my own jar, and am now waiting to see if it&#x27;ll work as well on scars and bruises -- but really, even if it doesn&#x27;t, the damage control for patches of dry skin makes it well worth the investment.    </li>
            <li>I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me.</li>
            <li>It is slightly greasy/tacky at first, but absorbs quickly, leaving skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3 weeks and although my skin doesn&#x27;t show much significant improvement, it is softer and there are no dry spots.</li>
            <li>My face gets so dry in the winter, uneven tone, and very reactive, and it looks great right now.</li>
            <li>This jar is huge and will last forever!</li>
            <li>The results I have already gotten in such a short time is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>:B00JATQVAK Miracle Anti Aging Cream with Natural Moisturizers for Soft and Smooth Skin.</li>
            <li>One jar did last several months, but I didn&#x27;t see any amazing results.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes this stuff, and it seems to work</li>
            <li>It really is all purpose.  </li>
            <li>Really greasy.</li>
            <li>I really don’t write product reviews, but I felt the need to share my experience in this situation.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t use a lot of this product, it will leave you very greasy if you do.</li>
            <li>Shipping was lighting fast, 2 days</li>
            <li>I find this cream greasy, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very choosy about my cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like really, the pores on my nose are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Didnt really help with my eczema</li>
            <li>really helps.  </li>
            <li>My scars have lightened up and is much smoother.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and matches description.</li>
            <li>But I went to Belize and was exposed to severe sand fleas, intense sun in June</li>
            <li>i like buying on amazon because it is cheaper than whole foods.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me at Whole Foods when they ran out of California Baby cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin glowed and my make up wore VERY evenly all day.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help as much as I thought with moisture.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li>It is something you have to get used, if you apply too much your face can feel very greasy.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is very oily.</li>
            <li>And when I put it on my face in the night, I still feel very oily.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the simplicity and healing properties.</li>
            <li>and basically it just makes my face really greasy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My friend recommend this product to me and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it really balances everything out.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin supple and ready for makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>My skin is just really dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I have had problem skin almost my whole</li>
            <li>This product is very greasy and didn&#x27;t at all moisturizer my or my child&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>and he really like it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really helpful .</li>
            <li>Very oily and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people with oily skin.</li>
            <li>it has soo much oil makes your face feel greesey</li>
            <li>it has way to much oil its like melted butter on your hands.</li>
            <li>the reason why i returned this product was because it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I assume wholeheartedly I did get the real deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really can do what this does without the royal jelly and propolis.</li>
            <li>I applied this 4 times a day to the burn, and can&#x27;t believe how fast it&#x27;s healing at this</li>
            <li>was in a hurry, so I went to Whole Paycheck to ensure I could carry the real thing home that night</li>
            <li>Not too much to say about this.</li>
            <li>Ive tried this on my face and body, and though many say its a \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot;, they never really say what \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; they&#x27;re seeing??  </li>
            <li>and I purchased this one because I really like what does for my skin.</li>
            <li>Give it some time, it really evens out skin tones.</li>
            <li>every morning both products are working really well</li>
            <li>You So much</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy online</li>
            <li>but you can get it at Whole Foods too.</li>
            <li>When I put on this cream, my face got really oily.</li>
            <li>I bought this from here and from a real seller because I was bewildered with the difference in price.</li>
            <li>really value for money.</li>
            <li>skin cream has really helped.</li>
            <li>Why would you spend this much money for something you could make yourself?  </li>
            <li>but my hands turned very greasy...</li>
            <li>Very greasy - almost like putting Vaseline on my face.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend works at Whole Foods and while browsing the Whole Body section I saw a price tag for a 30.00 jar of skin cream.</li>
            <li>It can appear and feel very oily</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my skin but made my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>i bought this as a gift for my sister and she states she loves it so, goal accomplished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really dislike it, but I don&#x27;t expect to buy it again.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hydrate &amp; it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like that feeling for my whole face or body.</li>
            <li>If I go to sleep at night with no moisturizer on, I wake up with a MUCH oilier face than I do if I sleep in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should really try it.</li>
            <li>and I find this moisturizer seems to really correct that.  </li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had the chance to really use it.</li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I could see the pores on my nose and nasal folds get clogged with oil and dirt, and I started to develop acne on my chin, so I discontinued the whole face</li>
            <li>and ive been buying it for a wide array of individuals who also love it.</li>
            <li>The product works very well, but you have to use it persistently.</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual about this cream at all..  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with really hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>so I am very conscience of ingredients and this cream seems to be working quite well.  </li>
            <li>I know when someone wants to try it, they will.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using this her face has cleared up very noticeably.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>your face will be very sticky and smells.</li>
            <li>It is nice in a light application after my regular moisturizer has set a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell what it does to my skin, besides just keep it moisturize.</li>
            <li>This product really doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.. Helps psoriasis</li>
            <li>It would have saved us both much heartache and money.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this product was very greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not a cream but more of an ointment.</li>
            <li>and is very breathable.</li>
            <li>Ship so fast.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream and use it all over.  </li>
            <li>but too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been more careful about getting it around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really saved on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Or use it on days when I am not planning on wearing too much makeup.</li>
            <li>hight humidity make my skin smoot oil water but not oily to much.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very greasy though.</li>
            <li>The change is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The solid Egyptian Magic would  put a smile back on my face</li>

            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me, maybe my skin is already too oily.</li>
            <li>I have to stop short of saying it is a miracle, but it really is a fantastic multi-purpose product, and</li>
            <li>Really oily, not recommended for people combination skin - oily.</li>

            <li>Within 2 hours my face was very oily because of the product.</li>

            <li>Do keep in mind you have to really rub it in no matter where you use it</li>
            <li>hesitate to buy this either online or at Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I apply this all over my face at night and when I wake up, my skin is very hydrated and glows.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is also much cheaper.</li>
            <li>But, it is very oily.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful as well</li>
            <li>I bought it on here because I couldn&#x27;t believe how much cheaper it was.</li>
            <li>I went to Whole foods and the girl there</li>
            <li>It pays to buy the real product.</li>
            <li>6 stars for real EM 0 stars for this knock off product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>How much are you putting on?  </li>
            <li>, that really shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really encases moisture.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and greasy</li>
            <li>so I apply lightly at night only.</li>
            <li>Might be too much for the summertime, but it&#x27;s wonderful during the cold months.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my eyelids were soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>And still, 2 months later, I have still not been able to completely clear my face up again.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a balm, a solid substance that melts immediately upon contact into a clear liquid...nothing creamy about this</li>
            <li>Then I saw it was called Egyptian Magic, Ancient Kamitian Secret Magical Cream.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs and leaves incredible soft skin behind.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to play around with it by using a different facewash &amp; toner for sensitive skin (in this case, USANA Sense Facewash &amp; Toner) and then apply Egyptian Magic oil afterwards.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to play around with it by using a different facewash &amp; toner for sensitive skin (in this case, USANA Sense Facewash &amp; Toner) and then apply Egyptian Magic oil afterwards.</li>
            <li>to the claims that Amazon&#x27;s product is fake...  while it might be so, if you go to Egyptian Magic&#x27;s website, they have a nice explanation of the situation, and they stopped using the word &amp;#34;Kamitian&amp;#34; on the label.  </li>
            <li>This item is good but a bit different than what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I have never dealt with acne (thanks to good genes because my diet sucks).    </li>
            <li>After washing my hair, I take a fair amount (because I have ultra thick hair) of the product, rub it between my hands, then apply  it to my hair.</li>
            <li>but for now it&#x27;s a great general refresher and a total lifesaver for embarrassing, persistent dry skin.</li>
            <li>Took some time because I had to really spread because I didn&#x27;t have much to go from, and with dry skin, sometimes products won&#x27;t spread easily because there is no moisture to slide on.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super glow-y and quenches my skin even during the most dry conditions (such as in the deserts of san diego).</li>
            <li>I love it and use it on super dry skin- especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Must be very old sitting on a hot shelf.</li>
            <li>This creme is so good, especially if you have dry skin, or during those winter months when you need a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>The red scaly spots almost have faded into the fine tone of the normal skin.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way with this, which is great too.  </li>
            <li>i think they must put a little bit of magic in the jar ;-)  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this as a day moisturizer, especially during summer; it might be too rich.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about having moderately stinky hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy even for around the eyes, like so many other creams that make you puffy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this Egyptian Magic based on all the rave reviews on Amazon and on other sites.  </li>
            <li>I have read from other reviewers that they&#x27;ve had some issues with this product (mostly break-outs).  </li>
            <li>It is priced like they know its a heck of a lot better than other brands...</li>
            <li>I have some of the most pitted scars and abrasive skin post 2 cycles of Accutane treatment and after 4 years of ceasing treatment, my skin&#x27;s extreme oiliness and breakouts returned.</li>
            <li>Hope doctors have the knowledge of Egyptian Magic and recommend it to patients instead of other chemicals.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t magically change the skin like some other moisturizer that I have used.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, like many suggest, I took a little bit of the wax and warmed it between my fingers before applying it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge, but good so far.</li>
            <li>$30 bucks is a small price to pay for great skin--and it&#x27;s my face--I&#x27;m only going to get one</li>
            <li>I use this on my dry psoriasis skin and although the root cause of psoriasis is internal, this external cream feels great.  </li>
            <li>Rub the balm in really well and let it sit for a while, I&#x27;ve used it under makeup to give you that vibrant shine desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
            <li>UNLESS you purchase it and LOOK at the contents first, there is no way to know if you will get the good or the poor version.</li>
            <li>, I like it very much, it makes my lips feeling naturally grossed.</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the fact that it was highly rated plus there were so many people raving about it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and helps keep it straight when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>kind of small for the price...</li>
            <li>So since it was doing such a good job on my hands within a short time I started applying it on my lips and on the skin above the lip.</li>
            <li>I apply about a nice small grape sized dollop, make it an oily lather and massage into my face every night.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, and I react to a lot of products, but not this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I never purchased this product because now I am out $30, and still have a almost full container left.</li>
            <li>and this product works better than all of them - hands down (pun intended).</li>
            <li>Before I started using this oil, my skin was really dry and sun damaged, but overtime, I can see my damage healing and my skin becoming very soft.</li>
            <li>I stirred in a little jasmine essential oil to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The instructions say to take a moderate amount, rub it with your finger in the palm of your other hand till it&#x27;s a smooth oil like consistency then smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li>and if you do you will use it so fast that you will have to buy a new one soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even half pleased with this product, it&#x27;s like a 360 in comparison to others.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing-it has transformed my skin from dry, flaky and patchy to smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews about this product and most of them reassure you that the oils of the product will soak up in your skin even if you have typically oil skin like mine.</li>
            <li>When applying this product less is more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about half a month, the scar of pimple becomes light, and i think if i use longer, it will disappear!</li>
            <li>I have been using Egyptian magic as my sole facial moisturizer for about four years now.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see the magic in it and the jar was too big since I only used it for a couple of times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it really is all purpose: from healing cuts or burns in a day to moisturizing freshly saved legs, using after a facial to keep the glow going or even smoothing out frizzies...</li>
            <li>The second I applied Egyption Magic to my jock, instantly, the itching stopped!  </li>
            <li>I use this as a balm for my tattoos, it keeps the colors vibrant and hydrates the skin (this could also be used for tattoo healing).</li>
            <li>He was pretty hesitant at first, but I convinced him to give it a shot, and now two days later it&#x27;s clearing up quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>After using Egyptian Magic for a few days, I found it really helpful.</li>
            <li>The main thing is the product.  </li>
            <li>I do not put cream on my thumbs - just my particular application technique) and rub the fingers of both my hands together.</li>
            <li>Being older, I&#x27;ve noticed changes in my sun damaged skin on arms and chest.  </li>
            <li>Though originally solid, it quickly melted into an oily texture.</li>
            <li>I am now using extra virgin coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, and I would highly recommended this over Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I have always had good clear skin with very few wrinkles (now age 67) and I would love to keep that look for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy feeling, but it&#x27;s all natural and it definitely gets absorbed and helps with maintaining an amazing glow.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me and all natural cant beat that!</li>
            <li>i think the first time i used it i put a little too much because the next day there were still a good amount left on my face</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy, just the occasional zit, but I do touch my face alot more than I should :(</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this based on the reviews</li>
            <li>this is highly oil based.</li>
            <li>It could be a coincidence, but I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would recommend it highly and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product to the reader.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>that wear lots of high heels/boots made for the Army</li>
            <li>I bought it after all those rave reviews about this product, with a high expectation.</li>
            <li>It was by sheer happenstance that I stumbled upon Egyptian Magic at Whole Foods and, after seeing the short list of natural ingredients, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It makes a fantastic lip balm or gloss, it heals uncomfortable dry patches anywhere on your body, it softens cuticles, it makes a great eye cream when my eyes are irritated by allergies.</li>
            <li>it is fine, but I do not really like the texture</li>
            <li>I use this cream on my face and hands and can I say; soft!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and hydrated!!  </li>
            <li>Dab a little more oil to your nose, mouth and chin</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, with a very mild form of eczema being the cause.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to spread evenly throughout their scalp and hair without accidentally leaving clumps of the product in one area which is what happens to me with other hair grease sometimes.    </li>
            <li>Originally I bought it because my skin was really dry.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, I found a great price here and the shipment was super quick but as far as the product goes - I didn&#x27;t hate it.  </li>
            <li>This product absolutely works and the ingredients are all natural and pronouncable.</li>
            <li>Pat dry with clean towel&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pat dry with a clean towel</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d break out from anything too heavy/greasy</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t buy my normal moisturizer and had to use what I had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK, a bit too heavy even as night cream for face, or for hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it has so few ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Combination (Oily t-zone (acne prone) and normal cheeks and chin)  -No skin conditions and No allergies      </li>
            <li>Another reviewer noted that the true cream should say \\&quot;The Ancient KAMITIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\</li>
            <li>The Sweet Bee has a strange smell and doesn&#x27;t heal anything...</li>
            <li>He started using All Purpose Egyptian Magic and in just a few days his hands began to heal.</li>
            <li>Then I found there is a big big big whole in this jar, but the top looks very full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is, until my mom brought by this jar of magical miracle oil a few weekends ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny - a four ounce jar will last you forever since there&#x27;s no water in it</li>
            <li>I just had so many surgeries and has applies this cream at night before bed and in a few days the scars have been fading.</li>
            <li>Just a normal skin cream.</li>
            <li>I bought several  Egyptian Magic Cream for my mother in law and for my friends long time ago from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I normally take a shower 1 hour before bed time and sleep immediately.</li>
            <li>I normally take a shower 1 hour before bed time and sleep immediately.</li>
            <li>well worth packing on your next trip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people who has normal or combination skin.  </li>
            <li>good for dry skin, but dont like the smell, and u need to wait a little bit before u go to bed, coz maybe it will touch ur pillow.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but is very thick--too thick for day use, but just right for a nightly rejuvenation.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased Egyption Magic from Costco for my dry face.  </li>
            <li>and it actually made my skin more dry.  </li>
            <li>Instant relief for dry skin :-)</li>
            <li>Love this product and recommend especially for problem dry skin areas.</li>
            <li>I had a breast augmentation and since the skin streched i got a scar right in the middle of my chest.</li>
            <li>Knowing the right amount to use will keep you from causing further skin problems and giving yourself additional issues.</li>
            <li>But anyways, after i rubbed it, i patted it on my entire face, and right away i didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and thought it felt really nice for the first few times I applied it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, fantastic product, can be used on burns, cuts, scratches.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very concentrated and rich emulsion of olive oil, beeswax, royal jelly and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that it is made from natural ingredients and it&#x27;s helping my scars fade a little.  </li>
            <li>expensive but very good especially at night</li>
            <li>This my new BBF.</li>
            <li>No glow but a new hurting pimples on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I use it on hands feet face brand new, sealed jar.</li>
            <li>Live this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, this is too greasy for people who live in humid areas.  </li>
            <li>our helps keep my usage of the magic cream down and hence avoids the possibility of using too much and clogging it further.</li>
            <li>but as i kept wearing it, i did notice a difference in blemishes... and helped make my feet not dry which im sure other lotions can do also....</li>
            <li>The real EM reads \\&quot;The Ancient Kamitian&#x27;s Secret Magical Cream\\&quot; besides that there are many other ways to tell it</li>
            <li>Decided to try this product on my super dry feet.  </li>
            <li>At night I wash my face, then rinse; while it is wet, I scoop out a bit of Egyptian Magic onto the palm of my hand and rub my palms together to melt it, then rub my hands together to distribute it all over my hands front and back, then use the palms of my hands to pat this over my face, including eye area (leaving my palms cleaner for reading a book, etc).  </li>
            <li>because to be honest, it looks like low budget petroleum jelly in a gimmicky pacakage.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for day use unless you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t mind being a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li>Super moisturizer for all dry skin.  </li>
            <li>After using Egyptian Magic for a few days the rash stopped itching and within 10 days was gone completely.</li>
            <li>- there is nothing magic about achieving younger looking skin after it has been aged.  </li>
            <li>That must sound terrible but I don&#x27;t mind because the cream is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most expensive skin product I&#x27;ve tried but at $28.00 for a 4 oz jar, it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap either.  </li>
            <li>More importantly I knew it was fake but tried it</li>
            <li>gave me a free sample and asked me only to come back and let her know if it worked.</li>
            <li>I do have a few acne scars - Egyptian Magic did nothing to help them, but it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>Love this little gadget!</li>
            <li>Other than that if you have kids, it&#x27;s very useful to have around.</li>
            <li>My skin feel soft afterwards and stays hydrated longer than the high end moisturizers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so very soft and it not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>But not really \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; or anything special.</li>
            <li>As strange as this may sound since this is a moisturizing style product, it can dry your skin so be aware and conscious of that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to treat my husband&#x27;s eczema and it helped his skin considerably!</li>
            <li>when I received this item, I am not sure if this is the authentic one.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look like any difference at the first couple of minutes, but later it looked like the bumps were not bumps anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll melt if it gets hot enough.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I only put on my feet.</li>
            <li>Most of my other creams last months.</li>
            <li>I am almost 50 years old!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Recently I purchased this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>As a result of a complete lack of moisture in my skin, I started to get wrinkles!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>People have told me that I look really pretty and even younger, but they can&#x27;t point out why</li>
            <li>My skin become soft and return to normal .   </li>
            <li>I saw an actual difference within the first 3 days of applying it on the backs of my arms after a shower.</li>
            <li>I bought my first jar at another store, but after I finish it, I&#x27;ll come to amazon for a second.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with Adovia Mineral Soap and then apply a small amount of this Egyptian Magic Cream to my face.</li>
            <li>First of all the cream&#x27;s label that I received looks different</li>
            <li>So  Far I am a believer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar and at first it seemed kings of greasy</li>
            <li>This is their big \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to clearing up your skin, and it makes intuitive sense at first, and it did to me too.</li>
            <li>I have used many expensive products such as La Mer, and I think it works better on me than La Mer.</li>
            <li>I first used it for a mysterious itching, spreading rash</li>
            <li>since then we&#x27;ve used it for everything: facial moisturizer, hair oil, for lips and nails and most recently to treat a 2nd degree burn.</li>
            <li>But i slept with it the first night, and when i woke up the next morning, my face had a matte smoothness, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I usually try to put this on way before I go to bed to give it more time to incorporate into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I believe my first jar lasted just under a year, and I used the product once daily (after my morning shower).</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it is small amounts on elbows and my face.</li>
            <li>In the morning I can tell the moisture in my skin is higher than if I had used a water based moisturizer only.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as the first two that I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s another product that does the same with the same ingredient I&#x27;m thinking of trying, I give one star because it&#x27;s NOT the original.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>It also works well as a healing balm for tattoos (unscented, natural, no parabens, no mineral oil, no lanolin-&gt;bad for tattoos!), and I have three of them.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A light amount also smoothes down frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and has an odd, earthy, but not unpleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my face the way other people claim, but it can be nice to slather it on your feet or hands and let it sit for a few hours to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use such a natural product, but now I just want my money back!</li>
            <li>Honestly it seems to just be an olive oil solid with very little else added.</li>
            <li>I try to live as \\&quot;cleanly\\&quot; as I can by using natural, organic products.</li>
            <li>it makes the skin smooth but haven&#x27;t used long enough to know the longevity of the product&#x27;s effects.</li>
            <li>Some people said this one is useful for scar and dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where to buy: Costco offers it, Wholefoods, Riteaide, local grocery store, Trader joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage:  Keep away from hot temperature and away from sunlight.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it really is moisture magic.</li>
            <li>daughter has very sensitive skin , but this cream is 100 % natural and does not have alcohol or perfumes so it does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li>It does help with fine lines a little.  </li>
            <li>They would be oily on top and rough and dry under the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in 2010 and I still have more than half the jar left.</li>
            <li>This feels great on my skin, I can see the benefits, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin, and have been using this cream for just a few weeks, and I LOVE it already!</li>
            <li>I had trouble getting this oil absorbed by my skin--it would just sit on top of my face for half an hour.</li>
            <li>If you want a product that&#x27;s filled with chemicals and has a strong enough smell to fill a room, go to Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  </li>
            <li>I buy the large one and use it on my face and body, and carry the smaller one around in my bag for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and simple.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old gets cracked and dry skin between his toes and this stuff clears it right up.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little work to soften it up into an oil and it does not spread smoothly over my skin without a LOT of work.  </li>
            <li>A very thin layer, massaged into my face at night, and I&#x27;m good as new in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I use pure honey and a microfiber cloth to cleanse, Egyptian Magic and Moroccan Argan oil to moisturize, coffee grounds to exfoliate and Aztec Secret [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, the texture and application process is a little weird.</li>
            <li>I hardly see any magical part of it.</li>
            <li>Once you start using Egyptian Magic, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else.</li>
            <li>I washed my face and decided to try using it only on the spots where my skin normally gets super dry instead of all over.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the other claims and uses of Egyptian magic, but I  know I  would not survive the dry air of winter or the allergy season without it.</li>
            <li>But just a little dollop of Egyptian Magic in freshly shampooed and wet hair brings back the soft curls I used to have.  </li>
            <li>a few years ago one of my toe joints dropped causing a huge callus on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li>My acne scars had also began to clear up already</li>
            <li>The next morning, I woke up to find my dermatitis flaking off and whole, clear skin beneath.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear-</li>
            <li>Your skin will clear after using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helping to clear her acne</li>
            <li>wow, my local Whole Foods store recommended as a Staff Pick....</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, I find that it helps clear up breakouts and any cuts..  </li>
            <li>The one I switched to was Clean and Clear Deep cream cleanser) and it cleared up the dry spots and blemishes overnight by about 40%.</li>
            <li>In the morning my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is all natural and makes your skin just glow.</li>
            <li>it looks elastic and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>AM AN \\&quot;OLD FLORIDA GAL\\&quot;, SO LOTS OF SUN DAMAGE ON MY HANDS</li>
            <li>, they were soft to the touch, like velvet.</li>
            <li>Like wow.  </li>
            <li>My hands are frequently chapped from frequent washing while cooking, and EM</li>
            <li>I have very senstive, blemish-prone facial skin which has been suffering from rashiness since the beginning of the summer.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>So, for anyone who might be sensitive to scents, beware.</li>
            <li>This product does so much, I use it as a lip balm, hand/cuticle cream, night cream, and I have even used it on my hair for the fly-aways &amp; for slicking back strays for a sleek pony tail.</li>
            <li>When I would be driving and my hands were on the steering wheel, I could see how the skin would wrinkle and just looked old.</li>
            <li>I also have celiacs and A LOT of beauty products have gluten in them which is what i&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
            <li>A couple days before this product arrived I developed a sebaceous cyst in my cheek the size of a golf ball.</li>
            <li>People started telling me how young I look.</li>
            <li>So for delicate skin that you don&#x27;t want to pull on, say, around the eyes, the E.M. might be a better choice.  </li>
            <li>when I was 18 or 19 years old.  </li>
            <li>but I never have gotten that far with it.  </li>
            <li>i get a rash frequently on my ring finger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old and had no wrinkles before this product.</li>
            <li>21 years old with winkles??</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old</li>
            <li>But if I coukd, I would tell you that this stuff fixed them.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with severe acne all through HS and into my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>SO, if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>now looks glossier and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>Their hair looks shiny and feels really soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using it on her because it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I applied this religiously for 2 weeks straight at night after a shower, and I&#x27;m not kidding...</li>
            <li>Save yourself some time and get it straight from the site or your local Costco might carry it.</li>
            <li>Enough that I decided to splurge and buy it for myself without knowing a whole lot about it.  </li>
            <li>I will not try this product again and stick to shea butter and home-made honey masks for natural skin care, thank-you-very-much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I bought it in Costco and was attracted by natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend who doesn&#x27;t use any type of body products (a straight soap and razor type - mechanic) actually swears by this cream as a healer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works well so far.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so far, after the shower is when I apply it.</li>
            <li>Over all skin is soft as they claim.</li>
            <li>They sell the same product at Costco and Whole Foods so save yourself the pain of having to determine it&#x27;s authenticity by purchasing it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and sensitive and this moisturizer does not cause any redness nor breakouts.</li>
            <li>It has a natural scent to almost no scent at all.</li>
            <li>if you compare this to the one in whole foods, even the packing is slightly different.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it contains just olive oil and bee products, but together they seem to be miraculous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any scent or taste.</li>
            <li>WOW, I cannot begin to say how much this 34 year old scar has begun to diminish after only three days.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin so soft and glow.</li>
            <li>Based on what I have used so far.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin with eczema and thought I&#x27;d try this since it&#x27;s suppose to be anti-inflammatory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>how they naturally protect hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after a few weeks of using it I noticed some kind of warts around my eyes where I have used Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and you wake up to baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural just honey, olive oil, bee propolis, royal jelly, and beeswax.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and almost glowing.</li>
            <li>Some symptoms disappeard though my skin didn&#x27;t come to a complete recovery.</li>
            <li>I have combination and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have watched my wife use it over nearly 2 months</li>
            <li>It feels vey greasy and smells like old cooking oil.</li>
            <li>Have paid mucho much bucks for multiple skin creams, but NOTHING</li>
            <li>when you really need extra healing, this is the product to try.</li>
            <li>it is all natural...</li>
            <li>It has not made me look 30 years old</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed (a couple hours before if I can) and when I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>I worried it would make my pillowcase and sheets greasy, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a problem.</li>
            <li>I suffer from allergies  and have particularly sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy texture that you think will feel heavy on the face</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and radiant now...</li>
            <li>Both the smell and the texture are DIFFERENT from the real one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, professionally I am in pharmaceutical industry.</li>
            <li>All natural product.</li>
            <li>Is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this cream around for years and just recently purchased it at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>This product is very oily and did not absorb into my skin well, even when I used the littlest amount I possibly could to cover my face.</li>
            <li>As far as I concerned this is just a greasy cream which does nothing to your skin.</li>
            <li>this is not so much a CREAM as it is an OINTMENT which is both greasy and tacky at the same time.</li>
            <li>: natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I use it daily for eczema and it really helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely not the real product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had soft skin</li>
            <li>but this makes those tougher places feel soft too like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li>When I tell people my age they never believe me and say I look like I am in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>But my skin had been this strange combination of sensitive/dry/flaky/pimply, so I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>Make my skin is sooo soft , I also use it in my hair in the L.O.C treatment</li>
            <li>My face was really oily and shiny, and when I woke up the next morning I felt like I needed to take a shower because the product got on my hair overnight and made that oily looking as well.    </li>
            <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have noticed such a difference that it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product egyptian magic is a total waste of money...</li>
            <li>I like it for the most part, but sometimes a few red dots appear ion my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer and the stretch marks are slowly and surely fading.</li>
            <li>This is an all-natural, thick cream that feels more like an oil when rubbed with your hands.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so thick and tacky, that with enough   of it, I could possibly give a car a good lube job.   </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair that has also been affected by the medications I&#x27;m on (stay healthy, people...</li>
            <li>: At night, I use a wet finger to (very lightly) circle around the jar for 2-3 times, blend the product with my other moisturizer, apply while concentrating on my cheeks</li>
            <li>This is the first such product that really does work to lubricate, moisten, and even heal dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin usually looks totally dry and lifeless, but thanks to Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>This sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>This has helped my dry winter hands more than any other product!  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly and does not feel heavy like other creams on the face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, and it&#x27;s easy to fill a small sample jar for your purse; I wouldn&#x27;t put it in a pocket</li>
            <li>This one is shiny and greasy and because of prime when it got here first I made the mistake of using it and my skin is all dry and scaly despite all the grease.</li>
            <li>I tried other cheap product but it only cause breakages on my skin.</li>
            <li>Once the mask is completely dry, rinse it off with hot water (this may take a minute or so, depending on the thickness of the mask)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I first discovered that this cured my eczema, I&#x27;ve been using it for every itch and dry skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>A little greasy at first but absorbs in fast.</li>
            <li>Other folks are saying that if you put it on before bedtime, it&#x27;s all absorbed overnight...</li>
            <li>But because of an excited recommendation from a friend, I bought the cream and used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently decided to make the switch to natural products and this was one of my first big steps.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with dry flaky skin most of my adult life</li>
            <li>It is very pricey, but I only go through about a jar a year as it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize the dry skin and relieve the itching.</li>
            <li>Serious magic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it because they claim to have the same ingredients as Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with this product and preach the gospel of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>i can actually wear my rings now on a regular basis, thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it on a steady bases, it&#x27;s for a lot of different things.</li>
            <li>It can be pretty nice for cold feet or soar neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really particular about scented products, and this product does not have a lasting odor.  </li>
            <li>I like natural skin care and have normal skin with clogged pores and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>The one from the official website tasted a little sweet when I used on my lips.</li>
            <li>But, it matches the natural lipids in the skin so well, it literally soaks right in and leaves such smooth, soft, and healed skin behind.  </li>
            <li>This is a 4-star review only because of the fairly high price and the fact that I do find it leaves your skin a bit too oily in appearance, even after letting it sink in.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a high quality facial product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt if this product has done any that sort of study (even if it doesn&#x27;t need a prescription, they have to do some basic testing or study).</li>
            <li>There is very little smell to it and again, nothing else has worked for me to help smooth my lines.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff, love how it melts, in your hands, then apply to skin, HOWEVER, my skin is now all dried out, scaly and dry, WTH?</li>
            <li>I used this product for about six months on my face, which for a 35 yr old is pretty dry and gets very occasional adult acne, as well as my arms, as I suffer from keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>He has many very dark raised spots (not cancerous, thank you), and the big one under his eye is smaller now.  </li>
            <li>It was VERY greasy and took a long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li>when I apply it, that part of my skin really starts to glow a bit for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time &amp; money buying it on amazon or ebay as there are too many fakes around + incorrect guides as well on how to distinguish between real and fake.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical to buy the cream, but I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>so I bought directly from the company,but I experienced same disappointing result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have zits all over my usually blemish free face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t totally   fall for the hype, and waste money on the standard   jar.   </li>
            <li>, if u have normal skin with no problem, i recommend getting just a regular moisturize</li>
            <li>I have issues with dry skin during certain times of the year.</li>
            <li>As a sufferer of acne for many years now - since I started high school - I&#x27;ve tried a number of products and 90% of them have this in common: they dry you out.</li>
            <li>It does go on a little creamy/greasy feeling but it absorbs quickly (within 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>but if you rub it in your hands a little longer it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one wins hands down.  </li>
            <li>He gets chapped cheeks due to teething and this chilly winter, this stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Once thing u all need to do is, since this balm is all purpose and u&#x27;ll be using it on different parts of ur body, make sure u use a small spatula, spoon or anything to take out the balm since it is an open jar, and u don&#x27;t wanna spoil the natural contents of it by putting germs and bacteria in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, very solid and hard in the jar.  </li>
            <li>I used it only as a night cream since it tends to be an extremely oily product (I have super oily skin)</li>
            <li>As a new user to the product will re-post update at a later date.</li>
            <li>I put it on pretty heavy right before bed (after washing my makeup off) and when I wake up in the morning I just rinse my face with water and pat it dry.</li>
            <li>So, if you are experiencing chronic dry skin with patches, itchiness and flakiness, I HIGHLY recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li>concerned it would be too much even for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Not a   horrible smell, but not pleasant either.  </li>
            <li>This cream is a real savior in healing his dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>Definitely improved my skin quality and this stuff really does last forever.</li>
            <li>It also makes the red left after a pimple go away so much faster.  </li>
            <li>One thing this product did work well on was my 9 year old daughter, her skin is sensitive and gets the occasional rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this jar will last me at least 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li>When  you open them; the real one has almost a matte finish to it and is SOLID.</li>
            <li>I have been battling really severe eczema for my entire life, and I have tried COUNTLESS products/lotions/supplements/etc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it many times and it moisturizes without irritating sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also shared my difficult trials with skin problems towards the end of the review if you want to read my whole experience .  :)</li>
            <li>I see a change in an old scar, and especially in one area that looked like an old pimple that never healed.  </li>
            <li>It looks thick and yucky, like vaseline or aquaphor, but goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft the next day.</li>
            <li>However, when I use it as a night cream I notice that my skin is very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use as little as possible as it can get a little greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Pros:  - Works well for all the things mentioned in list above  - Lasts a LONG time  - 6 natural ingredients   - Not water based, so consistency doesn&#x27;t change much    </li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is aware that there are fake products out there, even though they may list the same ingredients they may not be the quality you&#x27;re hoping for.</li>
            <li>Then overnight, I saw a major difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>Then overnight, I saw a major difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>what I bought WAS fake, hey, bring it on because it&#x27;s sure working for us!</li>
            <li>The lotions recommended by dermatologists for my chronic dry skin: cethaphil, aveeno, luberiderm, vaseline, made my skin super dry and itchy!</li>
            <li>Anything with a lot of chemicals makes it even more dry and will give me small rashes.</li>
            <li>So I used this as a night/sleep cover for the last step of the daily skin care process, and it would protect me from the dryness till the next morning, and in the meantime to ensure the regular lotion be absorbed</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li>She says it removes many of the fine facial lines that other products fail to erase.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest applying a very small amount to DAMP skin so that the product is absorbed and assimilated in the skin much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely heavy and kind of gross feeling...but give it a half hour</li>
            <li>For me, so far, the results are temporary and I see no difference overall (other than for the first 10 or 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li>It has cleared up a area in my smile line that was breaking out with  Little pimples this winter.</li>
            <li>I put little sock on afterwards because it is a bit tacky but worth it.</li>
            <li>I must say I was quite skeptical about this product but after using it for more than I month, my face feels vibrant and looks so hydrated.</li>
            <li>cream is very thick, more along the lines of a balm, and takes some emulsifying to apply.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use the whole container, but in order to mask the &amp;#34;lard&amp;#34; smell I need to use my regular moisturizer over it, which also helps a little bit with absorbing the &amp;#34;Egyptian Magic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I usually come back about 15 minutes after I apply it and smooth my hands over my face once again just to help the remaining greasiness absorb.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my lips (day &amp; night), a tiny bit on unruly hair frizz, and even on minor scrapes (no broken skin).</li>
            <li>With the exception of one or two occasional pimples, my skin is clear...</li>
            <li>I looked like I&#x27;d abruptly developed a red, puffy goatee.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is also extremely sensitive to creams and facial washes.</li>
            <li>But I think I would only use it in someday but not everyday because it is too oil...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for months now and have barely made a dent.</li>
            <li>( Not much on the market you can really say that about.)    </li>
            <li>I use it at night and by morning my skin is soft, younger looking and looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>it was completely gone the next morning.</li>
            <li>It works terrific keeping your skin soft protecting it against the elements.</li>
            <li>Then, I tried my old facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Next time I will order directly from the website.  </li>
            <li>But for me, I&#x27;m sticking with my extra virgin coconut oil to moisturize my face and body naturally.</li>
            <li>When you figure out how much to use there is no greasiness as it sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, it&#x27;s all the rage in Paris and</li>
            <li>I put this on my lips at every night as well, and my lips gets so soft in the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local natural food store.</li>
            <li>I actually stopped washing my face completely</li>
            <li>This is my personal usage review that may help individuals with sensitive + acne +</li>
            <li>I also use it on my chest, as I have a lot of sun damage in that area; the deep set lines that I thought would never go away have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 38 years young male</li>
            <li>All the years purchasing from Amazon this is the second time I didn&#x27;t received what I have ordered but the first time writing in am really not please with this.</li>
            <li>And the words are kind of vague.</li>
            <li>Ancient EGYPTIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It breaks my face out like crazy but it is good for the rest of my body</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t warm it up and allow it to liquefy a bit, it can be difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little less greasy than Vaseline but absorbs better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for my cracked heels (due to excessive sandal and flip flop wear in the summer) but not good for the face.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday to smooth my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I really like what it&#x27;s done for my skin, especially during the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to put it on delicate skin for fear of breaking out, so I mostly just used it on my hands and forearms and dry leg spots for a while.</li>
            <li>If your skin is looking dry, slather this stuff on, but only at night because it is VERY shiny.</li>
            <li>I also have a mild case of eczema so for a while, I was using Sarna with a few drops of Jojoba oil mixed together for my face and hands.</li>
            <li>Right now in the dead of winter</li>
            <li>I tired a little bit at first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to spread on face unless you rub it in your fingers and let your body heat warm it up a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had tiny red dots on the back of my arms since I was in junior high.</li>
            <li>Because the main ingredient is olive oil which has long been a standard product used in beauty products for centuries.  </li>
            <li>I was drawn to Egyption Magic because of its natural ingredients, however, it did not work for me because it broke my face out pretty bad.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If my face looks extremely shiny or looks greasy, I have used too much.</li>
            <li>My face looks refreshed no matter how hot and muggy the weather is, not getting enough sleep or  whatever challenging circumstances arise.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of moisturizing or aiding my skin in any other way</li>
            <li>If she doesn&#x27;t shower it off completely with soap, it leaves a brown scum &amp; brown bubbles in the hot tub!</li>
            <li>And I realize the cream is not like the real one I bought from other place.</li>
            <li>My acne is even doing a little better with a few days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>It is more firm in the jar than Medicine Mama&#x27;s, so you have to rub it between your hands a little longer before applying.</li>
            <li>I think it would be great to protect the skin from the cold, but definitely not to heal dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am curious about how the real product should work, but I will definitely never buy it again, ever.</li>
            <li>In search of a moisture that did not dry my skin</li>
            <li>It is 5 times more pricey than Aquaphor ointment, but besides the worse smell, it does similar job.</li>
            <li>all young people must go through, but I became more skeptical of this as the acne continued into my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using this on my face I have ditched all the expensive facial moisturizers and I&#x27;m loving my complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product, but there is a lot of false hype because beauty gurus on YouTube were paid to sell it to the public before the law about sharing if they were paid was enacted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many false creams out there that try to advertise as the same company so beware.</li>
            <li>It smealls a little funny</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that this stuff wasn&#x27;t as great as I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I generally use a home-crafted almond oil blend as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of products from American products like Clinique, Paula&#x27;s Choice to Foreign Brands like Face Shop (Korea), AquaMoist (Japan) that are reasonable in price, but none of them worked.</li>
            <li>I like that it is ALL NATURAL and the jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>On the third day, I had spots on both cheeks and chin (itchy red pimples and dry flakey cheeks mainly around those itchy pimples).  </li>
            <li>For ages I&#x27;ve been using ph5 Eucerin (Beiersdorf) cream for sensitive skin which has been, and still is, my long time favourite day &amp; night cream.</li>
            <li>( I live in a very dry area and I tried everything, but nothing worked ).</li>
            <li>At first I was using it during the day, but it was just a little too heavy for daytime use, especially during hot, August days.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY dry, VERY sensitive skin and have tried hundreds of products over the years.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of weird claims about this cream, and the inventor is one odd duck (see New York Times), but this is a very good, no fuss, no funny ingredient, no funny smell skin treatment.   </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and the results makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My kids have eczema and this did nothing for that other than as a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I got no particular healing effects -- it doesn&#x27;t work any better than vaseline or other generic heavy oils.  </li>
            <li>It smells bad and it&#x27;s pretty oily, it&#x27;s ok for the body but not for the face, which is what I wanted to use it for.</li>
            <li>I only write review if I am extremely happy or disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li>So far, it cure my dry skin, and it&#x27;s my biggest problem.</li>
            <li>This has completely CURED my dry cracked heels and elbows.  </li>
            <li>Time went on...5 minutes, 10 minutes, half an hour, and still my face looked really oily.</li>
            <li>In the first jar I had the cream was white and fluffy.</li>
            <li>already the pink and purple discoloration has almost completely faded!</li>
            <li>and my once soft hair is now coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li>In a pinch, I rub a little together in my my palms and use it to smooth my hair and add a little shine.</li>
            <li>It felt super heavy on my skin even though I hadn&#x27;t used much, like a really thick foundation.</li>
            <li>I use this year round,  Whenever my face is feeling particularly dry, I use this all over my face right before I go to sleep</li>
            <li>My skin usually gets super dry when traveling and rubbing a dab of the cream into my cuticles and palms keeps them from cracking.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days the red, bumpy areas on my cheeks were perfectly smooth and hydrated - no more bumps!!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and a tub lasts a long while so definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The bad thing is finding good products to use to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is good, The smell is really bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a night cream and love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells very nice; just like honey!</li>
            <li> ,  THE PROTECTION IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> But what a nice salve to come home to!!</li>
            <li> However, I did have very good luck with using the product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when people started telling me that I didn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li> a very good all-purpose cream.</li>
            <li> THEY SAID IT&#x60;S VERY GOOD   </li>
            <li> it was very good.  </li>
            <li> and it is ideal for the face.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, this application worked incredibly well for me in terms of healing and preventing recurrence of the eczema rashes on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It also works great on fly aways/frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> My face and hands never looked so good...!</li>
            <li> Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> before you buy it test your skin if you are suitable for it!!</li>
            <li> Once this cream is applied my skin is so radiant, even, and beautiful, that the Acne doesn&#x27;t matter or bother me.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful boost to my skin.</li>
            <li> it tames the fly-aways beautifully.</li>
            <li> good product!!!!!i love it!!!</li>
            <li> , the ingredients are great.</li>
            <li> , it can be used all over the body (which is great for me, I don&#x27;t like the way it sits on the skin, so I&#x27;m going to use the rest of my jar as a scalp treatment, who knows,</li>
            <li> This is a great product for skin care.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews on it and thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> I find this is especially important in the winter when everything dries out from lack of moisture.  </li>
            <li> But it is not that great at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use on your hands at night.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this after hearing great things about it.</li>

            <li> Egyptian Magic had the best reviews.</li>
            <li> A delightful skin treatment, whether it works magic or not.</li>
            <li> Should do my own account!</li>
            <li> She says, Egyptian Magic is wonderful, skin looks and feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t discovered Egyptian Magic yet, this skin cream is marvelous.</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> Nice !</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for many problems.  </li>
            <li> It holds curls in place really nicely!</li>
            <li> I have fairly severe eczema in my hands and have found that Egyptian Magic is the best at keeping my hands hydrated.</li>
            <li> The cream has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If not it is still a great product, I love the way it smells too!</li>
            <li> using on feet really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but would rather recommend BioOil or Eight Hour Cream depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li> Based on the good review I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product to use in winter.</li>
            <li> This is GOOD stuff.</li>
            <li> good product..</li>
            <li> great product....works really nicely ......</li>
            <li> good deal.</li>
            <li> So I knew the product will probably be good.</li>
            <li> Also good as a hair pomade.  </li>
            <li> This cream is turning out to be a really good buy.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the good news...</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> IS IN GOOD SHAPE,  AND IN WINTER IS UNBEATEABLE</li>
            <li> I think that it might be good used as a heel cream</li>
            <li> Also, EM is a good makeup remover and helps with moisturizing.</li>
            <li> good luck.</li>
            <li> yea dont think thats a good idea</li>
            <li> What can grow in oil and water without a preservative can kill you, or leave you deformed for life (MRSA is a good example).</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I can&#x27;t blame the product for that which is why I just gave it 3 stars to be fair.</li>
            <li> Plus amazon gives a good price.</li>
            <li> It is called Good News in Milford, DE.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I use on my face for eczema instead of steroids.</li>
            <li> I find it greasy &amp; it work as good as putting baby oil on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good for the hair too.</li>
            <li> However, it makes me feel good when I wake up in the morning after I use it every night.</li>
            <li> The cream worked well with the Weleda Calendula Cream I was using as a night cream, and made a good barrier to protect my rash from the elements.</li>
            <li> I just loved it for my boys</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking a good 10 years off my skin.  </li>
            <li> A good friend had tried this cream and recommended it to go with my perfective ceuticals</li>
            <li> Good skin product.that is not greasy.not greasey</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in two years.  </li>
            <li> Loved it and ordered again</li>
            <li> All is good except that its too oily.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been 2weeks and my skin looks really good</li>
            <li> The product feels good going on and lasts throughout the day and night if applied as directed.</li>
            <li> so the 4-oz size is a good value.</li>
            <li> Good for the skin and makes my fingernails stronger.</li>
            <li> Will make good use of it anyway.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be good for people with skin problem.</li>
            <li> I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;REALLY GOOD FOR:&lt;br /&gt;acne</li>
            <li> It was so good</li>
            <li> It is way too oily for me, if you applied this at night, good thing is that it does absorb in the morning,</li>
            <li> I loved this skin cream.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> This can be a good thing for some people because it makes it easier to apply</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this must-have product that i used to loved!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizing balm - I&#x27;ve been using it successfully for a couple of months</li>
            <li> A must have for beautiful, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product.</li>

            <li> It is great and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> After checking with the site and reading here, I&#x27;m sure that those who aren&#x27;t happy had bought counterfeit goods.  </li>
            <li> He was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for a couple of weeks now and have been happy to see improvement in texture and reduction in wrinkles and scaring.  </li>
            <li> I read great reviews about this product an how so many celebs were using it.</li>

            <li> I would recommend using it as a night moisturizer (and washing your face in the morning) because it&#x27;s pretty greasy and your skin needs time to absorb it for the best results.  </li>

            <li> The results are amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have to say, it has been amazing.  </li>
            <li> those women have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any amazing results, but</li>
            <li> Works great as moisturizer under makeup and does smooth the skin with continued use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great around the eyes at night and helps smooth your lips.</li>
            <li> So smooth and great results....</li>
            <li> If this product works for you, this is a wonderful plus as in the end, it will be very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By that time, I am good to go and my skin looks healthy and glowing, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> but if that was the case, there would be no reason I would have this kind of a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> it is a good hand/foot moiserizing cream, but nothing magic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of in a block in the tub.</li>
            <li> I used it on a some cuts and scrapes, which helped it heal nicely.  </li>
            <li> It does not however, reduce scars of any kind.</li>
            <li> an excellent beauty product that really smooths and sooths my face and neck.</li>
            <li> After seeing so many good reviews raving about how amazing this it.</li>
            <li> the good thing is this cream is effective in refreshing your skin, if you could bear your oily skin all night.</li>
            <li> Kind of</li>
            <li> really nice cream for the growing tummy.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY picky about what goes on my face, but this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> so,  I tried using a clay mask to get rid of the spots, and I noticed that no oil of any kind came from around the breakout area.</li>
            <li> It kept it very hydrated and works great!     </li>
            <li> In the morning, my skin is nicely hydrated (a miracle in our climate).    </li>
            <li> I have used this product and liked it....</li>
            <li> Warm it in your fingers so it will spread well.</li>
            <li> I was kind of greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li> The rest is a nice mix.</li>
            <li> I know that some people say that it should be oily in consistency when you warm it with your hands.</li>
            <li> but if you keep the usage to a minimum it is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> The cream felt nice on my hands</li>
            <li> for buying it: buy it from a store/ trusted and reliable seller, preferably their own website.</li>

            <li> Equally effective for heels, elbows and faces</li>
            <li> Instead it kind of smells like honey bees.</li>
            <li> but when I got the product, it really was great!</li>
            <li> I use it as lip balm because it hydrates and adds a nice dewy sheen to my lips, which eliminates the need for a lip color product.</li>
            <li> It feels nice for hands before going to bed (it&#x27;s too waxy and oily for daytime).</li>
            <li> which is really nice.</li>
            <li> but it gave my skin a nice glow and translucence.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a youthful look to your skin.</li>

            <li> Used it for burn, excellent, no scars, healed fast.</li>
            <li> My scars are healing nicely, pores shrinking</li>
            <li> just make sure you have a really good cleanser</li>
            <li> a kind of test, I started putting it on a wart.  </li>
            <li> The cream is nice, but oilly.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so nice, and moist.</li>
            <li> an absolute wonderful product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> To each their own just make sure you&#x27;re giving it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The original product is great and does wonders on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li> (NEVER have to use it there anymore); soaks into the skin rather than rests on the skin like lotions; makes my whole body and face GLOW bright and beautiful; gives my dry-dead-ends (hair) a conditioning affect; firms my skin; and leaves my skin silky;     BUT don&#x27;t use this cream as a cure for severe acne, it won&#x27;t cure acne; it will relieve acne of stress if you put it on at night, and it will moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a very strong scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is excellent, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing, great for winter dry season.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great as a lotion for dry skin, and the best tattoo healer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;good\\&quot; version has a nice consistency, spreads into oil easily, smells like bee products (beeswax etc), and is a good face creme.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a great full body moisturiser, scar treatment, night cream or for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased thank you Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> My best friend took one from me and I gave another one to my boyfriend, they all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> On time with nice package and good quality of cream with cheap price.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is so much better!</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is truly magical!</li>
            <li> I am so glad i did, after a couple hours the knee was looking and feeling so much better!</li>
            <li> Best face lotion/make-up remover for sensitive - pimple prone skin!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really smell very good</li>
            <li> By far the best cream out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps over time, it will fade acne scars; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised, the ingredients are great!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and  have nearly perfect skin</li>
            <li> Why many people liked it?</li>
            <li> Then, the most amazing thing started happening.</li>
            <li> Can I say, radiant, soft, and beautiful looking skin!!</li>
            <li> My face is soft and flawless.</li>
            <li> I heard amazing things about this product, and it is really interesting.</li>
            <li> This egyptian magic was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t rush out to buy more.</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever, all natural ingredients,</li>
            <li> but soo far da best....</li>
            <li> My smile lines have diminished greatly and I think this may be the cause!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased Egyptian Magic at Costco for its assertion of being effective on eczema.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic however is amazing.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on line but especially loved the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had heard about this product from a friend, and she raved about how good it is, but the packaging was off-putting and looked cheap.</li>
            <li> Still, Egyptian Magic is a good product and does a nice job keeping your skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just love love love it!</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell too great, lol.</li>
            <li> I am so far really enjoying this cream and feel that it is the perfect moisturizer during the winter months.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying the ingredients on your own and getting much more for your hard-earned money.</li>
            <li> it didnt do anything special for me but the moisturizing and mosquito bite comfort is good.</li>
            <li> It was great the first try on my eyelids, but that was it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> all in all, pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very smooth</li>
            <li> - Packaging is very cheap looking   </li>
            <li> The packaging is very cheap.</li>
            <li> My face is very smooth and moist, and I think it improved the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> They said although it&#x27;s feel oil but skin feel very comfortable after use it.</li>
            <li> I will sure recommend this product to anyone who isn&#x27;t allergic to BEE&#x27;s, a person with stretch marks, a person with the bumply stuff that I have, and a person who just wants beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, lovely scent, beautiful radiant moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this with Sweet Bee Magic, can&#x27;t tell any difference, both are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it must also be said that the Egyptian Magic has a more pleasant scent than real, pure, unbleached shea butter, and also glides on with greater ease.  </li>
            <li> Have used Egyptian Magic for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> It leaves oily stains on most</li>
            <li> It also appeared to be more even-toned.</li>
            <li> I am using Egyptian Magic on my face (including eyes), neck, hands, body, heels of feet, etc.  </li>
            <li> However, it has rave reviews so it must work miracles for most people.</li>
            <li> Its lovely</li>
            <li> So many people were warning customers; folks, this is a night cream, don&#x27;t expect to wear this under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is more like a scalp oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why so many people endorsed this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any magic when I use this, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I love how Egyptian Magic makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this would not work for all skin types, but for mine it does.  </li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic helps to balance it all out.  </li>
            <li> I was able to put on eyeshadow that day and did not feel any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic has erased scars, healed rashes and burns, and cured virtually everything I&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Bee Magic</li>
            <li> i love the way it absorb into my skin...</li>
            <li> , u&#x27;ll love the way ur hair would feel after wash.</li>
            <li> As an alternative I bought Bio-Oil, I recommend that over Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> More like ointment, but it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use egyptian magic all over...</li>
            <li> I was able to apply this to my dermatitis while at work, and no one was the wiser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Mama Medicine&#x27;s Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and I expect that this cream will keep it looking fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find the perfect cream and cleanser because I have absolutely no facial regime</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> but over all quite pleased.........</li>
            <li> and since I am a scuba diver 5 hours or more a day of salt water immersion.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference so the cream did not work magic for me.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> I did and read so many reviews by others.</li>
            <li> I rumb the magic into my palms like stated in the directions</li>
            <li> I ordered it for many reasons.</li>
            <li> But best of all it saved me $$ for not purchasing a product to use on my recent permanent eyeliner (tattoo).</li>
            <li> so simple but, soooo AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This cream has made the qulaity of my life so much better.</li>
            <li> I love this Cream and will buy again</li>
            <li> It is also very moisturizing and great as a night cream.</li>
            <li> When I received the jar of Egyptian Magic Cream</li>
            <li> While it may look like petroleum jelly, it is much more healthy for your skin than petroleum jelly would be.    </li>
            <li> I guess it is Magic in that sense.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have given a jar to two of my friends and they love it too.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream, I even have mu husband use it.</li>
            <li> I started using Egytian Magic every morning under my makeup.</li>
            <li> but many many people ...</li>
            <li> I did not know if this was because of the Egypian Magic or the Coco Butter goo that I was using.</li>
            <li> Then, I ran out of the Egyptian Magic and stopped using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> I purchase this magic cream just for a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years-</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better now.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Well, my hands seem to need more than just Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> Oh yes, you may want to wash Egyptian Magic off your hands before you touch your hair.</li>
            <li> I was told that there are some counterfeit Egyptian Magic dealers on Amazon and packaging</li>
            <li> ..way overpriced based on claims of Magic.</li>
            <li> you cant even see it any more, this was with me using it twice a day</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I started tring it for more than 3 weeks, nothing improved for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;No comments for this product.</li>
            <li> I think I will not buy it, unless he made magic</li>
            <li> Her skin would puff up and look literally cracked in some areas and Egyptian Magic worked for her.</li>
            <li> though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week.</li>
            <li> But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works like magic</li>
            <li> I received my Egyptian Magic in the mail yesterday, tried it and this morning</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s many purposes.</li>
            <li> and I love how it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t magic for me, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream and love it.</li>
            <li> I still use my favorite moisturizer and then apply this on top.  </li>
            <li> Many stars use this</li>
            <li> It is truly magical.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years..  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with this product for my uses.  </li>
            <li> Hand Moisturizer  - Heal scars (works best on recent scars from what I&#x27;ve seen)  - Eye cream  - Treatment for ends of hair       </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with break outs and even though it has olive oil in it, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out more.  </li>
            <li> so thanks amazon for this great product .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay.</li>
            <li> I read all these rave reviews about Egyptian Magic and had to have it.  </li>
            <li> It melts into a lovely beeswax-honey scented moisturizer and barrier cream, as well as - if all claims are to be believed - magic cream.   </li>
            <li> My face drastically cleared up after using this product :)</li>
            <li> This cream has changed my face... for the better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, even the most $$$ supposed &amp;#34;ACNE FREE&amp;#34; creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to put the formula out, but if you read the container it&#x27;s all the ingredients listed in descending order.</li>
            <li> Which means it&#x27;s mostly Olive Oil A and Beeswax.</li>
            <li> I think the Egyptian Magic Skin Cream is overpriced.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this because I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it.</li>
            <li> It gives a really healthy looking glow, I can&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products, and this one is truly MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this cream on it.</li>
            <li> B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]]) to eliminate bacteria in my pores.</li>
            <li> I love this cream because of its ingredients and what it does for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things but nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like a balm (like the consistency of Tiger balm or petroleum jelly)</li>
            <li> And, quite frankly, I like my product better.  </li>
            <li> i just keep finding more and more uses for this cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s should be egyptian magic all purpose</li>
            <li> I have been only using it on my face, and it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of a friend recommendation.... and as its name, is magical what happens with the skin after using it....</li>
            <li> And I have been itch free ever since!  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> love, love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy the Egyptian Magic sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I fell so in love with this.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect all year, and a jar seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Peace, Divine love, perfect health, internal, eternal wisdom and infinite blessings unto you,</li>
            <li> Then by morning my skin feels and looks rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li> I will return it for sure.</li>
            <li> It works and has so many uses....cuts, scrapes, burns</li>
            <li> It is not a cream, more of a balm but absorbs well and leaves your skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> Ive used it through two pregnancies and it works better than any moisturizer ive ever used, but doesn&#x27;t leave any grease residue on clothes.  </li>
            <li> So with that in mind, I&#x27;d rate Egyptian Magic cream as 3 star/</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li> today offer way better alternatives for testing ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister had given me a sample size of Egyptian Magic, and at the peak of my struggle with nothing to lose, I smeared this evenly over my face one night and hoped I wouldn&#x27;t be horrified in the morning.</li>
            <li> Yet, this product has been the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think that this product will help me keep my face moist for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It turned my raisin skin more supple and youthful.  </li>
            <li> Cant say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Better off buy Loreal skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Even though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week.</li>
            <li> But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic know there are a lot of fakes of this product on Amazon and have this in their FAQ if you go to the Egyptian magic website and look at their FAQ</li>
            <li> make these checks when you get your jar or buy from a reseller that does not carry fakes and make sure you return this to</li>
            <li> I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> But my rashy areas feel more supple and they haven&#x27;t re-rashed up.</li>
            <li> It works better than the prescription steroid cream my dermatologist gave me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product applied \\&quot;thin\\&quot; still lays on the top of the skin</li>
            <li> I  love what this product does for my face.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got the Egyptian Magic 4 Ounce from Amazon factory, and then i figured that the expiration date was erased.  </li>
            <li> I love the results it gives me when I use it as an overnight cream.  </li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> It works better at night before bed, as it it somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> I received Egyptian Magic as a sample in a skin care pack.</li>
            <li> My best friend&#x27;s wedding is next month</li>
            <li> The color was much much better</li>
            <li> She said she&#x27;s been using Magic cream for about a months now</li>
            <li> and when i woke up my face was so smooth, radiant and rosy!</li>
            <li> I have acne and would not consider using Egyptian Magic alone.  </li>
            <li> After the mask, this product reintroduces healthy oil (eliminating my skin&#x27;s need to produce sebum) and the honey acts as an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> skin is healthier than ever and so much more</li>
            <li> This cream was a good moisturizer and absorbed quite well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian Magic for about three months now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three months and every day my skin keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> My skin was more even toned and my wrinkles under my eyes had smoothed out.</li>
            <li> While my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s much better than before when I did use all kinds of different cleansers, toners, and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> One SB and then the slightly better EM.</li>
            <li> I hope someday (the sooner the better)</li>
            <li> I love her with everything I am.</li>
            <li> If I need more, I repeat the process.</li>
            <li> I hope the reader finds my comments helpful. :)</li>

            <li> Even then, aquaphor or vaseline works better than this.</li>
            <li> This cream would be ok as a something between a cream and a lotion, and it has a honey smell.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> Egyptian magic website states how to tell if your jar is counterfiet - if the \\&quot;use by date\\&quot; is printed and not engraved its counterfeit.</li>
            <li> But the cream is indeed magic for everything.</li>
            <li> I started using it for Mosquito bites, it stops the itch like magic.</li>
            <li> it is magic, magic and magic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad she did it.</li>
            <li> is an excellent product I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.  </li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had any noticeable improvements in my skin hydration or softness, but it does make my skin feel slightly more elastic while it&#x27;s on in the mornings.</li>

            <li> (I&#x27;m 41 and used to love the sun)</li>
            <li> Carolla&#x27;s Beeswax Skin Creme is a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> I looked at the 700 or so good reviews and thought that meant it was possibly worth $30 or so</li>
            <li> The scent used to be better also.</li>
            <li> I reached out to the Egyptian Magic company twice to inquire about the product and have gotten no response.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 oz and 2 oz jar of Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it for hands and feet.</li>

            <li> I have tried many product to cure my acne.  </li>

            <li> And Much better for you.</li>
            <li> Not Smelly. :)</li>
            <li> I have applied Egyptian Magic for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> Most of all, Egyptian Magic does not bring any side effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> it is better for women.</li>
            <li> With the price tag of this product I was sure it would impress.  </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend and she LOVES it, says it works and plans on buying more.</li>
            <li> ok, if I could return the order.</li>
            <li> It is called magic cream, I use it as night</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is homey yellow!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> My wife really love using Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I love my Egyptian magic.  </li>
            <li> but this product makes me even more confident in many</li>
            <li> More like Vaseline or aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Great cream that works very well.</li>
            <li> but when I wake up I wake up with a baby look like face :)</li>
            <li> Will buy more when winter comes.</li>
            <li> I purchased another Egyptian magic cream from its official website.</li>
            <li> It is more than 38 dollars.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels more protected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It is more like a vaseline (vysleen) petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> We always make sure that we have one of these in our house at all times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Medicine Mama&#x27;s Bee Magic too, and like that, but I love the Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my skin, but it is oily and needs to be put on an hour or so before applying makeup because of that.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb into the skin but sitting on top and feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I can buy a better lotion for a fraction of this price.</li>
            <li> it is great for normal skin too!</li>
            <li> but my skin has never felt better so far so good!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face , which is very sensitive and it makes your skin look and feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> Also, though it feels very rich, the cream is not greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This Egyptian magic is awesome for all the dry spots and face, hands, elbows, knees and etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, and is a great consistency and spreads easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the REAL product is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> The product smells sweet with the honey in it and royal jelly is amazing for your skin as well as a nutritional supplement.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin and is the only product (and I&#x27;ve tried many!)</li>
            <li> I thought it might be wonderful because Egypt has long history and</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good</li>
            <li> Well, it would be pretty good if it did not immediately melt into a liquid.</li>
            <li> The seller was also great promptly sent me the product, I received it quickly and began to use it right away.</li>
            <li> In my experience, Egyptian Magic has been effective and economical.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend trying Egyptian Magic skin cream.</li>
            <li> and it was supposed to be the best cream ever for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, if a person has dry skin this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed into my 30&#x27;s that my skin dries out a bit more easily</li>
            <li> Perfect if you have dry patches and are travelling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is so easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also awesome for women who have really dry skin, as I apply it to my lips to moisturize and heal up cracks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be excellent for the dry winter.</li>
            <li> this magic cream isnt really cream but a greasy (in a good way) substance.</li>
            <li> U&#x27;ll love this balm, not just becoz its cheap, but also the magic it does.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my face, it was a rough winter and everyone knows that moisturizing is best for your face.</li>
            <li> Great that it&#x27;s all natural too!</li>
            <li> Excellent, replaced many other products with this one.</li>
            <li> an excellent moisturiser for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> so-called lightly spread this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; its totally more of an oil, on my face around 9pm...</li>
            <li> This works really great as a night cream; my skin feels so soft  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and natural.</li>
            <li> I have only used this on my hands, because I find the product to be incredibly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use the Sweet Bee magic every night and I use the Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> It also works great on my baby&#x27;s sensitive cheeks and nose to prevent chapping when he has a runny nose, or is drueling a lot.</li>
            <li> works great on my daughters sensitive skin to help keep moisture locked in.</li>
            <li> This product is a great all natural solution for all of my problems.</li>
            <li> I read through a bunch of reviews before buying this stuff and it seemed to be a great natural moisturizer, which is what I needed.</li>
            <li> It is great and all natural, and you can use it on your hair and body as well.</li>
            <li> I always wondered what this was as in many beauty magzines the write ups were fantastic and now I know why.</li>
            <li> But...it softens wrinkles and makes your face feel smooth and more youthful.</li>
            <li> It is great for mature and baby skin.</li>
            <li> this review was useful, have nice day and peace out.</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews...I was so excited to try this cream.</li>
            <li> Perhaps best used in connection with wearing gloves to bed at night for extreme treatment.  </li>
            <li> Dont let the cheaper price fool you ...go with the original Egyptian magic...</li>
            <li> and she remarked excitedly how it magically healed up her blister.    </li>
            <li> surprisingly it didn&#x27;t, which is one thing that impressed me because this cream...more like wax...seemed very thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> easily put 7 to 8 coats of moisturizer on my face after cleansing to relieve the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one does not become oily so easily even after rubbing it between my hands.</li>
            <li> you have to dip your fingers inside, so make sure they are clean.</li>
            <li> it liquefies and can be smoothed into the skin easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply if you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my face, I apply this cream after using my clay mask and makes my skin soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> It also helps heal scratches easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to be creamy, and it&#x27;s not supposed to have a strong, chemically enhanced smell.  </li>
            <li> Works really like magic for any kind of skin irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> This kind product is real magic and usefull for dry air</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> heard about Sweet Bee Magic and thought I would give it a try becasue</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this &#x27;cream&#x27;, you can feel completely safe and confident about absorbing all of them through your skin into your body, with no toxicity at all.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it for myself after reading all the reviews on amazon and other web-sites and I can honestly say it is a great multipurpose product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 6+ years, as well as trying competing products and blending my own.</li>
            <li> I understand that this items has been compared to the cheaper version - Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tried and true and called magic for a reason.</li>
            <li> Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is better than sweet bee&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This stuff (which is really a solid that melts to an oily consistency on contact) works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order the cheaper alternative Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic to see if it works just as well.</li>
            <li> At first he liked the cream.</li>
            <li> Just buy normal Nivea Creme from the supermarket for $4 just as good.</li>
            <li> It has incredible healing ingredients;great for scrapes,dry skin, minor irritations,you name it</li>
            <li> My skin was looking dehydrated and had fine lines.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and even adds shine.  </li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> check to make sure it authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li> I have fine hair by the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to start with a small amount and add more if you feel it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> For wintry dry skin it is brilliant.  </li>
            <li> Silky smooth and easy to apply....and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine</li>
            <li> the color is fine, looks just like it does it the picture online.</li>
            <li> Super softening and smells like honey :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer, but it leaves me looking like I&#x27;m super greasy-</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product!</li>
            <li> I tried many products that worked for everything else but would not start the healing process for my sores but the very first night that I applied this stuff...</li>
            <li> Thanks, Egyptian Magic!  </li>
            <li> It is good if you have sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it magic but it does work great for my dry, flaky skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I started using Egyptian Magic, and now my heels are super smooth.</li>
            <li> i love this product works great for dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li> and I can tell I&#x27;m receiving the best moisturizer ever, and my skin is as clear and soft as ever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  works very well !!  </li>
            <li> I broke out in huge pimples both days after applying, I&#x27;d blame it on the cheesecake except I KNOW a greasy face for hours equals pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel and see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have notice a huge difference already.</li>
            <li> If you get even a drop of water in this whether making it, or buying it, you are just giving out a huge invitation to germs and molds to ruin it.</li>
            <li> While she still has to deal with it, this cream has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> After two weeks i caved in and spent the money on this stuff after hearing many great things.</li>
            <li> One application and a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> After one use on my feet I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all &#x27;round excellent product.</li>
            <li> this product is chemical free; they use it as a diaper rash cream, body  balm..</li>
            <li> But the wax softens almost immediately once you&#x27;re rubbing it on your fingers, and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> smooth my scar</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my skin so smooth, stains have practically disappeared.</li>
            <li> It smells lightly of olive oil and moisturizes my face like nothing ever has.</li>
            <li> Even though it feels greasy at the time, I awaken to smooth and moist</li>
            <li> I did end up using a teeny bit rubbed over both my hands to smooth my hair</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and luminous.</li>
            <li> My thoughts were that if they liked it that much, then perhaps I would as well.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Its not to oily feeling and goes on smooth and absorb in the skin.  </li>
            <li> , so I would never use it under makeup for daytime, but putting it on at night it really soaks in and my skin feels amazing when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to know</li>
            <li> This is the best trouble spot moisturizer ever.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for a few weeks now and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Ok, i expected something miraculous and magical since i&#x27;ve read so good critics about it</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for 3 weeks -- but think it is great - get compliments</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> Felt comfortable and reduced the rash and inflammation.  </li>
            <li> genuine product is unscented.  </li>
            <li> I also have wound up using it everywhere else including my face, the upper arms (keratosis pilaris), and scalp and have been really happy with it with no issues.</li>
            <li> It clears acne and smooth skins.</li>
            <li> i want to have a smooth skin like hers.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit heavy, however my skin absorbs it perfectly.</li>
            <li> It softens my skin and my skin feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t know what my cousin paid for the jar she gave me, I thought that paying about $20 here on Amazon for a jar that lasts the better part of a year is worth it.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it every day and says it is well worth the money and says she will buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> The seller was kind enough to send me an email when they shipped my Eqyptian Magic explaining how to use the product, how to know the product was authentic and contact information in case</li>
            <li> if u have light blemishes on your cheek and wanna try getting rid of them u can try but this also didnt help get rid of any acne.</li>
            <li> It smells lightly of honeyed wax.</li>
            <li> honestly, it is very oil, however you can warm it until melt, I use nothing but the oil cream after washing my face at night.</li>
            <li> Great formula, I use it on the body, too (especially arches of the feet, hands and elbows - and don&#x27;t forget the neck).</li>
            <li> ) Wash your face well with warm water using gentle, organic face wash.</li>
            <li> and I ended up giving the entire tube to her LOL.</li>
            <li> I also found another great use for it - on my last trip</li>
            <li> Its light and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> Some people said &amp;#34;oh you can use it as pre-makeup cream to smooth your skin.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> free shipping tho.</li>
            <li> They are both oily to start with, but for me, Egyptian Magic absorbs more readily.  </li>
            <li> Prescription creams, gels and pills have been used with good result, but Egyptian Magic is an ultimate soother.  </li>
            <li> So it is good for getting better looking and healthier skin, but it is not going to have the same effects as a scar cream like Mederma.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and goes on nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend also laughed at the hilarious packaging (Lord Pharoah Imhotep AmonRa is listed as the CEO), but became a believer when he saw the red dots practically disappear within a week.</li>
            <li> There are so many recent good reviews, that my   curiosity was peaked and I had to try this out.   </li>
            <li> I like the idea that it is all natural and is good to fend off skin infections from cuts and burns.</li>
            <li> I like it because it hydrates well, smells good, and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this after seeing so many reviews of people swearing by this product...</li>
            <li> it feels good and makes your skin soft too.how</li>
            <li> This product is okay for the most part, it didn&#x27;t really improve my skin</li>
            <li> For me, Egyptian Magic worked AWESOMELY when I apply it at least 3-4 hours before bed time.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there that fade acne scars, Tea Tree Oil is a good example, anything anti-microbial probably would and most of the ingredients in Egyptian Magic are</li>
            <li> A week later I absolutely love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> Very economical night cream</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have super super sensative skin</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot;, but it didn&#x27;t turn out to be so magical for me.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite product!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses Egyptian Magic and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> I have not found a better thing to keep the environment from drawing the moisture out of my skin, which is GOOD since dry skin is often wrinkly skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li> I am totally hooked on this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> After my first use my skin was much more hydrated feeling and looking.</li>
            <li> Well worth the results, too!</li>
            <li> When I got my first container, I thought it would be greasy because it looks more like an ointment than a cream.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about the Egyptian Magic from Youtube.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first jar from another website and that one was way better than this one I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to try it as a hair balm as well.</li>
            <li> Next morning I found the cream is totally absorbed after the whole night and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> But this one was REAL! :)</li>
            <li> &quot; my skin much at all, it kind of sat on top of it, even after a whole nights sleep</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fragrant and nice like normal cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Even used on my dogs hot spot...healed it and it was ok for him to lick.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say this product is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> That \\&quot;crepe-paper\\&quot; look on my face is GONE, and people are forever telling my these days I look so FRESH!  </li>
            <li> Any skin product must go through vigorous standard procedure of absorption through skin in almost all the ethnic group with successful absorption results in order to get drug approval.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and additives and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my face and hair after reading reviews online.</li>
            <li> , I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product that helps retain moisture in dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Its cheaper, and product absorbs nicely into the skin faster, and I saw further improvements in my skin faster than Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> Great on dry skin-hands, arms, legs.</li>
            <li> Really great cream for dry hands, nails, and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> After I clean them at night, I use this product and it works well.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a natural product made with mostly olive oil.  </li>
            <li> Keeping my skin clean from the inside</li>
            <li> love it  Natural ingredients and magical results.</li>
            <li> I still love the rose hip oil I mentioned earlier and use that during the day.  </li>
            <li> and I started using this because of a person who uses it religiously with the most amazing skin.</li>
            <li> It works great on my dry &amp; cracked heels.</li>
            <li> it worked great on my feet and kept them from getting dry...</li>
            <li> Thanks for having many products available to purchase</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for older,terribly dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> This works really great if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for dry cracked  hands, lips to face.</li>
            <li> Probably great for really really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and beautiful and my eyes look normal again.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the smell is not that pleasant.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give a good review yet because I have not used it much.</li>
            <li> I generally have very good skin and don&#x27;t use any sort of product on my face, but I now use Egyptian Magic if I see I&#x27;m starting to flake or just look</li>
            <li> I ordered EM from Amazon after reading so many positive reviews about the product.  </li>
            <li> I developed a charming case of dermatitis right around my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer,it made me a little lighter wen</li>
            <li> Worked great on my son&#x27;s dry arms and legs!</li>
            <li> Great product, heals dry skin and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li> I thought to myself this product must be special and one that I should try.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS SPECIALLY AROUND MY EYES EVERY NIGHT</li>
            <li> I have yet to see anything special.</li>
            <li> I did not find anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice anything special.  </li>
            <li> I got the set at Costco and it works great on my face and hands, which tend to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my rough feet.  </li>
            <li> but the area was still swollen and bright red (and embarrassing).</li>
            <li> I received this product recently and at first I thought it was great.</li>
            <li> Also great for my rough elbows and under eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I got and its incredibly greasy, there is no scent which that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, and it takes a long time to absorb, I put it on before bed</li>
            <li> Two, let&#x27;s spread this baby more thinly, I&#x27;m not letting you do this to me again.</li>
            <li> Replenishment effect of this product is good, but not obvious to the scar.</li>
            <li> Being a skeptic, I asked Whole Foods store to give me a sample of this \\&quot;magical stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It really absorbs into the skin and does keep my cuticles and feet in better condition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wake up to greasy pillows or a face full of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my skin nice and soft and helps keep my acne under control when I use it.</li>
            <li> the glide and consistency of this stuff is good enough that you could even use it for giving a massage, if you wish.</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched many years for a cream or lotion that really keeps my skin moist and prevents scaliness and fissures during the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have true wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my face at night and my skin feels so good the next morning.</li>
            <li> Honey is a good humectant and in low levels is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Well, I love it so much that I plan on \\&quot;gifting\\</li>
            <li> She seems to like it and wants more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft moisturizer and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Not the real egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> I was really psyched to use this because I wanted a better night moisturizer</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t having much luck with steroid creams and I suggested he try the Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I did not buy this cream through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and you didn&#x27;t notice it as much as before, so a plus on that aspect of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m not one to write reviews... but Egyptian Magic really has been a godsend for my skin, so I figured I should share my experience with others who suffer.</li>
            <li> It is an intense moisturizer &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> Gently rub 2 fingers in Egyptian Magic in circular motion 5-6</li>
            <li> And it is effective for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> good for EVERYTHING skin related...</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face every night after washing for a full two months.  </li>
            <li> The one from Pro Therapy supplies doesn&#x27;t taste sweet at all.</li>
            <li> and when I wake up the next morning my skin looks healthy, bright, smooth and CLEAR!</li>
            <li> it is the best product by far for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> using half jar ，found can make skin more healthy：） good to use as night cream do not use in the day time to oily</li>
            <li> There is less of the good stuff and more water.</li>
            <li> But other then that, its a great lip balm.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is an amazing product, lasts a long time and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read in reviews that this product was good for acne and acne scars but apparently not for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it is on scars, because I do have acne scars and it hasn&#x27;t reduced them much, but it is definitely amazing with dry skin.</li>
            <li> First two days were fine.</li>
            <li> Within one use, my skin was super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably start using EM more as I get older</li>
            <li> and if anything extraordinary happens I&#x27;ll post another review.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t seem to soak into the skin, but more just sat on top of it.     </li>
            <li> The starts out as a cream and you rub it quickly in your hands to make an oil.</li>
            <li> This is super emollient and you shouldn&#x27;t  put it on your face..</li>
            <li> They absorb quickly and you see a difference with your skin after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have issue with mild to severe acne and scars that stays on my face like forever...</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients, and makes your skin so soft and smooth...a great value.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly and without any irritation or burning sensations.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Super super greasy.</li>
            <li> and my skin is glowing like a pregnant woman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, it really does not feel or smell good, did not do anything to my dry hands.</li>
            <li> My skin always feel more supple when I wake up the next morning after an application of the Egyptian magic cream the night before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6) Quickly apply the oil to your forehead and spread it</li>
            <li> Quickly apply the oil to your cheeks in upward movement</li>
            <li> This is an all natural product that&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does heal cuts quickly too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works super on my desert feet.</li>
            <li> Got a super deal at a warehouse store.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes but like so many before it</li>
            <li> So, I had high hopes for Egyptian Magic.     </li>
            <li> Better than the really high end stuff.</li>
            <li> Which is what it did the very first time I bought some.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but after becoming trained as a formulator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for an evening moisturizer and for winter skin; I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge difference from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help keep skin clear and smooth, it also works great as a leave-in hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I bought my very first MC then</li>
            <li> After the first week, my skin already felt smooth and plump, and it cleared up my complexion and my acne scars were no longer visible.</li>
            <li> I am 42 and work out consistently, which means the free radicals speed up, which age you faster.</li>
            <li> :) The ingredients are all natural, just olive oil and all the good things from bees you can possibly get.</li>
            <li> Great for other skin issues too!</li>
            <li> and I am determined to have the clear, smooth complexion a 30 year old should have, and now that this wonderful facial cream is in my life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased I purchased it, not because the product is a new fave of mine</li>
            <li> I have no idea about this product since I noticed my new co-worker who had a vey smooth, rosy skin without a make-up on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, per previous feedback, and it works great for my curly, sometimes frizzy locks.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe they had whipped it into a very creamy oil that would sink into the skin easily, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> it is good for dry skin but use at night because it feels oily when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin that gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> her face will clear up entirely, but until then this stuff helps keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;She is a beautiful woman.</li>
            <li> okay so i been using this for about 2 months straight every night and at first i saw no difference</li>
            <li> Ok hi I was really iffy on this product at first</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR DRY HAIR, TOO.</li>
            <li> My face was very moisturized, and I appreciate that the product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much, and it&#x27;s easy to carry when traveling, too.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and most skin creams and makeup products make me itch or break out.  </li>
            <li> The oily appearance did go away, but my other moisturizer, Korres Wild Rose 24-hour Moisturizer, worked alot ALOT better than Egyptian magic.     </li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> I did not try it on the face because it really looks oil!!</li>
            <li> great thing about this, if you have severely dry skin, is that it really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> It makes the skin on my cheeks super soft and I use it on my dog&#x27;s flea bites too :)</li>
            <li> The best way to review this product is to explain what all it has done for me: clears up my bruises (immediately!); deeply moisturizes my face; cured my dry elbows and knees</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the whole body including the face if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great non-toxic creme that really works on dry and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect dry skin cream that actually heels it and not just temporarily.</li>
            <li> Dry patchy, flakey, itchy red, or even spotty skin but best of all</li>
            <li> Even if I can&#x27;t get it to the bruise site right away I will apply it 2-3 times a day and the bruise goes away quickly .</li>
            <li> will see how it goes long term, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> , I was very fortunate to purchase from a authorized seller, there are so many fakes, you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> So, I am so happy that I didn&#x27;t get ripped off for   a little jar of grease.</li>
            <li> As described this product is a little greasy but works great to apply at night.</li>
            <li> feels great a little getting used to as has a coca butter texture</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be great, but too heavy to use in the mornings for all day wear.</li>
            <li> Well, it is actually amazing for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a great night cream (too heavy to use as a day cream).</li>
            <li> My hands have literally never been this smooth, moisturized, and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - I HIGHLY recommend this for any fellow eczema sufferers out there!</li>
            <li> It is amazing how glowing my skin is the next morning and throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product, I use it on my entire face as a moisturizer, body for eczema, and hair as a styler wax.</li>
            <li> my thoughts, it should be absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use many products on my legs because they are sensitive and react to a lot of lotions.  </li>
            <li> and I found that most natural....</li>
            <li> But when I get up, it can be totally absorbed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Now, it looks bizarre, like a wax mass that&#x27;s even more solid than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> so I think its well worth the price.</li>
            <li> All are 100% natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I say this as someone who was a professional massage therapist for many years)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> My face , for the most part, was finally CLEAR.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about it being a petroleum product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this cream is worth $30.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an anhydrous product and will stay fresh for a year, or so.</li>
            <li> they are gone!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
            <li> This cream is definitely worth using.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It is probably worth $5 instead of $36.</li>
            <li> Having a sensitive skin, most creams don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t like the natural scent of those products, don&#x27;t buy egyptian magic and expect something like lavender, roses and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It gives me a soft glow, smells good and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> So far I love it</li>
            <li> My callus is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it is all absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It may be on the pricey side, but it is so, SO worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely rave about a skin product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its all natural</li>
            <li> if its worth the price</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin produce more oil naturally as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful to my acne.</li>
            <li> I hope you guys find this useful</li>
            <li> was told to be useful</li>
            <li> Too greasy and no cosmetic value at all, there are far better products out there.  </li>
            <li> Worth twice the price, and then some.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nice and is very oily, it did however make my skin feel soft, until I got the cystic acne anyway.</li>
            <li> did find my own personal pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in some home-made lotion bars with beeswax, coconut oil, and cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> ...ESP for the people that didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you have been looking for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy, but the product absorbs pretty quickly into the skin, and it does not sting the eyes.  </li>
            <li> At first try, it may seem too greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves a radiant glow.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy at first, but it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy at first but then does soak in most of the way, however you still have a bit that does get left on the skin, which for some may not be ok.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is like no other!  </li>
            <li> Worked super fast and super well.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the other customers if I didn&#x27;t tell my experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews thinking it&#x27;d be a good scar cream.</li>
            <li> this is a good smelling all purpose moisturizer that I have been using on my face and other areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even good as a body cream , due to the stickiness factor.</li>
            <li> I was excited to read some of the reviews about this cream, but I tried it for 30 days and really didnt see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel right about having opened a product then returning it...</li>
            <li> The price was right on this one</li>
            <li> Got delivery right away and started using it on my legs, feet and forearms.  </li>
            <li> You have to work to find the right amount for your skin</li>
            <li> Even if yours does say the right label.</li>
            <li> and when I do this the bruising is dramatically reduced right away .</li>
            <li> When I was in my teens I just assumed it was the right of passage</li>
            <li> I have psorasis on my right foot</li>
            <li> THEY ARE RIGHT  .  </li>
            <li> You have to remember to rub it between palms before applying and do it right after washing  your face to avoid the greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is not the right color.</li>
            <li> The one on the right howver is what I still paid 4o bucks for.</li>
            <li> it you applied it right before makeup, it&#x27;s almost impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were right.  </li>
            <li> My dear cousin first introduced me to Egyptian Magic because she thought it would clear the acne scars (from poking and prodding) from my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated/</li>
            <li> i bought this for my friend and he likes it very much, and i guess it is useful for him.</li>
            <li> softens my dry skin so well and the softness lasts for days... smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I use the product primarily under the eyes, where the skin tends to dry out the most.</li>
            <li> I also have many more raised black head</li>
            <li> :) Less is more.</li>
            <li> Feels oily at first, but absorbs into my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but this product appears safe and gentle on my skin - no breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product feels greasy for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but then is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes a good lip balm but not worth the price just for that.  </li>
            <li> She claims it helps her with her skin especially on new tattoos</li>
            <li> My best friend actually told me that I looked a little haggard.</li>
            <li> While the price is a bit much, the consistency makes it last long since it spreads nicely once you warm it on your skin.   </li>
            <li> Beeswax is a great sealant but the composition of this particular product is too greasy, if there was less Olive Oil maybe...</li>
            <li> It may be really oily when I put it on at night, but after two nights, my skin became more mosturized and soft and even my friends and family noticed it.</li>
            <li> Recently I got brave enough to start using it on my chest and neck and no breakouts...</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my 17 month old &#x27;s delicate cheeks.</li>
            <li> A lot more even, not dry, and it  has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I came in contact with EM after a huge battle with my skin and being made fun of and even went home early from work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and effective for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub between your fingers before applying, I noticed a big difference in it&#x27;s effectiveness, rather than just applying a glob right to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To my surprise it helped very much.  </li>
            <li> If I consistently rub a small amount of this into my nails and cuticles at night, I have nice nails - strong even.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t do any good, or the next day my face would get super oily.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing but little bit oily.</li>
            <li> The cream was new and originally packed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 big blemishes are almost completely healed over with significantly reduced swelling and tenderness; redness in my formerly rashy spots is diminished and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m finding that pure shea butter (and I mean the real unadulterated stuff from Africa, not some lotion that claims it as an ingredient) absorbs and moisturizes better.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this magic lotion for my very dry and old looking hands.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> At first I was putting it on my face but it seemed like every time I did, I would throw up.</li>
            <li> I recently read a celebrity interview in a well-known beauty / fashion magazine where Egyptian Magic skin cream was mentioned as a</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li> It worths the money!I will buy it more in the future.</li>
            <li> I feel like I look much better without makeup actually.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is DEFINITELY not Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I love this and have gotten several friends hooked too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the face if you have oily skin, BUT it did work pretty well on my hands/cuticles.</li>
            <li> oh and use it as a hot oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li> Love this for all things especially for my grandsons allergy dermatitis.</li>
            <li> And then my coworker pulled Egyptian Magic out of her purse and told me her entire family swear by it.    </li>
            <li> I can only use Bee Magic if I&#x27;m covering my hands and going to bed; otherwise, it ends up all over everything.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The cream is very oily, and it even feels oilier than Vaseline on my face!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> The actual cream looks more like petroleum jelly than cream.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE- if you are allergic to bees</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine article several years ago that many movie stars (Madonna included)swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like I was breaking out.</li>
            <li> You may break out at first.</li>
            <li> Prescription creams did not remotely help as much as egyptian magic did.  </li>
            <li> At first,  i was disapointed with the vaseline feel and greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all perfectly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling extra hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not my first time that i used this product</li>
            <li> If you like it, look at the dates to make sure you are buying a jar from the same date as the sample.</li>
            <li> Last year, my sister&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Egyptian Magic to her and she tried to sell me on how well it worked.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, I got it from Hip Apotheca</li>
            <li> After only 4 days use, 3 or 4 times a day, the redness is already notably better, and it&#x27;s healing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this way it&#x27;s really not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I got the first jar as a gift</li>
            <li> and they are all pronounceable, readable, understandable, and recognizable.</li>
            <li> used as a lip gloss and hair tamer and both work out pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for this winter problem and this works for me, just remember to apply it daily and the skin will not crack, working out doors in the winter dries my the thumbs</li>
            <li> First, it smells like lard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do also like that this item is fragrance free, lasts forever and can go on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> also use this on my kids, since the ingredients are safe and nothing extra is added.  </li>
            <li> not when I first read about it in a health and beauty magazine and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Could see improvement the second day of using Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I most definitely have to stack up on this product.</li>
            <li> It is pretty greasy</li>
            <li> I first read about this product in a celebrity magazine.  </li>
            <li> &quot; More likely someone&#x27;s husband looked at her grocery receipt and got upset by the $30 price tag.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a solid vaseline &amp; too oily to use as a day cream for me</li>
            <li> For this reason, I went back to Costco to get two packs more since I am moving</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me hydrocortisone cream fro it initially but that made it more inflamed and it continued to spread.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m hoping it gets even better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product first at Costco after reading about the cream in an advertisement.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my entire face, but it required a lot of work to emulsify between my hands, and even more to work it into the skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer out there, simple ingredients</li>
            <li> I also put some Egyptian Magic in my hair, just at the tips, and i didn&#x27;t even use a lot of it, only a 1/4 inch circle, and it looked like i didn&#x27;t wash my hair in 2 days.</li>
            <li> At first I thought she&#x27;s born with it</li>
            <li> At first, the product scared me because how greasy it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The problem is that their skin is not properly prepared for Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff and can&#x27;t go a second without it.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered it multiple times.</li>
            <li> And even though it goes on oily at first, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> this stuff truly is magic cant beleive i didnt know about it until i dated an egyptian if i had only known</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face in the morning with anything but hot water....</li>
            <li> Now, I only have to use Egyptian Magic once a day - before bed, I put it on my hands and cover them with cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> When I used it consistently, the scars faded over time, leaving me with clearer skin and a radiant glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I apply, I cover the first digit of my index finger with cream, and then I spread it across my fingertips (from index to pinky.</li>
            <li> Not so magical but only the price tag.</li>
            <li> I just had to go out and buy an acne cleanser for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> (The cream smells funny though)</li>
            <li> It has fixed all the cracks in my fingers and has made my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had purchased Egyptian Magic ages ago.  </li>
            <li> I consistently used it for about a month.</li>
            <li> my first month in</li>
            <li> the first week i wore this i broke out and thought i would never try this cream again.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house wants to use it, I have to hide it!</li>
            <li> And this material has no frightening laboratory chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product whole heartedly!</li>
            <li> Most skin products out there can only help you in one of the affected areas.</li>
            <li> Then my cousin recommended me to try Egyptian Magic as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, the cream didn&#x27;t work well when I use it after I applied my Face Shop acne facewash and toner.</li>
            <li> I cannot praise this product enough, although I do wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be an actual business but more of just an answering service, some marketing and distribution.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Absolute Skin miracle!</li>
            <li> My mother initially bought this and did not like the feeling of this, considering it&#x27;s more of a balm instead of a cream.</li>
            <li> Jackson, SC is so brilliantly hot and sunny in May-August!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this product, I will always use it for all of the above uses because I am attracted to all-natural balms.</li>
            <li> (I bought my Egyptian magic at a big warehouse store that rhythms with</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about one month now and really FEEL as well as SEE a difference!  </li>
            <li> I will not be using anything else for the rest of my life - my skin feels naturally lubricated and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I got my first jar, but I always used it for my feet.  </li>
            <li> It really helps all sorts of skin ailments, I use it a lot!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 27 ;)</li>
            <li> Although it is probably good for your hair, if you plan on going out, it can make it look and feel a bit greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> The best part is getting beautiful skin without all the chemicals and bad stuff in other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like the cream specially for my feet at night, it makes it nice and soft since I have pretty dry feets.  </li>
            <li> but the first ingredient listed on the bottle is always the greatest quantity in the product, so a less oily effect shouldn&#x27;t be expected.</li>
            <li> it is not a typical fluffy, emulsified face cream; it&#x27;s more of a semi-solid mixture of oils that you have to warm up on your fingertips before application.</li>
            <li> Also works great for extra moisturization for my face, hands, and hair on dry winter nights.</li>
            <li> The real EM has helped me tremendously for years with my rosacea and made my acne disappear as well as make my skin look very youthful.</li>
            <li> It really absorbs right in with no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> So, I definitely recommend Egyptian Magic, but only if you have a good enough cleanser!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of the frizzyness without using a flat iron, curling iron, or some heat-appliance for hair</li>
            <li> how incredibly soft ur face feels in the morning after everything is absorbed by your skin!</li>
            <li> I use it as a face and hand cream and comes in handy for burns, rashes and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> I will have to wait for the hype of this product to die down, then I will hopefully get it a fair decent price again.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was super excited and it definitely lived up to its expectations...</li>
            <li> I clean it off completely at night with a mixture of baby shampoo and olive oil...</li>
            <li> we rely on good, natural products like this one that sinks in yet doesn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li> My advice- buy a good bottle of extra virgin olive oil and use it the same way you use this product.  </li>
            <li> the real one above the use by has 0000 on top of the use by date and this one does not</li>
            <li> I honestly believe the makers of this product are taking full advantage of the reputation it had in the past.</li>
            <li> the one on the left is real Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> and since i&#x27;ve started using this balm i haven&#x27;t had a single breakout and my skin looks so bright and fresh in the morning, my pore size has shrunk extensively....</li>
            <li> This product is worth the rather high cost.</li>
            <li> Helped mine quickly and it&#x27;s not excessively greasy like coconut oil is.</li>
            <li> yes, it is greasy, but, once it sets in, that feeling goes away and your skin feels super soft!</li>
            <li> I got this item after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to use this for the rest of my life so long as they make it as is or better.</li>
            <li> I usually use argan oil but when somebody left a jar of Egyptian Magic at my house I used it and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> love that is has a minimal ingredients list and is all natural and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> First of all, my face looked SO oily, my whole face was shining.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly bought this at Whole Foods the first time for $45.  </li>
            <li> She says it works good, she usually hates creams.</li>
            <li> You know, right in time for my high school reunion.  </li>
            <li> This cream is silky smooth and heals up dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I had better luck on my scars, mainly on my hands, one knee, and on my back.</li>
            <li> jar is huge, and I only use a tiny amount on my eyes now, so this jar should last a good while.</li>
            <li> Instantly my skin felt smooth and healthy, and my breakouts and old acne scars began to clear almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I just use it for my face (or little irritations like heat rashes) and it works its magic!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this for my face in the long NY winters!</li>
            <li> I add about two-three drops of Argan Oil to just a small (pea-sized) dollop of Egyptian magic and smooth it all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> (my skin&#x27;s starting to dry out and scars more easily now),</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my skin super soft,</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it for me, and now&lt;br /&gt;no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this</li>
            <li> I love this stuff in the dry winter.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for chapped lips, dry wintered skin, de-frizzer for hair, etc.,</li>
            <li> and I mix he egyptian magic cream and aloe gel together on my skin and that worked so well, neither oil or dry</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to use as a moisturizer for my dry, aging, wrinkly face because Egyptian Magic doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My skin had started to become a little more loose and \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot;, and after a week, I would say it is 80% better!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I found  it was so large</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certainly a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing positive for my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture of the skin on my cheeks was also very bumpy, and completely unrecognizable compared to my normal smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry and this cream helps me so much!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for ten years - I get sun rashes, suffer from acne and have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that has smoothed out my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Really delivers and pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I instantly bought my own jar, and am now waiting to see if it&#x27;ll work as well on scars and bruises -- but really, even if it doesn&#x27;t, the damage control for patches of dry skin makes it well worth the investment.    </li>
            <li> I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me.</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy/tacky at first, but absorbs quickly, leaving skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3 weeks and although my skin doesn&#x27;t show much significant improvement, it is softer and there are no dry spots.</li>
            <li> My face gets so dry in the winter, uneven tone, and very reactive, and it looks great right now.</li>
            <li> This jar is huge and will last forever!</li>
            <li> The results I have already gotten in such a short time is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> :B00JATQVAK Miracle Anti Aging Cream with Natural Moisturizers for Soft and Smooth Skin.</li>
            <li> One jar did last several months, but I didn&#x27;t see any amazing results.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff, and it seems to work</li>
            <li> It really is all purpose.  </li>
            <li> Really greasy.</li>
            <li> I really don’t write product reviews, but I felt the need to share my experience in this situation.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t use a lot of this product, it will leave you very greasy if you do.</li>
            <li> Shipping was lighting fast, 2 days</li>
            <li> I find this cream greasy, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very choosy about my cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like really, the pores on my nose are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Didnt really help with my eczema</li>
            <li> really helps.  </li>
            <li> My scars have lightened up and is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and matches description.</li>
            <li> But I went to Belize and was exposed to severe sand fleas, intense sun in June</li>
            <li> i like buying on amazon because it is cheaper than whole foods.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me at Whole Foods when they ran out of California Baby cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin glowed and my make up wore VERY evenly all day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help as much as I thought with moisture.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> It is something you have to get used, if you apply too much your face can feel very greasy.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is very oily.</li>
            <li> And when I put it on my face in the night, I still feel very oily.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate the simplicity and healing properties.</li>
            <li> and basically it just makes my face really greasy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this product to me and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it really balances everything out.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin supple and ready for makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> My skin is just really dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> and I have had problem skin almost my whole</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy and didn&#x27;t at all moisturizer my or my child&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> and he really like it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really helpful .</li>
            <li> Very oily and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> it has soo much oil makes your face feel greesey</li>
            <li> it has way to much oil its like melted butter on your hands.</li>
            <li> the reason why i returned this product was because it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I assume wholeheartedly I did get the real deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really can do what this does without the royal jelly and propolis.</li>
            <li> I applied this 4 times a day to the burn, and can&#x27;t believe how fast it&#x27;s healing at this</li>
            <li> was in a hurry, so I went to Whole Paycheck to ensure I could carry the real thing home that night</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about this.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this on my face and body, and though many say its a \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot;, they never really say what \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; they&#x27;re seeing??  </li>
            <li> and I purchased this one because I really like what does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Give it some time, it really evens out skin tones.</li>
            <li> every morning both products are working really well</li>
            <li> You So much</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy online</li>
            <li> but you can get it at Whole Foods too.</li>
            <li> When I put on this cream, my face got really oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this from here and from a real seller because I was bewildered with the difference in price.</li>
            <li> really value for money.</li>
            <li> skin cream has really helped.</li>
            <li> Why would you spend this much money for something you could make yourself?  </li>
            <li> but my hands turned very greasy...</li>
            <li> Very greasy - almost like putting Vaseline on my face.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend works at Whole Foods and while browsing the Whole Body section I saw a price tag for a 30.00 jar of skin cream.</li>
            <li> It can appear and feel very oily</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my skin but made my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my sister and she states she loves it so, goal accomplished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really dislike it, but I don&#x27;t expect to buy it again.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hydrate &amp; it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like that feeling for my whole face or body.</li>
            <li> If I go to sleep at night with no moisturizer on, I wake up with a MUCH oilier face than I do if I sleep in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should really try it.</li>
            <li> and I find this moisturizer seems to really correct that.  </li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had the chance to really use it.</li>
            <li> it is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I could see the pores on my nose and nasal folds get clogged with oil and dirt, and I started to develop acne on my chin, so I discontinued the whole face</li>
            <li> and ive been buying it for a wide array of individuals who also love it.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, but you have to use it persistently.</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual about this cream at all..  </li>
            <li> and I wake up with really hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> so I am very conscience of ingredients and this cream seems to be working quite well.  </li>
            <li> I know when someone wants to try it, they will.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this her face has cleared up very noticeably.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> your face will be very sticky and smells.</li>
            <li> It is nice in a light application after my regular moisturizer has set a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell what it does to my skin, besides just keep it moisturize.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing.. Helps psoriasis</li>
            <li> It would have saved us both much heartache and money.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this product was very greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a cream but more of an ointment.</li>
            <li> and is very breathable.</li>
            <li> Ship so fast.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and use it all over.  </li>
            <li> but too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been more careful about getting it around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really saved on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Or use it on days when I am not planning on wearing too much makeup.</li>
            <li> hight humidity make my skin smoot oil water but not oily to much.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very greasy though.</li>
            <li> The change is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The solid Egyptian Magic would  put a smile back on my face</li>
            <li> Apply gentle organic toner using a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> really helps moisturize my hands and body.  </li>
            <li> Not a wart really...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, maybe my skin is already too oily.</li>
            <li> I have to stop short of saying it is a miracle, but it really is a fantastic multi-purpose product, and</li>
            <li> Really oily, not recommended for people combination skin - oily.</li>
            <li> For my whole family..</li>
            <li> this product works very well and has produced a noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Use on whole body-hands,feet,face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face at night and my skin looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> Within 2 hours my face was very oily because of the product.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me, not as much as the cystic acne I got after using this product.</li>
            <li> she said, very well , my feet skin change very well.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and body, really hydrates.  </li>
            <li> , my hair tends to get oily fast after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it the whole time when I was training; for bug bites, scars, calloused feet, to keep acne away, and an after-sun balm because Ft. Leonard Wood, MO/Ft.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind you have to really rub it in no matter where you use it</li>
            <li> hesitate to buy this either online or at Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I apply this all over my face at night and when I wake up, my skin is very hydrated and glows.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is also much cheaper.</li>
            <li> But, it is very oily.</li>
            <li> the next morning, I feel my skin smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful as well</li>
            <li> I bought it on here because I couldn&#x27;t believe how much cheaper it was.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole foods and the girl there</li>
            <li> It pays to buy the real product.</li>
            <li> 6 stars for real EM 0 stars for this knock off product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> How much are you putting on?  </li>
            <li> , that really shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really encases moisture.</li>
            <li> It is very oily and greasy</li>
            <li> so I apply lightly at night only.</li>
            <li> Might be too much for the summertime, but it&#x27;s wonderful during the cold months.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my eyelids were soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> And still, 2 months later, I have still not been able to completely clear my face up again.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a balm, a solid substance that melts immediately upon contact into a clear liquid...nothing creamy about this</li>
            <li> Then I saw it was called Egyptian Magic, Ancient Kamitian Secret Magical Cream.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs and leaves incredible soft skin behind.</li>
            <li> Then I tried to play around with it by using a different facewash &amp; toner for sensitive skin (in this case, USANA Sense Facewash &amp; Toner) and then apply Egyptian Magic oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> Then I tried to play around with it by using a different facewash &amp; toner for sensitive skin (in this case, USANA Sense Facewash &amp; Toner) and then apply Egyptian Magic oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> to the claims that Amazon&#x27;s product is fake...  while it might be so, if you go to Egyptian Magic&#x27;s website, they have a nice explanation of the situation, and they stopped using the word &amp;#34;Kamitian&amp;#34; on the label.  </li>
            <li> This item is good but a bit different than what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I have never dealt with acne (thanks to good genes because my diet sucks).    </li>
            <li> After washing my hair, I take a fair amount (because I have ultra thick hair) of the product, rub it between my hands, then apply  it to my hair.</li>
            <li> but for now it&#x27;s a great general refresher and a total lifesaver for embarrassing, persistent dry skin.</li>
            <li> Took some time because I had to really spread because I didn&#x27;t have much to go from, and with dry skin, sometimes products won&#x27;t spread easily because there is no moisture to slide on.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super glow-y and quenches my skin even during the most dry conditions (such as in the deserts of san diego).</li>
            <li> I love it and use it on super dry skin- especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Must be very old sitting on a hot shelf.</li>
            <li> This creme is so good, especially if you have dry skin, or during those winter months when you need a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> The red scaly spots almost have faded into the fine tone of the normal skin.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way with this, which is great too.  </li>
            <li> i think they must put a little bit of magic in the jar ;-)  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this as a day moisturizer, especially during summer; it might be too rich.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about having moderately stinky hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy even for around the eyes, like so many other creams that make you puffy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this Egyptian Magic based on all the rave reviews on Amazon and on other sites.  </li>
            <li> I have read from other reviewers that they&#x27;ve had some issues with this product (mostly break-outs).  </li>
            <li> It is priced like they know its a heck of a lot better than other brands...</li>
            <li> I have some of the most pitted scars and abrasive skin post 2 cycles of Accutane treatment and after 4 years of ceasing treatment, my skin&#x27;s extreme oiliness and breakouts returned.</li>
            <li> Hope doctors have the knowledge of Egyptian Magic and recommend it to patients instead of other chemicals.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t magically change the skin like some other moisturizer that I have used.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, like many suggest, I took a little bit of the wax and warmed it between my fingers before applying it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge, but good so far.</li>
            <li> $30 bucks is a small price to pay for great skin--and it&#x27;s my face--I&#x27;m only going to get one</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry psoriasis skin and although the root cause of psoriasis is internal, this external cream feels great.  </li>
            <li> Rub the balm in really well and let it sit for a while, I&#x27;ve used it under makeup to give you that vibrant shine desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
            <li> UNLESS you purchase it and LOOK at the contents first, there is no way to know if you will get the good or the poor version.</li>
            <li> , I like it very much, it makes my lips feeling naturally grossed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the fact that it was highly rated plus there were so many people raving about it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and helps keep it straight when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> kind of small for the price...</li>
            <li> So since it was doing such a good job on my hands within a short time I started applying it on my lips and on the skin above the lip.</li>
            <li> I apply about a nice small grape sized dollop, make it an oily lather and massage into my face every night.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, and I react to a lot of products, but not this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I never purchased this product because now I am out $30, and still have a almost full container left.</li>
            <li> and this product works better than all of them - hands down (pun intended).</li>
            <li> Before I started using this oil, my skin was really dry and sun damaged, but overtime, I can see my damage healing and my skin becoming very soft.</li>
            <li> I stirred in a little jasmine essential oil to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The instructions say to take a moderate amount, rub it with your finger in the palm of your other hand till it&#x27;s a smooth oil like consistency then smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> and if you do you will use it so fast that you will have to buy a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even half pleased with this product, it&#x27;s like a 360 in comparison to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing-it has transformed my skin from dry, flaky and patchy to smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product and most of them reassure you that the oils of the product will soak up in your skin even if you have typically oil skin like mine.</li>
            <li> When applying this product less is more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about half a month, the scar of pimple becomes light, and i think if i use longer, it will disappear!</li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian magic as my sole facial moisturizer for about four years now.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see the magic in it and the jar was too big since I only used it for a couple of times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it really is all purpose: from healing cuts or burns in a day to moisturizing freshly saved legs, using after a facial to keep the glow going or even smoothing out frizzies...</li>
            <li> The second I applied Egyption Magic to my jock, instantly, the itching stopped!  </li>
            <li> I use this as a balm for my tattoos, it keeps the colors vibrant and hydrates the skin (this could also be used for tattoo healing).</li>
            <li> He was pretty hesitant at first, but I convinced him to give it a shot, and now two days later it&#x27;s clearing up quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> After using Egyptian Magic for a few days, I found it really helpful.</li>
            <li> The main thing is the product.  </li>
            <li> I do not put cream on my thumbs - just my particular application technique) and rub the fingers of both my hands together.</li>
            <li> Being older, I&#x27;ve noticed changes in my sun damaged skin on arms and chest.  </li>
            <li> Though originally solid, it quickly melted into an oily texture.</li>
            <li> I am now using extra virgin coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, and I would highly recommended this over Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I have always had good clear skin with very few wrinkles (now age 67) and I would love to keep that look for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy feeling, but it&#x27;s all natural and it definitely gets absorbed and helps with maintaining an amazing glow.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me and all natural cant beat that!</li>
            <li> i think the first time i used it i put a little too much because the next day there were still a good amount left on my face</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy, just the occasional zit, but I do touch my face alot more than I should :(</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews</li>
            <li> this is highly oil based.</li>
            <li> It could be a coincidence, but I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would recommend it highly and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product to the reader.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> that wear lots of high heels/boots made for the Army</li>
            <li> I bought it after all those rave reviews about this product, with a high expectation.</li>
            <li> It was by sheer happenstance that I stumbled upon Egyptian Magic at Whole Foods and, after seeing the short list of natural ingredients, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It makes a fantastic lip balm or gloss, it heals uncomfortable dry patches anywhere on your body, it softens cuticles, it makes a great eye cream when my eyes are irritated by allergies.</li>
            <li> it is fine, but I do not really like the texture</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my face and hands and can I say; soft!!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and hydrated!!  </li>
            <li> Dab a little more oil to your nose, mouth and chin</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, with a very mild form of eczema being the cause.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really easy to spread evenly throughout their scalp and hair without accidentally leaving clumps of the product in one area which is what happens to me with other hair grease sometimes.    </li>
            <li> Originally I bought it because my skin was really dry.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, I found a great price here and the shipment was super quick but as far as the product goes - I didn&#x27;t hate it.  </li>
            <li> This product absolutely works and the ingredients are all natural and pronouncable.</li>
            <li> Pat dry with clean towel&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pat dry with a clean towel</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d break out from anything too heavy/greasy</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t buy my normal moisturizer and had to use what I had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, a bit too heavy even as night cream for face, or for hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it has so few ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Combination (Oily t-zone (acne prone) and normal cheeks and chin)  -No skin conditions and No allergies      </li>
            <li> Another reviewer noted that the true cream should say \\&quot;The Ancient KAMITIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\</li>
            <li> The Sweet Bee has a strange smell and doesn&#x27;t heal anything...</li>
            <li> He started using All Purpose Egyptian Magic and in just a few days his hands began to heal.</li>
            <li> Then I found there is a big big big whole in this jar, but the top looks very full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is, until my mom brought by this jar of magical miracle oil a few weekends ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny - a four ounce jar will last you forever since there&#x27;s no water in it</li>
            <li> I just had so many surgeries and has applies this cream at night before bed and in a few days the scars have been fading.</li>
            <li> Just a normal skin cream.</li>
            <li> I bought several  Egyptian Magic Cream for my mother in law and for my friends long time ago from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I normally take a shower 1 hour before bed time and sleep immediately.</li>
            <li> I normally take a shower 1 hour before bed time and sleep immediately.</li>
            <li> well worth packing on your next trip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people who has normal or combination skin.  </li>
            <li> good for dry skin, but dont like the smell, and u need to wait a little bit before u go to bed, coz maybe it will touch ur pillow.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, but is very thick--too thick for day use, but just right for a nightly rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased Egyption Magic from Costco for my dry face.  </li>
            <li> and it actually made my skin more dry.  </li>
            <li> Instant relief for dry skin :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product and recommend especially for problem dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> I had a breast augmentation and since the skin streched i got a scar right in the middle of my chest.</li>
            <li> Knowing the right amount to use will keep you from causing further skin problems and giving yourself additional issues.</li>
            <li> But anyways, after i rubbed it, i patted it on my entire face, and right away i didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and thought it felt really nice for the first few times I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, fantastic product, can be used on burns, cuts, scratches.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very concentrated and rich emulsion of olive oil, beeswax, royal jelly and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that it is made from natural ingredients and it&#x27;s helping my scars fade a little.  </li>
            <li> expensive but very good especially at night</li>
            <li> This my new BBF.</li>
            <li> No glow but a new hurting pimples on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I use it on hands feet face brand new, sealed jar.</li>
            <li> Live this stuff.</li>
            <li> However, this is too greasy for people who live in humid areas.  </li>
            <li> our helps keep my usage of the magic cream down and hence avoids the possibility of using too much and clogging it further.</li>
            <li> but as i kept wearing it, i did notice a difference in blemishes... and helped make my feet not dry which im sure other lotions can do also....</li>
            <li> The real EM reads \\&quot;The Ancient Kamitian&#x27;s Secret Magical Cream\\&quot; besides that there are many other ways to tell it</li>
            <li> Decided to try this product on my super dry feet.  </li>
            <li> At night I wash my face, then rinse; while it is wet, I scoop out a bit of Egyptian Magic onto the palm of my hand and rub my palms together to melt it, then rub my hands together to distribute it all over my hands front and back, then use the palms of my hands to pat this over my face, including eye area (leaving my palms cleaner for reading a book, etc).  </li>
            <li> because to be honest, it looks like low budget petroleum jelly in a gimmicky pacakage.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for day use unless you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t mind being a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li> Super moisturizer for all dry skin.  </li>
            <li> After using Egyptian Magic for a few days the rash stopped itching and within 10 days was gone completely.</li>
            <li> - there is nothing magic about achieving younger looking skin after it has been aged.  </li>
            <li> That must sound terrible but I don&#x27;t mind because the cream is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most expensive skin product I&#x27;ve tried but at $28.00 for a 4 oz jar, it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap either.  </li>
            <li> More importantly I knew it was fake but tried it</li>
            <li> gave me a free sample and asked me only to come back and let her know if it worked.</li>
            <li> I do have a few acne scars - Egyptian Magic did nothing to help them, but it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> Other than that if you have kids, it&#x27;s very useful to have around.</li>
            <li> My skin feel soft afterwards and stays hydrated longer than the high end moisturizers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so very soft and it not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> But not really \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; or anything special.</li>
            <li> As strange as this may sound since this is a moisturizing style product, it can dry your skin so be aware and conscious of that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my husband&#x27;s eczema and it helped his skin considerably!</li>
            <li> when I received this item, I am not sure if this is the authentic one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like any difference at the first couple of minutes, but later it looked like the bumps were not bumps anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll melt if it gets hot enough.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I only put on my feet.</li>
            <li> Most of my other creams last months.</li>
            <li> I am almost 50 years old!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> As a result of a complete lack of moisture in my skin, I started to get wrinkles!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> People have told me that I look really pretty and even younger, but they can&#x27;t point out why</li>
            <li> My skin become soft and return to normal .   </li>
            <li> I saw an actual difference within the first 3 days of applying it on the backs of my arms after a shower.</li>
            <li> I bought my first jar at another store, but after I finish it, I&#x27;ll come to amazon for a second.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with Adovia Mineral Soap and then apply a small amount of this Egyptian Magic Cream to my face.</li>
            <li> First of all the cream&#x27;s label that I received looks different</li>
            <li> So  Far I am a believer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar and at first it seemed kings of greasy</li>
            <li> This is their big \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to clearing up your skin, and it makes intuitive sense at first, and it did to me too.</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive products such as La Mer, and I think it works better on me than La Mer.</li>
            <li> I first used it for a mysterious itching, spreading rash</li>
            <li> since then we&#x27;ve used it for everything: facial moisturizer, hair oil, for lips and nails and most recently to treat a 2nd degree burn.</li>
            <li> But i slept with it the first night, and when i woke up the next morning, my face had a matte smoothness, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I usually try to put this on way before I go to bed to give it more time to incorporate into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe my first jar lasted just under a year, and I used the product once daily (after my morning shower).</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it is small amounts on elbows and my face.</li>
            <li> In the morning I can tell the moisture in my skin is higher than if I had used a water based moisturizer only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the first two that I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s another product that does the same with the same ingredient I&#x27;m thinking of trying, I give one star because it&#x27;s NOT the original.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> It also works well as a healing balm for tattoos (unscented, natural, no parabens, no mineral oil, no lanolin-&gt;bad for tattoos!), and I have three of them.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A light amount also smoothes down frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and has an odd, earthy, but not unpleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my face the way other people claim, but it can be nice to slather it on your feet or hands and let it sit for a few hours to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use such a natural product, but now I just want my money back!</li>
            <li> Honestly it seems to just be an olive oil solid with very little else added.</li>
            <li> I try to live as \\&quot;cleanly\\&quot; as I can by using natural, organic products.</li>
            <li> it makes the skin smooth but haven&#x27;t used long enough to know the longevity of the product&#x27;s effects.</li>
            <li> Some people said this one is useful for scar and dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where to buy: Costco offers it, Wholefoods, Riteaide, local grocery store, Trader joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage:  Keep away from hot temperature and away from sunlight.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it really is moisture magic.</li>
            <li> daughter has very sensitive skin , but this cream is 100 % natural and does not have alcohol or perfumes so it does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It does help with fine lines a little.  </li>
            <li> They would be oily on top and rough and dry under the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in 2010 and I still have more than half the jar left.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin, I can see the benefits, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, and have been using this cream for just a few weeks, and I LOVE it already!</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting this oil absorbed by my skin--it would just sit on top of my face for half an hour.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that&#x27;s filled with chemicals and has a strong enough smell to fill a room, go to Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  </li>
            <li> I buy the large one and use it on my face and body, and carry the smaller one around in my bag for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure and simple.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old gets cracked and dry skin between his toes and this stuff clears it right up.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little work to soften it up into an oil and it does not spread smoothly over my skin without a LOT of work.  </li>
            <li> A very thin layer, massaged into my face at night, and I&#x27;m good as new in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I use pure honey and a microfiber cloth to cleanse, Egyptian Magic and Moroccan Argan oil to moisturize, coffee grounds to exfoliate and Aztec Secret [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, the texture and application process is a little weird.</li>
            <li> I hardly see any magical part of it.</li>
            <li> Once you start using Egyptian Magic, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I washed my face and decided to try using it only on the spots where my skin normally gets super dry instead of all over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other claims and uses of Egyptian magic, but I  know I  would not survive the dry air of winter or the allergy season without it.</li>
            <li> But just a little dollop of Egyptian Magic in freshly shampooed and wet hair brings back the soft curls I used to have.  </li>
            <li> a few years ago one of my toe joints dropped causing a huge callus on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> My acne scars had also began to clear up already</li>
            <li> The next morning, I woke up to find my dermatitis flaking off and whole, clear skin beneath.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear-</li>
            <li> Your skin will clear after using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s helping to clear her acne</li>
            <li> wow, my local Whole Foods store recommended as a Staff Pick....</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, I find that it helps clear up breakouts and any cuts..  </li>
            <li> The one I switched to was Clean and Clear Deep cream cleanser) and it cleared up the dry spots and blemishes overnight by about 40%.</li>
            <li> In the morning my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is all natural and makes your skin just glow.</li>
            <li> it looks elastic and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> AM AN \\&quot;OLD FLORIDA GAL\\&quot;, SO LOTS OF SUN DAMAGE ON MY HANDS</li>
            <li> , they were soft to the touch, like velvet.</li>
            <li> Like wow.  </li>
            <li> My hands are frequently chapped from frequent washing while cooking, and EM</li>
            <li> I have very senstive, blemish-prone facial skin which has been suffering from rashiness since the beginning of the summer.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> So, for anyone who might be sensitive to scents, beware.</li>
            <li> This product does so much, I use it as a lip balm, hand/cuticle cream, night cream, and I have even used it on my hair for the fly-aways &amp; for slicking back strays for a sleek pony tail.</li>
            <li> When I would be driving and my hands were on the steering wheel, I could see how the skin would wrinkle and just looked old.</li>
            <li> I also have celiacs and A LOT of beauty products have gluten in them which is what i&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
            <li> A couple days before this product arrived I developed a sebaceous cyst in my cheek the size of a golf ball.</li>
            <li> People started telling me how young I look.</li>
            <li> So for delicate skin that you don&#x27;t want to pull on, say, around the eyes, the E.M. might be a better choice.  </li>
            <li> when I was 18 or 19 years old.  </li>
            <li> but I never have gotten that far with it.  </li>
            <li> i get a rash frequently on my ring finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and had no wrinkles before this product.</li>
            <li> 21 years old with winkles??</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old</li>
            <li> But if I coukd, I would tell you that this stuff fixed them.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with severe acne all through HS and into my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> SO, if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> now looks glossier and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> Their hair looks shiny and feels really soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using it on her because it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I applied this religiously for 2 weeks straight at night after a shower, and I&#x27;m not kidding...</li>
            <li> Save yourself some time and get it straight from the site or your local Costco might carry it.</li>
            <li> Enough that I decided to splurge and buy it for myself without knowing a whole lot about it.  </li>
            <li> I will not try this product again and stick to shea butter and home-made honey masks for natural skin care, thank-you-very-much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Costco and was attracted by natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend who doesn&#x27;t use any type of body products (a straight soap and razor type - mechanic) actually swears by this cream as a healer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works well so far.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so far, after the shower is when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Over all skin is soft as they claim.</li>
            <li> They sell the same product at Costco and Whole Foods so save yourself the pain of having to determine it&#x27;s authenticity by purchasing it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and sensitive and this moisturizer does not cause any redness nor breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has a natural scent to almost no scent at all.</li>
            <li> if you compare this to the one in whole foods, even the packing is slightly different.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it contains just olive oil and bee products, but together they seem to be miraculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any scent or taste.</li>
            <li> WOW, I cannot begin to say how much this 34 year old scar has begun to diminish after only three days.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft and glow.</li>
            <li> Based on what I have used so far.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin with eczema and thought I&#x27;d try this since it&#x27;s suppose to be anti-inflammatory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how they naturally protect hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a few weeks of using it I noticed some kind of warts around my eyes where I have used Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night and you wake up to baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural just honey, olive oil, bee propolis, royal jelly, and beeswax.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and almost glowing.</li>
            <li> Some symptoms disappeard though my skin didn&#x27;t come to a complete recovery.</li>
            <li> I have combination and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have watched my wife use it over nearly 2 months</li>
            <li> It feels vey greasy and smells like old cooking oil.</li>
            <li> Have paid mucho much bucks for multiple skin creams, but NOTHING</li>
            <li> when you really need extra healing, this is the product to try.</li>
            <li> it is all natural...</li>
            <li> It has not made me look 30 years old</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed (a couple hours before if I can) and when I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> I worried it would make my pillowcase and sheets greasy, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a problem.</li>
            <li> I suffer from allergies  and have particularly sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy texture that you think will feel heavy on the face</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and radiant now...</li>
            <li> Both the smell and the texture are DIFFERENT from the real one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, professionally I am in pharmaceutical industry.</li>
            <li> All natural product.</li>
            <li> Is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this cream around for years and just recently purchased it at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle enough to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> This product is very oily and did not absorb into my skin well, even when I used the littlest amount I possibly could to cover my face.</li>
            <li> As far as I concerned this is just a greasy cream which does nothing to your skin.</li>
            <li> this is not so much a CREAM as it is an OINTMENT which is both greasy and tacky at the same time.</li>
            <li> : natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I use it daily for eczema and it really helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely not the real product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had soft skin</li>
            <li> but this makes those tougher places feel soft too like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> When I tell people my age they never believe me and say I look like I am in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> But my skin had been this strange combination of sensitive/dry/flaky/pimply, so I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> Make my skin is sooo soft , I also use it in my hair in the L.O.C treatment</li>
            <li> My face was really oily and shiny, and when I woke up the next morning I felt like I needed to take a shower because the product got on my hair overnight and made that oily looking as well.    </li>
            <li> However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have noticed such a difference that it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product egyptian magic is a total waste of money...</li>
            <li> I like it for the most part, but sometimes a few red dots appear ion my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably softer and the stretch marks are slowly and surely fading.</li>
            <li> This is an all-natural, thick cream that feels more like an oil when rubbed with your hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and tacky, that with enough   of it, I could possibly give a car a good lube job.   </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that has also been affected by the medications I&#x27;m on (stay healthy, people...</li>
            <li> : At night, I use a wet finger to (very lightly) circle around the jar for 2-3 times, blend the product with my other moisturizer, apply while concentrating on my cheeks</li>
            <li> This is the first such product that really does work to lubricate, moisten, and even heal dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin usually looks totally dry and lifeless, but thanks to Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> This sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my dry winter hands more than any other product!  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly and does not feel heavy like other creams on the face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, and it&#x27;s easy to fill a small sample jar for your purse; I wouldn&#x27;t put it in a pocket</li>
            <li> This one is shiny and greasy and because of prime when it got here first I made the mistake of using it and my skin is all dry and scaly despite all the grease.</li>
            <li> I tried other cheap product but it only cause breakages on my skin.</li>
            <li> Once the mask is completely dry, rinse it off with hot water (this may take a minute or so, depending on the thickness of the mask)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I first discovered that this cured my eczema, I&#x27;ve been using it for every itch and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> A little greasy at first but absorbs in fast.</li>
            <li> Other folks are saying that if you put it on before bedtime, it&#x27;s all absorbed overnight...</li>
            <li> But because of an excited recommendation from a friend, I bought the cream and used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to make the switch to natural products and this was one of my first big steps.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry flaky skin most of my adult life</li>
            <li> It is very pricey, but I only go through about a jar a year as it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize the dry skin and relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> Serious magic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it because they claim to have the same ingredients as Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with this product and preach the gospel of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> i can actually wear my rings now on a regular basis, thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it on a steady bases, it&#x27;s for a lot of different things.</li>
            <li> It can be pretty nice for cold feet or soar neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really particular about scented products, and this product does not have a lasting odor.  </li>
            <li> I like natural skin care and have normal skin with clogged pores and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> The one from the official website tasted a little sweet when I used on my lips.</li>
            <li> But, it matches the natural lipids in the skin so well, it literally soaks right in and leaves such smooth, soft, and healed skin behind.  </li>
            <li> This is a 4-star review only because of the fairly high price and the fact that I do find it leaves your skin a bit too oily in appearance, even after letting it sink in.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a high quality facial product for the price.  </li>
            <li> I highly doubt if this product has done any that sort of study (even if it doesn&#x27;t need a prescription, they have to do some basic testing or study).</li>
            <li> There is very little smell to it and again, nothing else has worked for me to help smooth my lines.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff, love how it melts, in your hands, then apply to skin, HOWEVER, my skin is now all dried out, scaly and dry, WTH?</li>
            <li> I used this product for about six months on my face, which for a 35 yr old is pretty dry and gets very occasional adult acne, as well as my arms, as I suffer from keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> He has many very dark raised spots (not cancerous, thank you), and the big one under his eye is smaller now.  </li>
            <li> It was VERY greasy and took a long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> when I apply it, that part of my skin really starts to glow a bit for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time &amp; money buying it on amazon or ebay as there are too many fakes around + incorrect guides as well on how to distinguish between real and fake.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to buy the cream, but I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> so I bought directly from the company,but I experienced same disappointing result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now have zits all over my usually blemish free face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t totally   fall for the hype, and waste money on the standard   jar.   </li>
            <li> , if u have normal skin with no problem, i recommend getting just a regular moisturize</li>
            <li> I have issues with dry skin during certain times of the year.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of acne for many years now - since I started high school - I&#x27;ve tried a number of products and 90% of them have this in common: they dry you out.</li>
            <li> It does go on a little creamy/greasy feeling but it absorbs quickly (within 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> but if you rub it in your hands a little longer it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> He gets chapped cheeks due to teething and this chilly winter, this stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Once thing u all need to do is, since this balm is all purpose and u&#x27;ll be using it on different parts of ur body, make sure u use a small spatula, spoon or anything to take out the balm since it is an open jar, and u don&#x27;t wanna spoil the natural contents of it by putting germs and bacteria in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, very solid and hard in the jar.  </li>
            <li> I used it only as a night cream since it tends to be an extremely oily product (I have super oily skin)</li>
            <li> As a new user to the product will re-post update at a later date.</li>
            <li> I put it on pretty heavy right before bed (after washing my makeup off) and when I wake up in the morning I just rinse my face with water and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> So, if you are experiencing chronic dry skin with patches, itchiness and flakiness, I HIGHLY recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li> concerned it would be too much even for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Not a   horrible smell, but not pleasant either.  </li>
            <li> This cream is a real savior in healing his dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> Definitely improved my skin quality and this stuff really does last forever.</li>
            <li> It also makes the red left after a pimple go away so much faster.  </li>
            <li> One thing this product did work well on was my 9 year old daughter, her skin is sensitive and gets the occasional rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this jar will last me at least 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> When  you open them; the real one has almost a matte finish to it and is SOLID.</li>
            <li> I have been battling really severe eczema for my entire life, and I have tried COUNTLESS products/lotions/supplements/etc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it many times and it moisturizes without irritating sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also shared my difficult trials with skin problems towards the end of the review if you want to read my whole experience .  :)</li>
            <li> I see a change in an old scar, and especially in one area that looked like an old pimple that never healed.  </li>
            <li> It looks thick and yucky, like vaseline or aquaphor, but goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft the next day.</li>
            <li> However, when I use it as a night cream I notice that my skin is very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use as little as possible as it can get a little greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Works well for all the things mentioned in list above  - Lasts a LONG time  - 6 natural ingredients   - Not water based, so consistency doesn&#x27;t change much    </li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is aware that there are fake products out there, even though they may list the same ingredients they may not be the quality you&#x27;re hoping for.</li>
            <li> Then overnight, I saw a major difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> Then overnight, I saw a major difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> what I bought WAS fake, hey, bring it on because it&#x27;s sure working for us!</li>
            <li> The lotions recommended by dermatologists for my chronic dry skin: cethaphil, aveeno, luberiderm, vaseline, made my skin super dry and itchy!</li>
            <li> Anything with a lot of chemicals makes it even more dry and will give me small rashes.</li>
            <li> So I used this as a night/sleep cover for the last step of the daily skin care process, and it would protect me from the dryness till the next morning, and in the meantime to ensure the regular lotion be absorbed</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li> She says it removes many of the fine facial lines that other products fail to erase.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest applying a very small amount to DAMP skin so that the product is absorbed and assimilated in the skin much faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely heavy and kind of gross feeling...but give it a half hour</li>
            <li> For me, so far, the results are temporary and I see no difference overall (other than for the first 10 or 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up a area in my smile line that was breaking out with  Little pimples this winter.</li>
            <li> I put little sock on afterwards because it is a bit tacky but worth it.</li>
            <li> I must say I was quite skeptical about this product but after using it for more than I month, my face feels vibrant and looks so hydrated.</li>
            <li> cream is very thick, more along the lines of a balm, and takes some emulsifying to apply.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use the whole container, but in order to mask the &amp;#34;lard&amp;#34; smell I need to use my regular moisturizer over it, which also helps a little bit with absorbing the &amp;#34;Egyptian Magic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I usually come back about 15 minutes after I apply it and smooth my hands over my face once again just to help the remaining greasiness absorb.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my lips (day &amp; night), a tiny bit on unruly hair frizz, and even on minor scrapes (no broken skin).</li>
            <li> With the exception of one or two occasional pimples, my skin is clear...</li>
            <li> I looked like I&#x27;d abruptly developed a red, puffy goatee.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is also extremely sensitive to creams and facial washes.</li>
            <li> But I think I would only use it in someday but not everyday because it is too oil...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months now and have barely made a dent.</li>
            <li> ( Not much on the market you can really say that about.)    </li>
            <li> I use it at night and by morning my skin is soft, younger looking and looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> it was completely gone the next morning.</li>
            <li> It works terrific keeping your skin soft protecting it against the elements.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried my old facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Next time I will order directly from the website.  </li>
            <li> But for me, I&#x27;m sticking with my extra virgin coconut oil to moisturize my face and body naturally.</li>
            <li> When you figure out how much to use there is no greasiness as it sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, it&#x27;s all the rage in Paris and</li>
            <li> I put this on my lips at every night as well, and my lips gets so soft in the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local natural food store.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped washing my face completely</li>
            <li> This is my personal usage review that may help individuals with sensitive + acne +</li>
            <li> I also use it on my chest, as I have a lot of sun damage in that area; the deep set lines that I thought would never go away have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 38 years young male</li>
            <li> All the years purchasing from Amazon this is the second time I didn&#x27;t received what I have ordered but the first time writing in am really not please with this.</li>
            <li> And the words are kind of vague.</li>
            <li> Ancient EGYPTIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It breaks my face out like crazy but it is good for the rest of my body</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t warm it up and allow it to liquefy a bit, it can be difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little less greasy than Vaseline but absorbs better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for my cracked heels (due to excessive sandal and flip flop wear in the summer) but not good for the face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to smooth my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I really like what it&#x27;s done for my skin, especially during the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to put it on delicate skin for fear of breaking out, so I mostly just used it on my hands and forearms and dry leg spots for a while.</li>
            <li> If your skin is looking dry, slather this stuff on, but only at night because it is VERY shiny.</li>
            <li> I also have a mild case of eczema so for a while, I was using Sarna with a few drops of Jojoba oil mixed together for my face and hands.</li>
            <li> Right now in the dead of winter</li>
            <li> I tired a little bit at first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to spread on face unless you rub it in your fingers and let your body heat warm it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tiny red dots on the back of my arms since I was in junior high.</li>
            <li> Because the main ingredient is olive oil which has long been a standard product used in beauty products for centuries.  </li>
            <li> I was drawn to Egyption Magic because of its natural ingredients, however, it did not work for me because it broke my face out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If my face looks extremely shiny or looks greasy, I have used too much.</li>
            <li> My face looks refreshed no matter how hot and muggy the weather is, not getting enough sleep or  whatever challenging circumstances arise.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of moisturizing or aiding my skin in any other way</li>
            <li> If she doesn&#x27;t shower it off completely with soap, it leaves a brown scum &amp; brown bubbles in the hot tub!</li>
            <li> And I realize the cream is not like the real one I bought from other place.</li>
            <li> My acne is even doing a little better with a few days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> It is more firm in the jar than Medicine Mama&#x27;s, so you have to rub it between your hands a little longer before applying.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great to protect the skin from the cold, but definitely not to heal dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am curious about how the real product should work, but I will definitely never buy it again, ever.</li>
            <li> In search of a moisture that did not dry my skin</li>
            <li> It is 5 times more pricey than Aquaphor ointment, but besides the worse smell, it does similar job.</li>
            <li> all young people must go through, but I became more skeptical of this as the acne continued into my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using this on my face I have ditched all the expensive facial moisturizers and I&#x27;m loving my complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, but there is a lot of false hype because beauty gurus on YouTube were paid to sell it to the public before the law about sharing if they were paid was enacted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many false creams out there that try to advertise as the same company so beware.</li>
            <li> It smealls a little funny</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this stuff wasn&#x27;t as great as I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I generally use a home-crafted almond oil blend as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of products from American products like Clinique, Paula&#x27;s Choice to Foreign Brands like Face Shop (Korea), AquaMoist (Japan) that are reasonable in price, but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I like that it is ALL NATURAL and the jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> On the third day, I had spots on both cheeks and chin (itchy red pimples and dry flakey cheeks mainly around those itchy pimples).  </li>
            <li> For ages I&#x27;ve been using ph5 Eucerin (Beiersdorf) cream for sensitive skin which has been, and still is, my long time favourite day &amp; night cream.</li>
            <li> ( I live in a very dry area and I tried everything, but nothing worked ).</li>
            <li> At first I was using it during the day, but it was just a little too heavy for daytime use, especially during hot, August days.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, VERY sensitive skin and have tried hundreds of products over the years.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of weird claims about this cream, and the inventor is one odd duck (see New York Times), but this is a very good, no fuss, no funny ingredient, no funny smell skin treatment.   </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and the results makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My kids have eczema and this did nothing for that other than as a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got no particular healing effects -- it doesn&#x27;t work any better than vaseline or other generic heavy oils.  </li>
            <li> It smells bad and it&#x27;s pretty oily, it&#x27;s ok for the body but not for the face, which is what I wanted to use it for.</li>
            <li> I only write review if I am extremely happy or disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> So far, it cure my dry skin, and it&#x27;s my biggest problem.</li>
            <li> This has completely CURED my dry cracked heels and elbows.  </li>
            <li> Time went on...5 minutes, 10 minutes, half an hour, and still my face looked really oily.</li>
            <li> In the first jar I had the cream was white and fluffy.</li>
            <li> already the pink and purple discoloration has almost completely faded!</li>
            <li> and my once soft hair is now coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li> In a pinch, I rub a little together in my my palms and use it to smooth my hair and add a little shine.</li>
            <li> It felt super heavy on my skin even though I hadn&#x27;t used much, like a really thick foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this year round,  Whenever my face is feeling particularly dry, I use this all over my face right before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> My skin usually gets super dry when traveling and rubbing a dab of the cream into my cuticles and palms keeps them from cracking.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days the red, bumpy areas on my cheeks were perfectly smooth and hydrated - no more bumps!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and a tub lasts a long while so definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is finding good products to use to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is good, The smell is really bad</li>
            <li> So get a very thin layer on your fingers and apply that to your skin and go back for more if necessary, a little bit over a pea size should be enough for your face (that might even be too much).</li>
            <li> First off it has very few ingredients in it</li>
            <li> As a face cream, it IS super thick &amp; gloppy; a teeny bit warmed in your hands goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 1 night of applying this product the cyst was almost completely healed (along with all the other tiny blemishes along my jaw line).</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Philosophy moisturizer (which isn&#x27;t completely moisturizing enough for winter months) fro m Sephora that I&#x27;ve been using for a year, but you can use it with any other lighter moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> My dry patches was reduced significantly, no new acne developed and my skin looked younger in years.  </li>
            <li> My dry patches was reduced significantly, no new acne developed and my skin looked younger in years.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very good, but not disturbing.</li>
            <li> and I have had exactly the same results with other less costly products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, A little really does go a very long way, even with using this product daily, I doubt I could get though it in 6 months if only using on my face.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has become much softer and I&#x27;ve had healing on the dry patches that have previously resisted everything I&#x27;ve thrown at them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but for me this really didn&#x27;t \\&quot;soak into\\</li>
            <li> this is an olive oil based product with beeswax, and some royal jelly, honey and other somewhat natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> I found that it hydrates in ways completely unlike any other skin product...</li>
            <li> Seems helping my girl&#x27;s hair damage due to frequent swims.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really soak up even if I used a small amount, and it left me with some white-heads and caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> It now clears up fast, and usually goes away for the rest of the year till the next winter season.&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall as long as ur not purchasing it over 35bucks in total, you havent been screwed over with.  </li>
            <li> buy it today and a jar will last a long time (unless you use daily like me)</li>
            <li> THIS TREATMENT IS VERY INTENSE, ONLY TAKES A VERY SMALL \\&quot;DAB TO DO IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be returning to the whole face application, but I will be using it to treat dry trouble spots from now.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy like vaseline but still moisturizing enough for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But you can choose to use less on your skin - I have my way of using it to my absolute advantage without it staying on my face for two hours like an oily mask - which is what happens if you use it like any other regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from Whole Foods but didn&#x27;t want to make a trip just for this.</li>
            <li> Will see when the next flare up occurs but, for now, I do consider this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; although the ingredients have long been proven to have medicinal properties (yes, the \\&quot;love\\&quot; ingredient included).</li>
            <li> So, $30 jar can last a long time.</li>
            <li> So while it is pricey, it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long story short-</li>
            <li> the only thing i can say is that it works as long as you have it and use it wen</li>
            <li> jar should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> For a person with normal skin, no acne, blemishes, uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I like it, and generally I do not like things of this sort.</li>
            <li> Even though I had pretty thick socks on.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this stuff would clog my pores because it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> And when I open the jar, it smells totally different from my last bottle, or you can say this bottle has not smell at all, which is ridiculous compare to the sesame oil smell of the real one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very sensitive, very dry skin due to illiness.  </li>
            <li> which is palmer cocoa butter, it smells very sweet and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit greasy due to the olive oil but it absorbs fast enough.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick like a chapstick but quickly melts when rubbed in between fingers.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I have radiation on my face and it left my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I  live in a  dry climate, and just a little dab of this covers my entire face.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried once I received the jar simply because at first look it appears to be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> really doesnt do anything , its greasy too, used for over a month and did nothing for scars or dark spots , not worth the money or time</li>
            <li> It does not even do the basic work of moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream turned my extra dry skin from sand paper to baby soft in less than one week.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products which would excessively dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific lip and dry skin balm.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li> It definitely keeps dry skin away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m probably only going to use this stuff at night now, because my skin gets oily AND DRY if I use it during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this on dry feet (cover with socks to prevent falls), and recent scars to promote healing.</li>
            <li> My skin has a tendency to be dry, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry itchy skin on my legs, and clogged follicles, since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> , I even use it on my English Bulldog&#x27;s nose which tends to get dry....</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone who has dry skin or is dealing with a dry skin related problem.</li>
            <li> and they turned all itchy dry and red</li>
            <li> I have a dry patch on my back</li>
            <li> Especially for dry lips.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my chest has chronic problems from sun damage, including breakouts and sore, dry patches similar to contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side and the moisturizing effects last all day.  </li>
            <li> But overall, for those blustery winter days, I apply this to my cheeks nose and lips to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and eczema, and this is a terrific moisturizer for my face as well as the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> (a few minutes later) it keeps my skin quite soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I am battling dry skin, and if feels smothered underneath a super thin layer of this product, and it&#x27;s just left greasy,</li>
            <li> None of the natural cures or masks were working either -- and the steady irritation of moisturizers was actually making the rash worse.    </li>
            <li> It also makes a fantastic lip balm (just scoop a small amount into a little empty pot).</li>
            <li> It helped lighten a few darks spots, and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> but it had zero effect, positive or negative.    </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and only break out once a month around my period, but when I do, I always get one (sometimes two) very large cystic bumps on my chin (sometimes other parts of my t-zone but chin mostly) and not only are these painful, they are embarrassing and take a couple of weeks to go away!</li>
            <li> My 2yr old son has a very dry skin and none of the other creams work well including Vaseline, Aquaphor etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hell the stuff did to my face, but it just gets worse and worse no matter how many times I wash (with my normal cleanser, Dermalogica).</li>
            <li> none that I&#x27;ve tried actually keep my skin from being dry for long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, has a very faint beeswax scent (no added fragrance), and seems to heal chapped skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to use this about 15 - 20 years ago and it was MUCH better back then - and MUCH less expensive.</li>
            <li> It was only then I went back to read and comprehend all the other things that it can do</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it is pretty thick and leaves your face shiny!</li>
            <li> I use it for a night moisturizer and have been amazed at the results to my skin (normally very dry, especially in winter).  </li>
            <li> My scaring was very minimal, compared to others, who had similar surgeries, I had 6, on my left hand.</li>
            <li> The product only works when I apply it  to my hair while it is still wet/toweled dry; if I apply it when my hair is dry then it just makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> a hard to find at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Is this monkey see, monkey do?</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to penetrate..</li>
            <li> I find that it helps heal faster, and has worked wonders on minor burns as well.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so long now.</li>
            <li> I continued to apply for another few days - the blemish completely disappeared, leaving no scar whatsoever.</li>
            <li> For a long time I heard a lot of hype about this &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Use a a pea sized amount and play with the amount, a pea sized amount will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I apply to my skin at night so that it has a long duration of time to sink it.</li>
            <li> So far after a few weeks I can see the results.</li>
            <li> the next morning it had already closed the wound and began to become smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive but lasts at least 6mo if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> Definitely not soft or moisturized as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> We use it on all cuts, scrapes and minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I want this one a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time too.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Elidel may cause cancer for long term use, and Hydrocortisone discolors skin.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> As long as directions are followed</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Having used a jug last winter, I decide to continue on it this year because I failed to find a good replacement after repeated browsing online and trying in-store (these actions are actually exhausting and</li>
            <li> It is a little rich and heavy for a regular face moisturizer for me (my skin is normal although it&#x27;s a little dry in the winter), although from time to time if my face is feeling tight I will dab on a little at night.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I only took half the jar and left remains at home.</li>
            <li> I had a slight problem with eczema on the 2 corners of my upper lip, and in the inner corner of my eye brows.  </li>
            <li> have a complicated skin problem where I break out in acne, but I have certain areas on my cheek that is very sensitive, patchy and dry.</li>
            <li> i also have a feeling its reducing my small newly form acne, but thats just me.</li>
            <li> Put it on be 4 bed and ur sick feel nice</li>
            <li> It only takes a very little amount, so a 2oz jar will last a long, long time (I know the price is intimidating, but you&#x27;ll really only need to buy this cream once a year).  </li>
            <li> This product is ok, but for the price tag there are other less expensive products that yield the same result for me.</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase the other one next time.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps reduce acne (zits, milia-like acne, and any other pimples).</li>
            <li> The other day I actually had a man in his 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> During the day, to prevent shine, I circle my finger only once around the jar, then blend with the other moisturizer before applying.    </li>
            <li> I will not buy this again due to the price since my results were no different than if I had used the cheaper products that I already had.</li>
            <li> This cream is yellow and a little solid and feels oily.</li>
            <li> The next day I looked to find that my forehead was COVERED in little bumps, similar to what I&#x27;ve seen my friends describe as a break out.</li>
            <li> I used this on multiple skin irritations and extreme dryness, and even tried it on areas of eczema.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hard in winter, and kind of hard to dig out even a little piece.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this cream for very long.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin baby soft, but not very effective in calming my acne and dry patches (Eczema).  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin baby soft, but not very effective in calming my acne and dry patches (Eczema).  </li>
            <li> It also has an interesting smell its nothing bad just different.</li>
            <li> I still get it on my upper lip in my mustache, but it&#x27;s not as bad, and the egyptian magic always helps.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my face overnight in the winter, as my skin tends to get dry, and this moisturizes well without making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> I would say that I have combination skin...greasier in some spots, dry in others.  </li>
            <li> The greasy spots don&#x27;t get greasy during the day and the dry spots don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I no longer have that overly dry with problem oil areas anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my lips, nails and cuticles, hands, dry areas on my face, elbows,feet, and sometimes as a hair product.  </li>
            <li> It works for dry skin, pimples,Eczema.  </li>
            <li> I have also been applying to my lips at night and they are no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> I put the cream on and then wear cotton gloves to bed to heal dry, chapped hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I also use the cream on my face and it cures dry skin remarkedly well.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to work for people with dry and acne-prone skin.</li>

            <li> My husband has dry skin on his face and forehead.  </li>

            <li> I have dry skin..</li>
            <li> the driest of the dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body including my feet which are always dry from wearing sandals a lot.  </li>
            <li> Even you have dry skin, I don&#x27;t push you to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Tried this for treating my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I had really dry heels,</li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin from using acne products and also has helped my eczema.</li>
            <li> The main complaint I&#x27;m reading from people here is the consistency and the smell.  </li>
            <li> am only 24, but I have a few stretch marks on my inner thigh...</li>
            <li> This is definitely hydrating and thick, I eventually had to add a vitamin E serum into my routine to completely hydrate -</li>
            <li> This did not live up to the description.</li>
            <li> May be a little of your normal price range but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> so instead I bought about three jars and started plopping them all over the stitches every single day for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single pimple since using this</li>
            <li> The font type and placement are different and colors of print are not right.</li>
            <li> Super greasy, my face broke out very bad, I used it on my body instead, still nothing special, don&#x27;t recomend it</li>
            <li> I use it for almost everything; My underarms were getting dark becoz of shaving, so i started putting this balm only at night and it unimaginable to see that the color of my underarms now matches the arm</li>
            <li> (And the instructions on the back abruptly swoop into crunchy-granola mysticism, but the product IS called \\&quot;Egyptian Magic\\&quot;, so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.)  </li>
            <li> I used it for a day and realized that all that dipping my fingers in over and over was not a good thing, so I transferred a small bit into another tub and put the original package into the fridge.  </li>
            <li> The down side of the product, is that it is quite oily and can clog my facial pores.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I noticed that my eyelids became very dry, red, swallen and raw to the touch.</li>
            <li> and I love it very much, but this one is so disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> so if I dry out my skin, my acne will disappear\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it has put some life into my desert dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Last summer we ran into some serious financial problems and had no extra money.</li>
            <li> Beeswax about a 1/3rd or less of the entire product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have used 1/2 of the jar in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It totally works and it&#x27;s half the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use personally use black soap</li>
            <li> (he is a lot less religious about applying it than I</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night and my skin looks and feels softer, less lined, younger!</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have had only a small amount of acne (hormone related; that&#x27;s going to happen no matter</li>
            <li> No more physical pain or emotional pain.</li>
            <li> I bought from Costco for only $39.95 for one big + one small tub.</li>
            <li> I ran a little through my dry hair too, just to see what it would do, and it totally tames frizz and adds tons of shine.</li>
            <li> I sent a jar to my cousin who lives in a cold climate and was having extreme problems with his hands becoming dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> When I worked the cream hard between my fingers, I found it relatively easy to apply it to my eyelids in a thin oily film.</li>
            <li> very dry area of the country..</li>
            <li> I bought it to even out the tone in my very dry legs.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my kids who are prone to very dry skin and eczema, to no avail.</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t VERY dry this item will probably be too greasy for you.</li>
            <li> I have very dry</li>
            <li> I use for very dry areas like my lips, hands/feet.</li>
            <li> but I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> ( my shins have always been very dry and cracked)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that tends to be very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Since the weather has changed, my foot has been very dry and peeling.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> I have not used it when my skin was very dry.</li>
            <li> It also caused me to get little white zits on my face and chest and upper-back...which I normally never get.    </li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin where I would have a pimple here and there and the common blackheads around the nose area if the lotions/creams I use aren&#x27;t agreeing with my skin.</li>
            <li> My son had a few dry patches on his back (eczema type) and this helped him a lot.  </li>
            <li> I only use this when my skin feels dull and extra dry because I don&#x27;t want to use it all up.</li>
            <li> The jar looks a little different from what it should be.</li>
            <li> all the little red bumps cleared up.</li>
            <li> I not only use it on my face and neck, but I use it as a hair balm (in little bits) as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the fact that my skin is clearer and my little lines that were starting to form around my eyes and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price:  A little pricey for a tiny bottle</li>
            <li> Not necessarily greasy, but does take a little bit longer than some moisturizers to absorb fully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I got little bumps all over my face by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, so I&#x27;m starting to get concerned about the little lines that seem to be popping up here and there.</li>
            <li> I battle with dry skin due to the climate and elevation here in Colorado.</li>
            <li> I also have been using on my face due to dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has no fragrance at all and a little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> It is hard as a rock and feels like Vaseline except more expensive.  </li>
            <li> A year later, it is hardly visible to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> Limited results healing with other products</li>
            <li> BUT despite it looking all greasy, it did make my hair more shiny, and the texture wasn&#x27;t that bad.    </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, delicate skin</li>
            <li> In the late afternoon I examined my skin in the mirror and noticed a couple of tiny red bumps on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Maybe thats where all these negative reviews are coming from, but I suggest to people to get the actual cream from the actual website!!!</li>
            <li> I have excema there &amp; now it has spread worse, and even though it is very soothing, it has not done anything.  </li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money!!!Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but is so so worth it....</li>
            <li> I had read quite about this cream and was curious.  </li>
            <li> A few nights later I started putting on my face before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I use it for rough skin and stretch marks and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this after reading all the rave reviews and have been looking for a minimally processed face cream with royal jelly.</li>
            <li> I really do not know whether there...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it on a lot of people and never really felt that self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those few beauty products that actually have expiration dates; I&#x27;ll be using this thing for 3 years,</li>
            <li> but it is minimal.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li> But once you put it on, it sinks into your skin and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks and</li>
            <li> not really penetrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already been a few years, and it hasn&#x27;t came back in that spot.  </li>
            <li> So I suggest anyone curious about this to try it.  </li>
            <li> There is no real scent to it besides it being a bit earthy?</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I ditched the makeup - yes, even when going out in public!</li>
            <li> It can be a drag.</li>
            <li> It was a big waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Merchandise arrived sooner that I have expected .</li>
            <li> I was using,plus my lips turned pink</li>
            <li> The quality is absolutely not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> It appears to be what I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> However, I only used it for a few weeks and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> know I only used it for a few weeks, so it might not show yet,</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no Whole Foods here.</li>
            <li> This is such a waste of money because it is just like a vaseline/petrolium gel.</li>
            <li> Since this product is all natural it tends to work slowly.</li>
            <li> Ill get back to you in 20 years, if I live that long, and let you know if this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> and has not helped with the dry skin!!</li>
            <li> A month in, no large pimples even during my period, no makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some very dry patches of eczema (fortunately, I only have two small patches</li>
            <li> First I bought from Amazon, after a huge disappointment I though may be the product was fake from Amazon</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it at night my skin looked and felt lovely in the morning, but now my skin feels and looks awful all the time.</li>
            <li> The ones from the official website had a harder butter like consistency but other than that I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I woke up with a cold sore, and putting a small dab of Egyptian Magic on it throughout the day has kept it moisturized and aided in healing.</li>
            <li> The dry areas are gone, the wrinkles are less noticable.  </li>
            <li> but NO MORE, they are soft and no more dry skin as well as my hands.</li>
            <li> back then The product has much gotten thinner in consistency and the scent much less faint.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and can be used for face, body and ends of hair.</li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is kinda greasy, just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - on face and neck.</li>
            <li> It also lasts quite a long time, as a little goes</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey compared to other moisturizers, but a little bit truly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if I had a fake this last time, as the packaging started to fade, but this new container started clearing up some blemishes I had.</li>
            <li> The only negative fact I can find is that it&#x27;s a little oily , but this is also why I only use it at night time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Unlike any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product I received was fake or if the formula has changed, but within minutes of applying this to my hands and face, I broke out in a hot rash and my entire body became EXTREMELY itchy.</li>
            <li> I still have the other symptoms, but will continue to use to see if it improves.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my face only at night- for people with oily skin, please do not be scared to use it, i have excessively oily skin</li>
            <li> Other than this i use it on my feet and put on cotton socks for about 15 min.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products that usually cause clogging after use yet doesn&#x27;t alleviate the dryness at all.</li>
            <li> I read hundreds of reviews before settling for this product and I tried it for about a week before I had to stop due to the break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as I thought  a $30 jar of magic would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for some of the other recommended uses, but I would trust that it could be beneficial for other purposes as well.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face at night and it makes my face extremely oily.</li>
            <li> Other than using this on my feet, I have on idea</li>
            <li> what other stuff I can use this for.</li>
            <li> bought this stuff due to recommendations for use on eczema.  </li>
            <li> Considering her other choices in life, I tend to believe her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely overpriced IMHO.</li>
            <li> I guess it can be seen as a moisturizer, but I can think of plenty other moisturizers that are cheaper and dont smell like a BP Oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used any other scar erasing product, but this one works so well</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had the other ingredients and made it myself.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely overpriced cream.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me other than moisturizing as any other lotion or cream would.</li>
            <li> I have skin on my lip; closed sore!</li>
            <li> Although putting something like this on a face prone to oil excessive production sounds a bit spooky, I&#x27;ve come to understand that a moisturizer like this can help to regulate the production of oil and actually keep it in check.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Costco, paid a lot more than I would have on Amazon:(  Started to use it on lips and face at night, rubbed the rest into my hands.  </li>
            <li> i used it once all over my face and other times</li>
            <li> I had a lot of blackheads and pimples as a result of using it once a day (and only a small amount).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other people try it for eczema, and for some it worked, and others</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have tried other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products and they just never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if she uses it daily as I do, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like every other face moisturize.  </li>
            <li> my skin now has a softer texture, the red spots seem to be disappearing, and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> This facial product is not overwhelming and too greasy.</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the miraculous recovery my skin has made in the last six months.</li>
            <li> Overall, yet another pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> EVEN MY FEET, which have never been healed with lotions or other creams.  </li>
            <li> , it did not leave me with a feeling that it penetrated my skin at all - just slick hands until the next time I washed them.</li>
            <li> When I first got the package, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I used the 4 oz container for 6 months before it ran out, but I want to try some other moisturizers before buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product is EXTREMELY oily.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Also patting a little onto my cheeks keeps them from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> Seems a little expensive but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, my little girls are half black, so their hair required the extra moisture and hair grease and this product does the job.  </li>
            <li> I bruise easily and badly .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible unless you can apply it smoothly on your face.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how dry your skin has to be to benefit from this, but I think it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It should be firm, firm enough that you have to rub it in your hands to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Last few years I have noticed a few very DRY spots and of course, a few deeper wrinkles as well as wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It did help with my redness, a little bit with acne scars, but not really with the lines.</li>
            <li> it saved my skin during winter!my skin is annoying during winter, easily get dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, greasy, balmy, etc.</li>
            <li> the weather here from November would get very dry against which the regular moist lotion does no good, not to mention the drier indoors environment because of the heating radiators.  </li>
            <li> so acne and dull skin came back.</li>
            <li> After seeing how it made my sister&#x27;s little red dots disappear, I decided to secretly buy it and try it, since I&#x27;d already openly mocked her about it.</li>
            <li> When I say I have dry skin - I mean I have dry</li>
            <li> But it is NOT worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Having had caesarean surgery before, the second time I had it, I had an infection, this is quite common for repeat offenders (</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a week before I bought this I had burned myself with a curling iron, at least a second degree burn, and it refused to scab over or heal.  </li>
            <li> (evidentally my body temperature is not warm   enough).   </li>
            <li> and I wake up and its still not absorbed.</li>
            <li> what do you call those dark raised age spots?  </li>
            <li> It is NOT WORTH $30.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to me but</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;poor\\&quot; version is loaded with beeswax making it too thick to spread easily, especially for the face.</li>
            <li> So far, both my Amazon purchases of this product were the \\&quot;poor\\&quot; version which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> I personally like how it&#x27;s thick and emollient bc</li>
            <li> So i took a very small amount of the hard gel, which is basically the consistency, and after rubbing it for a little bit with my fingertips, it really did turn into oil.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a very, very long way.  </li>
            <li> small jar lasts really long, i&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now and even when i&#x27;m using it for everything, its not even half way.</li>
            <li> and I do end up wiping down my face.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry and flaky skin, you will see no more skin flaking.</li>
            <li> In the  past this has led to dry itchy and at times even flaky skin in and around my eye sockets.</li>
            <li> did get less dark by prob 1 or 2 shades .</li>
            <li> No more dry skin, and</li>
            <li> and they have been much less noticeable since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> They are all smothed out, much less visible and</li>
            <li> I put it on my typical problem areas for prevention but also on any flare ups.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smoother and there are less blemishes to cover up.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and have noticed a lot less redness and discoloration.    </li>
            <li> my forehead do seem less visible.  </li>
            <li> For less than $10, even the skeptics can afford to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I suspect the honey is about five percent, or less and everything below that falls around 1 percent.</li>
            <li> I also use this product as a lotion for my face to prevent the dryness I typically encounter around my nose area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half now.  </li>
            <li> but noticeable none the less.</li>
            <li> Beware that because the cream turns to oil when you massage it, you WILL have a slight shine on your skin (just because you&#x27;re applying oil to your face).</li>
            <li> Previous surgeries, did not do as well</li>
            <li> The jar I received from this company had the \\&quot; use by date\\&quot; printed in black on the bottom.</li>
            <li> so I use less for my skin to absorb it all.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer and makes wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> give a slight oily sheen to your face</li>
            <li> I am also noticing less eye lash fall when I curl them.</li>
            <li> I put it on a scar on my hand and that has also gotten lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numorous moisturizing products to try to help soften it with little to no success.</li>
            <li> You hardly need any and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was, but shortly after using this product my skin became very dull and dry.</li>
            <li> Yes I know that&#x27;s bad for me but its true.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on a dark patch on my elbow for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I think it did help with my tone and uneven dark marks</li>
            <li> It mess up my hair, my pillows and my clothes.</li>
            <li> my lower face is full of cystic acne, and it is painful.</li>
            <li> It does help moisturize but not worth the money or trouble.</li>
            <li> and since we live in a white-skin obsessed world</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema and skin allergies my whole life, and they get pretty bad during winter since it&#x27;s so dry and cold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even helped to fade my acne scars a little bit.  </li>
            <li> When I use it at night, it is a little bit oily.</li>
            <li> Also he has a little eczema around his mouth/dry patches and this cleared it up.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on cuts, and other small abrasions.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant,</li>
            <li> It was a little too greasy for me to use on my hands, face or body - no matter how little I used.  </li>
            <li> A little about me:  -My reason for buying: to use as a moisturizer for my face and treat ends of my hair  -My skin type:</li>
            <li> Aside from my skin I also use a little bit in my hair and my hair</li>
            <li> If it ever smells off, even a little bit, toss it.</li>
            <li> It has a plaster texture until you scoop out a little in your hand &amp; rub together.  </li>
            <li> This product was a little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have noted that the product was a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; and others have stated that it doesn&#x27;t seem greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> To use it you scoop a little bit of it and rub it between your palms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasier than argan oil</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but it soaks in.</li>
            <li> It was a little greasy until it soaked in</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is a little greasy</li>
            <li> It does gets a little too oily and</li>
            <li> It was so hard to find a cream that is not loaded with all sorts of chemicals, that can help prevent my dry spots drying, and help prevent acne!</li>
            <li> I like it, it a little bit oil, I suggest use it as night cream.</li>
            <li> Just a little to expencive.</li>
            <li> So I read all the reviews and was a little nervous to try it after hearing it caused some people pimples.</li>
            <li> I put it on immediately after my shower, then, get dressed and let it sink in before putting on my make-up or foundation because it is a little greasy, but so is Medicine Mama&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little greasy and not especially great.</li>
            <li> It does cling to the lashes, resulting in heavy grease on my glasses, and it can irritate the eyes a little if it gets in there.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick- same consistency as vaseline.</li>
            <li> Prednisone is at the top of that list and is the biggest culprit behind my bad skin.  </li>
            <li> but I think it really does reduce my bags in the morning or those crazy creases everyone over 30 seems to have.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped clear of some redness and random acne, too.</li>
            <li> My hands are in chemicals all day everyday.</li>
            <li> 15hrs later, I got tired of it and rubbed it</li>
            <li> every few weeks to clarify.</li>
            <li> everyday after shower and at night...</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to help with my acne scars, lines below my eyes and on my forehead, also with redness around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> EM absorbs in a few minutes</li>
            <li> I have tried products with mineral oil and products with cocoa butter and both have left me horribly broken out with an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cause a breakout, but too heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product as a night cream, and after a few days i started to break out.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of heavy</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I use it twice everyday, morning and night.</li>
            <li> My parents used to call it a heat rash but it was there year round.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything from irritated patches of skin, to everyday use as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered EMC a few weeks ago and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference after a few months.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth going on with an oily base.  </li>
            <li> I find it alittle to heavy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but WOW, it truly is a wonder cream.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face a neck under my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was heavy and greasy which I didn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> (It is too heavy for me to use in the humid summer and exacerbates acne</li>
            <li> I had to apply it everyday for a few months, but after a while my eyebrows stopped having the problem.  </li>
            <li> I bought this jar a few month ago.</li>
            <li> B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]], mixed with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> My hands were so dried and cracked over winter.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of night and day use, my skin had this glow.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend the money for expensive department store cosmetics, and drug store brands just go so far...</li>
            <li> I used to have to smother cream on my hands around-the-clock, which made everyday tasks the biggest nuisance.</li>
            <li> but I figured it just felt heavy to me because I&#x27;m not used to using products.</li>
            <li> I got it because I was reading about it in a few magazines/interviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, smells like cardboard, and gets messy, but holy mother of god</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> Ive beend using this product for a few years now, and I swear by it, I use it at night</li>
            <li> The product is fairly heavy to be putting on skin, and I saw no healing or change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my daughter a few times.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday on my face, hands, elbows and knees since I received it</li>
            <li> My friends like to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent (although I don&#x27;t dislike it).</li>
            <li> I looked down after a few days of use and I swear the scars have almost diminished!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a thickish, buttery, non-oily cream that absorbs well, with plain, preferably non-animal tested ingredients and no added heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I felt like this required an excessive amount of tugging and pulling on my face, and the results were less than optimal.</li>
            <li> i have extremely oily sensitive skin and was afraid that it would make me break out.  </li>
            <li> It made my face feel very very smooth, BUT I broke out like crazy!!</li>
            <li> I had had very large, painful, and under-the-skin cystic acne that showed no sign of retreating.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid that the Costco in my new area will not stock it!</li>
            <li> and it did not cause me to break out and caused no reaction whatsoever (also no strong smell).</li>
            <li> I also use it on the ends of my hair to tame fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> However, as I&#x27;m acne-prone, the excessive oil does make me break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> and my skin was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I used small bits for a few days on face, hands, lips and body.</li>
            <li> Wish the price would slow down.</li>
            <li> He said it sped up the healing time on cold sores when he got them and that he had used it on new tattoos to speed the healing as well</li>
            <li> This was nothing like a bad reaction I&#x27;ve had to chemical filled products, it was worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% committed to EM, and use the Pond&#x27;s cold cream on roughly the same schedule, butthat&#x27;s because Pond&#x27;s is 1/4th the price of EM.  </li>
            <li> but it is little greasy for me!</li>
            <li> the rash can be quite scaly and painful at times, not sure if it&#x27;s eczema, water trapped in the rings, or an allergic reaction or what, but putting a bit of this cream on it really helps to ease the pain, reduce redness/scaliness, and moisturize.</li>
            <li> +kudos because they use simple plain ingredients &amp; I like that it&#x27;s not tested on animals (as it&#x27;s completely needless suffering and nanotechnology techniques</li>
            <li> It looks greasy but you need very little, rub hands together and it melts into an oil.  </li>
            <li> Use very little.</li>
            <li> so try it you like but use very little.</li>
            <li> Its quite thick so a little is all you need.</li>
            <li> It did not really change anything!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face is smoother than before, so I once again bought a small bottle</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fus is.  </li>
            <li> I put small thin inch length spread on my cheeks chin and forehead, closed the bottle, then spread these inch length sections all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it the past 5 years</li>
            <li> That night, I washed my face as usual and placed a small amount of this on my parched eyelids.</li>
            <li> The break out was in the form of small bumps (not pimples or acne)</li>
            <li> but I assume that this was the result of excessive oil buildup just below the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the price however.</li>
            <li> i use this everyday in MN winters!  </li>
            <li> They would ask me if I was having a rough time because I looked so tired.</li>
            <li> It looks like butter and melts like it as well, when you scoop it up it melts and turns into an oil, put a small amount on your face.</li>
            <li> No better than vaseline.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son suffers from both acne and eczema on his face.  </li>
            <li> Within the past 18 years, I&#x27;ve bought and tried EVERYTHING on the market along with prescription medication for the eczema on my feet.</li>
            <li> I apply it to wet skin to thin it out and help seal in the hydration.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately i have lost the receipt and can not get my monry back.</li>
            <li> Really unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get breakouts anymore and the texture of my skin is so even now-- no more oil in some parts and dryness in others--</li>
            <li> - Smells faintly like iron (personally doesn&#x27;t bother me)  </li>
            <li> I use it at night after washing my face with my usual face cleanser</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for others with combo/dry skin, not sure about oily skin though.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, a small amount of EMC did NOT EVER ABSORB into my skin.</li>
            <li> apply a small amount and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Not sure where I saw or heard of this. . .</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my hands and then rub my arms, elbows and sometimes even run my hands thru my hair, helps with frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> Over the past month, I&#x27;ve worn this day and night every day.</li>
            <li> I usually wait an hour after applying this before doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this product because of its smell and because of the appearance.</li>
            <li> Before using this cream I had some shallow wrinkles that are even less visible</li>
            <li> I plan on using a small amount on my ends after a shower.</li>
            <li> The reader should know that a small amount of cream is needed to cover one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Within a week, the small lines on my forehead started fading.    </li>
            <li> so, so, soooo wanted this to work out, but it didn&#x27;t :/</li>
            <li> I tried everything from expensive lotions, to oils and strange green salves from the health food store.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see what it does with everyday use!  </li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> I just take a small amount of it and put it on my hand until it becomes oil and then apply it on my neck.</li>
            <li> The cream felt so thick and heavy</li>
            <li> The cream felt so thick and heavy</li>
            <li> and I also use a small amount after i get out of the shower before I put my make-up on.  </li>
            <li> but this is not the product it used to be in the past.</li>
            <li> - Too expensive for the simple things it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined a few years ago I&#x27;d use something as thick as this on my face, but instead of causing any sort of breakout, it retained the moisture.  </li>
            <li> Everytime you just need a small piece.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to apply without using a lot of pressure and pulling on facial skin.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it is difficult to keep it from getting in your hair unless you wear a cap all the time, and if used as a night cream, your face will stick to the pillow.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no magic here.</li>
            <li> When I see people from my past they are in shock.</li>
            <li> am truly sorry for the people who have bought this product on here and do not get the same results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice miracles but I am now applying it all over my fave and neck (taking a small amount and warming it on my finger tips and massaging in).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy something just because a celebrity uses it.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> My allergies were really bad this year &amp; my eyelids became swollen, itchy, dry places and red.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement :(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too oily, and the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> In less than 24 hrs his psoriasis no longer itches and has faded quite a bit!!  </li>
            <li> My face tends to get oily,but a little goes a long way, don&#x27;t be afraid to use it on oily skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not help my dry eczema-proned skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream on my legs and dry skin until it&#x27;s gone because it was expensive</li>
            <li> Too bad the owner of the company is so sloppy in maintaining a consistent product.</li>
            <li> And while there is no cure short of surgery for a dropped toe joint, this product makes it much less painful to walk around on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hard waxy substance that becomes like an oil when you rub it.</li>
            <li> I hide my dull skin with foundation and blush on</li>
            <li> And it was really hard to rub into an oil, and it didn&#x27;t spread well at all.</li>
            <li> I have to look hard to find the scars.</li>
            <li> I found that sometimes its hard for the skin to absorb it, cuz its so thick.</li>
            <li> I also want to ad though that I feel we&#x27;re so used to synthetic added perfumes that we start to regards natural ingredients as having &#x27;a bad smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li> could it be bad when it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I used to have really bad breakouts from when I was 11 to about 18 years old, and now I no longer have it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is extremely expensive for a mere combination of natural waxes, oil and honey</li>
            <li> least ingredients is the prescription for me.  </li>
            <li> Use it at night and see how your skin sucks in all the yummy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve acutally had complements on my face lately.  </li>
            <li> There was no noticeable difference in the moisture of my skin, and it definitely didn&#x27;t help my chicken skin arms.</li>
            <li> least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Both have negative reactions like skin peeling and dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and those suckers seem to pop up overnight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly thick with an creamy/oily consistency, but it&#x27;s water soluble and not goopy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and a bit shiny until it soaks in</li>
            <li> I would agree that it is a &#x27;thick&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt greasy, and my pores felt thick with the stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick cream that when rubbed between your fingers turns into an oil.</li>
            <li> not too slow.</li>
            <li> the ceasarean I mean)</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on overnight, wash your face when you wake up and tada!</li>
            <li> Just because it worked for me this way, it doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you this way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and I mean everything, to get rid of these breakouts</li>
            <li> No more flakiness, and no oily skin by the end of the day!</li>
            <li> and I started to break out so badly in little white heads on my cheek, which I still haven&#x27;t gotten rid of :(</li>
            <li> I thought I could put those terrible acne days behind me, but alas, no... Last year I was diagnosed with a chronic condition that requires certain medications that wreak havoc on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not right for me.</li>
            <li> It is also a VERY SMALL jar.</li>
            <li> The jars are very small-</li>
            <li> I have been using bacitracin on a knee scrap and it just continued to get worse and was clearly beginning to scar badly.</li>
            <li> it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> When I got home I followed up with some Pond&#x27;s dry skin hypoallergenic cold cream, and crossed my fingers when I crawled into bed.    </li>
            <li> &quot; This stuff seriously works.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> He has been using it every night, and he used it when he went traveling on the East coast where it was cold and dry.</li>
            <li> Saved me from the cold and dry winter here.</li>
            <li> seriously this is the fifth time i bought it</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> She believes the one purchased from  Pro Therapy Supplies is fake too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big reason I believe it is fake is that there is no receipt in the package and there is no way you can return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gross and feels like petroleum jelly (which is really bad for your skin, and drying--believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently I had a bad fight with an acne flare-up that wouldn&#x27;t quit.</li>
            <li> not too bad overall.</li>
            <li> it is quite oily, so possibly not good for daytime use since it would make your face look too shiny even with the foundation covering it up.  </li>
            <li> I have a scar on my hip where they took the graft from which tore, being young and stupid</li>
            <li> smell not good</li>
            <li> I honestly HATE how greasy this stuff is, but I must say it is the BOMB as far as wrinkles are concerned.  </li>
            <li> It does moisturize very well and helped heal a very bad burn.</li>
            <li> My son who&#x27;s a toddler was experiencing eczema due to the cold weather and this nipped it in the bud.</li>
            <li> This does moisturize skin and according to the ingredient list has very little random chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed especially considering  the cost of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> First of all, it smells AWFUL, not something I would want to walk around smelling like all day unless you are a fragrance wearer and can cover up this smell, yuck!!  </li>
            <li> This was a weak moment of mine when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Duh not amazon!</li>
            <li> I am hoping I can get this from a different store which is legitimate and not selling me engine oil. :(</li>
            <li> Apply very thick coat of Indian Healing Clay mask</li>
            <li> Goodbye heavy foundation, hello radiant skin!!!</li>
            <li> Looking back, it was probably my stupid decision to stop moisturizing altogether that caused it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if we are all kidding ourselves, and confusing glow with grease, but I&#x27;m not impressed, maybe a bit amused.</li>
            <li> B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]]</li>
            <li> they all thank me for telling them about this secret balm.</li>
            <li> I had read that this was the secret to the stars and was basically an all over miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of secret Egyptian needs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you what they are because it&#x27;s a secret.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product that was sent to me.</li>
            <li> This container says &#x27;The Ancient Kamitian&#x27;s Secret&#x27;, and the official website&#x27;s product says &#x27;The Ancient Egyptian&#x27;s Secret.&#x27;</li>
            <li> i applied a thin layer to my zits and it dries up overnight without being too oily on my combination.</li>
            <li> Worse case scenario is you put it on your hands before bed and it helps moisturize them.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, just wandering the \\&quot;story\\&quot; behind this..</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not happy with that.</li>
            <li> So if you may have thin feeling hair, you may want to use the creme for a thicker feel.</li>
            <li> And I even put a thin layer of it on my face which is prone to break out with anything greasy like this</li>
            <li> my hair, it is a disaster, no matter how little I use, even if well rubbed in, it just makes it greasy, dirty, and even my pillow gets dirty from it.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed in size of product.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive but a little goes a loooonnng way!!</li>
            <li> It had always been hard and painful to walk on, and I even had custom insoles made for my shoes.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, thick, and frizzy (bad genes here).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t quite expect the lasting grease look and feel, but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I bought a fake on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Friends that I had known for years asked me my secret!</li>
            <li> I ordered it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and she wasn&#x27;t wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product with</li>
            <li> It looks like Vaseline, smells faintly of herbal tea,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical</li>
            <li> As I implied I believe one time I recieved a fake tub, because it wasn&#x27;t working for my acne as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dont see what all the hoopla is about?  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say that the label doesn&#x27;t match the picture.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was part of the group that broke out rather than benefited from this product.  </li>
            <li> Not saying that it is not a good product just that it is very expensive</li>
            <li> think I got a fake.</li>
            <li> Weird thing is that the EMC website&#x27;s products&#x27; labels look like the one I got....</li>
            <li> but mine just HAS to be a fake.</li>
            <li> and is also really faint.</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> the consistency is all wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too expensive in my opinion, and I want to try out the alternative beeswax product people have mentioned here, but for now I have a full-sized jar of EM to get through.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive.  </li>
            <li> The fake I got was scented.  </li>
            <li> If you have used it before you know the fake</li>
            <li> was too expensive and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed by Dermatitis for about 1 year</li>
            <li> had tried vaseline,cetaphil,cerave and the drugs recommended by my dermatologist,but they all failed and some even irritated and hurt.)</li>
            <li> The consistency is mushy and wrong.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to buy a jar of vaseline and apply instead of this expensive</li>
            <li> but sadly it was a nightmare for my skin.</li>
            <li> It has an uncomfortable feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes it worse!</li>
            <li> I am just not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> so how could I go wrong.</li>
            <li> I seen how expensive it was on amazon</li>
            <li> I felt weird when I saw the barcode under the jar was scratched,</li>
            <li> The sad thing is I&#x27;ve purchased two @ $72.00 for my son and I.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so what&#x27;s the use of using this expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Ill be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> I wish that it was not so expensive</li>
            <li> I have extremely weird skin.  </li>
            <li> could I know that it&#x27;s the fake one without opening???</li>
            <li> was fake.</li>
            <li> Both gave me expensive creams to use and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> The seller is apparently not trustable and the product selling here is fake!!!</li>
            <li> It has been very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> everything (including very expensive creams like La Mer) made it worse.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick consistency, I hate to use it during the day.</li>
            <li> This product is the worst skin product I ever spent money on.</li>
            <li> It has a Vaseline type texture but doesn&#x27;t have petroleum or other nasty things.  </li>
            <li> Returned did not like the thick ness of the goop !!!</li>
            <li> If I rub it in my hands, everything I touch gets dirty (computer, papers, everything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on my legs, the couch gets dirty.</li>
            <li> I changed my review from 5 to 4 stars, because of the disappointing results for eczema.</li>
            <li> I got a scrip from another doctor, then was also told to get moisturizer, cortisone cream, apply cold packs to my face, etc etc.  </li>
            <li> the results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Not fragranced, colored or artificial in any way.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to break out.</li>
            <li> I am totally unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> That said, the price is crazy for a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> After seeing it raved about on The View, I figured, I can&#x27;t go wrong, look at all these customers!</li>
            <li> I felt really sorry for myself!</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that its so expensive</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I find it to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> however, this still makes it very difficult to put makeup on, let alone</li>
            <li> Anything I put on them (not even talking about make up here) would sting so badly, I had to take it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone with bad skin.</li>
            <li> a rash gone bad, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> My hair is badly damaged</li>
            <li> but it could be me wanting it to really bad.</li>
            <li> I also get a really bad breakouts after using this product.</li>
            <li> He was having a bad eczema breakout on his face, when I found this product.</li>
            <li> the bad news is that it is  way hyped up here in the Amazon ratings...probably by sellers...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like smell bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product at all, but it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about the product is the hygiene issue-</li>
            <li> i look my friend used this product , she told me her feet skin is bad ,but used this product every well now</li>
            <li> I have not used it on my hair as that might be a bad idea</li>
            <li> I bought it to use for a bad scar on my leg and</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also bad with picking at my skin.</li>
            <li> Ugly package, bad smell and waxy uneasy feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> This product works on cracked winter hands that are painful.</li>
            <li> I end up running the vicious cycle of covering it all up with makeup which as you know, just makes it worse.</li>
            <li> After a month&#x27;s use, I was really shocked to see that my mole/wart/raisedbrownspot disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Never in my life had I been so disappointed by a product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to the \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; that everyone claims is in this product :(</li>
            <li> Mine was melted up opening :(</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> Now I had to stop using the $30 dollar ointment because it makes cyst grow around my eyes and cheeks :(</li>
            <li> The odor is wrong and horrible might I add.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product that i cant recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I heard from people with oily skin that it would help reduce oiliness, but it didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> You will be highly disappointed and you won&#x27;t be alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the hype but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the cream and will not order it again or refer it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to let you all know this</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The annoying blackheads have been reduced to the point of where I don&#x27;t notice or think about them and the flakiness from winter weather has disappeared from my face.</li>
            <li> So, no matter how much I hate the greasiness of this stuff otherwise it would be 5 stars +), I am COMMITTED to using it EVERY NIGHT.  </li>
            <li> The wife loves it, I hate it.....</li>
            <li> it simly greasy and bad smell!</li>
            <li> Hated this.</li>
            <li> it did everything it said it would, I would like to share with others and purchase again but fearful of getting that greasy one again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the rave review about this cream, I decided to try and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was experiencing a nasty breakout</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over the awful smell.  </li>
            <li> I was miserable!  </li>
            <li> The color and texture are disgusting.</li>
            <li> but it gave me a terrible rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing but vaseline  ..made to smell awful  </li>
            <li> I had really horrible sun burn used this cream for two nights before going to bed and it was gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because one day i noticed the paint on the container fell off terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff, and it seems to work</li>
            <li> allergic to bee pollen when the label states it helps people with allergies and facial redness. Can not breathe on this product.</li>
            <li> By far the best cream out there. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one wins hands down.  Its now my go to product.</li>
            <li> Have used Egyptian Magic for a couple of years. A little goes a long way and can be used for face, body and ends of hair. It really is all purpose.  Received it in a couple of days after ordering through Amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> really doesnt do anything , its greasy too, used for over a month and did nothing for scars or dark spots , not worth the money or time</li>
            <li> Never in my life had I been so disappointed by a product.&lt;br /&gt;-It is extremely expensive for a mere combination of natural waxes, oil and honey&lt;br /&gt;-It was endorsed by beauty magazines and Kate Hudson says she uses it in her hair&lt;br /&gt;-Amazon has so many great reviews, so I was confident&lt;br /&gt;So I broke the bank and got it.&lt;br /&gt;In my hair, it is a disaster, no matter how little I use, even if well rubbed in, it just makes it greasy, dirty, and even my pillow gets dirty from it. Plus, it is a pain to re-wash it to rinse it off, it is so sticky.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried to just use it for its purpose: on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Again, it does nothing but to make it oily. If I rub it in my hands, everything I touch gets dirty (computer, papers, everything. It leaves oily stains on most fabrics).&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s on my legs, the couch gets dirty. It&#x27;s like you spread pure olive oil all over yourself (but I actually saw benefits to my damaged hair when I used plain Olive Oil instead of this).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how dry your skin has to be to benefit from this, but I think it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the first such product that really does work to lubricate, moisten, and even heal dry, sensitive skin.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, neck and hands every night when I go to bed.  In the morning my face feels soft. I don&#x27;t know if it helps wrinkles, but it does soften the skin.</li>
            <li> Really greasy. At first I was putting it on my face but it seemed like every time I did, I would throw up. So I figured the smell upset my stomach. So I stopped that. I put it on my feet last night and then immediately put socks on. I just looked and there are greasy footprints all over my house now. Even though I had pretty thick socks on. And my feet aren&#x27;t any softer. I think I&#x27;ll throw this stuff away.</li>
            <li> I use this product for almost anything and it has amazing results. I use it on my lips, neck, chest,elbows, and love it! I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face is smoother than before, so I once again bought a small bottle</li>
            <li> After my first use my skin was much more hydrated feeling and looking. It also appeared to be more even-toned. I like the product and will continue to use it at night only. It can feel somewhat greasy which prevents me from using it during the day. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Great product! Unlike any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hands are in chemicals all day everyday.Have tried every thing.This has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Also using on feet really good.</li>
            <li> I really don’t write product reviews, but I felt the need to share my experience in this situation.  I recently read a celebrity interview in a well-known beauty / fashion magazine where Egyptian Magic skin cream was mentioned as a “must have, cannot leave home without” product by this person.  I thought to myself this product must be special and one that I should try.  This celebrity could afford virtually any beauty product on the market, and yet she was singing the praises of this one.  So I ordered the four ounce jar.  I am using Egyptian Magic on my face (including eyes), neck, hands, body, heels of feet, etc.  I immediately noticed softer, silkier and suppler skin.  It is a bit greasy, but the product absorbs pretty quickly into the skin, and it does not sting the eyes.  And so this has now become a product that I will not be without!  I would strongly recommend trying Egyptian Magic skin cream.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fus is.  This did absolutely nothing positive for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it at all.  However, it has rave reviews so it must work miracles for most people.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the other customers if I didn&#x27;t tell my experiences with this product. Before I purchased, I read reviews of individuals having the same issues and still made the decision to purchase this product. I&#x27;m pleased I purchased it, not because the product is a new fave of mine but because I didn&#x27;t want to be left with the what if it would have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, A little really does go a very long way, even with using this product daily, I doubt I could get though it in 6 months if only using on my face. You really can&#x27;t use a lot of this product, it will leave you very greasy if you do. So get a very thin layer on your fingers and apply that to your skin and go back for more if necessary, a little bit over a pea size should be enough for your face (that might even be too much). If this product works for you, this is a wonderful plus as in the end, it will be very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, the ingredients are great. Its lovely I can pronounce what I am putting on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd, it can be used all over the body (which is great for me, I don&#x27;t like the way it sits on the skin, so I&#x27;m going to use the rest of my jar as a scalp treatment, who knows, if my scalp loves it, I may update my review into a hair treatment. But I bought it for my skin, as it&#x27;s called a skin cream so... 3 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th, I was very fortunate to purchase from a authorized seller, there are so many fakes, you have to be careful. Shipping was lighting fast, 2 days people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so-called lightly spread this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; its totally more of an oil, on my face around 9pm...my thoughts, it should be absorbed by morning. So many people were warning customers; folks, this is a night cream, don&#x27;t expect to wear this under makeup. Truth tellers in a nutshell, I believed them but whoa, 12hrs later it was as if I just applied, no kidding. 15hrs later, I got tired of it and rubbed it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night Two, let&#x27;s spread this baby more thinly, I&#x27;m not letting you do this to me again. I put small thin inch length spread on my cheeks chin and forehead, closed the bottle, then spread these inch length sections all over my face. Took some time because I had to really spread because I didn&#x27;t have much to go from, and with dry skin, sometimes products won&#x27;t spread easily because there is no moisture to slide on. Anyway I still looked greasy, next day, same dilemma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if we are all kidding ourselves, and confusing glow with grease, but I&#x27;m not impressed, maybe a bit amused. After seeing it raved about on The View, I figured, I can&#x27;t go wrong, look at all these customers! Is this monkey see, monkey do? Are we all persistently following the leader? I&#x27;m not even half pleased with this product, it&#x27;s like a 360 in comparison to others. What works for others will not always work for me, but who can work with grease?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps over time, it will fade acne scars; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised, the ingredients are great! But it is NOT worth it for me. There are other products out there that fade acne scars, Tea Tree Oil is a good example, anything anti-microbial probably would and most of the ingredients in Egyptian Magic are anti-microbial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I wanted something moisturizing, A CREAM. When they said it was an All-Purpose Skin Cream, I was expecting something that wouldn&#x27;t sit on my skin after 12 hours. This is more like a scalp oil. I can&#x27;t even use this product to seal in moisture. Beeswax is a great sealant but the composition of this particular product is too greasy, if there was less Olive Oil maybe...but the first ingredient listed on the bottle is always the greatest quantity in the product, so a less oily effect shouldn&#x27;t be expected. I thought maybe they had whipped it into a very creamy oil that would sink into the skin easily, but that was not the case. I am battling dry skin, and if feels smothered underneath a super thin layer of this product, and it&#x27;s just left greasy, if I put water before applying this product for a moisture-sealant effect, it&#x27;s just greasy and watery. I can&#x27;t win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel right about having opened a product then returning it... I will just eat the cost and try another beeswax product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I broke out in huge pimples both days after applying, I&#x27;d blame it on the cheesecake except I KNOW a greasy face for hours equals pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps...any courageous ponderers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for skin care. It is excellent, I highly recommend it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my husband&#x27;s eczema and it helped his skin considerably! Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it the past 5 years and it&#x27;s wonderful!  It&#x27;s beneficial for mosquitoe bites, scars, rashes and as a moisturizer.  I love it because it works!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have sensitive skin and it is ideal for the face.  I only use a fingertip of it.  It is also excellent as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> Having had caesarean surgery before, the second time I had it, I had an infection, this is quite common for repeat offenders (the ceasarean I mean). My third ceasarean I assumed would also cause me infection problems so instead I bought about three jars and started plopping them all over the stitches every single day for about a week. I have no remaining scars from the ceasarean. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t buy anymore of this stuff is because here in Southeast Asia there&#x27;s a product with similar healing abilities called Gamat, from sea cucumbers which doesn&#x27;t require me to shell out my credit card. Other than that, fantastic product, can be used on burns, cuts, scratches. It&#x27;s not a facial product mind you, I did put the stuff on my face, it makes your skin darker but clearer and since we live in a white-skin obsessed world I doubt that&#x27;s what women would go for. Other than that if you have kids, it&#x27;s very useful to have around.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why so many people endorsed this product.  It is hard as a rock and feels like Vaseline except more expensive.  I don&#x27;t feel any magic when I use this, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I just started using it on my face yesterday.  I have been applying to my lips for some time now, I like it very much, it makes my lips feeling naturally grossed.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for face, hair and feet. It works amazingly and does not feel heavy like other creams on the face.</li>
            <li> I find this cream greasy, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  The jar is going to last me a while!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but would rather recommend BioOil or Eight Hour Cream depending on your needs.  Bio Oil -If you&#x27;re looking for a great full body moisturiser, scar treatment, night cream or for stretch marks.  Eight Hour Cream - For lips, cuticle care, cracked heals, skin irritations and everything else.  Eight hour is versatile and a cult favourite(I always have a tube in my handbag.)  Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I read great reviews on it and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I can&#x27;t use many products on my legs because they are sensitive and react to a lot of lotions.  This cream is great!  It relieves eczema wonderfully!  I also use it as a chapstick and on my cuticles.  I put it on my face overnight in the winter, as my skin tends to get dry, and this moisturizes well without making it greasy.  Might be too much for the summertime, but it&#x27;s wonderful during the cold months.</li>
            <li> If I consistently rub a small amount of this into my nails and cuticles at night, I have nice nails - strong even.  I find this is especially important in the winter when everything dries out from lack of moisture.  I also slather a bit on my lips before bedtime.  My hard-to-please daughter is always snitching some of this when she comes to visit because of what it does for her nails.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, VERY sensitive skin and have tried hundreds of products over the years.  The price was right on this one plus I&#x27;ve always wanted to see if royal jelly would help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this, if you have severely dry skin, is that it really moisturizes.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it takes quite a while for it to absorb which is ususally not the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I easily put 7 to 8 coats of moisturizer on my face after cleansing to relieve the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this, which is great too.  No burning.  No stinging or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will see how it goes long term, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. It is all natural and makes your skin just glow. Right now in the dead of winter my skin usually looks totally dry and lifeless, but thanks to Egyptian Magic it looks elastic and feels so soft. I am just starting to get wrinkles between my eye brows and they have been much less noticeable since I started using this cream. My mom has been using E.M. for over a year and looks younger than she did 10 years ago!! Thank you Egyptian Magic!!!</li>
            <li> Great product that helps retain moisture in dry skin.  I use the product primarily under the eyes, where the skin tends to dry out the most.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product I received was fake or if the formula has changed, but within minutes of applying this to my hands and face, I broke out in a hot rash and my entire body became EXTREMELY itchy. This has never happened before when using EMC before so I have no idea what is going on. It is a shame because this stuff USED to be wonderful. I&#x27;ve washed my hands and face 3x already and I&#x27;m still itchy. Ugh!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing-it has transformed my skin from dry, flaky and patchy to smooth and glowing.  It&#x27;s even helped to fade my acne scars a little bit.  I would recommend using it as a night moisturizer (and washing your face in the morning) because it&#x27;s pretty greasy and your skin needs time to absorb it for the best results.  Also, I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s never caused a breakout despite the greasiness.</li>
            <li> Based on the good review I bought this product. But it is not that great at all. I hardly see any magical part of it. Greasy on hand or hair. I don&#x27;t dare to use it on face anyway. Thinking a way to get rid it now...</li>
            <li> It is GREAT! Even my son can use it. It worths the money!I will buy it more in the future.</li>
            <li> Within one use, my skin was super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t quite expect the lasting grease look and feel, but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Well worth the results, too! Just put a small amount on overnight, wash your face when you wake up and tada! My acne is even doing a little better with a few days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY NIGHT AT BED TIME ON MY HANDS AND ELBOWS.  AM AN \\&quot;OLD FLORIDA GAL\\&quot;, SO LOTS OF SUN DAMAGE ON MY HANDS--THEY ARE LOOKING SO MUCH BETTER! THIS TREATMENT IS VERY INTENSE, ONLY TAKES A VERY SMALL \\&quot;DAB TO DO IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian magic as my sole facial moisturizer for about four years now.  Nothing has come close to performing as this product does and I have tried countless products.  At first try, it may seem too greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves a radiant glow.  I do not wear any makeup and I love how Egyptian Magic makes my skin look and feel.  I feel like I look much better without makeup actually.  I add about two-three drops of Argan Oil to just a small (pea-sized) dollop of Egyptian magic and smooth it all over my face and neck.  I usually come back about 15 minutes after I apply it and smooth my hands over my face once again just to help the remaining greasiness absorb.  By that time, I am good to go and my skin looks healthy and glowing, not greasy.  I&#x27;m sure that this would not work for all skin types, but for mine it does.  I would say that I have combination skin...greasier in some spots, dry in others.  Egyptian Magic helps to balance it all out.  The greasy spots don&#x27;t get greasy during the day and the dry spots don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I struggled for years before finding skin products that worked for me and I found that most natural....least ingredients is the prescription for me.  I use pure honey and a microfiber cloth to cleanse, Egyptian Magic and Moroccan Argan oil to moisturize, coffee grounds to exfoliate and Aztec Secret [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]] every few weeks to clarify.</li>
            <li> I used it for about one month. Replenishment effect of this product is good, but not obvious to the scar. When I use it at night, it is a little bit oily. But when I get up, it can be totally absorbed. It is a good product to use in winter.</li>
            <li> when I received this item, I am not sure if this is the authentic one. We have tried it for 6days and no progress at all. I wish I bought a smaller size if there&#x27;s one just for a test.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for ten years - I get sun rashes, suffer from acne and have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very choosy about my cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about Sweet Bee Magic and thought I would give it a try becasue it is less expensive. Well, it is DEFINITELY not Egyptian Magic. It doesn&#x27;t feel all-natural, doesn&#x27;t have the same beeswaxy smell, and it irritated my acne. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it because they claim to have the same ingredients as Egyptian Magic but if that was the case, there would be no reason I would have this kind of a reaction to it. So I returned the jar, and re-ordered Egyptian Magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried EMC, you must!! There is nothing like it! It always makes my rashes go away in two hours, tops. It makes the skin on my cheeks super soft and I use it on my dog&#x27;s flea bites too :)</li>
            <li> Recently, I noticed that my eyelids became very dry, red, swallen and raw to the touch. Anything I put on them (not even talking about make up here) would sting so badly, I had to take it off immediately. They were puffy. I tried EVERYTHING: Aquaphor, Olay, Nivea, baby oil, butter, vitamin e oil, everything. They would be oily on top and rough and dry under the product. Then, a friend of mine recommended EM. Being a skeptic, I asked Whole Foods store to give me a sample of this \\&quot;magical stuff\\&quot;. That night, I washed my face as usual and placed a small amount of this on my parched eyelids. The next morning, I could not believe it! Not only were they not red, they were soft to the touch, like velvet. I was able to put on eyeshadow that day and did not feel any dryness or irritation. Will see when the next flare up occurs but, for now, I do consider this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; although the ingredients have long been proven to have medicinal properties (yes, the \\&quot;love\\&quot; ingredient included).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month morning and evening. These are my noticed results:&lt;br /&gt;1) no breakouts.  I started using this product when I was experiencing a nasty breakout and it was noticeably healed 4x faster.  Like wow.  And since I also applied before foundation, I did not have the crusty look foundation often gets when applied over acne.&lt;br /&gt;2) even skin tone.  Noticeably smoothed my skin from splotchy red to creamy white.&lt;br /&gt;3) pore size reduced and remain blackhead free!!!  Like really, the pores on my nose are very noticeable.  They are all smothed out, much less visible and my foundation and grease does not stick to them any more!&lt;br /&gt;4) reduction of lines and creases.  My eyes look younger!&lt;br /&gt;And if this weren&#x27;t enough...it feels amazing!  I no longer have that overly dry with problem oil areas anymore.  SO IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  I have oily skin and it still works for me.  My 4 yr old gets cracked and dry skin between his toes and this stuff clears it right up.  Also he has a little eczema around his mouth/dry patches and this cleared it up.  Finally something that works for him.  I love it.  This jar is huge and will last forever!</li>
            <li> This is GOOD stuff. Egyptian Magic has erased scars, healed rashes and burns, and cured virtually everything I&#x27;ve used it for. It&#x27;s well worth the price. Get it even if you don&#x27;t have an immediate use for it, because one day you will. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this amazing stuff!  I use it on my lips, nails and cuticles, hands, dry areas on my face, elbows,feet, and sometimes as a hair product.  Do Not Hesitate To Purchase!  When I got my first container, I thought it would be greasy because it looks more like an ointment than a cream.  But, it matches the natural lipids in the skin so well, it literally soaks right in and leaves such smooth, soft, and healed skin behind.  No scent so can be used by both men and women.  clgoehler</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and I like its results.  I like that it is ALL NATURAL and the jar lasts a long time.  You can use it on cuts, and other small abrasions. It also helps with reducing the look on scars.  It&#x27;s great to use on your hands at night.  It&#x27;s an all &#x27;round excellent product.</li>
            <li> It works for dry skin, pimples,Eczema.  Not a over night cure, but it works.  Little bit goes a long way. So, $30 jar can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with this product and preach the gospel of Egyptian Magic. It is a miracle-worker and a cure-all for my skin needs. I slather it on my face, neck, chest, and hands and will use it on my eyelids and cheekbones as a quickie luminizer. It also helps with stretch marks. It makes my skin super glow-y and quenches my skin even during the most dry conditions (such as in the deserts of san diego). I&#x27;ve never tried Bee Magic so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I love this and have gotten several friends hooked too.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product and most of them reassure you that the oils of the product will soak up in your skin even if you have typically oil skin like mine. It didn&#x27;t really soak up even if I used a small amount, and it left me with some white-heads and caused me to break out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the face if you have oily skin, BUT it did work pretty well on my hands/cuticles.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for a month or so and I had definitly seen difference. It may be really oily when I put it on at night, but after two nights, my skin became more mosturized and soft and even my friends and family noticed it. My acne scars had also began to clear up already</li>
            <li> I ordered EM from Amazon after reading so many positive reviews about the product.  My allergies were really bad this year &amp; my eyelids became swollen, itchy, dry places and red.  As soon as I received the product, I applied it.  The next morning, my eyelids were soft and smooth! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I still have the other symptoms, but will continue to use to see if it improves.  I have also been applying to my lips at night and they are no longer dry.  The jar will last forever, so even at $29.99, it&#x27;s a bargain!  UPDATE: It was great the first try on my eyelids, but that was it.  I have excema there &amp; now it has spread worse, and even though it is very soothing, it has not done anything.  BUT: as a skin moisturizer, it can&#x27;t be beat.  I have been applying it to my hands and arms, and it has taken years off!  My skin had started to become a little more loose and \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot;, and after a week, I would say it is 80% better! I changed my review from 5 to 4 stars, because of the disappointing results for eczema.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. i love the way it absorb into my skin...(a few minutes later) it keeps my skin quite soft and moisturize. i also have a feeling its reducing my small newly form acne, but thats just me. this magic cream isnt really cream but a greasy (in a good way) substance. putting this on, you&#x27;ll notice how oily looking it is, but dont worry it wont clog your pores. since this does get oily i use it at night. overall as long as ur not purchasing it over 35bucks in total, you havent been screwed over with.  it isnt just a facial \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.. you can use it on any need-to-be moisturized area on your body. good product..</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about how this one would work, but i&#x27;m glad i bought it. I use it for almost everything; My underarms were getting dark becoz of shaving, so i started putting this balm only at night and it unimaginable to see that the color of my underarms now matches the arm......I also use it on my face only at night- for people with oily skin, please do not be scared to use it, i have excessively oily skin and since i&#x27;ve started using this balm i haven&#x27;t had a single breakout and my skin looks so bright and fresh in the morning, my pore size has shrunk extensively....Other than this i use it on my feet and put on cotton socks for about 15 min. everyday after shower and at night...oh and use it as a hot oil treatment once a week, u&#x27;ll love the way ur hair would feel after wash. I recomended this product to all my cousins who have kids, becoz this product is chemical free; they use it as a diaper rash cream, body  balm..everything..they all thank me for telling them about this secret balm. Once thing u all need to do is, since this balm is all purpose and u&#x27;ll be using it on different parts of ur body, make sure u use a small spatula, spoon or anything to take out the balm since it is an open jar, and u don&#x27;t wanna spoil the natural contents of it by putting germs and bacteria in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small jar lasts really long, i&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now and even when i&#x27;m using it for everything, its not even half way. U&#x27;ll love this balm, not just becoz its cheap, but also the magic it does.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing, great for winter dry season. The only thing is the smell... But, I will still buy this cream again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to help with my acne scars, lines below my eyes and on my forehead, also with redness around my nose and cheeks. When applying this product less is more. I found that sometimes its hard for the skin to absorb it, cuz its so thick. I&#x27;d apply it at night and the next morning some of the product still there. It did help with my redness, a little bit with acne scars, but not really with the lines. Since this product is all natural it tends to work slowly. As an alternative I bought Bio-Oil, I recommend that over Egyptian Magic. Its cheaper, and product absorbs nicely into the skin faster, and I saw further improvements in my skin faster than Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I use this product in place of vaseline for my hands.  I put the cream on and then wear cotton gloves to bed to heal dry, chapped hands in the winter.  I was using vaseline, but to no avail.  I also use the cream on my face and it cures dry skin remarkedly well.  Best product on the market that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this product on my super dry feet.  It isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.  More like ointment, but it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.  It really absorbs into the skin and does keep my cuticles and feet in better condition.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this after hearing great things about it. When I got it I was super excited and it definitely lived up to its expectations...I use egyptian magic all over...literally and I feel and see a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve had many people complimenting me on how my skin has a glow to it! A+</li>
            <li> it didnt do anything special for me but the moisturizing and mosquito bite comfort is good. it is good for dry skin but use at night because it feels oily when you put it on. the jar is big so it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this for all things especially for my grandsons allergy dermatitis. (eczema) Thank you for coming to the resue</li>
            <li> On my doctor&#x27;s recommendation, I switched to a different sunscreen last month, and instantly regretted it: I developed a charming case of dermatitis right around my mouth and chin.  I looked like I&#x27;d abruptly developed a red, puffy goatee.  You know, right in time for my high school reunion.  Awesome.    I got a scrip from another doctor, then was also told to get moisturizer, cortisone cream, apply cold packs to my face, etc etc.  But every time I tried a moisturizer, it stung like hell.  None of the natural cures or masks were working either -- and the steady irritation of moisturizers was actually making the rash worse.    And then my coworker pulled Egyptian Magic out of her purse and told me her entire family swear by it.    Now, it looks bizarre, like a wax mass that&#x27;s even more solid than Vaseline.  (And the instructions on the back abruptly swoop into crunchy-granola mysticism, but the product IS called \\&quot;Egyptian Magic\\&quot;, so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.)  But the wax softens almost immediately once you&#x27;re rubbing it on your fingers, and it goes on smoothly.  I was able to apply this to my dermatitis while at work, and no one was the wiser.  When I got home I followed up with some Pond&#x27;s dry skin hypoallergenic cold cream, and crossed my fingers when I crawled into bed.    The next morning, I woke up to find my dermatitis flaking off and whole, clear skin beneath.  It was amazing.  I instantly bought my own jar, and am now waiting to see if it&#x27;ll work as well on scars and bruises -- but really, even if it doesn&#x27;t, the damage control for patches of dry skin makes it well worth the investment.    I generally have very good skin and don&#x27;t use any sort of product on my face, but I now use Egyptian Magic if I see I&#x27;m starting to flake or just look a bit run-down -- maybe once a week.  A very thin layer, massaged into my face at night, and I&#x27;m good as new in the morning.  I&#x27;m not 100% committed to EM, and use the Pond&#x27;s cold cream on roughly the same schedule, butthat&#x27;s because Pond&#x27;s is 1/4th the price of EM.  I&#x27;ll probably start using EM more as I get older (my skin&#x27;s starting to dry out and scars more easily now), but for now it&#x27;s a great general refresher and a total lifesaver for embarrassing, persistent dry skin.</li>
            <li> Kinda greasy. Didnt really help with my eczema</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Mama Medicine&#x27;s Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic.  They are both oily to start with, but for me, Egyptian Magic absorbs more readily.  My hands are frequently chapped from frequent washing while cooking, and EM really helps.  I can only use Bee Magic if I&#x27;m covering my hands and going to bed; otherwise, it ends up all over everything. EM absorbs in a few minutes and I can be back at the computer without getting it greasy.  I&#x27;ve used it as a lip balm as well.</li>
            <li> Best cream I ever use</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews listed here, I decided to give this cream a shot. I battle with dry skin due to the climate and elevation here in Colorado. I have tried several products that usually cause clogging after use yet doesn&#x27;t alleviate the dryness at all. This one has worked wonders! I was a little worried once I received the jar simply because at first look it appears to be a little greasy. Fortunately, my skin loves it! Every time I use it I love the way my skin feels all throughout the day. I have been also using it on my scalp and hair. It works well there also. A little goes a long way so I think its well worth the price. $30 bucks is a small price to pay for great skin--and it&#x27;s my face--I&#x27;m only going to get one and I expect that this cream will keep it looking fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and  have nearly perfect skin but my skin is also extremely sensitive to creams and facial washes. I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find the perfect cream and cleanser because I have absolutely no facial regime but I would like to have one to help prevent the signs of aging. I read hundreds of reviews before settling for this product and I tried it for about a week before I had to stop due to the break out I was getting. The break out was in the form of small bumps (not pimples or acne) but I assume that this was the result of excessive oil buildup just below the surface of the skin. This product seems to work for people with dry and acne-prone skin. My skin neither dry nor oily and I have never dealt with acne (thanks to good genes because my diet sucks).    However, I did have very good luck with using the product for my hair.My hair is wavy, thick, and frizzy (bad genes here). I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of the frizzyness without using a flat iron, curling iron, or some heat-appliance for hair and I&#x27;ve tried products like CHI, Bio Silk, John Frieda, Bed Head, Hemp, etc, etc. Nothing has done the trick until now. After washing my hair, I take a fair amount (because I have ultra thick hair) of the product, rub it between my hands, then apply  it to my hair. The product only works when I apply it  to my hair while it is still wet/toweled dry; if I apply it when my hair is dry then it just makes my hair look greasy. Hopes this help</li>
            <li> Great on dry skin-hands, arms, legs. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Also using on scars from an operation. My scars have lightened up and is much smoother. Great that it&#x27;s all natural too! Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> great product....works really nicely ......a little disappointed in size of product. kind of small for the price... but over all quite pleased.........will purchase again........</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and matches description.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Not pleased with the price however. But I went to Belize and was exposed to severe sand fleas, intense sun in June and since I am a scuba diver 5 hours or more a day of salt water immersion. This salve is the one product I am thankful I brought. Unfortunately I only took half the jar and left remains at home. But what a nice salve to come home to!! Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this magic lotion for my very dry and old looking hands.  For me, so far, the results are temporary and I see no difference overall (other than for the first 10 or 15 minutes).  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as I thought  a $30 jar of magic would do the trick.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and if anything extraordinary happens I&#x27;ll post another review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on a dark patch on my elbow for a few weeks. I have not seen any difference so the cream did not work magic for me. I do like the bee wax smell of the cream. Also, though it feels very rich, the cream is not greasy on the skin. Overal it is a good hand/foot moiserizing cream, but nothing magic.</li>
            <li> I bought it to reduce my pimples but it&#x27;s so oily that I got a lot of whiteheads in the region between my eyes and nose!!! And those won&#x27;t go away now!! before you buy it test your skin if you are suitable for it!!</li>
            <li> i love this product. smooth my scar and I also see the different in my bf face. He used to have a lot of acne. I found out costco sell this product too for $45 for a 4oz and 2oz. good deal. I recommend this product to everyone with bad skin.</li>
            <li> I first heard about the Egyptian Magic from Youtube. So I thought, let me research on it. I did and read so many reviews by others. So I knew the product will probably be good. Yes it was! I have dry skin... like all over. Plus, I have this bumply skin condition which looks like a rash gone bad, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s like a bunch of bumps (similar to razor burns or so). I thought, hey, this may be my cure for those bumply bumps! I rumb the magic into my palms like stated in the directions and then I massage it into my bumps(arms and legs). It didn&#x27;t look like any difference at the first couple of minutes, but later it looked like the bumps were not bumps anymore. It was as though they kinda vanished.    Also, I used this \\&quot;MAGIC\\&quot; on my stretch marks. It totally lighten my marks. I will sure recommend this product to anyone who isn&#x27;t allergic to BEE&#x27;s, a person with stretch marks, a person with the bumply stuff that I have, and a person who just wants beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to rave about something after just one night, but this stuff is awesome!  I have very senstive, blemish-prone facial skin which has been suffering from rashiness since the beginning of the summer. Prescription creams, gels and pills have been used with good result, but Egyptian Magic is an ultimate soother.  Normally I&#x27;d break out from anything too heavy/greasy but I followed instructions on the package and used all over my face last night to see what it could do.  2 big blemishes are almost completely healed over with significantly reduced swelling and tenderness; redness in my formerly rashy spots is diminished and my skin feels great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The jar looks a little different from what it should be. It reads \\&quot;The Ancient Egyptians...\\&quot; And the words are kind of vague. The cream is very oily, and it even feels oilier than Vaseline on my face! I am curious about how the real product should work, but I will definitely never buy it again, ever. I can&#x27;t believe I bought a fake on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  If I could rave about it for days, I would.  I have tried products with mineral oil and products with cocoa butter and both have left me horribly broken out with an allergic reaction.  This product leaves my skin glowing and healthy-looking, and radiant.  Plus, some scars that I have had for YEARS have finally started to heal.  Try this product if you need something to help chronically dry skin.  IT IS EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> This product works great on my rough feet.  I use it everyday to smooth my dry skin.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> For our daughter&#x27;s hands. Only thing which helps her allergy to plastics</li>
            <li> I got this item after reading all the positive reviews.This is a total waste of money!!!Don&#x27;t buy it.It does not even do the basic work of moisturizing dry skin.This is going back.</li>
            <li> very dry area of the country..we rely on good, natural products like this one that sinks in yet doesn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the fact that it was highly rated plus there were so many people raving about it.  I ignored the price and bought it.  I was fully prepared for the appearance and what to do to emulsify the cream before applying but what I didn&#x27;t expect was the smell!  Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells but this was so offensive, I almost gagged.  I could not put it on my face and could not keep it on my hands.  So, for anyone who might be sensitive to scents, beware.</li>
            <li> i use this everyday in MN winters!  it is the best product by far for dry skin.  (besides a derm prescription)  i use this on my dry face in the winter, along with elbows, hands, legs, everything.  my son has eczema and it works great for him too.  no overpowering smell.  no harmful chemicals.  i like buying on amazon because it is cheaper than whole foods. i recommend it to everyone who complains of dry skin.  buy it today and a jar will last a long time (unless you use daily like me) but then you wont mind paying the $30.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for many reasons. This product does so much, I use it as a lip balm, hand/cuticle cream, night cream, and I have even used it on my hair for the fly-aways &amp; for slicking back strays for a sleek pony tail. But best of all it saved me $$ for not purchasing a product to use on my recent permanent eyeliner (tattoo). It looks greasy but you need very little, rub hands together and it melts into an oil.  Use very little.</li>
            <li> i think they must put a little bit of magic in the jar ;-)  it does everything that it is advertised to do.  so simple but, soooo AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me at Whole Foods when they ran out of California Baby cream.  I&#x27;ve had eczema and skin allergies my whole life, and they get pretty bad during winter since it&#x27;s so dry and cold.  I put it on my typical problem areas for prevention but also on any flare ups.  I carry the container in my purse and as soon as I feel dryness/itching I put it on.  It works immediately to make the hives/wheals disappear.  Plus it makes my skin super soft, so bonus :D  While the price is a bit much, the consistency makes it last long since it spreads nicely once you warm it on your skin.   The main complaint I&#x27;m reading from people here is the consistency and the smell.  Everybody needs to look at ingredients before they purchase something - It&#x27;s olive oil, and forms of honey/beeswax etc with synthetic fragrance added.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be creamy, and it&#x27;s not supposed to have a strong, chemically enhanced smell.  If you want a product that&#x27;s filled with chemicals and has a strong enough smell to fill a room, go to Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  If you want a product that heals your skin and helps with skin allergies, stick with this.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer. Goes on clear- it&#x27;s kind of in a block in the tub. It&#x27;ll melt if it gets hot enough. I love it and use it on super dry skin- especially in the winter. I read some other reviews thinking it&#x27;d be a good scar cream. It treats scars like an intensive moisturizer. So it is good for getting better looking and healthier skin, but it is not going to have the same effects as a scar cream like Mederma. Definitely improved my skin quality and this stuff really does last forever.</li>
            <li> In search of a moisture that did not dry my skin and I finally found it! This cream turned my extra dry skin from sand paper to baby soft in less than one week. This cream has made the qulaity of my life so much better. It is all natural and goes on nice and smooth! Feels great on the skin, not all sticky or greasy! The lotions recommended by dermatologists for my chronic dry skin: cethaphil, aveeno, luberiderm, vaseline, made my skin super dry and itchy! With the Magic cream, I am no longer itchy! So, if you are experiencing chronic dry skin with patches, itchiness and flakiness, I HIGHLY recommend you give this a try! It is expensive, but is so so worth it....</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I use on my skin. I get regular facials and peels, use products like Murad and Clarisonic. I had read quite about this cream and was curious.  The first time I used it I only put on my feet. A few nights later I started putting on my face before I go to bed.  I was a little hesitant, concerned it would be too much even for my dry skin.  I didn&#x27;t wake up to greasy pillows or a face full of breakouts.  In fact, I really like what it&#x27;s done for my skin, especially during the dry winter weather. I even slathered it on before I went out to shovel snow so that I wouldn&#x27;t come inside parched and irritated.  Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Very Good Night Cream! Your skin will clear after using this for 2 weeks.I love this Cream and will buy again</li>
            <li> This works really great as a night cream; my skin feels so soft  the next day. I used it on a some cuts and scrapes, which helped it heal nicely.  Also good as a hair pomade.  Really great cream for dry hands, nails, and cuticles.  Great product, and so many uses.</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews...I was so excited to try this cream. Unfortunately, it did not help my dry eczema-proned skin. The consistency is very thick like a chapstick but quickly melts when rubbed in between fingers. The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t seem to soak into the skin, but more just sat on top of it.     It also caused me to get little white zits on my face and chest and upper-back...which I normally never get.    Worked great on my son&#x27;s dry arms and legs!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of Egyptian Magic. I purchased my first jar from another website and that one was way better than this one I ordered from Amazon. This one has a different odor, color, and consistency. This one does not become oily so easily even after rubbing it between my hands. It stays like a wax. I think I will purchase the other one next time. It definitely helps reduce acne (zits, milia-like acne, and any other pimples). It does not however, reduce scars of any kind. It is also very moisturizing and great as a night cream. Because it is so greasy it will not work as day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how this cream works/doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll never know - I can&#x27;t get over the awful smell.  Simply horrid.  I had to return.  Sorry Egyptian Magic... I tried.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read about this product was what helped me to decide to give it a try.     When I received the jar of Egyptian Magic Cream I thought that the jar looked generic looking. The actual cream looks more like petroleum jelly than cream. While it may look like petroleum jelly, it is much more healthy for your skin than petroleum jelly would be.    I had noticed that my hands were starting to show age. When I would be driving and my hands were on the steering wheel, I could see how the skin would wrinkle and just looked old. I have only been using this cream for less than 2 weeks but I have notice a huge difference already. My hands actually look a lot younger.     So since it was doing such a good job on my hands within a short time I started applying it on my lips and on the skin above the lip. I am seeing my lips looking softer and fuller as well as the skin above my lip is smoother. This cream is turning out to be a really good buy. The results I have already gotten in such a short time is truly amazing. This will be a staple for me from now on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cause a breakout, but too heavy for my face. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my skin. I now use essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is worth every penny. I use it for rough skin and stretch marks and it works wonders. My skin is noticeably softer and the stretch marks are slowly and surely fading. A little bit goes a long way and the results makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this after reading all the rave reviews and have been looking for a minimally processed face cream with royal jelly. I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated/acne prone and oily. I also have celiacs and A LOT of beauty products have gluten in them which is what i&#x27;m sensitive to. A couple days before this product arrived I developed a sebaceous cyst in my cheek the size of a golf ball. I lanced and drained it but the area was still swollen and bright red (and embarrassing). After 1 night of applying this product the cyst was almost completely healed (along with all the other tiny blemishes along my jaw line). I even applied this cream to my chest and back post work out at the gym and all the little red bumps cleared up. The product smells sweet with the honey in it and royal jelly is amazing for your skin as well as a nutritional supplement. My hair is badly damaged so I&#x27;m excited to try it as a hair balm as well. I HIGHLY recommend this product. I DID use it under my make up but I would suggest applying a very small amount to DAMP skin so that the product is absorbed and assimilated in the skin much faster. My skin glowed and my make up wore VERY evenly all day. BE AWARE- if you are allergic to bees you could have an allergic reaction to this product because of the bee by-products.</li>
            <li> Why many people liked it? I guess it is Magic in that sense. Ugly package, bad smell and waxy uneasy feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it to even out the tone in my very dry legs.  It didn&#x27;t help as much as I thought with moisture.  My legs were still dry in the morning.  It is also a VERY SMALL jar. It lasted only two weeks and I used it ALMOST every night. Most of my other creams last months. I think it did help with my tone and uneven dark marks but it could be me wanting it to really bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother dry hands and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have given a jar to two of my friends and they love it too.  Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> I have had alot of problems with my eyelids.  After I clean them at night, I use this product and it works well.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my face!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  Stays on lips all night and they don&#x27;t feel dry in the morning.  My daughters are also using it after they tried mine.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I even have mu husband use it. I would recommend it to anyone, even for a rash.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine article several years ago that many movie stars (Madonna included)swear by this stuff. I bought some and started using it. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It sort of had this greasy feel, so I stopped using it. I threw it in my drawer for almost 3 years. Last summer we ran into some serious financial problems and had no extra money. I couldn&#x27;t buy my normal moisturizer and had to use what I had. I felt really sorry for myself! I started using Egytian Magic every morning under my makeup. I used another greasy coco butter product on my face at night. I did not like the texture of either product but I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it as I was just too short of cash to buy anything else. I was miserable!  Well, it took about a month, but I was amazed with the results!! At first it seemed like I was breaking out. Like all of this junk was coming out of my skin. Then, the most amazing thing started happening. People started telling me how young I look. Not just one or two people .... but many many people ... everywhere I went! Friends that I had known for years asked me my secret! I did not know if this was because of the Egypian Magic or the Coco Butter goo that I was using. Then, I ran out of the Egyptian Magic and stopped using it for about a month. I was amazed when people started telling me that I didn&#x27;t look very good. They would ask me if I was having a rough time because I looked so tired. My best friend actually told me that I looked a little haggard. I started using the product again and will never stop using it! The other day I actually had a man in his 30&#x27;s ask me out on a date!! I was floored! I am almost 50 years old! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I have a son that is in his 30&#x27;s. I LOVE this stuff! Give it a try ... but you have to be patient! You may break out at first. But, if you hang in there for a month or so ... you may have found your miricle wrinkle cure!! [[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I used this product as a night cream, and after a few days i started to break out. Then I tried to use the cream for my scars but it has done nothing for them. But other then that, its a great lip balm.</li>
            <li> Heard this product has great function, works for many types of fucntions. So far, it cure my dry skin, and it&#x27;s my biggest problem. I bought 2 in one time, almost finished one, will keep continue use.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, the texture and application process is a little weird. It is something you have to get used, if you apply too much your face can feel very greasy. It looks like butter and melts like it as well, when you scoop it up it melts and turns into an oil, put a small amount on your face. It also has an interesting smell its nothing bad just different. It is a great product, I absolutely love it. It has helped with my acne greatly. I have tried countless products which would excessively dry my skin. This leaves my skin nice and soft and helps keep my acne under control when I use it. The seller was also great promptly sent me the product, I received it quickly and began to use it right away. Works very well for me and all natural cant beat that!</li>
            <li> an excellent beauty product that really smooths and sooths my face and neck. I use it in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this product, but I think it&#x27;s too oily for my combination skin. Not recommended if your skin is oily or combination.</li>
            <li> No better than vaseline.</li>
            <li> This oil has done wonders for my skin. Before I started using this oil, my skin was really dry and sun damaged, but overtime, I can see my damage healing and my skin becoming very soft. It melts on your skin as soon as you put it on. It is great and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I would given this zero star. This cream smell like leftover food. It&#x27;s gross!! The packaging is unattractive. The color and texture are disgusting. After seeing so many good reviews raving about how amazing this it. I thought I give it a try. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. This is just olive oil. It does absolutely nothing to my skin. Not only it feels so greasy on my face, it does not absorb. When I woke up my skin is still dry and cracking, while this cream is just sitting on my skin. When I apply this to my face, it just feels like I put cooking oil on my face. It mess up my hair, my pillows and my clothes. I also get a really bad breakouts after using this product. NOT WORTH IT. I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and natural. It&#x27;s made my skin so smooth, stains have practically disappeared. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I purchase this magic cream just for a try. I heard someone talked about it before. When it arrived, I found  it was so large and I dont know when I could use it up. The cream is very oily. I do not suggest people with oil skin use it...  My skin is neutral. And when I put it on my face in the night, I still feel very oily.  Next morning I found the cream is totally absorbed after the whole night and my skin looks great! the good thing is this cream is effective in refreshing your skin, if you could bear your oily skin all night. It is a good and effective product. But I think I would only use it in someday but not everyday because it is too oil...</li>
            <li> I received this product recently and at first I thought it was great. Then one morning I woke up with severely swollen eyes. it took me a while, but I figured out it was the cream. I&#x27;m allergic to bees and this product contains bees wax and bee pollen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years- I really appreciate the simplicity and healing properties. It&#x27;s a terrific lip and dry skin balm. It&#x27;s fairly thick with an creamy/oily consistency, but it&#x27;s water soluble and not goopy.  I haven&#x27;t used it for some of the other recommended uses, but I would trust that it could be beneficial for other purposes as well.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moLDXLKNRKW8H7]]</li>
            <li> Best cream ever.  I have severely dry skin all of a sudden.  Kind of eczema-like v. an allergic reaction.  Prescription creams did not remotely help as much as egyptian magic did.  I&#x27;m a believer.  It&#x27;s basically like vaseline with olive oil.  A little bit goes a very long way.  So while it is pricey, it will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for months now and have barely made a dent.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My skin looks and feels so much better now. I&#x27;m a mom to a teenage daughter so I ordered a second jar for her, and she loves it- it&#x27;s helping to clear her acne so we will continue to use regularly....Very happy with the results....</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin where I would have a pimple here and there and the common blackheads around the nose area if the lotions/creams I use aren&#x27;t agreeing with my skin. I also have a mild case of eczema so for a while, I was using Sarna with a few drops of Jojoba oil mixed together for my face and hands. However, Egyptian Magic has done wonders for my face!!! It smells lightly of olive oil and moisturizes my face like nothing ever has. I have not had a single pimple since using this and it&#x27;s been about a week now. The annoying blackheads have been reduced to the point of where I don&#x27;t notice or think about them and the flakiness from winter weather has disappeared from my face. Makeup goes on smoother and there are less blemishes to cover up. What&#x27;s not to love? Well, my hands seem to need more than just Egyptian Magic. For those interested in THE BEST hand moisturizer/protector, try Working Hands. It&#x27;s cheap and it works!!! Oh yes, you may want to wash Egyptian Magic off your hands before you touch your hair. Although it is probably good for your hair, if you plan on going out, it can make it look and feel a bit greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this &#x27;cream&#x27;, you can feel completely safe and confident about absorbing all of them through your skin into your body, with no toxicity at all.  All are 100% natural and safe.( Not much on the market you can really say that about.)    That being said, I am not finding this as absorbable as I had hoped. Other folks are saying that if you put it on before bedtime, it&#x27;s all absorbed overnight... that&#x27;s not my experience.  Frankly, I&#x27;m finding that pure shea butter (and I mean the real unadulterated stuff from Africa, not some lotion that claims it as an ingredient) absorbs and moisturizes better.  However, it must also be said that the Egyptian Magic has a more pleasant scent than real, pure, unbleached shea butter, and also glides on with greater ease.  So for delicate skin that you don&#x27;t want to pull on, say, around the eyes, the E.M. might be a better choice.  In fact,(and I say this as someone who was a professional massage therapist for many years) the glide and consistency of this stuff is good enough that you could even use it for giving a massage, if you wish.</li>
            <li> wow, my local Whole Foods store recommended as a Staff Pick....so i ordered it and basically it just makes my face really greasy.  A waste of money, i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived it wasn&#x27;t sealed in plastic and didn&#x27;t have a seal under the lid. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is the real thing. I was told that there are some counterfeit Egyptian Magic dealers on Amazon and packaging is what to look for.</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this but it made me break out.  this may be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have acne prone skin but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son suffers from both acne and eczema on his face.  He was having a bad eczema breakout on his face, when I found this product. It cleared up the eczema within about two days, and also improved his acne.  He loves the product and now uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the hype or celebrity endorsements...this is an olive oil based product with beeswax, and some royal jelly, honey and other somewhat natural ingredients...that&#x27;s the good news...the bad news is that it is  way hyped up here in the Amazon ratings...probably by sellers...IMHO,that is.  It takes a long time to penetrate..so apply well before bedtime...no miraculous advantages over applying olive oil from the bottle.  Good product..way overpriced based on claims of Magic.</li>
            <li> really nice cream for the growing tummy.  I also have been using on my face due to dry winter skin.  I have very sensitive skin, but this product appears safe and gentle on my skin - no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read about this cream in a magazine and it was supposed to be the best cream ever for any dry skin. I found it to be a little greasy and not especially great.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I don&#x27;t use it every day i use it every time i exfoliate on my face and  i stick just putting it on at night. I dislike that this product is greasy but it truly does wonders for your skin. I had a breast augmentation and since the skin streched i got a scar right in the middle of my chest. My friend would tell me it looked like i got open heart surgery. I started applying this product on the mark and it started fading you cant even see it any more, this was with me using it twice a day i didn&#x27;t mind it since it was on my chest and not my face. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and how incredibly soft ur face feels in the morning after everything is absorbed by your skin! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I checked label, it says wonderful. I thought it might be wonderful because Egypt has long history and culture.&lt;br /&gt;However, I started tring it for more than 3 weeks, nothing improved for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;No comments for this product.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever. I use it at night and by morning my skin is soft, younger looking and looks refreshed. It helps combat redness and irritation as well. I would not recommend this as a day moisturizer, especially during summer; it might be too rich. But this cream is perfect for night time!</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this product to me and I really like it.  It make my face feels like two or three years ago when I was 18 or 19 years old.  I will buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a good product.  Why? Because the main ingredient is olive oil which has long been a standard product used in beauty products for centuries.  Why you would you want to spend $30 for 4 oz of it?  My advice- buy a good bottle of extra virgin olive oil and use it the same way you use this product.  Try it and see what you think.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!  I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS SPECIALLY AROUND MY EYES EVERY NIGHT AND IT KEEPS IS IN GOOD SHAPE,  AND IN WINTER IS UNBEATEABLE,  THE PROTECTION IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, a bit too heavy even as night cream for face, or for hair. I use it on my feet</li>
            <li> Oil too, like China clams oil. I really do not know whether there...I think I will not buy it, unless he made magic</li>
            <li> This comes as a solid product that turns into oil in your hands. It&#x27;s sort of heavy so I don&#x27;t wear it out or under make up. I will if I&#x27;m staying around the house and every night before bed. It definitely keeps dry skin away. My sister was having severe dry skin irritation. Her skin would puff up and look literally cracked in some areas and Egyptian Magic worked for her. I don&#x27;t know how effective it is on scars, because I do have acne scars and it hasn&#x27;t reduced them much, but it is definitely amazing with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner EVER!!!!!!Even though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week. But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li> This may be the best skin cream I have ever tried.  I ordered it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and she wasn&#x27;t wrong.  I use it all over but especially on a recent surgical scar on my knee.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works like magic</li>
            <li> Within the past 18 years, I&#x27;ve bought and tried EVERYTHING on the market along with prescription medication for the eczema on my feet. OMG! I received my Egyptian Magic in the mail yesterday, tried it and this morning I can tell you I&#x27;m a happy camper. The results are amazing and I&#x27;m certainly a believer in this product. After doing some research on the product and learning what all it can do.......no household should be without it! I never buy anything without going to Amazon.com and reading the reviews......that&#x27;s how I found this product. I typed in Eczema and with all the products that came up...Egyptian Magic had the best reviews. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product with it&#x27;s many purposes. Wow! What a deal!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, delicate skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it!  I love that it has so few ingredients.  I apply it to wet skin to thin it out and help seal in the hydration.  My skin feel soft afterwards and stays hydrated longer than the high end moisturizers I have tried.  Definitely worth a try if you have been looking for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> WOW! It looks like Vaseline, smells faintly of herbal tea, feels like oil but melts into the skin and disappears. It really absorbs right in with no greasy after feel. I have combination/sensitive skin and it really balances everything out. I am VERY picky about what goes on my face, but this stuff is amazing!!! I work in skin care so I have tried everything- I am now a convert. I ran a little through my dry hair too, just to see what it would do, and it totally tames frizz and adds tons of shine. I am truly stumped. As my grandmother jokingly used to say..\\&quot;how do it know?\\&quot; This stuff seriously works.</li>
            <li> Within a eek of using this on my scars, they have visibly lightened. A friend of mine said she uses this under her eyes so I&#x27;m going to try that next. It leaves my face feeling very smooth and I love how it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched many years for a cream or lotion that really keeps my skin moist and prevents scaliness and fissures during the winter. This product is worth the rather high cost. I apply it at bedtime to my face, hands, and arms. Even though it feels greasy at the time, I awaken to smooth and moist skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> At first,  i was disapointed with the vaseline feel and greasy feeling.  Use it at night and see how your skin sucks in all the yummy ingredients.  It makes my skin supple and ready for makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had read that this was the secret to the stars and was basically an all over miracle worker.  I&#x27;m still trying to ascertain what the hub bub is all about.  It was a little too greasy for me to use on my hands, face or body - no matter how little I used.  I did end up using a teeny bit rubbed over both my hands to smooth my hair but it doesn&#x27;t really smell very good so I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about having moderately stinky hair.  I think that it might be good used as a heel cream but I never have gotten that far with it.  I guess as my mother would have said, \\&quot;Different strokes for different folks\\&quot;.  On the plus side, I found a great price here and the shipment was super quick but as far as the product goes - I didn&#x27;t hate it.  I didn&#x27;t love it.  It just wasn&#x27;t magic for me, Egyptian or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream and love it. It lasts forever and is fairly-priced! I definitely saw a difference the next morning. Very economical night cream but I do recommend using some serums for added effect before using this cream.</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased this for the first time.  I have used many expensive creams.  I still use my favorite moisturizer and then apply this on top.  My skin was looking dehydrated and had fine lines.  This smooths those lines out.  It is great on elbows and feet as well.  Before you apply it put it in your hand and rub it until it melts into an oil.  Apply it to your skin.  My skin does not feel greasy.  This sinks right in.  My skin feels so smooth afterwards.  It&#x27;s the only product that has smoothed out my fine lines.  I don&#x27;t have true wrinkles.  My skin is just really dehydrated.  This is great on your chest and on any scars.  Many stars use this but I don&#x27;t care about that.  It works and that&#x27;s all I care about.  It will last forever too.  My skin is prone to acne on my chin, even though I&#x27;m almost 40.  This has not caused any acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;Egyptian Magic\\&quot; when I saw the wonderful results that it had on a girlfriend of mine.  I like the product because it is quite versatile.  I not only use it on my face and neck, but I use it as a hair balm (in little bits) as well.  It makes my hair smooth and helps keep it straight when I blow dry it. It can also be used as under eye cream and hand softener. I love the fact that it is a natural product made with mostly olive oil.  The down side of the product, is that it is quite oily and can clog my facial pores.  It doesn&#x27;t mix too well with make up.  Over all, I would recommend it, but it isn&#x27;t the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it to soften my skin especially my face. Its not enough to use all over and if you do you will use it so fast that you will have to buy a new one soon. I hate the fact that its so expensive but I would buy it again. I stick to dove and aveeno for my body.</li>
            <li> The best way to review this product is to explain what all it has done for me: clears up my bruises (immediately!); deeply moisturizes my face; cured my dry elbows and knees (NEVER have to use it there anymore); soaks into the skin rather than rests on the skin like lotions; makes my whole body and face GLOW bright and beautiful; gives my dry-dead-ends (hair) a conditioning affect; firms my skin; and leaves my skin silky;     BUT don&#x27;t use this cream as a cure for severe acne, it won&#x27;t cure acne; it will relieve acne of stress if you put it on at night, and it will moisturize the skin. I would recommend putting it on at night because it&#x27;s really thick like Vaseline, so you wouldn&#x27;t want that on during the day, BUT it will firm and hydrate your skin over night like MAGIC.</li>
            <li> i get a rash frequently on my ring finger. the rash can be quite scaly and painful at times, not sure if it&#x27;s eczema, water trapped in the rings, or an allergic reaction or what, but putting a bit of this cream on it really helps to ease the pain, reduce redness/scaliness, and moisturize. i can actually wear my rings now on a regular basis, thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was drawn to Egyption Magic because of its natural ingredients, however, it did not work for me because it broke my face out pretty bad. Unfortunately i have lost the receipt and can not get my monry back. I also think that the product is way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and had no wrinkles before this product. I&#x27;m not sure what it was, but shortly after using this product my skin became very dull and dry. As a result of a complete lack of moisture in my skin, I started to get wrinkles! 21 years old with winkles??? Really unbelievable. I hadn&#x27;t changed anything about my skin routine besides my moisturizer and I started using a mask every couple of weeks. The first few times I used it at night my skin looked and felt lovely in the morning, but now my skin feels and looks awful all the time. I also have many more raised black head than I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably only going to use this stuff at night now, because my skin gets oily AND DRY if I use it during the day. How can that happen if it&#x27;s oil based?? I was really excited to use such a natural product, but now I just want my money back!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about a month ago. I put it all over my face and neck after I wash my face at night.  I am 21 years old and I have had problem skin almost my whole life-- dryness in some areas, oil in some areas, and stubborn acne. My skin is now flawless since using this product. My face is so smooth and luminous. I don&#x27;t get breakouts anymore and the texture of my skin is so even now-- no more oil in some parts and dryness in others-- it&#x27;s all perfectly soft and smooth. I would highly recommend this product. It is truly magical. As a side note-- I had a sunburn last week from being at the beach and I put this product on my shoulders and neck where the burn was-- it was completely gone the next morning. AMAZING PRODUCT. 5 stars. Buy it now--- it&#x27;s completely worth the money. It will change your life.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of secret Egyptian needs. I can&#x27;t tell you what they are because it&#x27;s a secret. But if I coukd, I would tell you that this stuff fixed them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item after reading about it in a magazine. It works terrific keeping your skin soft protecting it against the elements. NB it is not a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with severe acne all through HS and into my early 20&#x27;s.  Long story short- My face , for the most part, was finally CLEAR.  I decided to buy this cream to get rid of my acne scars that I have had since HS. This cream is very thick- same consistency as vaseline. It made my face feel very very smooth, BUT I broke out like crazy!! And still, 2 months later, I have still not been able to completely clear my face up again.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream on my legs and dry skin until it&#x27;s gone because it was expensive and I don&#x27;t want to waste it. SO, if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts I DO NOT recommend this for your face.  If your going to use it as a skin cream- lube up! It leaves your skin feeling extra hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li> I try to live as \\&quot;cleanly\\&quot; as I can by using natural, organic products. I work in cancer treatment and we give this in sample form to our patients. I really, really wanted to love this product! Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t. I have been using it on my kids who are prone to very dry skin and eczema, to no avail. My youngest had to finally go the doctor and get a prescription after using this for weeks. It&#x27;s like it never absorbs into the skin. I think it would be great to protect the skin from the cold, but definitely not to heal dry skin. I am so disappointed especially considering  the cost of this stuff!  Pediatrician recommended Cetaphil lotion (in the tub) but I&#x27;m not crazy about it being a petroleum product. Well...the search goes on.</li>
            <li> received the product promptly and the product is wonderful. I would recommend this item to anyone  that has any skin problems.</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy and didn&#x27;t at all moisturizer my or my child&#x27;s skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years..  I even use this on my face.  Several years ago I have radiation on my face and it left my skin very dry. Use this after a shower when you can let it soak in.</li>
            <li> While reading through a People&#x27;s Magazine I saw that Goldie Hawn and her daughter would not want to be without  this product. My thoughts were that if they liked it that much, then perhaps I would as well.  I deal with Lupus and a form that attacks the skin and my skin was pretty bad.  What not give it a try.  Got delivery right away and started using it on my legs, feet and forearms.  What a difference.  Like night and day.  This my new BBF.</li>
            <li> I have begun to use this product and I will look forward to results in about another month or so, but delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, I find that it helps clear up breakouts and any cuts..  Also, EM is a good makeup remover and helps with moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use this at morning and at night. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this on my hands, because I find the product to be incredibly greasy.  Even using it on just my hands, I have to wipe the excess grease off to avoid leaving it on everything I touch.  Perhaps best used in connection with wearing gloves to bed at night for extreme treatment.  I would never use this type of product for facial purposes.  To me, it is very similar to using Vaseline.</li>
            <li> This is an all-natural, thick cream that feels more like an oil when rubbed with your hands. It goes on smooth, but is very thick--too thick for day use, but just right for a nightly rejuvenation. I also use it on my lips (day &amp; night), a tiny bit on unruly hair frizz, and even on minor scrapes (no broken skin). I find that it helps heal faster, and has worked wonders on minor burns as well. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and has an odd, earthy, but not unpleasant smell to it. I am definitely satisfied with this product for my uses.  It is a bit pricey compared to other moisturizers, but a little bit truly goes a long way. And it&#x27;s natural! Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> A little about me:  -My reason for buying: to use as a moisturizer for my face and treat ends of my hair  -My skin type: Combination (Oily t-zone (acne prone) and normal cheeks and chin)  -No skin conditions and No allergies      My experience with EM:    First two days were fine. Made my skin smooth and hydrated. On the third day, I had spots on both cheeks and chin (itchy red pimples and dry flakey cheeks mainly around those itchy pimples).  I thought it was odd, so,  I tried using a clay mask to get rid of the spots, and I noticed that no oil of any kind came from around the breakout area. So, I stopped using the EM since it was the newest facial product that I tried. Then, I tried my old facial cleanser (Note: Cleanser that I used while using EM was Botanics deep skin brightening cleanser. The one I switched to was Clean and Clear Deep cream cleanser) and it cleared up the dry spots and blemishes overnight by about 40%. So, I tried the EM again, and my face didn&#x27;t break out. It kept it very hydrated and works great!     What I use it for now:    - Nighty moisturizer for face  - Lip balm  - Cuticles  - Hand Moisturizer  - Heal scars (works best on recent scars from what I&#x27;ve seen)  - Eye cream  - Treatment for ends of hair       My pro and con list:    Pros:  - Works well for all the things mentioned in list above  - Lasts a LONG time  - 6 natural ingredients   - Not water based, so consistency doesn&#x27;t change much    Cons:  - Smells faintly like iron (personally doesn&#x27;t bother me)  - Packaging is very cheap looking   - Pricey (especially for those using it for skin condition)  - Comes in a tub (Unsanitary)        My verdict: LOVE IT! I&#x27;m probably going to use this for the rest of my life so long as they make it as is or better. So, I definitely recommend Egyptian Magic, but only if you have a good enough cleanser! (And remember, I used a drugstore brand!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I have problem skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and have noticed a lot less redness and discoloration.    I also use it on the ends of my hair to tame fly-aways.  My hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and even adds shine.  This product will be a part of my daily beauty routine from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using it at my brother&#x27;s house.  He said it sped up the healing time on cold sores when he got them and that he had used it on new tattoos to speed the healing as well and he really like it.  I ordered it for myself after reading all the reviews on amazon and other web-sites and I can honestly say it is a great multipurpose product.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with break outs and even though it has olive oil in it, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out more.  My skin has actually improved.  I use it at night after washing my face with my usual face cleanser and I wake up with my face looking so well rested and just glowing.  I&#x27;ve acutally had complements on my face lately.  People have told me that I look really pretty and even younger, but they can&#x27;t point out why, they just say something is different.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the fact that my skin is clearer and my little lines that were starting to form around my eyes and my forehead do seem less visible.  It also makes the red left after a pimple go away so much faster.  Aside from my skin I also use a little bit in my hair and my hair now looks glossier and feels so soft.  Plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair product causing my face to break out if I sleep on my hair or something, cause hey! it&#x27;s the same stuff I use on my face already!  Also, my little girls are half black, so their hair required the extra moisture and hair grease and this product does the job.  Their hair looks shiny and feels really soft.  And, because when you rub the product in your hands it turns into an oil-like consistency it&#x27;s really easy to spread evenly throughout their scalp and hair without accidentally leaving clumps of the product in one area which is what happens to me with other hair grease sometimes.    It&#x27;s an awesome product!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> hi   it&#x27;s not my first time that i used this product it&#x27;s really helpful . i had eczema for along time and i tried almost every things until i saw this product and i decided to try it .after using this cream for five months My skin become soft and return to normal .   so thanks amazon for this great product .</li>
            <li> This product smells very nice; just like honey! It&#x27;s very good for my cracked heels (due to excessive sandal and flip flop wear in the summer) but not good for the face. I read in reviews that this product was good for acne and acne scars but apparently not for me! I put this on my face at night and it makes my face extremely oily. After 2 nights of using this, I broke out all over my face a  couple of days before graduation! Other than using this on my feet, I have on idea what other stuff I can use this for. I don&#x27;t have dry skin and scars so yeah... kind of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay. Very oily and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people with oily skin. Don&#x27;t see the magic in it and the jar was too big since I only used it for a couple of times.</li>
            <li> This is the second one. I use it twice everyday, morning and night. I am dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to others. Will use it in the future.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin, I can see the benefits, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  Use it as a night cream and it&#x27;ll be great, but too heavy to use in the mornings for all day wear.</li>
            <li> the only thing i can say is that it works as long as you have it and use it wen you run out well...good luck.</li>
            <li> Its not to oily feeling and goes on smooth and absorb in the skin.  It&#x27;s great for the whole body including the face if you have dry skin.  I put it on my face at night and my skin feels so good the next morning.</li>
            <li> The jar I received says \\&quot;The Ancient Egyptian&#x27;s...\\&quot; not \\&quot;The Ancient Kamitan&#x27;s...\\&quot;  It was VERY greasy and took a long time to absorb.  I put it on my legs, feet, and hands.  NO way is it going on my face.  Next time I will order directly from the website.  Beware.</li>
            <li> I read all these rave reviews about Egyptian Magic and had to have it.  It&#x27;s okay, very solid and hard in the jar.  It takes a little work to soften it up into an oil and it does not spread smoothly over my skin without a LOT of work.  It makes a good lip balm but not worth the price just for that.  I guess my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to the \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; that everyone claims is in this product :(</li>
            <li> There are a lot of weird claims about this cream, and the inventor is one odd duck (see New York Times), but this is a very good, no fuss, no funny ingredient, no funny smell skin treatment.   I&#x27;ve used this from face to feet, including lips, without any problems. It melts into a lovely beeswax-honey scented moisturizer and barrier cream, as well as - if all claims are to be believed - magic cream.   At night I wash my face, then rinse; while it is wet, I scoop out a bit of Egyptian Magic onto the palm of my hand and rub my palms together to melt it, then rub my hands together to distribute it all over my hands front and back, then use the palms of my hands to pat this over my face, including eye area (leaving my palms cleaner for reading a book, etc).  In the morning, my skin is nicely hydrated (a miracle in our climate).    I&#x27;ve also used this on dry feet (cover with socks to prevent falls), and recent scars to promote healing. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, and it&#x27;s easy to fill a small sample jar for your purse; I wouldn&#x27;t put it in a pocket - I think it melts at body temperature.  A delightful skin treatment, whether it works magic or not. Reasonable price, lovely scent, beautiful radiant moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and liked it....HOWEVER....UNLESS you purchase it and LOOK at the contents first, there is no way to know if you will get the good or the poor version. The \\&quot;good\\&quot; version has a nice consistency, spreads into oil easily, smells like bee products (beeswax etc), and is a good face creme. The \\&quot;poor\\&quot; version is loaded with beeswax making it too thick to spread easily, especially for the face. So far, both my Amazon purchases of this product were the \\&quot;poor\\&quot; version which is frustrating. If you purchase at a health store you can ask for a sample. If you like it, look at the dates to make sure you are buying a jar from the same date as the sample. Lots of work to buy a simple product. Too bad the owner of the company is so sloppy in maintaining a consistent product.</li>
            <li> My face drastically cleared up after using this product :) I use clearasil daily moisturizing wash and then this and I&#x27;m pretty happy, just the occasional zit, but I do touch my face alot more than I should :(</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product that was sent to me. It has a gray color instead of a yellowish. It smealls a little funny and it just doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product I&#x27;ve been using for the last 8 or 9 years. I usually buy this product from Whole Foods but didn&#x27;t want to make a trip just for this. I guess I&#x27;ll have to go there again so I can actually see and smell what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li> Love this product !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tiny red dots on the back of my arms since I was in junior high. My sister had it too. My parents used to call it a heat rash but it was there year round. I&#x27;ve seen it on a lot of people and never really felt that self-conscious about it. Last year, my sister&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Egyptian Magic to her and she tried to sell me on how well it worked. Of course I was skeptical because to be honest, it looks like low budget petroleum jelly in a gimmicky pacakage. After seeing how it made my sister&#x27;s little red dots disappear, I decided to secretly buy it and try it, since I&#x27;d already openly mocked her about it. I saw an actual difference within the first 3 days of applying it on the backs of my arms after a shower. The dots are about 90% gone now and I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 days. My boyfriend also laughed at the hilarious packaging (Lord Pharoah Imhotep AmonRa is listed as the CEO), but became a believer when he saw the red dots practically disappear within a week. Now we use it for everything from razor burn to dry patches. This product absolutely works and the ingredients are all natural and pronouncable. For less than $10, even the skeptics can afford to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed anything different.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to try this product out and well wasnt happy...its says you can use it on your face...yea dont think thats a good idea it has soo much oil makes your face feel greesey...yuck.  I guess you can use it for the body but not the face..plus I noticed I started to breakout um yea no wonder it has olive oil.....anyways it didnt work for me and wished I didnt buy it..I tried to give it to my sis but she said the same thing its not for the face just to heavey and feels werid..maybe my mom can use it..but I dont know..dont buy it..it has way to much oil its like melted butter on your hands.</li>
            <li> This cream has changed my face... for the better. I apply it literately to my eyebrows and eyelashes. My eyelashes are so long now. I generally only use it after I have exfoliated, which is only once a week.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot;, but it didn&#x27;t turn out to be so magical for me.  i have extremely oily sensitive skin and was afraid that it would make me break out.  surprisingly it didn&#x27;t, which is one thing that impressed me because this cream...more like wax...seemed very thick and oily.  but yeah, it didn&#x27;t make me break out.  the reason why i returned this product was because it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  i would put it on before i slept and in the morning i didn&#x27;t see any change or improvement.  i don&#x27;t think this cream is worth $30.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the company I purchased this product from, the product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if I had a fake this last time, as the packaging started to fade, but this new container started clearing up some blemishes I had. :) Which is what it did the very first time I bought some. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 years (morning and night) and I&#x27;ve only purchased it 3 times... it lasts a LOOOONG time for facial application. It does go on a little creamy/greasy feeling but it absorbs quickly (within 10 minutes) and if I need to put my makeup on asap I let it sit on my face for a minute and pat my face with a towel to take off excess. :) Less is more. Warm it in your fingers so it will spread well. It&#x27;s the ONLY lotion for my face that does not break me out. I&#x27;ve tried everything, even the most $$$ supposed &amp;#34;ACNE FREE&amp;#34; creams. I will always use this! As I implied I believe one time I recieved a fake tub, because it wasn&#x27;t working for my acne as well. But this one was REAL! :)</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, I got it from Hip Apotheca so I assume wholeheartedly I did get the real deal. I used this product for about six months on my face, which for a 35 yr old is pretty dry and gets very occasional adult acne, as well as my arms, as I suffer from keratosis pilaris. I was disappointed that this stuff wasn&#x27;t as great as I had hoped it would be. There was no noticeable difference in the moisture of my skin, and it definitely didn&#x27;t help my chicken skin arms. A little goes a long way, but for me this really didn&#x27;t \\&quot;soak into\\&quot; my skin much at all, it kind of sat on top of it, even after a whole nights sleep I was kind of greasy in the morning. One thing this product did work well on was my 9 year old daughter, her skin is sensitive and gets the occasional rash. I don&#x27;t mind using it on her because it is natural. But for me, I&#x27;m sticking with my extra virgin coconut oil to moisturize my face and body naturally.</li>
            <li> Mine was melted up opening :(</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but after becoming trained as a formulator. I&#x27;ve learned to make it myself for a 10th of the price and almost anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to put the formula out, but if you read the container it&#x27;s all the ingredients listed in descending order. I suspect the honey is about five percent, or less and everything below that falls around 1 percent. Which means it&#x27;s mostly Olive Oil A and Beeswax. Beeswax about a 1/3rd or less of the entire product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get no water in this at all, while you&#x27;re making it, or after. It&#x27;s an anhydrous product and will stay fresh for a year, or so. If you get even a drop of water in this whether making it, or buying it, you are just giving out a huge invitation to germs and molds to ruin it. If it ever smells off, even a little bit, toss it. Seriously. What can grow in oil and water without a preservative can kill you, or leave you deformed for life (MRSA is a good example). It&#x27;s an okay product, but there is a lot of false hype because beauty gurus on YouTube were paid to sell it to the public before the law about sharing if they were paid was enacted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can do what this does without the royal jelly and propolis. The rest is a nice mix. Honey is a good humectant and in low levels is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Once you start using Egyptian Magic, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else. I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 6+ years, as well as trying competing products and blending my own. Nothing measures up to this.</li>
            <li> I think the Egyptian Magic Skin Cream is overpriced.  I have used it faithfully each day since my purchase and see no change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the cream specially for my feet at night, it makes it nice and soft since I have pretty dry feets.  Now, for my face, I being using the cream every night and I have not seeing any improvements, but will continue to used and hope that I see some improvements later on.</li>
            <li> I only heard about this about a week ago, and came here to read the reviews.  After checking with the site and reading here, I&#x27;m sure that those who aren&#x27;t happy had bought counterfeit goods.  This stuff is made out of mostly olive oil and beeswax, so any weird scent, color or texture should have alerted you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff due to recommendations for use on eczema.  I have to say, it has been amazing.  After only 4 days use, 3 or 4 times a day, the redness is already notably better, and it&#x27;s healing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week before I bought this I had burned myself with a curling iron, at least a second degree burn, and it refused to scab over or heal.  Thinking what the heck I applied this 4 times a day to the burn, and can&#x27;t believe how fast it&#x27;s healing at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and a bit shiny until it soaks in, so I would never use it under makeup for daytime, but putting it on at night it really soaks in and my skin feels amazing when I wake up.  It&#x27;s not too greasy even for around the eyes, like so many other creams that make you puffy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a hurry, so I went to Whole Paycheck to ensure I could carry the real thing home that night, it was $40/4oz.  I used it for a day and realized that all that dipping my fingers in over and over was not a good thing, so I transferred a small bit into another tub and put the original package into the fridge.  A very little goes a very, very long way.  It&#x27;s working on my feet, my elbows, my eczema, my burn, my face.  I can&#x27;t praise it enough.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this is a good product.  Considering her other choices in life, I tend to believe her.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about this. It&#x27;s okay. I used this on my face and it gave me blackheads. Now I use it around my eyes and or over any scrapes I get as it has great healing properties. It&#x27;s extremely overpriced IMHO.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Egyptian Magic based on all the rave reviews on Amazon and on other sites.  Unfortunately, I dont see what all the hoopla is about?  First of all, it smells AWFUL, not something I would want to walk around smelling like all day unless you are a fragrance wearer and can cover up this smell, yuck!!  Ive tried this on my face and body, and though many say its a \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot;, they never really say what \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; they&#x27;re seeing??  I guess it can be seen as a moisturizer, but I can think of plenty other moisturizers that are cheaper and dont smell like a BP Oil well?</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this because I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it. Sorry to say that the label doesn&#x27;t match the picture. I was warned about this and knew to check it. Will be sending it back. There was also no receipt in the box.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews but unfortunately I was part of the group that broke out rather than benefited from this product.  I have really sensitive skin so I guess I can&#x27;t blame the product for that which is why I just gave it 3 stars to be fair.</li>
            <li> This container says &#x27;The Ancient Kamitian&#x27;s Secret&#x27;, and the official website&#x27;s product says &#x27;The Ancient Egyptian&#x27;s Secret.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t purchase this one, I bought mine from Costco, I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting a fake.&lt;br /&gt;However the REAL product is absolutely amazing! I use it for everything from irritated patches of skin, to everyday use as a moisturizer for my face. Make sure you rub between your fingers before applying, I noticed a big difference in it&#x27;s effectiveness, rather than just applying a glob right to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am only 24, but I have a few stretch marks on my inner thigh...I applied this religiously for 2 weeks straight at night after a shower, and I&#x27;m not kidding...they are gone!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the buy, just make sure you aren&#x27;t getting a fake. Egyptian Magic is aware that there are fake products out there, even though they may list the same ingredients they may not be the quality you&#x27;re hoping for. Save yourself some time and get it straight from the site or your local Costco might carry it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. Would recommend this for others with combo/dry skin, not sure about oily skin though.    1. The question of whether or not it&#x27;s too oily for any skin type.  Yes, it definitely is. But you can choose to use less on your skin - I have my way of using it to my absolute advantage without it staying on my face for two hours like an oily mask - which is what happens if you use it like any other regular moisturizer.  I use this along with the Philosophy moisturizer (which isn&#x27;t completely moisturizing enough for winter months) fro m Sephora that I&#x27;ve been using for a year, but you can use it with any other lighter moisturizers.  My routine: At night, I use a wet finger to (very lightly) circle around the jar for 2-3 times, blend the product with my other moisturizer, apply while concentrating on my cheeks (driest part of my face). This provides just enough deep moisturization for night.  During the day, to prevent shine, I circle my finger only once around the jar, then blend with the other moisturizer before applying.    2. It claims to heal skin disorders.  I&#x27;ve no skin disorders, but when I bought this, I had a month-long blemish on my lower chin, the redness just wouldn&#x27;t go away! After applying the Egyptian cream for only one night, the redness of the blemish dimmed noticeably. I continued to apply for another few days - the blemish completely disappeared, leaving no scar whatsoever. I&#x27;ve not used any other scar erasing product, but this one works so well, I won&#x27;t bother looking for another if I ever need one.    It&#x27;s one of those few beauty products that actually have expiration dates; I&#x27;ll be using this thing for 3 years, this way it&#x27;s really not expensive at all. Plus amazon gives a good price. I bought my first jar at another store, but after I finish it, I&#x27;ll come to amazon for a second. It gives a really healthy looking glow, I can&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I got the first jar as a gift and I purchased this one because I really like what does for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my lips.  Also works great for extra moisturization for my face, hands, and hair on dry winter nights.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but for the price tag there are other less expensive products that yield the same result for me. I will not buy this again due to the price since my results were no different than if I had used the cheaper products that I already had. Not saying that it is not a good product just that it is very expensive and I have had exactly the same results with other less costly products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard a bit about this product before I ordered it.  Enough that I decided to splurge and buy it for myself without knowing a whole lot about it.  Well, I love it so much that I plan on \\&quot;gifting\\&quot; it to friends and family.  I use it for a night moisturizer and have been amazed at the results to my skin (normally very dry, especially in winter).  The texture of my skin has become much softer and I&#x27;ve had healing on the dry patches that have previously resisted everything I&#x27;ve thrown at them. This product feels greasy for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but then is easily absorbed into the skin.  This has completely CURED my dry cracked heels and elbows.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This cream is silky smooth and heals up dry skin quickly. A little greasy at first but absorbs in fast. A light amount also smoothes down frizz. Can be used over your entire body.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 8 months. I use it once a day, before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t see any improvement :(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too oily, and the price is a little too high. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product! Great for just about anything. Dry skin, chapped lips, burns, face moisturizer.  Super softening and smells like honey :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have super super sensative skin and I can use this everywhere with no problem! Its wonderful not greasy, It melts to oil in your hands and absorbs in your skin. You can use it as a face cream, great at night! put it on your eyelashs as a conditioner. Makeup remover. Great for EVERYTHING! Wonderful as a split end mender too!! It really is magic!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used so many products, and this one is truly MAGIC. I buy the large one and use it on my face and body, and carry the smaller one around in my bag for travel. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this Egyptian Magic Cream!!! First off it has very few ingredients in it and they are all pronounceable, readable, understandable, and recognizable. I wash my face with Adovia Mineral Soap and then apply a small amount of this Egyptian Magic Cream to my face. Can I say, radiant, soft, and beautiful looking skin!! I still have Acne on my face but it is minimal. Once this cream is applied my skin is so radiant, even, and beautiful, that the Acne doesn&#x27;t matter or bother me. I love the way my skin feels with this cream on it. I will not be without this cream!!! It is very expensive but a little goes a loooonnng way!! I have not even put a dent in my jar yet!! I use this cream on my face and hands and can I say; soft!! I&#x27;m sure this jar will last me at least 6 months to a year. 5 stars all the way!!!     Give it some time, it really evens out skin tones.</li>
            <li> I use the Sweet Bee magic every night and I use the Egyptian Magic every morning both products are working really well my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I ordered EMC a few weeks ago and had to return it. First of all the cream&#x27;s label that I received looks different that the one you see in the picture. Another reviewer noted that the true cream should say \\&quot;The Ancient KAMITIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\&quot; Mine said \\&quot;The Ancient EGYPTIAN&#x27;S Secret, Magical Cream.\\&quot; Also, mine had some  FONT and TEXT color differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the texture...Yuck. I know that some people say that it should be oily in consistency when you warm it with your hands. Fine. I get it. I have used olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter on my hair and skin. All of THESE are oily too, but they actually absorb into your skin/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, a small amount of EMC did NOT EVER ABSORB into my skin. I felt so sticky and greasy. It felt \\&quot;bad\\&quot; for my skin. So after hours of wearing it on my face and arms, I had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I got a fake. Weird thing is that the EMC website&#x27;s products&#x27; labels look like the one I got....but mine just HAS to be a fake. It&#x27;s so gross and feels like petroleum jelly (which is really bad for your skin, and drying--believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed. I will not try this product again and stick to shea butter and home-made honey masks for natural skin care, thank-you-very-much.</li>
            <li> This cream is a great way to eliminate problem areas on your skin. It&#x27;s important to know this is highly oil based. It&#x27;s very thick, greasy, balmy, etc. but if you keep the usage to a minimum it is extremely effective. Knowing the right amount to use will keep you from causing further skin problems and giving yourself additional issues. As strange as this may sound since this is a moisturizing style product, it can dry your skin so be aware and conscious of that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offset the need to use the cream a lot by doing what I consider a cleansing foundation. I use aloe-based toner ([[ASIN:B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]]) to eliminate bacteria in my pores. Since it&#x27;s got aloe, it&#x27;s also a moisturizer. Keeping my skin clean from the inside our helps keep my usage of the magic cream down and hence avoids the possibility of using too much and clogging it further.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just great. Does all the things advertised. I have suggested it to family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You So much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for an evening moisturizer and for winter skin; I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge difference from other moisturizers. That might be a bit of a placebo effect. My cracked parched post-rock-climbing hands do appreciate the stuff though.</li>
            <li> I love this cream because of its ingredients and what it does for me. Using this cream for not even a week I can already see a difference in my skin. I just use it for my face (or little irritations like heat rashes) and it works its magic! Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and most skin creams and makeup products make me itch or break out.  My eyes get puffy, flaky and dry from allergies in Spring and Fall and the inside of my nose gets dry and sore from allergies as well.  I&#x27;ve tried many things but nothing has worked.  This product eliminated these problems with no irritation!!  My skin is soft and beautiful and my eyes look normal again.  It also works great on hair to stop the frizzies!  It feels more like a balm (like the consistency of Tiger balm or petroleum jelly) so a little goes a long way.  You have to work to find the right amount for your skin or it could feel greasy but don&#x27;t give up b/c of that.  When you figure out how much to use there is no greasiness as it sinks into your skin.  The only drawback for me is that it isn&#x27;t vegan.  Much cheaper to buy online but you can get it at Whole Foods too.</li>
            <li> I had this product for several months. It did not really change anything!!!! When I put on this cream, my face got really oily. Don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Having used a jug last winter, I decide to continue on it this year because I failed to find a good replacement after repeated browsing online and trying in-store (these actions are actually exhausting and time consuming).&lt;br /&gt;Particularly I&#x27;m in the upstate NY and the weather here from November would get very dry against which the regular moist lotion does no good, not to mention the drier indoors environment because of the heating radiators.  So I used this as a night/sleep cover for the last step of the daily skin care process, and it would protect me from the dryness till the next morning, and in the meantime to ensure the regular lotion be absorbed completely.&lt;br /&gt;A tip and warning: it is quite oily, so possibly not good for daytime use since it would make your face look too shiny even with the foundation covering it up.  So personally I suggest it used rather as a night cream to prevent &amp;#34;water loss&amp;#34; of skin than a day cream.</li>
            <li> I verified that this is indeed a FAKE brand copy of egyptian magic. Even if yours does say the right label. The only way to tell is on the bottom there is a use by date that is on all of them however the real one above the use by has 0000 on top of the use by date and this one does not and is also really faint. I bought this from here and from a real seller because I was bewildered with the difference in price. You can also tell the difference by the inside. When  you open them; the real one has almost a matte finish to it and is SOLID. This one is shiny and greasy and because of prime when it got here first I made the mistake of using it and my skin is all dry and scaly despite all the grease. DO  NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> a very good all-purpose cream. an excellent moisturiser for very dry skin. i applied a thin layer to my zits and it dries up overnight without being too oily on my combination. used as a lip gloss and hair tamer and both work out pretty well. really value for money.</li>
            <li> My skin has a tendency to be dry, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;This skin cream has really helped. My wife bought it for me, and now&lt;br /&gt;no more dry skin. This cream is definitely worth using.&lt;br /&gt;Just apply a small amount and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00JATQVAK Miracle Anti Aging Cream with Natural Moisturizers for Soft and Smooth Skin. 4 Oz of Face Cream.]]</li>
            <li> Why would you spend this much money for something you could make yourself?  I&#x27;ve used this product.  But the selling price is out of control when you price out the ingredients.  I bought propolis and royal jelly for $20 - I had the other ingredients and made it myself.  I could make 20 jars for what they are selling this at.  And, quite frankly, I like my product better.  I used Argan Oil instead of the Olive Oil and infused it with botanicals. Sorry...but no...I&#x27;m an informed consumer....</li>
            <li> I used this cream on my face and neck at night. My skin feels so soft. Also use it on my husband&#x27;s arms, who&#x27;s skin has become so dry that if sometimes flakes.  After 2 night treatments, his arms are already improving.  I&#x27;m sold on this cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best trouble spot moisturizer ever.  Too greasy to use all over it works well on dry areas on feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> There are so many recent good reviews, that my   curiosity was peaked and I had to try this out.   While I didn&#x27;t spring for the 4oz. jar, I did   buy a sample packet of it to see for myself.  What a relief! I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t totally   fall for the hype, and waste money on the standard   jar.   This \\&quot;Egyptian Magic\\&quot; has the consistancy of   axle grease and it never melts into the skin   (evidentally my body temperature is not warm   enough).   I definitely, will not put this on my hair because   I would need a degreaser to remedy such a fiasco.   This stuff is so thick and tacky, that with enough   of it, I could possibly give a car a good lube job.   Finally, the smell is not that pleasant. Not a   horrible smell, but not pleasant either.  So, I am so happy that I didn&#x27;t get ripped off for   a little jar of grease.</li>
            <li> This product works on cracked winter hands that are painful. I have tried many products for this winter problem and this works for me, just remember to apply it daily and the skin will not crack, working out doors in the winter dries my the thumbs and they crack if I forget to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely overpriced cream. I bought it in Costco and was attracted by natural ingredients. First, it smells like lard. It does not absorb well. It is 5 times more pricey than Aquaphor ointment, but besides the worse smell, it does similar job. I am trying to use the whole container, but in order to mask the &amp;#34;lard&amp;#34; smell I need to use my regular moisturizer over it, which also helps a little bit with absorbing the &amp;#34;Egyptian Magic&amp;#34;. I tried to use it as a hand cream but my hands turned very greasy...The packaging is very cheap. After a couple of uses the print on packaging gets dissolved by the cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again. It is probably worth $5 instead of $36. Somebody makes a fortune on it !!!</li>
            <li> Super greasy, my face broke out very bad, I used it on my body instead, still nothing special, don&#x27;t recomend it</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading all the conflicting reviews. I have EXTREMELY dry skin so it&#x27;s perfect for me. If your skin isn&#x27;t VERY dry this item will probably be too greasy for you. it&#x27;s a little less greasy than Vaseline but absorbs better. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> For a long time I heard a lot of hype about this &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;. Well, it is actually amazing for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it really is all purpose: from healing cuts or burns in a day to moisturizing freshly saved legs, using after a facial to keep the glow going or even smoothing out frizzies...i just keep finding more and more uses for this cream. Even my boyfriend who doesn&#x27;t use any type of body products (a straight soap and razor type - mechanic) actually swears by this cream as a healer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one vice: it&#x27;s named incorrectly. This is more of a balm, a solid substance that melts immediately upon contact into a clear liquid...nothing creamy about this and it&#x27;s also not just for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s should be egyptian magic all purpose balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do also like that this item is fragrance free, lasts forever and can go on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to keep for all uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE: I understand that this items has been compared to the cheaper version - Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic. I bought both....definitely buy this one. The Sweet Bee has a strange smell and doesn&#x27;t heal anything...it&#x27;s just another moisturizer. Dont let the cheaper price fool you ...go with the original Egyptian magic...it&#x27;s tried and true and called magic for a reason.</li>
            <li> good product!!!!!i love it!!! but it is little greasy for me! i think you need try it. if you want</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry psoriasis skin and although the root cause of psoriasis is internal, this external cream feels great.  I bought 2 jars together. Best price ever.</li>
            <li> Trying to get rid of sun spots and scars.  This product works well so far.  I can see the difference after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a week morning and night. It has cleared up a area in my smile line that was breaking out with  Little pimples this winter. I have been only using it on my face, and it feels wonderful. My skin feels soft and smooth. So  Far I am a believer!  PS this is not Marcus it is his wife&#x27;s! Can&#x27;t change the name on the account review. Should do my own account!</li>
            <li> Very greasy - almost like putting Vaseline on my face.  Don&#x27;t understand all the hype on this product.  Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel wonderful  Best product I&#x27;ve found for taking care of cracks in your feet.  Not too greasy</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and those encouraged me to purchase this product. I should have saved my money. Didn&#x27;t work for me other than moisturizing as any other lotion or cream would.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth going on with an oily base.  it makes the skin smooth but haven&#x27;t used long enough to know the longevity of the product&#x27;s effects.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry itchy skin on my legs, and clogged follicles, since I was a teen.  Nothing seemed to work for any extended period of time.  Then I tried this.  My skin is radiant, the clogged follicles I have had for 30 years on my legs are gone.  The itchiness is gone. I use it at night all over my arms and legs and feet.  I use it once a week on my face, since I have oily skin.  Overall I have noticed such a difference that it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my kids, since the ingredients are safe and nothing extra is added.  Also, I would like to point out that I bought this at a local health food store for 27.99!  It is called Good News in Milford, DE.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far, after the shower is when I apply it. It&#x27;s very greasy at first but then does soak in most of the way, however you still have a bit that does get left on the skin, which for some may not be ok. Over all skin is soft as they claim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and haven&#x27;t found anything to compare to the results.  My face is soft and flawless.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of a friend recommendation.... and as its name, is magical what happens with the skin after using it....love it  Natural ingredients and magical results.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased Egyption Magic from Costco for my dry face.  For $39.00 you get one 2 once jar, and one 4 once jar.  Let me just say, we all have our male and female problems!  No matter how well we take care of our bodies!  I have been suffering for a while with an itching jock!  I have tried all kinds of powders and creams formulated for jock itch!  None of them worked for me!  In desperation, I reached for and applied the Egyption Magic to my Jock!  Fella&#x27;s, and even ladies, listen!  The second I applied Egyption Magic to my jock, instantly, the itching stopped!  And I have been itch free ever since!  Not to mention, how awesome it works on my face! I never knew how handsome I was before using this miracle cream!  Get this cream!  If only for a back up in your medicine cabinet!  Awesome!  Just Awesome!</li>
            <li> Love. love, love this cream.  It works and I would\ definitely recommend this cream to anyone.  I have been using this several years not when I first read about it in a health and beauty magazine and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Not sure where I saw or heard of this. . . probably a magazine I read.  Apparently, it&#x27;s all the rage in Paris and those women have amazing skin.  It looks thick and yucky, like vaseline or aquaphor, but goes on easily.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy the Egyptian Magic sold on Amazon. I made the mistake of wasting my money on the one sold here but the date is printed, not engraved AND the consistency is all wrong. They sell the same product at Costco and Whole Foods so save yourself the pain of having to determine it&#x27;s authenticity by purchasing it elsewhere. The company itself warns buyers to stay away from eBay and Amazon when buying the cream. Chinese counterfeits are everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: The product itself is great. I got the set at Costco and it works great on my face and hands, which tend to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like smell bad and I don&#x27;t see any different</li>
            <li> Returned did not like the thick ness of the goop !!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff... It keeps my skin balanced and moisturised.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> Exceptional product. I had a burned lip since 12/25/14. Limited results healing with other products; open sore. Could see improvement the second day of using Egyptian Magic. I have skin on my lip; closed sore!</li>
            <li> I most definitely have to stack up on this product. My boyfriend and I fell so in love with this. We use this all over our bodies and it keeps my skin flawless and not greasy! I have acne prone skin and sensitive and this moisturizer does not cause any redness nor breakouts. If you suffer from dry and flaky skin, you will see no more skin flaking.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin- wrinkly and scaly (yuk).  This cream helps a lot. It is kinda greasy, just a little goes a long way.  I put a small amount on my hands and then rub my arms, elbows and sometimes even run my hands thru my hair, helps with frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> What is it: It&#x27;s a balm offered to consumers as an all healing, all purpose skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works on: Stretch marks (diminishes appearance), cuts (starts the healing process), bruises (fades them away quicker), dry skin (brings moisture and rids dry skin), oily skin (creates an equilibrium balance of oils, and even on hair (can be used to rejuvenate hair brings moisture to hair, can style hair but won&#x27;t stay still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  A little pricey for a tiny bottle but if you find the dual pack which comes in 4oz and 2oz bottle then your in luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:  Use it on your face, feet, and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  I&#x27;ve found that it is best to use it an an overnight cream for the face during any kind of weather.  Our skin can take a lot of damage while being out in the sun throughout the day.  It is a bit oily and leaving it in overnight will help set in your face or area of use.  Use a a pea sized amount and play with the amount, a pea sized amount will go a long way.  Rub the balm in really well and let it sit for a while, I&#x27;ve used it under makeup to give you that vibrant shine desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: olive oil, bees wax, honey, bee pollen, royal jelly, bee propolis and Divine love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to buy: Costco offers it, Wholefoods, Riteaide, local grocery store, Trader joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage:  Keep away from hot temperature and away from sunlight.  Keep it in bathroom medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I use on my face for eczema instead of steroids.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have issues with dry skin during certain times of the year. The starts out as a cream and you rub it quickly in your hands to make an oil. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes but like so many before it the results were disappointing.  I would not recommend this product to anyone especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> It takes care of my dry skin. I put this on my lips at every night as well, and my lips gets so soft in the next day. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It gets greasy at the beginning when you apply it but it&#x27;ll soak in and won&#x27;t be too greasy after all.</li>
            <li> I like to use this at night on my face and neck.  It is pretty greasy so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for day use unless you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t mind being a bit shiny.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.  It&#x27;s a great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I tried LOTS of diaper rash creams and this was the only thing that worked.  Great for other skin issues too!</li>
            <li> I first read about this product in a celebrity magazine.  The way some of the celebrities rave about this product I thought it would cure everything from dry hair to cracked feet.  It has a plaster texture until you scoop out a little in your hand &amp; rub together.  I find it greasy &amp; it work as good as putting baby oil on. It has a natural scent to almost no scent at all. I will continue to use my container but I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care cream we ever have used. It&#x27;s perfect all year, and a jar seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a night cream. My skin feels very soft the next day. It&#x27;s a little bit greasy due to the olive oil but it absorbs fast enough. I sent a jar to my cousin who lives in a cold climate and was having extreme problems with his hands becoming dry and cracked.  He started using All Purpose Egyptian Magic and in just a few days his hands began to heal. He was very pleased with the results. I like the idea that it is all natural and is good to fend off skin infections from cuts and burns. This is a great product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend works at Whole Foods and while browsing the Whole Body section I saw a price tag for a 30.00 jar of skin cream. Automatically I wanted it. Then I saw it was called Egyptian Magic, Ancient Kamitian Secret Magical Cream. Yes Please. \\&quot;Peace, Divine love, perfect health, internal, eternal wisdom and infinite blessings unto you, precious one.\\&quot; GIMME GIMME GIMME!    I let the boyfriend know, I want this. (But I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it for myself.)    Months later I had forgotten about it and he kept complaining of my scratching in my sleep due to my excema and came home and surprised me with it! It had been returned with an itty bitty dent from someone&#x27;s finger with the description of \\&quot;didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; More likely someone&#x27;s husband looked at her grocery receipt and got upset by the $30 price tag.    So I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for a few weeks now and am very happy. I was nervous to put it on delicate skin for fear of breaking out, so I mostly just used it on my hands and forearms and dry leg spots for a while. Then I tried my lips and was wowed by the softness. Recently I got brave enough to start using it on my chest and neck and no breakouts...So I made the jump and massaged it into my face. It&#x27;s definitely heavy and kind of gross feeling...but give it a half hour and it absorbs and leaves incredible soft skin behind. For that reason it&#x27;s definitely not a day cream.    I left it at work one day and a coworker had a blister on her heel and she remarked excitedly how it magically healed up her blister.    Pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my 17 month old &#x27;s delicate cheeks. He gets chapped cheeks due to teething and this chilly winter, this stuff is amazing!! Shipper sent product immediately. No issues. Very happy mama!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin cream...I use it every night.  Would not use anything else.  My face and hands never looked so good...!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great for sensitive skin that gets dry easily. Helped mine quickly and it&#x27;s not excessively greasy like coconut oil is.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years . I bruise easily and badly . I take some of this in my purse and out on my bike . I put it on as soon as possible after I bang some part of my body up and when I do this the bruising is dramatically reduced right away . It definitely takes the pain out . Even if I can&#x27;t get it to the bruise site right away I will apply it 2-3 times a day and the bruise goes away quickly . I looooove this stuff !!!!! Great for bruisers !!!!!</li>
            <li> I find it alittle to heavy. But it&#x27;s a great product. I haven&#x27;t been using it on a steady bases, it&#x27;s for a lot of different things. Must get back to using it again.</li>
            <li> Feet and elbows kids. This is super emollient and you shouldn&#x27;t  put it on your face..However scars,stretch marks, cuticles etc it&#x27;s perfect for.&lt;br /&gt;when my pedi is overdue but my feet will be on display the next day..this is IT. Be generous, add socks ,go to bed and voila! Also Beach days:massage into breasts, thighs and aSs..</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful boost to my skin. It can appear and feel very oily so I apply to my skin at night so that it has a long duration of time to sink it. Then by morning my skin feels and looks rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li> When I get this product, I apply it using my fingers, but it collapse. Then I found there is a big big big whole in this jar, but the top looks very full.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  My cuticles are a dry lost cause. The cream felt nice on my hands</li>
            <li> if you compare this to the one in whole foods, even the packing is slightly different. I will return it for sure.</li>
            <li> Ok, i expected something miraculous and magical since i&#x27;ve read so good critics about it but the thing is i know something else which i prefer which is palmer cocoa butter, it smells very sweet and is far less expensive. The consistence is the same and treats the same problems! I think, i would not buy another jar, because i still prefer palmer cocoa butter. If i had not known palmer cocoa butter i would have said i could not do without Egyptian Magic, but don&#x27;t misunderstand me the product is very good, it is just that to my opinion the palmer one is better.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cream to have on hand.  There are movie stars who say they never leave home without it.  I use it as a face and hand cream and comes in handy for burns, rashes and other skin conditions.  I was surprised that it contains just olive oil and bee products, but together they seem to be miraculous.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  It works and has so many uses....cuts, scrapes, burns, I even use it on my English Bulldog&#x27;s nose which tends to get dry....it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> For those of you that like Aquaphor or Vaseline for lips, cuticles, feet, dry skin...Egyptian Magic is so much better! It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any scent or taste. It is not a cream, more of a balm but absorbs well and leaves your skin so smooth! I use for very dry areas like my lips, hands/feet. My son had a few dry patches on his back (eczema type) and this helped him a lot.  It has a Vaseline type texture but doesn&#x27;t have petroleum or other nasty things.  I use it everyday and love it! If you have an aversion to products that are a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and have an oily feel then this may not be for you but I have very dry skin so I need the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps your decision.</li>
            <li> Disappointing! It does absolutely nothing for my skin but made my skin greasy. A total waste of money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hold on to your money!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my sister and she states she loves it so, goal accomplished. She seems to like it and wants more</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for 3 weeks -- but think it is great - get compliments&lt;br /&gt;on my skin already!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry skin. I&#x27;m on my second jar and at first it seemed kings of greasy but if you rub it in your hands a little longer it soaks in quickly. i even use it on my face and I look years younger</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Ive used it through two pregnancies and it works better than any moisturizer ive ever used, but doesn&#x27;t leave any grease residue on clothes.  It also works great on my baby&#x27;s sensitive cheeks and nose to prevent chapping when he has a runny nose, or is drueling a lot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thickish, buttery, non-oily cream that absorbs well, with plain, preferably non-animal tested ingredients and no added heavy perfumes. For ages I&#x27;ve been using ph5 Eucerin (Beiersdorf) cream for sensitive skin which has been, and still is, my long time favourite day &amp; night cream. Having a sensitive skin, most creams don&#x27;t work for me. So with that in mind, I&#x27;d rate Egyptian Magic cream as 3 star/Okay. I don&#x27;t really dislike it, but I don&#x27;t expect to buy it again. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product at all, but it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for. I think they should call it a BALSAM, not cream. I used small bits for a few days on face, hands, lips and body. It didn&#x27;t beat my all time favourite ph5 Eucerin because;&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t hydrate &amp; it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. so it sort of stays oily and that&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s more like a solid vaseline &amp; too oily to use as a day cream for me&lt;br /&gt;- i&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent (although I don&#x27;t dislike it). I also want to ad though that I feel we&#x27;re so used to synthetic added perfumes that we start to regards natural ingredients as having &#x27;a bad smell&#x27;. I&#x27;d suggest actually reading the ingredients before you buy this and understand it is made from, and thus supposed to smell like, a mixture of olive oil, beewax, honey etc. So if you don&#x27;t like the natural scent of those products, don&#x27;t buy egyptian magic and expect something like lavender, roses and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;- for some reason, it DOES promotes blood circulation a LOT in my skin. when I apply it, that part of my skin really starts to glow a bit for quite a long time. I&#x27;m okay with that but I don&#x27;t like that feeling for my whole face or body. It can be pretty nice for cold feet or soar neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product I think it deserves some +kudos because they use simple plain ingredients &amp; I like that it&#x27;s not tested on animals (as it&#x27;s completely needless suffering and nanotechnology techniques today offer way better alternatives for testing ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for buying it: buy it from a store/ trusted and reliable seller, preferably their own website. Do not waste your time &amp; money buying it on amazon or ebay as there are too many fakes around + incorrect guides as well on how to distinguish between real and fake. Since fakers also change their approach, do check their own updated guide on how to spot fakes: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was useful, have nice day and peace out.</li>
            <li> So far after a few weeks I can see the results. My face is softer I can see the spots starting to fade. I have had these brown spots on my cheeks for years and no creams have helped. So I am going to continue using the cream. Very pleased thank you Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with oily skin. As a sufferer of acne for many years now - since I started high school - I&#x27;ve tried a number of products and 90% of them have this in common: they dry you out. This is their big \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to clearing up your skin, and it makes intuitive sense at first, and it did to me too. \\&quot;I have oily skin and acne\\&quot;, I thought, \\&quot;and so if I dry out my skin, my acne will disappear\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, to my surprise, it&#x27;s not as simple as that. Recently I had a bad fight with an acne flare-up that wouldn&#x27;t quit. Looking back, it was probably my stupid decision to stop moisturizing altogether that caused it. My sister had given me a sample size of Egyptian Magic, and at the peak of my struggle with nothing to lose, I smeared this evenly over my face one night and hoped I wouldn&#x27;t be horrified in the morning. But I definitely thought I could be, given that the idea of putting an oily substance on a major-oil-producing face sounded like a recipe for disaster. Somehow I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up to an immediately obvious reduction in redness. I had had very large, painful, and under-the-skin cystic acne that showed no sign of retreating. Finally, after letting them soak in this stuff overnight, I had seen a glimmer of hope. Over the past month, I&#x27;ve worn this day and night every day. My acne has fully retreated, and I give this stuff a lot of credit. Why? Although putting something like this on a face prone to oil excessive production sounds a bit spooky, I&#x27;ve come to understand that a moisturizer like this can help to regulate the production of oil and actually keep it in check. If I go to sleep at night with no moisturizer on, I wake up with a MUCH oilier face than I do if I sleep in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff. It&#x27;s a bit too expensive in my opinion, and I want to try out the alternative beeswax product people have mentioned here, but for now I have a full-sized jar of EM to get through. This is a 4-star review only because of the fairly high price and the fact that I do find it leaves your skin a bit too oily in appearance, even after letting it sink in.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! use everywhere. Not fragranced, colored or artificial in any way. The one product you could take to the desert island and use for everything.</li>
            <li> Amazing magical balm! Has cured all my newborns skin problems from diaper rash to cradle cap to baby acne. Use it myself on dry skin or chapped lips. A little goes a long way and a tub lasts a long while so definitely worth the money. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I heard amazing things about this product, and it is really interesting. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the consistency it was-- it&#x27;s a hard waxy substance that becomes like an oil when you rub it. It does make my skin feel really smooth. But don&#x27;t expect it to be a cream!</li>
            <li> i use this product every day</li>
            <li> This product was a little greasy for me. I only used it once. However, if a person has dry skin this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This worked on our baby&#x27;s eczema. Felt comfortable and reduced the rash and inflammation.  I recommend it, seemed to work</li>
            <li> This Egyptian magic is awesome for all the dry spots and face, hands, elbows, knees and etc. You should really try it.</li>
            <li> Myself and my two sisters are using this now.. very happy girls&lt;br /&gt;Just check to make sure it authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li> I generally use a home-crafted almond oil blend as a facial moisturizer.  This is the only product that has come close to moisturizing as well as the blend my friend makes.  I have not tried any of the competing brands of this product, but this one I do know moisturizes my skin well.  I&#x27;ve noticed into my 30&#x27;s that my skin dries out a bit more easily and I find this moisturizer seems to really correct that.  Some reviewers have noted that the product was a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; and others have stated that it doesn&#x27;t seem greasy at all.  I would agree that it is a &#x27;thick&#x27; product.  Not necessarily greasy, but does take a little bit longer than some moisturizers to absorb fully.  I usually wait an hour after applying this before doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Costco, paid a lot more than I would have on Amazon:(  Started to use it on lips and face at night, rubbed the rest into my hands.  My skin just kept getting softer!  I had a skin graft done on my left hand (fingers) 34 years ago.  I looked down after a few days of use and I swear the scars have almost diminished!  I couldn&#x27;t and still can&#x27;t believe what I am seeing.  I have a scar on my hip where they took the graft from which tore, being young and stupid, I didn&#x27;t take care of my stitches as I should have, so I also have a 1\\&quot; X 2\\&quot; scar from the tear.  I decided three days ago to put some of the cream on the scar and remembered to check it today.  WOW, I cannot begin to say how much this 34 year old scar has begun to diminish after only three days.  SOLD, gotta get this stuff by the gallon!!!</li>
            <li> Put it on be 4 bed and ur sick feel nice</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer for all dry skin.  Equally effective for heels, elbows and faces and it lasts throughout the night. Hurrah!</li>
            <li> I found this product at Costco two months ago and my husband and I have been using it nightly. At Costco you get a package with a 4 oz container and a 2oz container for a bit under $40. The product is solid and amber in color. To use it you scoop a little bit of it and rub it between your palms. It doesn&#x27;t smell fragrant and nice like normal cosmetics. Instead it kind of smells like honey bees. I was not sure about this product because of its smell and because of the appearance. Yet, this product has been the best facial product I have ever used. I have used many expensive products such as La Mer, and I think it works better on me than La Mer. My face is very smooth and moist, and I think it improved the appearance of my face. Before using this cream I had some shallow wrinkles that are even less visible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t like using products, but he likes this product. He has been using it every night, and he used it when he went traveling on the East coast where it was cold and dry. He says that this product makes his face feel moist even after sleeping all night. I think that the best way to prevent wrinkles is to keep my face moist. I think that this product will help me keep my face moist for sure. For this reason, I went back to Costco to get two packs more since I am moving and I am afraid that the Costco in my new area will not stock it!</li>
            <li> I must say I was quite skeptical about this product but after using it for more than I month, my face feels vibrant and looks so hydrated. I use it mostly on my face, it was a rough winter and everyone knows that moisturizing is best for your face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It turned my raisin skin more supple and youthful.  Good for the hair too. Also use it on my lips instead of lip balm</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft and glow. I use it on my face as moisturizer, and use them on dry skin everywhere. It&#x27;s such a &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is truly magical! I first used it for a mysterious itching, spreading rash I had on my upper arm. My doctor gave me hydrocortisone cream fro it initially but that made it more inflamed and it continued to spread. After using Egyptian Magic for a few days the rash stopped itching and within 10 days was gone completely. since then we&#x27;ve used it for everything: facial moisturizer, hair oil, for lips and nails and most recently to treat a 2nd degree burn. It worked a miracle on the burn which is now healing with almost no trace of a scar. It is a household must have.</li>
            <li> My 2yr old son has a very dry skin and none of the other creams work well including Vaseline, Aquaphor etc.  We used to apply moisturizer on his body 4-5 times a day, but the problem continued until we found out about this cream. This cream is a real savior in healing his dry skin problem. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone who has dry skin or is dealing with a dry skin related problem.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but WOW, it truly is a wonder cream. I use it on my legs( my shins have always been very dry and cracked)..but NO MORE, they are soft and no more dry skin as well as my hands. I tried it on my face , which is very sensitive and it makes your skin look and feel beautiful. I am buying this for family and friends for xmas. Cant say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to see anything special. Its been a month. No glow but a new hurting pimples on my forehead. This is no different then someone take the ingredients and making it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local natural food store. I will be buying from here once I move though. D&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a night face moisturizer. Originally I bought it because my skin was really dry. It did wonders! My skin isn&#x27;t flaky at all. Plus I have noticed reduction of redness. I have only used it for 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m hoping it gets even better. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to use it anywhere but my face. One jar will probably last me around 6 months. Based on what I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive.  Was expecting a high quality facial product for the price.  Better off buy Loreal skin care products.  They absorb quickly and you see a difference with your skin after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a weak moment of mine when I bought this product. I saw on t.v. that a celebrity claimed to use it (I know she was paid to say so) but when I got the product, it really was great! I use it everyday on my face a neck under my makeup. It gives me a soft glow, smells good and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> works great on my daughters sensitive skin to help keep moisture locked in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy feeling, but it&#x27;s all natural and it definitely gets absorbed and helps with maintaining an amazing glow.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I ordered one for my sister also.</li>
            <li> I usually use argan oil but when somebody left a jar of Egyptian Magic at my house I used it and was very pleased. It&#x27;s a little greasier than argan oil but I&#x27;ve learned to use a tiny bit. It&#x27;s a nice soft moisturizer and works well under makeup. In the first jar I had the cream was white and fluffy. This cream is yellow and a little solid and feels oily. But once you put it on, it sinks into your skin and is not greasy. I prefer the lighter white stuff if I could ever find it.  Still, Egyptian Magic is a good product and does a nice job keeping your skin smooth and moist. I use this and argan oil regularly and I get complimented on my skin!</li>
            <li> Even though I did not see any magic after using this cream for one week. But it did make my skin more moisture.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic know there are a lot of fakes of this product on Amazon and have this in their FAQ if you go to the Egyptian magic website and look at their FAQ you well get lots of information about how to identify a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So make these checks when you get your jar or buy from a reseller that does not carry fakes and make sure you return this to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genuine product is unscented.  The fake I got was scented.  If you have used it before you know the fake you know it is different from the jar you have purchased before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original product is great and does wonders on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended it for my stretch marks and I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks and already the pink and purple discoloration has almost completely faded!</li>
            <li> I bought this for some very dry patches of eczema (fortunately, I only have two small patches so don&#x27;t know if it would work on larger issues/other eczema issues). If I use it consistently, it totally softens them. I also have wound up using it everywhere else including my face, the upper arms (keratosis pilaris), and scalp and have been really happy with it with no issues. It is a little greasy but it soaks in. It doesn&#x27;t bleed through clothes or anything but I do put socks on if I use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought it in summer, so I do not use it every night cuz it&#x27;s really oily. However, it makes me feel good when I wake up in the morning after I use it every night. I bought it to cure the scars of the acne, and I cannot say it works or not since I haven&#x27;t seen any obvious change in my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about a year.  It&#x27;s online at some places for $30-something.  This stuff is the only thing that helps with eczema I get on my face.  yes, it is greasy, but, once it sets in, that feeling goes away and your skin feels super soft!</li>
            <li> itself is oily .after using half jar ，found can make skin more healthy：） good to use as night cream do not use in the day time to oily</li>
            <li> Adore this product, use it every night before bed and on the nights I can&#x27;t, it drives me nuts. Believe the hype, people. It&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> I bought this product first at Costco after reading about the cream in an advertisement.  It is absolutely excellent for the face and neck area.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had the chance to really use it. i used it once all over my face and other times i just dab it on  spots of my face that were dry. i think the first time i used it i put a little too much because the next day there were still a good amount left on my face, i read somewhere it absorbs into your skin. my skin did feel somewhat softer but again i did not use it enough to get the effects it claims. it is very moisturizing so try it you like but use very little.</li>
            <li> On time with nice package and good quality of cream with cheap price. I like its. I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> I had read about celebs touting this cream as a definite winner, but I&#x27;m not feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very thick, more along the lines of a balm, and takes some emulsifying to apply. I tried it on my entire face, but it required a lot of work to emulsify between my hands, and even more to work it into the skin. I felt like this required an excessive amount of tugging and pulling on my face, and the results were less than optimal. My skin felt greasy, and my pores felt thick with the stuff. I could see the pores on my nose and nasal folds get clogged with oil and dirt, and I started to develop acne on my chin, so I discontinued the whole face application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I decided to try it on the dry rashy areas of my cheeks, and on my eyelids, since they were developing eczema patches. The cream worked well with the Weleda Calendula Cream I was using as a night cream, and made a good barrier to protect my rash from the elements. When I worked the cream hard between my fingers, I found it relatively easy to apply it to my eyelids in a thin oily film. Frankly, this application worked incredibly well for me in terms of healing and preventing recurrence of the eczema rashes on my eyelids. It does cling to the lashes, resulting in heavy grease on my glasses, and it can irritate the eyes a little if it gets in there. But my rashy areas feel more supple and they haven&#x27;t re-rashed up. It works better than the prescription steroid cream my dermatologist gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is huge, and I only use a tiny amount on my eyes now, so this jar should last a good while. I won&#x27;t be returning to the whole face application, but I will be using it to treat dry trouble spots from now.</li>
            <li> Totally allergic to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Product applied \\&quot;thin\\&quot; still lays on the top of the skin not really penetrating.&lt;br /&gt;It was heavy and greasy which I didn&#x27;t mind but it gave me a terrible rash.&lt;br /&gt;Itchy, red, bumpy rash.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin with eczema and thought I&#x27;d try this since it&#x27;s suppose to be anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I got little bumps all over my face by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my elbows and they turned all itchy dry and red too.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I was allergic to something in this.&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;At least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it magic but it does work great for my dry, flaky skin in the winter. (It is too heavy for me to use in the humid summer and exacerbates acne so I don&#x27;t use it all year long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that is has a minimal ingredients list and is all natural and cruelty free. Keep in mind it is not vegan because it contains beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick cream that when rubbed between your fingers turns into an oil. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, has a very faint beeswax scent (no added fragrance), and seems to heal chapped skin fairly quickly. I use it on my face, hands, lips and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who has really dry skin that needs some lovin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This product is a great all natural solution for all of my problems. I use it as lip balm because it hydrates and adds a nice dewy sheen to my lips, which eliminates the need for a lip color product. I use this as a balm for my tattoos, it keeps the colors vibrant and hydrates the skin (this could also be used for tattoo healing). I also use this product as a lotion for my face to prevent the dryness I typically encounter around my nose area. I have heard this can be used to protect your hair, but i have yet to try it. Once my argan oil runs out I may test this product on my hair. But I can imagine it working well based on the ingredients in it and how they naturally protect hair. I plan on using a small amount on my ends after a shower. So far I love it and ive been buying it for a wide array of individuals who also love it. Oh I forgot I use this to softeb ny cuticles and hang nails as well!</li>
            <li> Not the real egyptian magic. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin so I was hesitant to try this product as it contains olive oil. But because of an excited recommendation from a friend, I bought the cream and used it for a few weeks. Unfortunately it was not right for me. It feels nice for hands before going to bed (it&#x27;s too waxy and oily for daytime). However for the face, it was definitely comedogenic. I had a lot of blackheads and pimples as a result of using it once a day (and only a small amount). I do not recommend this product as a face cream for oily/acne prone/combination skin.</li>
            <li> I  love what this product does for my face. I  live in a  dry climate, and just a little dab of this covers my entire face. It is slightly greasy/tacky at first, but absorbs quickly, leaving skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema, and tons of allergies. I adore this product. A little goes a long way and it absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizing balm - I&#x27;ve been using it successfully for a couple of months and it has helped my skin enormously</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter and she loves it. She claims it helps her with her skin especially on new tattoos</li>
            <li> Everything that I was hoping for, excellent for anything and everything.  You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer out there, simple ingredients and you know what you are putting on your skin!</li>
            <li> I had these 4 sores on my arm that would NEVER heal.  I tried many products that worked for everything else but would not start the healing process for my sores but the very first night that I applied this stuff...the next morning it had already closed the wound and began to become smoother.  It was only then I went back to read and comprehend all the other things that it can do and now I will use it on my face.  I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This egyptian magic was amazing.  I had a slight problem with eczema on the 2 corners of my upper lip, and in the inner corner of my eye brows.  So I got this to see if would help at all.  To my surprise it helped very much.  I had to apply it everyday for a few months, but after a while my eyebrows stopped having the problem.  It&#x27;s already been a few years, and it hasn&#x27;t came back in that spot.  I still get it on my upper lip in my mustache, but it&#x27;s not as bad, and the egyptian magic always helps.  It now clears up fast, and usually goes away for the rest of the year till the next winter season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must warn people with.  Just because it worked for me this way, it doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you this way.  I&#x27;ve had other people try it for eczema, and for some it worked, and others it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great skin moisturizer.  It does help with fine lines a little.  I used it for that as well.  It&#x27;s also very nice as a lip balm.  You hardly need any and it lasts all day long.  So I suggest anyone curious about this to try it.  Worse case scenario is you put it on your hands before bed and it helps moisturize them.  You never need a lot either which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I got the Egyptian Magic 4 Ounce from Amazon factory, and then i figured that the expiration date was erased.  Therefore, just wandering the \\&quot;story\\&quot; behind this..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half now.  I love the results it gives me when I use it as an overnight cream.  Immediately after applying, the skin will seem oily so I do not put it on before going out.  However, when I use it as a night cream I notice that my skin is very soft the next day.  Also I have noticed a reduction in the appearance of acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am actually allergic to pollen.  However I have not had any adverse reaction to using this product even though it contains bee pollen. If you are allergic to pollen, I recommend testing out the product on a small area first to see if you have any reaction to it before you apply it on a larger area.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar a few month ago. I was really psyched to use this because I wanted a better night moisturizer and I wanted even skin tone. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of using it I noticed some kind of warts around my eyes where I have used Egyptian Magic. I asked my dermatologist and she said they were cyst if i recall correctly. Now I had to stop using the $30 dollar ointment because it makes cyst grow around my eyes and cheeks :( Also, I used it in my thights and it also gave me pimples. Maybe I am allergic to one of the ingridients. On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference as a moisturizer. It was ok.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face as a  mositure  cream. It works better at night before bed, as it it somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, but you have to use it persistently. It clears acne and smooth skins. Only after you put it on your skin, you can see the grease on the skin, but not wear it outdoor, people will see it. The smell is not very good, but not disturbing.</li>
            <li> This is a great non-toxic creme that really works on dry and irritated skin. Even used on my dogs hot spot...healed it and it was ok for him to lick.</li>
            <li> Wonderful all purpose cream. Bought 4 jars,,gave 2 as gifts and keeping 2 for myself. Great for heels, lips, elbows, even the face. Make sure to use as little as possible as it can get a little greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> softens my dry skin so well and the softness lasts for days... smells lovely! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have Rheumatoid Arthirits and a few years ago one of my toe joints dropped causing a huge callus on the bottom of my foot. It had always been hard and painful to walk on, and I even had custom insoles made for my shoes. I&#x27;ve tried numorous moisturizing products to try to help soften it with little to no success. I received Egyptian Magic as a sample in a skin care pack. On a whim I decided to try it on my callus. It has worked wonders! My callus is soft and smooth! And while there is no cure short of surgery for a dropped toe joint, this product makes it much less painful to walk around on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week or so ago my roommate was having problem with seborrheic dermatitis with had migrated to the area around his nose. He wasn&#x27;t having much luck with steroid creams and I suggested he try the Egyptian Magic. He was pretty hesitant at first, but I convinced him to give it a shot, and now two days later it&#x27;s clearing up quite rapidly. It could be a coincidence, but I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for just about any skin ailment!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I did not buy this cream through Amazon.  Instead my mom bought a two-pack from Costco and gave me the smaller 2oz  jar to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad skin is something I&#x27;ve struggled with all my life. When I was in my teens I just assumed it was the right of passage all young people must go through, but I became more skeptical of this as the acne continued into my 20&#x27;s.  Now that I&#x27;m in my 30s I thought I could put those terrible acne days behind me, but alas, no... Last year I was diagnosed with a chronic condition that requires certain medications that wreak havoc on my skin.  Prednisone is at the top of that list and is the biggest culprit behind my bad skin.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, and I mean everything, to get rid of these breakouts and I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect solution in Rose Hip Oil, by LifeFlo. That is, until my mom brought by this jar of magical miracle oil a few weekends ago.  Instantly my skin felt smooth and healthy, and my breakouts and old acne scars began to clear almost immediately.  My best friend&#x27;s wedding is next month and I am determined to have the clear, smooth complexion a 30 year old should have, and now that this wonderful facial cream is in my life I think I&#x27;ll finally get my wish!  I use this cream at night after washing my face and applying witch hazel astringent.  It only takes a very little amount, so a 2oz jar will last a long, long time (I know the price is intimidating, but you&#x27;ll really only need to buy this cream once a year).  At first I was using it during the day, but it was just a little too heavy for daytime use, especially during hot, August days.  So instead I reserve it for before bed and when I wake up the next morning my skin looks healthy, bright, smooth and CLEAR! Yay!  I still love the rose hip oil I mentioned earlier and use that during the day.  Used together these two products make the perfect team.  Not only does it help keep skin clear and smooth, it also works great as a leave-in hair conditioner.  I discovered this quite by accident when I ran my hands through my hair after applying it to my face.  I have thick, curly hair that has also been affected by the medications I&#x27;m on (stay healthy, people... medication induced beauty problems suck!) and my once soft hair is now coarse and dry.  But just a little dollop of Egyptian Magic in freshly shampooed and wet hair brings back the soft curls I used to have.  Trust me when I say this product is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> good for dry skin, but dont like the smell, and u need to wait a little bit before u go to bed, coz maybe it will touch ur pillow.</li>
            <li> For my face I&#x27;ve got dry skin. So i took a very small amount of the hard gel, which is basically the consistency, and after rubbing it for a little bit with my fingertips, it really did turn into oil. There is no real scent to it besides it being a bit earthy? But anyways, after i rubbed it, i patted it on my entire face, and right away i didn&#x27;t like it at all. First of all, my face looked SO oily, my whole face was shining. Time went on...5 minutes, 10 minutes, half an hour, and still my face looked really oily. It was quite sticky as well. But i slept with it the first night, and when i woke up the next morning, my face had a matte smoothness, if that makes sense. The oily appearance did go away, but my other moisturizer, Korres Wild Rose 24-hour Moisturizer, worked alot ALOT better than Egyptian magic.     I also put some Egyptian Magic in my hair, just at the tips, and i didn&#x27;t even use a lot of it, only a 1/4 inch circle, and it looked like i didn&#x27;t wash my hair in 2 days. I have fine hair by the way. BUT despite it looking all greasy, it did make my hair more shiny, and the texture wasn&#x27;t that bad.    I had better luck on my scars, mainly on my hands, one knee, and on my back. The color was much much better and you didn&#x27;t notice it as much as before, so a plus on that aspect of Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I have issue with mild to severe acne and scars that stays on my face like forever... I&#x27;m a filipina who worked overseas (taiwan). I have no idea about this product since I noticed my new co-worker who had a vey smooth, rosy skin without a make-up on! At first I thought she&#x27;s born with it and then I asked her what soap or beauty product she&#x27;s using to her face coz i want to have a smooth skin like hers. She said she&#x27;s been using Magic cream for about a months now and she recommends me to try one and see what the result on my skin... I bought my very first MC then after a weeks i finally got a result! I only used it as a night cream and when i woke up my face was so smooth, radiant and rosy! my 10 months acne scars was gone in a weeks! It was a hit to all my friends and they got the same result as mine... But i stopped using MC when i came back in the Phils coz MC in the Phils was too expensive and so acne and dull skin came back. I tried other cheap product but it only cause breakages on my skin. I hide my dull skin with foundation and blush on but i&#x27;m not happy with that. But when I came in the US I&#x27;m so happy to hear that there&#x27;s a MC cream here and i immediately search it on the internet and I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this must-have product that i used to loved!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! At first, the product scared me because how greasy it made my skin feel. I was afraid I was going to break out. But the oil is the beauty of the product, it shows just how moisturizing it is and i didn&#x27;t break out at all. I apply it at night and you wake up to baby soft skin. Especially great for the winter time. I have combination skin that tends to be very dry in the winter. I&#x27;ve used this product every night for 3 months and I still still have a lot of product left. After the first week, my skin already felt smooth and plump, and it cleared up my complexion and my acne scars were no longer visible. Also great for my rough elbows and under eye wrinkles. Great for preventing premature aging.The ingredients are all natural just honey, olive oil, bee propolis, royal jelly, and beeswax. This product is worth the money and then some. A must have for beautiful, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you have dry patches and are travelling.  Sometimes my skin takes a beating when i fly from all the recycled air and this protects my skin without causing it to break out.  Its quite thick so a little is all you need.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to buy the cream, but I am very glad I did. Its a great night cream (too heavy to use as a day cream). I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause me to break out and caused no reaction whatsoever (also no strong smell). It makes my skin soft and almost glowing. I have used it for about 3 weeks and although my skin doesn&#x27;t show much significant improvement, it is softer and there are no dry spots. It can be a bit heavy, however my skin absorbs it perfectly. Great, great product and it definitely shows that it is all-natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed by Dermatitis for about 1 year and it&#x27;s still there... red,dry, chapped and itching.After using Egyptian Magic for a few days, I found it really helpful.Some symptoms disappeard though my skin didn&#x27;t come to a complete recovery. This product does take some effect and relieve symptoms in a way.But, it can&#x27;t be used as a medicine to cure any disease. Anyway, I think it worked for me and I&#x27;ll buy it after finishing this one.(I had tried vaseline,cetaphil,cerave and the drugs recommended by my dermatologist,but they all failed and some even irritated and hurt.)</li>
            <li> I have read from other reviewers that they&#x27;ve had some issues with this product (mostly break-outs).  The problem is that their skin is not properly prepared for Egyptian Magic.  The best way to prepare is to use an Indian Healing Clay mask--mixed with apple cider vinegar--first.  I have acne and would not consider using Egyptian Magic alone.  After the mask, this product reintroduces healthy oil (eliminating my skin&#x27;s need to produce sebum) and the honey acts as an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this deep treatment twice per week:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Wash face with Alba Acnedote Deep Pore Wash [[ASIN:B003O3XXZY ALBA ACNEdote Deep Pore Wash, 6-Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;  2. Pat dry with clean towel&lt;br /&gt;  3. Apply very thick coat of Indian Healing Clay mask [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]], mixed with apple cider vinegar [[ASIN:B001AIWAAE Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar, 32 oz liquid]]&lt;br /&gt;  4. Once the mask is completely dry, rinse it off with hot water (this may take a minute or so, depending on the thickness of the mask)&lt;br /&gt;  5. Pat dry with a clean towel&lt;br /&gt;  6. Massage into skin a dime sized amount of Egyptian Magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is healthier than ever and so much more comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff and can&#x27;t go a second without it. It also makes a fantastic lip balm (just scoop a small amount into a little empty pot).</li>
            <li> This is an all-natural moisturizer that does its job.  The reason for the four stars is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; to your skin like lotion or creams.  It leaves a film on your face/hands.  I usually try to put this on way before I go to bed to give it more time to incorporate into my skin.  I like the product but it doesn&#x27;t make me ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and I started using this because of a person who uses it religiously with the most amazing skin.&#x27;i use it  every night and I can tell I&#x27;m receiving the best moisturizer ever, and my skin is as clear and soft as ever! The jar lasts for ever! Oven used it for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> Ill get back to you in 20 years, if I live that long, and let you know if this stuff works.  I doubt it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  Nothing unusual about this cream at all..  I bought 2 jars and I am returning the second one.</li>
            <li> My hands were so dried and cracked over winter.  This cream was a good moisturizer and absorbed quite well.  It was a little greasy until it soaked in but it gave my skin a nice glow and translucence.  Kind of a youthful look to your skin.</li>
            <li> If your skin is looking dry, slather this stuff on, but only at night because it is VERY shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this year round,  Whenever my face is feeling particularly dry, I use this all over my face right before I go to sleep and I wake up with really hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Items arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Definitely magic!  I don&#x27;t use it on my face because of the oil but it has soothed sunburn, bug bites, and taken years off the appearance of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian Magic for about three months now. I was skeptical at first because I have tried other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products and they just never worked for me. I have combination skin and only break out once a month around my period, but when I do, I always get one (sometimes two) very large cystic bumps on my chin (sometimes other parts of my t-zone but chin mostly) and not only are these painful, they are embarrassing and take a couple of weeks to go away! I end up running the vicious cycle of covering it all up with makeup which as you know, just makes it worse. After a few days of night and day use, my skin had this glow. After a few weeks, I ditched the makeup - yes, even when going out in public! A month in, no large pimples even during my period, no makeup. It&#x27;s been three months and every day my skin keeps getting better. Healthiest it&#x27;s ever been! Worth every penny. It&#x27;s all I keep in my bag (along with sunscreen). Goodbye heavy foundation, hello radiant skin!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  All natural ingredients, and makes your skin so soft and smooth...a great value.</li>
            <li> The font type and placement are different and colors of print are not right. The main thing is the product.  The consistency is mushy and wrong.  It should be firm, firm enough that you have to rub it in your hands to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it. The odor is wrong and horrible might I add.  I was in a hurry and should have looked at the reviews before I bought it.  Amazon should not be fulfilling &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; products!</li>
            <li> the product is very greasy, it feels like a heavy paste on my skin, I feel my skin is not breathing with the paste on.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I saw immediate results. My skin was more even toned and my wrinkles under my eyes had smoothed out. This is great for a night cream and for the winter giving me a lot of moisture in my skin. Instead of investing on an eye cream, this works wonders! I have combination and sensitive skin this works better than expensive night creams.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boys to combat dry winter skin.  One of my boys has eczema so I am very conscience of ingredients and this cream seems to be working quite well.  It absorbs fairly quickly and without any irritation or burning sensations.  I really like it and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer, but it leaves me looking like I&#x27;m super greasy- which makes sense as it is made from oil. It does not clog pores at all. I put it on religiously at night and when I wake up my skin looks glorious!! I actually stopped washing my face completely and I just put this on at night. While my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s much better than before when I did use all kinds of different cleansers, toners, and moisturizers. You can wear it during the day, but I found that it&#x27;s best to put it on, pat away excess with a towel, then put makeup on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have had trouble with dry flaky skin most of my adult life and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t do any good, or the next day my face would get super oily. I was worried that this stuff would clog my pores because it&#x27;s pretty thick but it doesn&#x27;t. I put it on pretty heavy right before bed (after washing my makeup off) and when I wake up in the morning I just rinse my face with water and pat it dry. No more flakiness, and no oily skin by the end of the day! The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell too great, lol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin. Both have negative reactions like skin peeling and dryness. I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me. But it may work for others. Im african american. I have dry skin except my face which is combination. Ive used both in my hair, on my face and body and yes i went through each jar back to back. One SB and then the slightly better EM. I know when someone wants to try it, they will. But if i had to recommend it would be the EM for quality. But i technically am still giving both no stars.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am prone to both breakouts and dry skin. I love this product and have ordered it multiple times. It&#x27;s kind of expensive but lasts at least 6mo if you use it daily. I like it because it hydrates well, smells good, and has natural ingredients. It also has improved the look and texture of my skin. And even though it goes on oily at first, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. I only docked it 1 star because its spendy and people might be turned off by the texture.</li>
            <li> this stuff truly is magic cant beleive i didnt know about it until i dated an egyptian if i had only known</li>
            <li> Nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t rush out to buy more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend the money for expensive department store cosmetics, and drug store brands just go so far...one month using this cream on my face at night and my entire skin tone changed.  I found that it hydrates in ways completely unlike any other skin product...and I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face in the morning with anything but hot water....it is all absorbed.  I clean it off completely at night with a mixture of baby shampoo and olive oil...and that is it...I am 63 and people think I am 40.  I also use it on my chest and arms.  It is priced like they know its a heck of a lot better than other brands...but then it is.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and by far a great value for the money.  i would recommend it highly and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife. She says, Egyptian Magic is wonderful, skin looks and feels rejuvenated. Highly recommend to all. Hint, makes a great gift guys.</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy. I found the best way to use this product was by having time to allow it to soak&lt;br /&gt;in the skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m not one to write reviews... but Egyptian Magic really has been a godsend for my skin, so I figured I should share my experience with others who suffer. I have been battling really severe eczema for my entire life, and I have tried COUNTLESS products/lotions/supplements/etc - but nothing has worked! It was by sheer happenstance that I stumbled upon Egyptian Magic at Whole Foods and, after seeing the short list of natural ingredients, decided to give it a try. And let me tell you, it is AMAZING! I used to have to smother cream on my hands around-the-clock, which made everyday tasks the biggest nuisance. Now, I only have to use Egyptian Magic once a day - before bed, I put it on my hands and cover them with cotton gloves. That&#x27;s it! My hands have literally never been this smooth, moisturized, and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - I HIGHLY recommend this for any fellow eczema sufferers out there! It may be on the pricey side, but it is so, SO worth it. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> It breaks my face out like crazy but it is good for the rest of my body</li>
            <li> I have psorasis on my right foot and this has helped me a lot.  Since the weather has changed, my foot has been very dry and peeling.  This product helps keep the area moisturized.  I am on my second jar.      I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering from psorasis or dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product. I have watched my wife use it over nearly 2 months and I want to share the results with you now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife of 22 has struggled with acne since she was 13. It hasn&#x27;t been what I would call severe as she has never had to go to a doctor for it but noticeable none the less. (Enough to say she has acne.) While she still has to deal with it, this cream has made a huge difference. She puts it on after washing her face before bed. She sleeps with is on her face all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this her face has cleared up very noticeably. While she still has pimples, she only has about 1/4 of the amount she had before she started using this. A BIG change is the red blotches, scars, and constant problem areas have seemed to disappear entirely. WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle cream but it works for my wife. I hope someday (the sooner the better) her face will clear up entirely, but until then this stuff helps keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;She is a beautiful woman. I love her with everything I am. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> What does it suppose to do again? I put on my face and hair. Don&#x27;t see any difference. Didn&#x27;t cause any break outs for me though.&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy but does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I just loved it for my boys and I also use it on there hair. There skin is so  nice  now that I am putting this on them</li>
            <li> My dear cousin first introduced me to Egyptian Magic because she thought it would clear the acne scars (from poking and prodding) from my face. With the exception of one or two occasional pimples, my skin is clear... although the scars would have an onlooker think otherwise. I use the product after cleansing my face, following the directions on the jar. It softens my skin and my skin feels smooth to the touch. My family members notice when I hug and kiss them. I have read reviews about folks using this to treat the skin all over their bodies (as a moisturizer, to treat eczema, etc.), but I&#x27;ve yet to do this. I&#x27;ve had excellent results using this for my face. When I used it consistently, the scars faded over time, leaving me with clearer skin and a radiant glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have used this product before ordering here on Amazon, I knew it would work to my expectations. I recommended the product to a dear friend - actually I ordered three from Amazon so I could give her one. She&#x27;d never tried it before... when I see her, I can see the same glow in her face that I have gotten from the cream. She also reports softer, smoother skin. I&#x27;m not sure if she uses it daily as I do, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product to the reader. The reader should know that a small amount of cream is needed to cover one&#x27;s face. When I apply, I cover the first digit of my index finger with cream, and then I spread it across my fingertips (from index to pinky. I do not put cream on my thumbs - just my particular application technique) and rub the fingers of both my hands together. Then I massage my face with my 8 fingers to apply the cream. If I need more, I repeat the process. It&#x27;s best to start with a small amount and add more if you feel it&#x27;s needed. If my face looks extremely shiny or looks greasy, I have used too much. Beware that because the cream turns to oil when you massage it, you WILL have a slight shine on your skin (just because you&#x27;re applying oil to your face). However, it should not be applied as if you are oiling a baking pan or heating a measure of oil in a skillet (do not apply a generous amount).  I believe my first jar lasted just under a year, and I used the product once daily (after my morning shower). In my experience, Egyptian Magic has been effective and economical. Although I don&#x27;t know what my cousin paid for the jar she gave me, I thought that paying about $20 here on Amazon for a jar that lasts the better part of a year is worth it. I hope the reader finds my comments helpful. :)</li>
            <li> It feels vey greasy and smells like old cooking oil. If you sleep with your partner he will want to stay away from you b/c your face will be very sticky and smells. Not so magical but only the price tag. I recommend to buy a jar of vaseline and apply instead of this expensive so called \\&quot;magic\\&quot;. I was just sold by a famous actress comments from magazine. I bet she gets paid tons for her claim. I wish I can get my refund!!!</li>
            <li> I use Egyptian Magic on my feet before bed to soften the skin on my heels and elbows. It absorbs quickly. In a pinch, I rub a little together in my my palms and use it to smooth my hair and add a little shine. You don&#x27;t need a lot, so the 4 oz. jar should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I HEARD OF THE NAME&#x60;Egyptian Magic Cream &#x60; FROM MANY PEOPLE  THEY SAID IT&#x60;S VERY GOOD   SO I BOUGHT THIS CREAM.  THEY ARE RIGHT  .  IT MAKES ME SHINING, MOISTURING  HOW NICE IT IS !!!</li>
            <li> I honestly HATE how greasy this stuff is, but I must say it is the BOMB as far as wrinkles are concerned.  Have paid mucho much bucks for multiple skin creams, but NOTHING, NOTHING beats this stuff.  That \\&quot;crepe-paper\\&quot; look on my face is GONE, and people are forever telling my these days I look so FRESH!  And I do.  It&#x27;s taking a good 10 years off my skin.  No lie, and no exaggeration.  Everybody notices, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. So, no matter how much I hate the greasiness of this stuff otherwise it would be 5 stars +), I am COMMITTED to using it EVERY NIGHT.  Next, I&#x27;m gonna try using it on my hair.  Can&#x27;t wait!  Thanks, Egyptian Magic!  XO</li>
            <li> I am 42 and work out consistently, which means the free radicals speed up, which age you faster. I cleanse, and then use this all over my face at night and to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off, I wear a scarf for my hair that covers my forehead. Within a week, the small lines on my forehead started fading.    I will confess to not using face makeup, as it clogs the pores, which also causes wrinkles. I do use eyeliner and lip gloss or nothing at all.    Egyptian Magic is an amazing product, lasts a long time and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read through a bunch of reviews before buying this stuff and it seemed to be a great natural moisturizer, which is what I needed. My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, with a very mild form of eczema being the cause. The great thing about my skin is that I&#x27;ve never had zits or blemishes, ever. The bad thing is finding good products to use to moisturize. Anything with a lot of chemicals makes it even more dry and will give me small rashes. Hypo-allergenic products don&#x27;t give me side effects but none that I&#x27;ve tried actually keep my skin from being dry for long. So, I had high hopes for Egyptian Magic.     I got it in the mail last week and tried it immediately. It felt super heavy on my skin even though I hadn&#x27;t used much, like a really thick foundation. That should have given it away but I figured it just felt heavy to me because I&#x27;m not used to using products. Throughout the day it made my skin feel not greasy, but sort of rubbery. Definitely not soft or moisturized as I was hoping. In the late afternoon I examined my skin in the mirror and noticed a couple of tiny red bumps on my forehead. I washed my face and decided to try using it only on the spots where my skin normally gets super dry instead of all over. The next day I looked to find that my forehead was COVERED in little bumps, similar to what I&#x27;ve seen my friends describe as a break out. The texture of the skin on my cheeks was also very bumpy, and completely unrecognizable compared to my normal smooth skin. I had tried it on my hands and cuticles too but it had zero effect, positive or negative.    This was nothing like a bad reaction I&#x27;ve had to chemical filled products, it was worse. I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to products too, and this wasn&#x27;t one. I don&#x27;t know what the hell the stuff did to my face, but it just gets worse and worse no matter how many times I wash (with my normal cleanser, Dermalogica). I just had to go out and buy an acne cleanser for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> very good!!!! my skin become more adaptable after using this cream. I think this cream is better than sweet bee&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it is small amounts on elbows and my face. It is nice in a light application after my regular moisturizer has set a few minutes. In the morning I can tell the moisture in my skin is higher than if I had used a water based moisturizer only.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever used before and I recommended it to my daughter and ordered her one and she loves it too!!! Great product use it on my hands lips a lot it is magic</li>
            <li> I Bought this upon request from my wife.  She thinks it is magic.  If she is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEE THESE INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> I like to absolutely look my best at all times - even if I&#x27;m just going to the market. It can be a drag. I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, so I&#x27;m starting to get concerned about the little lines that seem to be popping up here and there. A good friend had tried this cream and recommended it to go with my perfective ceuticals egf serum. I&#x27;m so glad this is so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of extra time to my beauty routine. (The cream smells funny though)</li>
            <li> I bought this because i read all of the reviews saying how awesome this product is and how it gave amazing results. But when i got it,it was not creamy at all, in fact it was like wax and i had to scrape it out with my finger nail to get some. And it was really hard to rub into an oil, and it didn&#x27;t spread well at all. I have a dry patch on my back and this did nothing to help, and when i put some on my face as a moisturizer it didn&#x27;t absorb well and made my face feel greasy. It also made me break out. I was so disappointed with this product that i cant recommend it to anyone. It was a big waste of my money.</li>
            <li> this product egyptian magic is a total waste of money...nothing but vaseline  ..made to smell awful  after two uses, mine went into the trash..buy vaseline and add a perfume sample to it...</li>
            <li> when you really need extra healing, this is the product to try. great on face and any rough-skinned place on your body.</li>
            <li> Best all-purpose moisturizer</li>
            <li> I put this under my eyes. It feels kind of greasy but I think it really does reduce my bags in the morning or those crazy creases everyone over 30 seems to have.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it is all natural...a hard to find at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had really horrible sun burn used this cream for two nights before going to bed and it was gone! Also I have really dry elbows and I&#x27;ve been using this and I&#x27;ve noticed my elbows have gotten lighter and smoother! This cream really is MAGIC!</li>
            <li> Just as wonderful as advertised.  It has fixed all the cracks in my fingers and has made my face feel smooth.  It has not made me look 30 years old but then you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it every day and says it is well worth the money and says she will buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> I suffered from&lt;br /&gt;Eczema like dryness and tried prescribed creams, oils, a &amp; d, and nothing helped. Thank goodness for this wonder paste, amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a little greasy so I only put it on at night.  It is amazing how glowing my skin is the next morning and throughout the day.  My face looks refreshed no matter how hot and muggy the weather is, not getting enough sleep or  whatever challenging circumstances arise.</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this after seeing so many reviews of people swearing by this product...but sadly it was a nightmare for my skin. I used it only as a night cream since it tends to be an extremely oily product (I have super oily skin) and I heard from people with oily skin that it would help reduce oiliness, but it didn&#x27;t :( When I woke up the product didn&#x27;t sink into my skin. Instead my face looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my face for days! It was so oily and I started to break out so badly in little white heads on my cheek, which I still haven&#x27;t gotten rid of :( I so, so, soooo wanted this to work out, but it didn&#x27;t :/</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  For wintry dry skin it is brilliant.  Especially for dry lips.  Silky smooth and easy to apply....and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever. We use it on all cuts, scrapes and minor skin irritations. It&#x27;s also great as a lotion for dry skin, and the best tattoo healer I have ever used. Seems a little expensive but so worth it. Everyone should have this in their house. A</li>
            <li> This has helped my dry winter hands more than any other product!  I love it!  I also love that it came to me in two -2 oz containers, rather than 1- 4 oz.  That way i can keep one at home and one at work.  It also works great on fly aways/frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> This did not live up to the description. I don&#x27;t like the smell and it is greasy. It has an uncomfortable feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, heals dry skin and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li> For a person with normal skin, no acne, blemishes, uneven skin tone.  I can&#x27;t really tell what it does to my skin, besides just keep it moisturize. Like every other face moisturize.  $20 for this, if u have normal skin with no problem, i recommend getting just a regular moisturize</li>
            <li> I rarely rave about a skin product. I have no idea why this cream works so well; it just does. For ten days I have been using it on my hands, under eye area, and chest. The skin on my chest has chronic problems from sun damage, including breakouts and sore, dry patches similar to contact dermatitis. The product has worked wonders on that area --  my skin now has a softer texture, the red spots seem to be disappearing, and no more breakouts. I have also noticed that when I put it on my hands the effect lasts all day without the need to re-apply. It also seems like one jar will last forever; only a tiny amount seems to do the trick. I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me.  I was expecting it to be fairly impressive given reviews and I&#x27;ve tried it on face and body.  Doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of moisturizing or aiding my skin in any other way but I do like the texture and I&#x27;ve been using it as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> Moisturize s well but a bit sticky</li>
            <li> Very soothing.. Helps psoriasis</li>
            <li> Hated this. Super super greasy. I think I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, lips, arms and chest. I put it on before bed (a couple hours before if I can) and when I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and soft. I worried it would make my pillowcase and sheets greasy, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it if you have acne! It makes it worse!</li>
            <li> Used it for a week now. Skin feels softer and smoother.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> my daughter recommended this and it&#x27;s great.. it feels good and makes your skin soft too.how could it be bad when it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I suffer from allergies  and have particularly sensitive skin around my eyes. In the  past this has led to dry itchy and at times even flaky skin in and around my eye sockets. I tried everything from expensive lotions, to oils and strange green salves from the health food store. Most things would burn and irritate my skin causing more itching and flaking. Then the owner of an herb store suggested this. That was about 15 years ago and I have never  been without a jar since.  I don&#x27;t know about the other claims and uses of Egyptian magic, but I  know I  would not survive the dry air of winter or the allergy season without it. It is very pricey, but I only go through about a jar a year as it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize the dry skin and relieve the itching. I  love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works like magic! Keeps skin soft and smooth for hours. Great on cuticles! Natural ingredients and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very sensitive, very dry skin due to illiness.  What Egyptian Magic does to your skin is truly magic!!  My skin is so soft and hydrated!!  The seller was kind enough to send me an email when they shipped my Eqyptian Magic explaining how to use the product, how to know the product was authentic and contact information in case I had any questions.  Another plus is what it has done for my husband.  My husband has psoriasis on his face.  When I received my order, the seller had included a couple of samples with my jar.  I gave the samples to my husband to try.  In less than 24 hrs his psoriasis no longer itches and has faded quite a bit!!  I can not wait to see what it does with everyday use!  I only wish I had purchased Egyptian Magic ages ago.  It would have saved us both much heartache and money.  I will be purchasing another jar as soon as I finish this review.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was very greasy. I got it because I was reading about it in a few magazines/interviews. I got and its incredibly greasy, there is no scent which that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, and it takes a long time to absorb, I put it on before bed and I wake up and its still not absorbed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s really not a cream but more of an ointment. I use quite liberally at night before bed. It helped lighten a few darks spots, and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Good skin product.that is not greasy.not greasey</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy texture that you think will feel heavy on the face but it doesn&#x27;t and is very breathable. I am so far really enjoying this cream and feel that it is the perfect moisturizer during the winter months.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream (4 oz.)]]  My hand therapy specialist saw the results. My scaring was very minimal, compared to others, who had similar surgeries, I had 6, on my left hand. I rubbed the cream in and kept it moist. A year later, it is hardly visible to the naked eye. I have to look hard to find the scars. Previous surgeries, did not do as well, I didn&#x27;t use the cream. Had surgery this year, again. Using the cream. It helps for dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t discovered Egyptian Magic yet, this skin cream is marvelous. It&#x27;s worth every penny - a four ounce jar will last you forever since there&#x27;s no water in it, it&#x27;s a very concentrated and rich emulsion of olive oil, beeswax, royal jelly and other natural ingredients. It makes a fantastic lip balm or gloss, it heals uncomfortable dry patches anywhere on your body, it softens cuticles, it makes a great eye cream when my eyes are irritated by allergies. It is a little rich and heavy for a regular face moisturizer for me (my skin is normal although it&#x27;s a little dry in the winter), although from time to time if my face is feeling tight I will dab on a little at night. I have even used it on my dog&#x27;s ears when he has scratched and irritated them! (I wouldn&#x27;t use it anywhere he could lick, though - I think it probably smells and tastes too tempting).</li>
            <li> I bought this in my continuing quest for something to help my atopic dermatitis (a form of eczema that is an allergic rash that itches and causes dry, flaky and leathery skin).  The best stuff the allergists/dermatologists can come up with is Eucerin, which gives doctors samples by the bucket.  Well creams won&#x27;t touch my eczema.  This stuff (which is really a solid that melts to an oily consistency on contact) works beautifully.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but I love that it&#x27;s all natural and I LOVE what it does for my skin.  It coats and protects the skin, locking in moisture and letting the skin heal. My skin is so much better now, and whenever I feel like scratching, I just put more of this stuff on.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in two years.  I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product!  Use it every night, carry some in my purse as well.  Not too greasy like vaseline but still moisturizing enough for extra dry skin.  Use it on my baby too- this will now be my go too moisturizing product!</li>
            <li> My kids have eczema and this did nothing for that other than as a decent moisturizer. Even then, aquaphor or vaseline works better than this. This cream would be ok as a something between a cream and a lotion, and it has a honey smell.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I used it on my ears where I had some dry/flaky/itchy thing going on and it cleared up after one use. I use it all over my body, even my face. It works great on my dry &amp; cracked heels. I have super sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out. The only problem is that I have used 1/2 of the jar in less than 2 weeks. I&#x27;m going to order the cheaper alternative Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic to see if it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Nice product! I love that.I always use this all year ,so I will buy this in the following days ,thank you .</li>
            <li> expensive but very good especially at night</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay has nothing on this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good I like it and it lasts for ever great to use before you go to bed.  I think it&#x27;s great to prevent wrinkles also.</li>
            <li> Best all around skin emulsion.</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to use this product. I consistently used it for about a month. I used it as a night creme and the only results I&#x27;ve seen was that my skin was a bit softer. I also tried putting it  on my hair (curly) and it just made it feel thicker and greasy. So if you may have thin feeling hair, you may want to use the creme for a thicker feel. Overall, the product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Egyptian magic website states how to tell if your jar is counterfiet - if the \\&quot;use by date\\&quot; is printed and not engraved its counterfeit. The jar I received from this company had the \\&quot; use by date\\&quot; printed in black on the bottom. Not engraved.......disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t let me give zero stars</li>
            <li> This product is okay for the most part, it didn&#x27;t really improve my skin but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. The bad thing about the product is the hygiene issue- you have to dip your fingers inside, so make sure they are clean. Also, the cream is a great moisturizer and the product lasts for quite a while. The cream is also very universal, you can use it for a variety of needs. I say try it!</li>
            <li> This is a comforting balm.  I used it on a couple of burns I received while cooking and on some psoriasis spots on my face.</li>
            <li> recieveced my 3 jars- The jars are very small- I am just not impressed with this product.  Too oily- and has not helped with the dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Being older, I&#x27;ve noticed changes in my sun damaged skin on arms and chest.  I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Magic for a couple of weeks now and have been happy to see improvement in texture and reduction in wrinkles and scaring.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! Not too oily, aroma just like honey in wax form. Have started using it and it&#x27;s great for acne-skin like me. Not too oily, face stays matte a while after application.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews about this product an how so many celebs were using it. I love the fact that its all natural and I can wear it under my makeup. The only thing is I have super dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t heel it just masks the dryness while its on y face. I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect dry skin cream that actually heels it and not just temporarily. But still alright</li>
            <li> The product helped my son&#x27;s eczema to his extremities . At first he liked the cream. The cream has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I just had so many surgeries and has applies this cream at night before bed and in a few days the scars have been fading. The healing powers of this cream is truly great. There are many false creams out there that try to advertise as the same company so beware. Maybe thats where all these negative reviews are coming from, but I suggest to people to get the actual cream from the actual website!!! Duh not amazon! [...]</li>
            <li> Ship so fast. But the cream is indeed magic for everything. I started using it for Mosquito bites, it stops the itch like magic. Started giving to friends&#x27; children to stop them from scratching themselves from the bites. Used it for burn, excellent, no scars, healed fast. Now I use it for everything. it is magic, magic and magic. Try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because a friend recommend it to me and I&#x27;m really glad she did it. It seems to work for every skin type, my friend even has acne. The only negative fact I can find is that it&#x27;s a little oily , but this is also why I only use it at night time.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff in the dry winter.  I&#x27;ve purchased it many times and it moisturizes without irritating sensitive skin.  Results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.  My husband has dry skin on his face and forehead.  It works great and has no odor.  I will buy this forever.</li>
            <li> okay so i been using this for about 2 months straight every night and at first i saw no difference whats so ever.. my first month in i realized my  blemishes left on my cheek did get less dark by prob 1 or 2 shades . i used it as a night cream for these two months and would wake up with a glow on my face.... it worked great on my feet and kept them from getting dry... im not sure if its worth the price .... if u have light blemishes on your cheek and wanna try getting rid of them u can try but this also didnt help get rid of any acne. the first week i wore this i broke out and thought i would never try this cream again. i gave it another try the following week and i didnt break out so maybe it had nothing to do with the cream but as i kept wearing it, i did notice a difference in blemishes... and helped make my feet not dry which im sure other lotions can do also.... its a nice product, nothing too crazy for me to keep bragging about.</li>
            <li> Loved it and ordered again</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever, all natural ingredients,</li>
            <li> I use it on hands feet face brand new, sealed jar. its lite enough it soaks in to skin give it about a week to see a change.</li>
            <li> Tried this for about two weeks. Didn&#x27;t have any amazing results, but not too bad overall. I had trouble getting this oil absorbed by my skin--it would just sit on top of my face for half an hour. It also makes my skin produce more oil naturally as well, I feel like. I also haven&#x27;t had any noticeable improvements in my skin hydration or softness, but it does make my skin feel slightly more elastic while it&#x27;s on in the mornings. However, as I&#x27;m acne-prone, the excessive oil does make me break out a little bit. There isn&#x27;t a very strong scent, which is nice. It smells lightly of honeyed wax.</li>
            <li> Egyptian magic has many uses.. Very moisturizing. Everyone in my house wants to use it, I have to hide it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and for a variety of skin issues or problems.  In fact I gave this to a friend who was having chemotherapy and their skin was burned and it worked wonders, truly does have &amp;#34;healing properties&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for chapped lips, dry wintered skin, de-frizzer for hair, etc., etc. Been using this for years! Getting more expensive as the years go by but, so is everything else..... One 4 oz. container lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li> After years of cracks on my fingers I finally found the answer. This product is amazing! I will not go without a jar ever.</li>
            <li> honestly, it is very oil, however you can warm it until melt, I use nothing but the oil cream after washing my face at night. it&#x27;s about half a month, the scar of pimple becomes light, and i think if i use longer, it will disappear!</li>
            <li> Your skin will thank you.  Your hair will thank you.  A little goes a long way and it really is moisture magic.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and use it all over.  My skin is on the dry side and the moisturizing effects last all day.  I saw Rachael Zoe recommended it so how could I go wrong.</li>
            <li> This facial product is not overwhelming and too greasy. I find it very effective for the neck. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I have fairly severe eczema in my hands and have found that Egyptian Magic is the best at keeping my hands hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have some of the most pitted scars and abrasive skin post 2 cycles of Accutane treatment and after 4 years of ceasing treatment, my skin&#x27;s extreme oiliness and breakouts returned. I apply about a nice small grape sized dollop, make it an oily lather and massage into my face every night. It&#x27;s sticky, smells like cardboard, and gets messy, but holy mother of god this Egyptian magic literally is magic. My scars are healing nicely, pores shrinking and my skin is glowing like a pregnant woman&#x27;s. It&#x27;s worth the price. I have olive, oily middle eastern skin. It&#x27;s also awesome for women who have really dry skin, as I apply it to my lips to moisturize and heal up cracks.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing but little bit oily.</li>
            <li> I just take a small amount of it and put it on my hand until it becomes oil and then apply it on my neck. I did not try it on the face because it really looks oil!!</li>
            <li> I reluctantly bought this at Whole Foods the first time for $45.  It was a big gamble but I needed something for my dry feet.  I was so impressed!  It totally works and it&#x27;s half the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and effective for dry skin in winter. Saved me from the cold and dry winter here. I think it can be used for years and share with your family. Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> it deliver what it promise&lt;br /&gt;but if youre using it for your face dont but too much or it will cause break out&lt;br /&gt;but seriously this is the fifth time i bought it and i will do it again</li>
            <li> Miracle worker. My face is so soft and radiant now... I have had 2 sore/swollen eyelash follicles though. Never had that before. Something in this is clogging or something. I&#x27;ve just been more careful about getting it around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use it on my body, hands &amp; feet. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this for my face in the long NY winters! A must have!</li>
            <li> It IS magic. Great formula, I use it on the body, too (especially arches of the feet, hands and elbows - and don&#x27;t forget the neck).</li>
            <li> Works great as moisturizer under makeup and does smooth the skin with continued use. Try it on your neck and arms as well.  Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for cuticles, feet, elbows, etc. If you don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; this isn&#x27;t for you. It is an intense moisturizer &amp; I love it. Wouldn&#x27;t use on face tho. Great for legs, arms, hands, feet, nails. Bought this at a Spa for about $15 more! Really saved on Amazon. Great for gifts.</li>
            <li> I like it for the most part, but sometimes a few red dots appear ion my face.  I do not know if it is an allergic reaction.  The dots disappear if I put hydrocortisome cream on them.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better thing to keep the environment from drawing the moisture out of my skin, which is GOOD since dry skin is often wrinkly skin. And this material has no frightening laboratory chemicals in it. It is also not greasy, although in the jar it seems to have the consistency of shoe polish in a can....it liquefies and can be smoothed into the skin easily. I like it, and generally I do not like things of this sort. I am going to use it!</li>
            <li> I had been reading about this product for some time and decided to go for it and order it. I am really glad that I did. My skin has such a radiant glow to it when I wear this. I like it because it does not have a smell to it that would clash with my perfume when I wear it. My skin feels and looks FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, as advertised. But not really \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; or anything special. Just a normal skin cream. Would not buy again. Just buy normal Nivea Creme from the supermarket for $4 just as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful to my acne. And it can moisturize a lot. All is good except that its too oily. I should wash it again and again.</li>
            <li> Ok hi I was really iffy on this product at first I seen how expensive it was on amazon so I used a site called aliexpress.com and purchased this product for 10.00 yes I said 10.00 not 35 I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but it&#x27;s been 2weeks and my skin looks really good just make sure you have a really good cleanser I use personally use black soap and I only use this for my face at night it&#x27;s too oily for day time use on the face I have combination skin I hope you guys find this useful</li>
            <li> The wife loves it, I hate it..... If she doesn&#x27;t shower it off completely with soap, it leaves a brown scum &amp; brown bubbles in the hot tub! It will defiantly hold  in moisture in the desert!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Yes a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;... but it&#x27;s a different type of product,  so I use it at night or wait 15 minutes between application and makeup. Or use it on days when I am not planning on wearing too much makeup. Works great under ponds luminous bb cream.</li>
            <li> This kind product is real magic and usefull for dry air hight humidity make my skin smoot oil water but not oily to much. Nice !</li>
            <li> it saved my skin during winter!my skin is annoying during winter, easily get dry and I mix he egyptian magic cream and aloe gel together on my skin and that worked so well, neither oil or dry, it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off for years.  I am really particular about scented products, and this product does not have a lasting odor.  I also find the product to not be greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this skin cream, it&#x27;s very greasy though. Feels great on skin, not sure it it&#x27;s making me more beautiful, but it feels nice. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge, but good so far.</li>
            <li> I love it!  The change is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 2 weeks and it actually made my skin more dry.  I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I want this one a long time. But I didn&#x27;t use it yet. Some people said this one is useful for scar and dry skin. They said although it&#x27;s feel oil but skin feel very comfortable after use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is good, The smell is really bad and I have many acne.</li>
            <li> I bought several  Egyptian Magic Cream for my mother in law and for my friends long time ago from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;But I just find out it is totally fake Egyptian Magic Cream!&lt;br /&gt;Because one day i noticed the paint on the container fell off terribly. So I opened it to check inside. And I realize the cream is not like the real one I bought from other place. Both the smell and the texture are DIFFERENT from the real one.&lt;br /&gt;I posted here just help others to know the truth!</li>
            <li> I love that it is made from natural ingredients and it&#x27;s helping my scars fade a little.  However, it does feel a bit sticky after application so I use less for my skin to absorb it all.</li>
            <li> The seller is apparently not trustable and the product selling here is fake!!! I felt weird when I saw the barcode under the jar was scratched, which looks like they are hiding sth. And when I open the jar, it smells totally different from my last bottle, or you can say this bottle has not smell at all, which is ridiculous compare to the sesame oil smell of the real one. The real Egyptian Magic is great and I love it very much, but this one is so disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this.</li>
            <li> was told to be useful</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I think things like this depends on how the skin is to begin with - there is nothing magic about achieving younger looking skin after it has been aged.  The product feels good going on and lasts throughout the day and night if applied as directed.</li>
            <li> This is way too greasy for my face. It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not find anything special about this product. It&#x27;s just OK, it really does not feel or smell good, did not do anything to my dry hands. I would not order again.</li>
            <li> this is a good smelling all purpose moisturizer that I have been using on my face and other areas. I think it has put some life into my desert dry skin!</li>
            <li> I love to put this on before going to bed. A little bit of it goes a long way. My skin always feel more supple when I wake up the next morning after an application of the Egyptian magic cream the night before. It does gets a little too oily and I don&#x27;t like it when I feel that I&#x27;m rubbing the moisturizer all over my pillow case. So I try to put it on an hour or so before bed to avoid that feeling!</li>
            <li> I read about the product in a magazine and decided to try it.  I love it because you can use if for every part of your body including hair.  I do not like products with a lot of perfume, so this is perfect and and it does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  I would definity recommend people giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my skin type.  Easy to apply if you follow the directions.  A little goes a long way so the 4-oz size is a good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the first two that I&#x27;ve purchased it&#x27;s just too greasy.  The sad thing is I&#x27;ve purchased two @ $72.00 for my son and I.&lt;br /&gt;I should have save my money. All the years purchasing from Amazon this is the second time I didn&#x27;t received what I have ordered but the first time writing in am really not please with this. The solid Egyptian Magic would  put a smile back on my face it did everything it said it would, I would like to share with others and purchase again but fearful of getting that greasy one again. There&#x27;s another product that does the same with the same ingredient I&#x27;m thinking of trying, I give one star because it&#x27;s NOT the original.</li>
            <li> Too greasy and no cosmetic value at all, there are far better products out there.  I wound not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using bacitracin on a knee scrap and it just continued to get worse and was clearly beginning to scar badly. After two weeks i caved in and spent the money on this stuff after hearing many great things. I am so glad i did, after a couple hours the knee was looking and feeling so much better! Hours! I recommend this product whole heartedly!</li>
            <li> This is great seller. Merchandise arrived sooner that I have expected . The cream was new and originally packed.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very sensitive skin , but this cream is 100 % natural and does not have alcohol or perfumes so it does not cause irritation. Thank you for speedy delivery and great product.&lt;br /&gt;Dorota</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer,it made me a little lighter wen I was using,plus my lips turned pink cos I use it as a lip balm also.did not help wit my acne thou but soo far da best....I&#x27;m HOOKED!!</li>
            <li> This is my personal usage review that may help individuals with sensitive + acne + eczema skin in their 20s. I&#x27;ve also shared my difficult trials with skin problems towards the end of the review if you want to read my whole experience .  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product combination + timing is so important when applying this product! For me, Egyptian Magic worked AWESOMELY when I apply it at least 3-4 hours before bed time. I think this gave my skin plenty of time to absorb the nutrients in the cream and not just rub them off on my pillow.  Here&#x27;s my take on getting the perfect skin result I wanted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash your face well with warm water using gentle, organic face wash. Do it 3-4 hours before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply gentle organic toner using a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3) Let the toner dry on your skin for 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;4) Gently rub 2 fingers in Egyptian Magic in circular motion 5-6 times.&lt;br /&gt;5) Then put it on your palm, rub your palms together in circular motion for 4-5 times quickly.&lt;br /&gt;6) Quickly apply the oil to your forehead and spread it cross evenly.&lt;br /&gt;7) Repeat step 4 &amp; 5&lt;br /&gt;8) Quickly apply the oil to your cheeks in upward movement&lt;br /&gt;9) Dab a little more oil to your nose, mouth and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a complicated skin problem where I break out in acne, but I have certain areas on my cheek that is very sensitive, patchy and dry. It was so hard to find a cream that is not loaded with all sorts of chemicals, that can help prevent my dry spots drying, and help prevent acne! Most skin products out there can only help you in one of the affected areas. I tried all sorts of products from American products like Clinique, Paula&#x27;s Choice to Foreign Brands like Face Shop (Korea), AquaMoist (Japan) that are reasonable in price, but none of them worked. Then my cousin recommended me to try Egyptian Magic as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of it&#x27;s thick consistency, I hate to use it during the day. So I only use it as a night cream. At first, the cream didn&#x27;t work well when I use it after I applied my Face Shop acne facewash and toner. It did make my skin baby soft, but not very effective in calming my acne and dry patches (Eczema).  I normally take a shower 1 hour before bed time and sleep immediately. The cream felt so thick and heavy and I get more acne in the morning. Then I tried to play around with it by using a different facewash &amp; toner for sensitive skin (in this case, USANA Sense Facewash &amp; Toner) and then apply Egyptian Magic oil afterwards. I also took my shower hours earlier before bed time. Then overnight, I saw a major difference with my skin. My dry patches was reduced significantly, no new acne developed and my skin looked younger in years.  I finally got the result that everyone here was proclaiming about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all my sisters and brothers out there trying to establish picture perfect skin!didn&#x27;t work well when I use it after I applied my Face Shop acne facewash and toner.

            <li> This is a great product for your skin.  I use it at night before I go to bed.  It makes my skin softer and makes wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I only write review if I am extremely happy or disappointed in the product. This product is the worst skin product I ever spent money on. First I bought from Amazon, after a huge disappointment I though may be the product was fake from Amazon so I bought directly from the company,but I experienced same disappointing result.&lt;br /&gt;First, professionally I am in pharmaceutical industry. Any skin product must go through vigorous standard procedure of absorption through skin in almost all the ethnic group with successful absorption results in order to get drug approval. I highly doubt if this product has done any that sort of study (even if it doesn&#x27;t need a prescription, they have to do some basic testing or study). What I found out is that this product doesn&#x27;t absorb at all through skin, but it just creates a shiny coat over your skin. What ever ingredients they claim you are not getting it at all so what&#x27;s the use of using this expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money this is a big marketing scam. You will be highly disappointed and you won&#x27;t be alone. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and this product works better than all of them - hands down (pun intended). I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It is sooooo moisturizing.  When I say I have dry skin - I mean I have dry skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;This really helps moisturize my hands and body.  I love it on my cuticles. I have used it on my face also.&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a great alllll around moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this d/t all the recommendations I have seen by celebrities in a couple of magazines I subscribe to.  It&#x27;s greasy and has NO smell. If it does its of virgin olive oil. Too oily for me.  Not at all worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream to put on at night before bed. Good for the skin and makes my fingernails stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to use as a moisturizer for my dry, aging, wrinkly face because Egyptian Magic doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemical ingredients.  As a face cream, it IS super thick &amp; gloppy; a teeny bit warmed in your hands goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face does get greasy as the day wears on and I do end up wiping down my face.  That must sound terrible but I don&#x27;t mind because the cream is really wonderful.  No more dry skin, and I like the honey smell when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a kind of test, I started putting it on a wart.  Not a wart really... what do you call those dark raised age spots?  Keratosis or something.  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and those suckers seem to pop up overnight.  After a month&#x27;s use, I was really shocked to see that my mole/wart/raisedbrownspot disappeared.  G O N E.  Serious magic if you ask me.  Now, of course I&#x27;m slathering over all my spots, and so is my husband.  He has many very dark raised spots (not cancerous, thank you), and the big one under his eye is smaller now.  (he is a lot less religious about applying it than I am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY takes the itch out of my mosquito bites.  Cat scratches on my ankle healed dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the claims that Amazon&#x27;s product is fake...  while it might be so, if you go to Egyptian Magic&#x27;s website, they have a nice explanation of the situation, and they stopped using the word &amp;#34;Kamitian&amp;#34; on the label.  The tub I bought did have the &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; embossing on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what I bought WAS fake, hey, bring it on because it&#x27;s sure working for us!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1st jar regular price....it was very good.  I bought 2 jars on sale to my regret.  The product was grainy and would not melt or absorb.  Must be very old sitting on a hot shelf.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff not too greasy and does the job. Instant relief for dry skin :-)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. All natural product. No alcohol.  Love Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I use this as a night cream and I also use a small amount after i get out of the shower before I put my make-up on.  I love that it&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and additives and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting but a good face cream</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, maybe my skin is already too oily. However, will give it another try once winter arrives and the weather is dryer.</li>
            <li> Seems helping my girl&#x27;s hair damage due to frequent swims.</li>
            <li> This item is good but a bit different than what I expected. Will make good use of it anyway. Thanks for having many products available to purchase</li>
            <li> Why do people rave about this product? MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SKIN PROBLEM? I don&#x27;t . Maybe it would be good for people with skin problem.</li>
            <li> This is truly magic. I bought it after reading about it in a magazine and it lives up to the hype. Worth twice the price, and then some. I use it on my face at night and my skin looks and feels softer, less lined, younger! (I&#x27;m 41 and used to love the sun) I also use it on my chest, as I have a lot of sun damage in that area; the deep set lines that I thought would never go away have almost completely disappeared. I cannot praise this product enough, although I do wish it smelled better. I guess that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the miraculous recovery my skin has made in the last six months. I say BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My wife uses Egyptian Magic and likes it very much.  She says it removes many of the fine facial lines that other products fail to erase. She depends on it. I depend on her, so it all works out for the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent, replaced many other products with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the hype but was disappointed. Carolla&#x27;s Beeswax Skin Creme is a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product! It is NOT WORTH $30. I looked at the 700 or so good reviews and thought that meant it was possibly worth $30 or so but this is not the product it used to be in the past. I used to use this about 15 - 20 years ago and it was MUCH better back then - and MUCH less expensive.I believe it used to be around $10 or $12 back then The product has much gotten thinner in consistency and the scent much less faint. Honestly it seems to just be an olive oil solid with very little else added. The scent used to be better also. I reached out to the Egyptian Magic company twice to inquire about the product and have gotten no response. It does not seem to be an actual business but more of just an answering service, some marketing and distribution. I honestly believe the makers of this product are taking full advantage of the reputation it had in the past. The quality is absolutely not what it used to be. You are better off buying the ingredients on your own and getting much more for your hard-earned money.</li>
            <li> This product is great for eczema. My son who&#x27;s a toddler was experiencing eczema due to the cold weather and this nipped it in the bud. His skin is now healing very nicely and looks great. I love that it&#x27;s natural...I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li> It gets very hard in winter, and kind of hard to dig out even a little piece.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my face and hair after reading reviews online. It works great on my face, I apply this cream after using my clay mask and makes my skin soft and smooth afterwards. I also use this as night cream and it gave my skin a noticeable glow too. But when my grandmother&#x27;s arms experienced itching to her lower arm, I had to try this product on her skin as her lotion wasn&#x27;t working and surprisingly, it this Magic Cream worked for her! Since I don&#x27;t like this product to be cross-contaminated (from her skin to my skin), I bought her a separate lotion in the drugstore for her itch but it still didn&#x27;t work. So this is the only product that works for her and I ended up giving the entire tube to her LOL. This is an all natural product that&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 oz and 2 oz jar of Egyptian Magic and I love this stuff when I travel! My skin usually gets super dry when traveling and rubbing a dab of the cream into my cuticles and palms keeps them from cracking. Also patting a little onto my cheeks keeps them from getting too dry. It works great on my hair too - it tames the fly-aways beautifully. I also found another great use for it - on my last trip I woke up with a cold sore, and putting a small dab of Egyptian Magic on it throughout the day has kept it moisturized and aided in healing. It is fantastic! I have to stop short of saying it is a miracle, but it really is a fantastic multi-purpose product, and well worth packing on your next trip.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin treatment. Too greasy for me to wear on my face during the day but great for nighttime, and for any part of the body. I love it for hands and feet. It does heal cuts quickly too.</li>
            <li> - Too expensive for the simple things it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;- Used it for a month on scars, but nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;- Really oily, not recommended for people combination skin - oily.</li>
            <li> Egyptian a very magic cream.. For my whole family.. For all skin problem.. I really really love this product and proud to use it  .. Many friends also already prove this magic cream..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined a few years ago I&#x27;d use something as thick as this on my face, but instead of causing any sort of breakout, it retained the moisture.  I only wore at night though- I did not want my face to be shiny during the day, and takes a while to absorb fully.  But never caused any sort of unwanted reaction.  Lasted a long time too.</li>
            <li> Its light and greasy.  I didnt notice anything special.  I dont want it on my pillows &amp; I cant wear it under make up.  Overall, yet another pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice, but oilly. It can just be uesd as night cream. Everytime you just need a small piece. And it is effective for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like it, it a little bit oil, I suggest use it as night cream. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> so greasy!! i don&#x27;t know why there would be so many of you like it! it simly greasy and bad smell!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. It is like a drink of water for my skin. You have to remember to rub it between palms before applying and do it right after washing  your face to avoid the greasy feeling on your skin. My daughter also uses it on her eczema and her face. We LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no fragrance at all and a little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this with Sweet Bee Magic, can&#x27;t tell any difference, both are good for my skin. It&#x27;ll be excellent for the dry winter.</li>
            <li> This stuff works super on my desert feet. One application and a huge improvement. I put little sock on afterwards because it is a bit tacky but worth it. I like it on my face and chest too.. Ill be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> this product works very well and has produced a noticeable improvement in my skin. it is not a typical fluffy, emulsified face cream; it&#x27;s more of a semi-solid mixture of oils that you have to warm up on your fingertips before application. if you don&#x27;t warm it up and allow it to liquefy a bit, it can be difficult to apply. all in all, pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> I got it at Costco awhile ago. Came as a set (two sizes).&lt;br /&gt;It smells like Vaseline and it feels like one, except that Vaseline will give you much more benefits then this cream.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin bur realize I need some moisture and love this product at night. A little goes a long way - on face and neck. I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, per previous feedback, and it works great for my curly, sometimes frizzy locks. My esthetician recommended this to me. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give a good review yet because I have not used it much. It appears to be what I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> As described this product is a little greasy but works great to apply at night. I have put it on my face with no problems of breakouts. I can tell a noticable difference in the overall softness and appearence of my skin. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Ive beend using this product for a few years now, and I swear by it, I use it at night about 2 weeks out of the month, and it makes my skin so nice, and moist. It is great and all natural, and you can use it on your hair and body as well. Awesome Cream!</li>
            <li> Since I first discovered that this cured my eczema, I&#x27;ve been using it for every itch and dry skin. It can cure eczema as well as cracked feet or fingers. It also helps heal scratches easily. I used it for my son&#x27;s rashes when he was a baby, and he still uses it for winter itch. Needless to say, we can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff, love how it melts, in your hands, then apply to skin, HOWEVER, my skin is now all dried out, scaly and dry, WTH? Anyone else have this happen? Been using it about 3 months.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my friend and he likes it very much, and i guess it is useful for him. whatever i rate 5 stars are great to have.</li>
            <li> Use on whole body-hands,feet,face.  Great moisturizer.  No odor.  Would def buy again</li>
            <li> In the last year I have started getting eczema on my face.  It has been very frustrating.  I thought I would give this product a try, even though none of the reviews mentioned eczema.  Anyway, after I started using it my face eczema was gone in a month.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions in the world....good for EVERYTHING skin related... Dry patchy, flakey, itchy red, or even spotty skin but best of all it is great for normal skin too! Absolute Skin miracle!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, and have been using this cream for just a few weeks, and I LOVE it already! My face gets so dry in the winter, uneven tone, and very reactive, and it looks great right now. A lot more even, not dry, and it  has a glow to it. My skin is pretty sensitive, and I react to a lot of products, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, and is a great consistency and spreads easy. Feels oily at first, but absorbs into my skin pretty quickly. The best part is getting beautiful skin without all the chemicals and bad stuff in other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have tried many product to cure my acne.  This is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for older,terribly dry winter skin.  Better than the really high end stuff. Is all natural.  I wish they would leave off the mystical chant from the jar. Will probably keep me from buying again.</li>
            <li> This works really great if you have dry skin. I use it as a night cream and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this cream around for years and just recently purchased it at Whole Foods. This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face at night and my skin looks much smoother. It has incredible healing ingredients;great for scrapes,dry skin, minor irritations,you name it, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use anywhere. My face tends to get oily,but a little goes a long way, don&#x27;t be afraid to use it on oily skin. It&#x27;s also great around the eyes at night and helps smooth your lips. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  works very well !!  I use it on my face and hands but it can be used all over the body.  My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> I use this as an overnight acne cream. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have had only a small amount of acne (hormone related; that&#x27;s going to happen no matter what).  This wouldn&#x27;t work on some skin types, but on mine it works great.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and thought it felt really nice for the first few times I applied it.  I now have zits all over my usually blemish free face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 5 years and it works wonders for my dry skin.  I recommend this to anyone who has extremely dry skin. I use it every night before I go to sleep on my face, neck, and hands.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and it&#x27;s pretty oily, it&#x27;s ok for the body but not for the face, which is what I wanted to use it for. I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural though.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I find it to be very expensive. For four ounces $35.00.  I wish that it was not so expensive</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this on my face I have ditched all the expensive facial moisturizers and I&#x27;m loving my complexion. My smile lines have diminished greatly and I think this may be the cause!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does give a slight oily sheen to your face but I like that.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face every night after washing for a full two months.  I did not see any changes to my skin for the better...</li>
            <li> I like the stuff but not for that amount$. Greed. what a bummer. I will have to wait for the hype of this product to die down, then I will hopefully get it a fair decent price again.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter has been using this for years. It is especially soothing for eczema. It is a must have for them.</li>
            <li> Interesting smell.....used it and will continue to use it (on face and feet). I have not flown so I have not used it when my skin was very dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading numerous reviews. I used the product for 1 week and stopped using it. This product is very oily and did not absorb into my skin well, even when I used the littlest amount I possibly could to cover my face. Within 2 hours my face was very oily because of the product. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, not as much as the cystic acne I got after using this product. I have never had a problem with cystic acne, after using this product for a week my lower face is full of cystic acne, and it is painful. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice and is very oily, it did however make my skin feel soft, until I got the cystic acne anyway. The product is fairly heavy to be putting on skin, and I saw no healing or change in my skin. I wish I never purchased this product because now I am out $30, and still have a almost full container left. Now I have to buy acne products as well.</li>
            <li> i look my friend used this product , she told me her feet skin is bad ,but used this product every well now, i tried this product same she said, very well , my feet skin change very well. i love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what all the reviews say. As far as I concerned this is just a greasy cream which does nothing to your skin.</li>
            <li> I always wondered what this was as in many beauty magzines the write ups were fantastic and now I know why. So smooth and great results....an absolute wonderful product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is definitely hydrating and thick, I eventually had to add a vitamin E serum into my routine to completely hydrate - I recommend the Body Shops serum.  But overall, for those blustery winter days, I apply this to my cheeks nose and lips to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to this product and it is great.  Use it on my face and body, really hydrates.  Also great for cuticles.  Really delivers and pure ingredients.  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it! I will order more soon! My skin was damaged by constant, low level radiation at work for three years. My skin went from looking 30 to 65 in that time. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of vitamins, lotions, etc., everything that you don&#x27;t have to go to a plastic surgeons office to do. I&#x27;m scared of that stuff but maybe some day I&#x27;ll venture into that. Anyway, this stuff helped and nothing else has come close to what this did. And I even put a thin layer of it on my face which is prone to break out with anything greasy like this and it doesn&#x27;t. You can put it everywhere. :) The ingredients are all natural, just olive oil and all the good things from bees you can possibly get. It also seems to even out my skin tone. I put it everywhere as soon as I get out of the shower. I stirred in a little jasmine essential oil to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> this is not so much a CREAM as it is an OINTMENT which is both greasy and tacky at the same time. This makes it difficult to apply without using a lot of pressure and pulling on facial skin. Not only that, it is difficult to keep it from getting in your hair unless you wear a cap all the time, and if used as a night cream, your face will stick to the pillow. It also made my face break out. I stuck with it for awhile despite all of these issues but  I saw zero improvement in my skin after a month of using this product. It&#x27;s not even good as a body cream , due to the stickiness factor. It&#x27;s not the most expensive skin product I&#x27;ve tried but at $28.00 for a 4 oz jar, it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap either.  I am totally unhappy with this product. I would not buy it again NOR would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. A bit pricey, but I can tell you if you use it on a scar after surgery, it just about&lt;br /&gt;disappears. It also lasts quite a long time, as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt; I also use it on my elbows , heels and where skin is particularly dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on my crows feet/smile lines and my frown lines on my forehead. Nothing else has worked as well as this cream. The instructions say to take a moderate amount, rub it with your finger in the palm of your other hand till it&#x27;s a smooth oil like consistency then smooth on your skin. There is very little smell to it and again, nothing else has worked for me to help smooth my lines. Also this cleared up the dry, flaky skin under my eyes ( I live in a very dry area and I tried everything, but nothing worked ). I have a seen this at Costco recently at the same price but for 2 jars! (one jar was slightly smaller but still a bargain). But since this is oil based, if you have acne pro skin, use sparingly until you see how your skin reacts to it. For the areas I do not put the Egyptian Magic on I use a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My mother initially bought this and did not like the feeling of this, considering it&#x27;s more of a balm instead of a cream. So she gave it to me, and man, am I glad I started using this. I used to have really bad breakouts from when I was 11 to about 18 years old, and now I no longer have it. But I do have scars and I use this for that as well as to keep the acne away and it works!! It makes my skin look so healthy and glowing and my family and friends have noticed the difference and always ask what I use. It also works well as a healing balm for tattoos (unscented, natural, no parabens, no mineral oil, no lanolin-&gt;bad for tattoos!), and I have three of them. I have not used it on my hair as that might be a bad idea, my hair tends to get oily fast after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for feet that are always in boots, I would know :) I used it the whole time when I was training; for bug bites, scars, calloused feet, to keep acne away, and an after-sun balm because Ft. Leonard Wood, MO/Ft. Jackson, SC is so brilliantly hot and sunny in May-August!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, I will always use it for all of the above uses because I am attracted to all-natural balms. It feels great on my skin and is the only product (and I&#x27;ve tried many!) that makes my skin look so healthy. Do keep in mind you have to really rub it in no matter where you use it; I use it the most on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this either online or at Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#x27;s. I found mine at Urban Outfitters for $20, it was on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REALLY GOOD FOR:&lt;br /&gt;acne&lt;br /&gt;dry skin&lt;br /&gt;uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;feet that wear lots of high heels/boots made for the Army&lt;br /&gt;tattoo aftercare balm&lt;br /&gt;itchy bug bites&lt;br /&gt;scars</li>
            <li> I swear by this product, for everything and anything beauty related</li>
            <li> I have extremely weird skin.  A combo of rosacea, flakes, bumps.  You name it, I&#x27;ve got it.  I&#x27;ve tried every cream and lotion there is and everything (including very expensive creams like La Mer) made it worse.  This is the only cream that, when used sparingly, actually improves my skin.  Its a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my daughter a few times. Thankfully this last time I bought it through Amazon, cheaper than through product website. My daughter has used this product for years and swears by its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Best. Love this Product.. Great for dry cracked  hands, lips to face. And Much better for you. Not Smelly. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in September and decided to try it awhile befor writing a review. I purchased it because someone told me it was great for everything. I used it everyday on my face, hands, elbows and knees since I received it and I have not seen a difference in anything. The smell is fine the color is fine, looks just like it does it the picture online. It does not bother my face (no break outs), it not oily. It is a little hard to spread on face unless you rub it in your fingers and let your body heat warm it up a bit. Not worth the money to me but for those of you who say it works wonders for you then go for it. Everyone&#x27;s skin if different.</li>
            <li> Live this stuff. Great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased Egyptian Magic at Costco for its assertion of being effective on eczema. The eczema on my forehead, eyelids, cheeks has harassed me for four months. Elidel and Hydrocortisone could not remove those red scaly spots. I have applied Egyptian Magic for about three weeks. The red scaly spots almost have faded into the fine tone of the normal skin. Most of all, Egyptian Magic does not bring any side effect on my skin. Elidel may cause cancer for long term use, and Hydrocortisone discolors skin. Hope doctors have the knowledge of Egyptian Magic and recommend it to patients instead of other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Seeing some improvement on facial lines.  As a new user to the product will re-post update at a later date.</li>
            <li> it is better for women. My friends like to use it everyday. And they would like to tell others to use it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.. the driest of the dry.  So, I am always on the lookout for something wonderful.  With the price tag of this product I was sure it would impress.  NOT.  (I bought my Egyptian magic at a big warehouse store that rhythms with fostco.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: greasy, not moisturizing, does not feel like it absorbs into the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find my own personal pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in some home-made lotion bars with beeswax, coconut oil, and cocoa butter.  It makes my skin smooth all day.  EVEN MY FEET, which have never been healed with lotions or other creams.  If you&#x27;d like the recipe, reply to this comment and I&#x27;ll post it.  You won&#x27;t regret giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The formulation of this product ha changed. It&#x27;s not the same consistency as when I bought it earlier. There is less of the good stuff and more water. Try it on your lips and you will see that after 2 to 3 seconds it feels like you put nothing on. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in 2010 and I still have more than half the jar left. A little goes a long way. I apply this all over my face at night and when I wake up, my skin is very hydrated and glows. I only use this when my skin feels dull and extra dry because I don&#x27;t want to use it all up. I love this product and will repurchase it! I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff.  One jar did last several months, but I didn&#x27;t see any amazing results.  I am now using extra virgin coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, and I would highly recommended this over Egyptian Magic. Coconut oil is also much cheaper.</li>
            <li> As someone who is allergic to everything I bought this after seeing the short list of ingredients and didn&#x27;t see any that I know I am allergic to.  I tired a little bit at first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction and I didn&#x27;t.  A week later I absolutely love this stuff!!  I use it on my face and body including my feet which are always dry from wearing sandals a lot.  After one use on my feet I noticed a huge difference.  This stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it.  If you have allergies to everything like I do give this one a try, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend and she LOVES it, says it works and plans on buying more.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic works great all over body and I use especially on feet.</li>
            <li> It goes on as a cream and turns into a liquid.  Works great!</li>
            <li> great moisturizer.heals skin</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for years.  Helps to heal any skin issues.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion/make-up remover for sensitive - pimple prone skin!</li>
            <li> feels great a little getting used to as has a coca butter texture but my skin has never felt better so far so good!</li>
            <li> This does moisturize skin and according to the ingredient list has very little random chemicals. But, it is very oily. So you&#x27;ll get it all over everything if you&#x27;ve got it on.</li>
            <li> The salve works great. I use it daily for eczema and it really helps to keep it under control. It is a bit greasy at first, but it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I guess the reason Cleopatra used this cream (just kidding) was because she lived in the desert.  Dryness needs this cream.  However, this is too greasy for people who live in humid areas.  Some people said &amp;#34;oh you can use it as pre-makeup cream to smooth your skin.&amp;#34;  This is ridiculous.  It&#x27;s impossible unless you can apply it smoothly on your face.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people who has normal or combination skin.  Tooooo greasy.  Even you have dry skin, I don&#x27;t push you to buy it.  This is over-greasy even as body purpose.</li>
            <li> I had one which I bought it from somewhere else.  It was so good so I had to order the 2nd one but once I got it, the label and the cream inside is totally different!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok, if I could return the order. But once the product had been opened, the return wasn&#x27;t acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;How could I know that it&#x27;s the fake one without opening???</li>
            <li> It is called magic cream, I use it as night cream!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in the beginning, the feeling will be oily.&lt;br /&gt;But the next morning, I feel my skin smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I like it. And I hope it will help me with the acne!</li>
            <li> Prestige Point: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNLFBI/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not the real product. They put something like Crisco in there! This product is not the right color. It is white. Egyptian Magic is homey yellow!&lt;br /&gt;What a ripoff, I want my money back!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Look at the picture. the one on the left is real Egyptian Magic. The one on the right howver is what I still paid 4o bucks for. NOT REAL.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, people! Egyptian Magic however is amazing. I am hoping I can get this from a different store which is legitimate and not selling me engine oil. :(</li>
            <li> I used this on multiple skin irritations and extreme dryness, and even tried it on areas of eczema.  I got no particular healing effects -- it doesn&#x27;t work any better than vaseline or other generic heavy oils.  Halfway through the container, it got slightly gritty, so I can&#x27;t use it on my lips anymore.  What is that???  I hope it&#x27;s just bee&#x27;s wax or something.  Gross.  Not recommended, especially for this price.  There&#x27;s no magic here.</li>
            <li> I have always had good clear skin with very few wrinkles (now age 67) and I would love to keep that look for as long as possible.  Last few years I have noticed a few very DRY spots and of course, a few deeper wrinkles as well as wrinkles around my eyes.  I read about this product on line but especially loved the natural ingredients.  I have been using it for about one month now and really FEEL as well as SEE a difference!  I will not be using anything else for the rest of my life - my skin feels naturally lubricated and comfortable.  I see a change in an old scar, and especially in one area that looked like an old pimple that never healed.  GONE!  The dry areas are gone, the wrinkles are less noticable.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I got my first jar, but I always used it for my feet.  Now I use it all over.  The ingredients appear to contain no toxins.  It&#x27;s all about the bees!</li>
            <li> It seems to make my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> Great item as described. Fast shipping.  Didn&#x27;t work though.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for many problems.  It is very handy to have on hand just in case!!!  Very helpful as well</li>
            <li> Still figuring out the best used for this product. It does moisturize very well and helped heal a very bad burn.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s greasy and smells like... oil. it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my face the way other people claim, but it can be nice to slather it on your feet or hands and let it sit for a few hours to moisturize.</li>
            <li> My wife really love using Egyptian Magic. She uses it for everything, and has for years. It&#x27;s pure and simple. Wish the price would slow down.</li>
            <li> nothing to say..i like it. not too slow. free shipping tho. I bought it for my friends, but still give a four starts for it!</li>
            <li> I bought it after all those rave reviews about this product, with a high expectation. However, I only used it for a few weeks and stopped using it. It is way too oily for me, if you applied this at night, good thing is that it does absorb in the morning, however, this still makes it very difficult to put makeup on, let alone it you applied it right before makeup, it&#x27;s almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I only used it for a few weeks, so it might not show yet, but I don&#x27;t feel hydrated with this product, only feel oily. It didn&#x27;t magically change the skin like some other moisturizer that I have used. So all in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Tried this for treating my dry hands. Got a super deal at a warehouse store. Well, it would be pretty good if it did not immediately melt into a liquid. Hands stay greasy, so does your clothing, your desk - everything you touch. I did not feel any relief (except for the lighter wallet), it did not leave me with a feeling that it penetrated my skin at all - just slick hands until the next time I washed them.</li>
            <li> Friends have told me about this wondrous cream and they were right.  I bought it to use for a bad scar on my leg and my mom and I both swear it made a difference in just 24 hours!  I am totally hooked on this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> it is fine, but I do not really like the texture</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting the product to be so greasy.  Takes a long time to absorb.  Probably great for really really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this skin cream. It was everything it was supposed to be!! It really helps all sorts of skin ailments, I use it a lot!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! GOOD FOR DRY HAIR, TOO.</li>
            <li> I love my Egyptian magic.  I put it on before I go to bed and in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had soft skin but this makes those tougher places feel soft too like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing as a present for my gf. She says it works good, she usually hates creams. Just a little to expencive.</li>
            <li> I was excited to read some of the reviews about this cream, but I tried it for 30 days and really didnt see any difference in my skin. I was disappointed in the cream and will not order it again or refer it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I Have been using this product for years after battling acne and rosacea for all my adolescent years until i was about 28. I bought it on here because I couldn&#x27;t believe how much cheaper it was. I&#x27;m disappointed to let you all know this...ESP for the people that didn&#x27;t find it useful. The product is a knock off. The real EM reads \\&quot;The Ancient Kamitian&#x27;s Secret Magical Cream\\&quot; besides that there are many other ways to tell it was fake. More importantly I knew it was fake but tried it and it made me break out. The real EM has helped me tremendously for years with my rosacea and made my acne disappear as well as make my skin look very youthful. I&#x27;m a 38 years young male and I still get asked for ID to buy alcohol and even cigarettes. Yes I know that&#x27;s bad for me but its true. When I tell people my age they never believe me and say I look like I am in my early 20&#x27;s. I came in contact with EM after a huge battle with my skin and being made fun of and even went home early from work. That day i cried and I prayed and prayed with all my heart for a solution. I went to Whole foods and the girl there gave me a free sample and asked me only to come back and let her know if it worked. That same day my skin changed instantly. No more physical pain or emotional pain. When I see people from my past they are in shock. I am a very handsome dude but this product makes me even more confident in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;I am truly sorry for the people who have bought this product on here and do not get the same results. It pays to buy the real product. I have to buy it from the EM website now because I moved and there&#x27;s no Whole Foods here. 6 stars for real EM 0 stars for this knock off product.</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing great about this product. More like Vaseline or aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Great cream that works very well.</li>
            <li> The product has a lot of bee product in it and works great.  Moisterizing, healing, etc.  Works great!</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry and this cream helps me so much!!!! I just love love love it! I just use it at night because it shines like oil but when I wake up I wake up with a baby look like face :) and I&#x27;m 27 ;)</li>
            <li> This is my third one! My best friend took one from me and I gave another one to my boyfriend, they all love it as much as I do. Will buy more when winter comes.</li>
            <li> I purchased another Egyptian magic cream from its official website. It is more than 38 dollars. I compared this two products, the one purchased from official website has a darker color of the cream, and does smell heavier than the one purchased from Pro Therapy Supplies through amazon. The one from the official website tasted a little sweet when I used on my lips. The one from Pro Therapy supplies doesn&#x27;t taste sweet at all. I shared this comparison with my friend, she also purchased it from the official website. She believes the one purchased from  Pro Therapy Supplies is fake too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big reason I believe it is fake is that there is no receipt in the package and there is no way you can return it.&lt;br /&gt;So if you consider buying this product, buy it from its official website or seller.</li>
            <li> I use this skin cream for everything from my face to my hair to my feet and I even use it for hemarroids!  It&#x27;s great stuff.  I&#x27;d use it all over, but I can&#x27;t afford to.</li>
            <li> So I read all the reviews and was a little nervous to try it after hearing it caused some people pimples. But my skin had been this strange combination of sensitive/dry/flaky/pimply, so I was willing to try anything. After 3 weeks of use, I can say I will never be without this product again. Within 2 days the red, bumpy areas on my cheeks were perfectly smooth and hydrated - no more bumps!! My skin looks better than it has in years. I am also noticing less eye lash fall when I curl them. I put it on a scar on my hand and that has also gotten lighter and less noticeable. Seriously a miracle product. I still use my regular cleansers - Philosophy Purity, CeraVe and Origins Checks &amp; Balances. After months of skin issues, I no longer have to worry because I have this magic in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I actually use it on my feet.  I had really dry heels, so bad I went to a podiatrist and a dermatologist.  Both gave me expensive creams to use and nothing worked.  I started using Egyptian Magic, and now my heels are super smooth.</li>
            <li> Make my skin is sooo soft , I also use it in my hair in the L.O.C treatment</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff.  Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> It boggles my mind that some reviewers mention this product doesn&#x27;t absorb into their skin overnight. How much are you putting on?  As long as directions are followed, that really shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because of all the hype. I like natural skin care and have normal skin with clogged pores and occasional breakouts. I&#x27;m also bad with picking at my skin. I apply EMC to areas I pick at, under my eyes at night and on my lips. I really like it. I didn&#x27;t notice miracles but I am now applying it all over my fave and neck (taking a small amount and warming it on my finger tips and massaging in). If I notice any changes with current breakouts, I&#x27;ll change my rating. Hyper pigmentation seems to have faded, though. I personally like how it&#x27;s thick and emollient bc my skin feels more protected.  To each their own just make sure you&#x27;re giving it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work on my face. smell not good</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is like no other!  I have tried the competition but the consistency is different.  This product is perfect and no matter what is going on with my skin I can always use this with no reaction, even on my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I first got the package, I was skeptical. I had heard about this product from a friend, and she raved about how good it is, but the packaging was off-putting and looked cheap. When I first used it, like many suggest, I took a little bit of the wax and warmed it between my fingers before applying it on my skin. Though originally solid, it quickly melted into an oily texture. My face was really oily and shiny, and when I woke up the next morning I felt like I needed to take a shower because the product got on my hair overnight and made that oily looking as well.    However, after using it for a couple of weeks, I became used to the product and did feel that my skin felt softer and smoother in the morning. My face was very moisturized, and I appreciate that the product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. I do have a few acne scars - Egyptian Magic did nothing to help them, but it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin either. I would recommend using a foam cleaner to wash this product off in the morning; any cleanser with microbeads seems to stick on the skin with this product. I used the 4 oz container for 6 months before it ran out, but I want to try some other moisturizers before buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin. Really encases moisture. Shipped quickly. Love this product and recommend especially for problem dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to make the switch to natural products and this was one of my first big steps. I put it on at night with no traces of it in the morning and it leaves my skin feeling great. It&#x27;s also helped clear of some redness and random acne, too. May be a little of your normal price range but a little bit goes a long way and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product - bought for acne and it is starting to work</li>
            <li> Use this cream not only for face. Works really like magic for any kind of skin irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It is more like a vaseline (vysleen) petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I use this at night since it is too greasy too be worn out in the daytime. It helps with my dry skin from using acne products and also has helped my eczema. This is multi- purposeful and can be used on your lips, body and even hair. This is definitely a product I would keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product is EXTREMELY oily. I would recommend using this only at night because it makes you look like a frying pan with oil in it. It does help moisturize but not worth the money or trouble.</li>
            <li> use once a day seems to work</li>
            <li> I found out about this when reading a magazine about celebrities. I don&#x27;t usually buy something just because a celebrity uses it.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  It leaves your skin so very soft and it not at all greasy.  That said, the price is crazy for a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff.  We always make sure that we have one of these in our house at all times.  We use this for cuts, scratches, rashes, burns, etc. I have used this with both of my kids when they were babies for any scraps or diaper rashes.  Worked super fast and super well.</li>
            <li> This creme is so good, especially if you have dry skin, or during those winter months when you need a little more moisture. It is a bit greasy, but it soaks in. I only use it at night because it is pretty thick and leaves your face shiny! But, it will definitely moisturize your face! It is good if you have sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> i love this product works great for dry skin conditions. keeps my psoriasis under control also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Medicine Mama&#x27;s Bee Magic too, and like that, but I love the Egyptian Magic. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months. It is more firm in the jar than Medicine Mama&#x27;s, so you have to rub it between your hands a little longer before applying. I put it on immediately after my shower, then, get dressed and let it sink in before putting on my make-up or foundation because it is a little greasy, but so is Medicine Mama&#x27;s. I guess that&#x27;s why it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a lot gooey and separation of i&#x27;m assuming honey and rest of the product occurs. This can be a good thing for some people because it makes it easier to apply but I don&#x27;t like how mushy it is. The ones from the official website had a harder butter like consistency but other than that I don&#x27;t notice a difference. Amazing product, I use it on my entire face as a moisturizer, body for eczema, and hair as a styler wax. It holds curls in place really nicely!</li>
            <li> Hoping it will make me look 20 again! If not it is still a great product, I love the way it smells too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this cream for very long. I would recommend this cream for winter time use. It is thick and heavy on the skin. It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and eczema, and this is a terrific moisturizer for my face as well as the rest of my body. Doesn&#x27;t take much, and it&#x27;s easy to carry when traveling, too.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my skin, but it is oily and needs to be put on an hour or so before applying makeup because of that. But...it softens wrinkles and makes your face feel smooth and more youthful.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough . It is great for mature and baby skin. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave review about this cream, I decided to try and very disappointed. It is very oily and greasy so I apply lightly at night only. It does not absorb into the skin but sitting on top and feel sticky. It does nothing to my scar, and worsen my pimples. I bought from Costco for only $39.95 for one big + one small tub. This is such a waste of money because it is just like a vaseline/petrolium gel. I can buy a better lotion for a fraction of this price. Don&#x27;t waste your money.. I do not recommend.</li>
