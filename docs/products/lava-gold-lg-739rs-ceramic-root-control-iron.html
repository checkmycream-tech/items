    <ol>
            <li>This is an awesome invention.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect  this way</li>
            <li>The wonderful thing is that allows me to extend the time between relaxers up to 4 months.</li>
            <li>This is a great edger.  </li>
            <li>You can get close to you roots with out burning yourself, if you do burn yourself with these you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing your own hair.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out silky and perfect from root to tip with just this and a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>This also works on all hair textures-- as I&#x27;ve tried using it on many clients and friends.</li>
            <li>Love this for what it does that it said it would do.</li>
            <li>but I guess its ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>my hair always looks perfect and relaxed, highly recommend, it heats up really quickly too, and is really safe to use no need to worry about burning yourself...</li>
            <li>It really did a good job straightening out the roots.</li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair, then this will probably work well for you.  </li>
            <li>It was a great concept but possibly just  a cheap version that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned - you do spend a good amount of effort trying not to change to setting during use - but overall ease of use and price make this a keeper.</li>
            <li>No one with a head full of curly hair has time to do three strands at a time.</li>
            <li>my flatiron did a better job getting my edges straight.</li>
            <li>Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li>It does nothing for my edges but does straiten the roots of my longer hair,somewhat,  however I have hair that gets straight easily.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I liked that you can&#x27;t burn yourself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and my daughter is definitely happy I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hair tool to have on hand to smooth out your roots, I just recently started wearing a ponytail</li>
            <li>This product works great for getting to areas that the flat iron can&#x27;t get to well enough.</li>
            <li>this is ok, I have coarse hair</li>
            <li>When moisture hit her hair the roots are the first thing that curl up.</li>
            <li>I never have to use a hot comb or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I could use a flat iron to achieve better results.</li>
            <li>As long as you make sure to comb your hair before using it you shouldn&#x27;t have issues with pulling or snagging.</li>
            <li>It has very good but not excellent heat heat.</li>
            <li>It also could rip out your hair if you go over it too fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, but poorly executed.  </li>
            <li>As a result, it gets really sticky, grabbing and breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li>My roots weren&#x27;t bone straight</li>
            <li>Wayyy to much heat on her hair.  </li>
            <li>Use very day would tell any one to use this</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to keep from flat ironing my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair so much.</li>
            <li>but I will probably use it on my daughter when she gets older if need be, but by the look of her hair, I will have no use of this tool ever again.</li>
            <li>I use this on my son&#x27;s hair all the time to make it more manageable and easier to braid without him fussing and crying.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a lot of new growth it can still be a little challenging smoothing the hair out.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use they instantly have a strong burnt odor from the second I turn them on.</li>
            <li>Gets my edges straight, however, you have to be careful because the hot barrel will get you, if you angle the iron just so, trying to get your edges bone straight.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough and I can also use it all over my head for my roots as needed in between relaxers.  </li>
            <li>Constantly using this to smooth out my roots and get really close to my scalp-- closer than I can get with other heat utensils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love this, definitely lays down my nape area (my kitchen) and my edges.</li>
            <li>When I use this on my short hair it does not do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I am natural, but my hair was pressed.</li>
            <li>I am now a year natural, with manageable 4c hair that is fine but thick (if that makes any sense).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white girl with curly/wavy hair and it did not work for me so natural girls- be forewarned!</li>

            <li> I ended up using this product then flat ironing anyway.</li>
            <li> No more near misses on her neck!!!</li>
            <li> So I have had this tool for months now and honestly, I do not use it much.</li>
            <li> It worked a little, but I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected and it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am currently going natural, but do not have very thick hair and thought I would buy this to maintain my edges.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected</li>
            <li> It gets hotter and smoother than other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the barrel is coated in some sort of yellow film.</li>
            <li> The teeth in the attached comb should be wider because, again, it causes breakage if you are not using a few strands, and I did say strands, at a time.  </li>
            <li> It smooths out those edges that don&#x27;t tame so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s limit to just the edges though, as the narrow teeth make it difficult for anything else.</li>
            <li> But if you have truly course hair and thick edges, this does nothing but maybe thin them.</li>
            <li> This has never given him any burns made him uncomfortable in the least</li>
            <li> which makes it difficult the turn in order to style.</li>
            <li> But they stink really bad.  </li>
            <li> :(  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is ok, I have coarse hair so I wish the comb enable it to get closer to the edges and I also wish it got a tad bit hOTTER</li>
            <li> My daughters and I are in the process of transitioning.  We also have different hair types in our hair.  This product works great for getting to areas that the flat iron can&#x27;t get to well enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and my daughter is definitely happy I purchased it.  No more near misses on her neck!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s hair all the time to make it more manageable and easier to braid without him fussing and crying.This has never given him any burns made him uncomfortable in the least bit.and he has alot of hair! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It gets hotter and smoother than other brands</li>
            <li> Constantly using this to smooth out my roots and get really close to my scalp-- closer than I can get with other heat utensils I&#x27;ve used. This also works on all hair textures-- as I&#x27;ve tried using it on many clients and friends.</li>
            <li> Gets my edges straight, however, you have to be careful because the hot barrel will get you, if you angle the iron just so, trying to get your edges bone straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  Not only did it not straighten her edges, it also pulled them and thinned them out.  It was a great concept but possibly just  a cheap version that didn&#x27;t work.  If you have baby fine hair, then this will probably work well for you.  But if you have truly course hair and thick edges, this does nothing but maybe thin them.</li>
            <li> Love this for what it does that it said it would do. It&#x27;s limit to just the edges though, as the narrow teeth make it difficult for anything else.

            <li> So I have had this tool for months now and honestly, I do not use it much. It does nothing for my edges but does straiten the roots of my longer hair,somewhat,  however I have hair that gets straight easily. I could use a flat iron to achieve better results. I am now a year natural, with manageable 4c hair that is fine but thick (if that makes any sense). My hair is cut into a short style on the sides. When I use this on my short hair it does not do much of anything. It also could rip out your hair if you go over it too fast. Overall, I would not recommend this product....but I will probably use it on my daughter when she gets older if need be, but by the look of her hair, I will have no use of this tool ever again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but poorly executed.  I&#x27;m not sure why the barrel is coated in some sort of yellow film. As a result, it gets really sticky, grabbing and breaking the hair.  On the other hand, I liked that you can&#x27;t burn yourself! They simply need to redesign it. The teeth in the attached comb should be wider because, again, it causes breakage if you are not using a few strands, and I did say strands, at a time.  No one with a head full of curly hair has time to do three strands at a time.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot. I&#x27;m a white girl with curly/wavy hair and it did not work for me so natural girls- be forewarned!</li>
            <li> My roots weren&#x27;t bone straight so I didn&#x27;t know if this was supposed to do that for me. I am natural, but my hair was pressed. I just needed a root touch up. It worked a little, but I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected and it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to keep from flat ironing my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair so much. When moisture hit her hair the roots are the first thing that curl up. This did nothing for that. I ended up using this product then flat ironing anyway. Wayyy to much heat on her hair.  :(  Oh well.</li>
            <li> You can still burn your scalp. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> It is so skinny that it doesn&#x27;t get into the hair well which makes it difficult the turn in order to style. It has very good but not excellent heat heat.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected but I guess its ok.</li>
            <li> Whoever thought to make this product is a genius. I absolutely love it. You can get close to you roots with out burning yourself, if you do burn yourself with these you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing your own hair.</li>
            <li> I am currently going natural, but do not have very thick hair and thought I would buy this to maintain my edges. This product did not work..my flatiron did a better job getting my edges straight.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome invention. No kinky hair woman should be without this item. It  works wonders. It smooths out those edges that don&#x27;t tame so well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair tool to have on hand to smooth out your roots, I just recently started wearing a ponytail and it&#x27;s perfect  this way my hair always looks perfect and relaxed, highly recommend, it heats up really quickly too, and is really safe to use no need to worry about burning yourself...</li>
            <li> Love this, definitely lays down my nape area (my kitchen) and my edges. Use very day would tell any one to use this</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  My hairdresser had a root control iron that she used on my hair so I decided to find one to use between appointments.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this one.  As long as you make sure to comb your hair before using it you shouldn&#x27;t have issues with pulling or snagging.</li>
            <li> I never have to use a hot comb or anything like that. I love this product and I tell all my friends about it. My hair comes out silky and perfect from root to tip with just this and a good flat iron. This product has changed my life!</li>
            <li> This is a great edger.  It gets hot enough and I can also use it all over my head for my roots as needed in between relaxers.  I won&#x27;t ever be without this tool.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.. But they stink really bad.  Whenever I use they instantly have a strong burnt odor from the second I turn them on.</li>
            <li> It really did a good job straightening out the roots. However, if you have a lot of new growth it can still be a little challenging smoothing the hair out. The wonderful thing is that allows me to extend the time between relaxers up to 4 months.</li>
