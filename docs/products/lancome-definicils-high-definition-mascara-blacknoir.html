            <li>Upon recommendations, I bought this mascara and love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked well for others.</li>
            <li>I exploryed many mascaras just to see the difference or which one is truly the better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many my head has is dizzy.  </li>
            <li>There is none better than Definicils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sincere, honest and true statement.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>She was able to get used to it however and the mascara itself still works fine.</li>
            <li>Never clumps, always thicken lashes and goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love this, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mascara based on all the great reviews (on this and other sites).</li>
            <li>I KNOW THAT THIS IS A BIT PRICEY FOR MASCARA, BUT IT IS WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t quite worth all the hype (and hence the price).</li>
            <li>This is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very precise, it gets every lash every time, I would recommend it to anyone, and i already have mega long lashes it makes them colossal!</li>
            <li>When new and fresh this goes on smoothly, separates, lengthens, curls, defines ....</li>
            <li>Every  time I try something else for a while that promises to be better, I end up coming back.  </li>
            <li>Different consistency, not the product I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li>Tried others that claim they&#x27;re better but always go back to Definicils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and wished that I had more eyelashes</li>
            <li>Have always used Lancome defincils.........lengths lashes while affording more volume than the store purchased type, is long lasting, ...........do not have to reapply unless maybe want to in 10 or more hours.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake much, which is the reason I bought it but doesn&#x27;t build well and does not enhance your lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara and will probably buy again when this runs out.</li>
            <li>Very pricey for mascara though.</li>
            <li>High Definition Mascara Black/Noir.  </li>
            <li>nope just my old mascara failing!!</li>
            <li>Lashes are super long.  </li>
            <li>i live far from stores and have to order on line</li>
            <li>I used to have some problem with the mascara flaking over the course of the day, but I put on a coat of clear mascara over it, and there are no problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The lashes are so long &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>She liked it but complained that without the curved tip that the Definicils pro has, the application was more difficult.</li>
            <li>Having been familiar with Lancome products in the past, I went back to them because they are a product you can trust.</li>
            <li>Do NOT be afraid to use on the bottom lashes as well, just not as much as on the top........</li>
            <li>I have tried over the past several years many other mascara&#x27;s just to see if anyone of of them could get even close to Lancome Definicils High Definition Mascara Black.  </li>
            <li>There is not one other product that even comes close to Lancome Definicils High Definition Mascars.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> There is not one other product that even comes close to Lancome Definicils High Definition Mascars.  </li>
            <li> I have searched long and hard for the right one.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical but it work great on my little eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried drugstore brands: they seem to do well at first, but then get too thick and lashes clump together.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to spent the 20$ and buy Lancome...</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascara&#x27;s in search of something less expensive that will not bother my contacts.  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes pop and rarely clumps, however it is a little slow to dry</li>
            <li> This mascara was dry and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> wow I have been missing out!</li>
            <li> After having tried the same in inexpensive products, I find it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this expensive mascara that I finally decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I find it to be not very thickening.</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde lashes, and it&#x27;s difficult to find a product that covers my lashes completely and makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because i bought it due to other reviews.  </li>
            <li> well w other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I was just about to get some Latisse due to the fact that I thought my lashes were diminishing...</li>
            <li> so can get elsewhere on your face if you&#x27;re not super careful</li>
            <li> I have worn this product for at least 10 years, it is not only lash defining, but, stayproof, and like the name implies, defines the length and fullness of your lashes!  </li>
            <li> Also, when you look down, it smudges.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember if this is typical but the mascara tube was not sealed.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely wet, and I find it to be very messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey..</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is not touted as being water proof, and yet, I have worn it in all condtions possible: heat, sweat, cold, crying, work, etc, and I have never had it flake or run.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch or old tube, but it did nothing for my lashes (in terms of adding length of volume).  </li>
            <li> if not better and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just getting accustomed to the different brush without a curve that fits your eyelashes was just slightly annoying she said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras over the years, and this had to be one of the worst.</li>

            <li> Tried many, many mascaras over the years. This is hands-down the best. It was actually recommended to me by an employee at the Clinique counter at Macy&#x27;s in downtown Chicago. Have loved it since.</li>
            <li> Upon recommendations, I bought this mascara and love it.  I have searched long and hard for the right one.  This one is great.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Lancome product is Best Mascara I have ever used! I have used others and keep going back to this one! Love it!</li>
            <li> This mascara was dry and clumpy.  Also, when you look down, it smudges.  I will continue searching for a mascara for length and smudge proof.</li>
            <li> I KNOW THAT THIS IS A BIT PRICEY FOR MASCARA, BUT IT IS WORTH IT.  IT DOES NOT SMEAR AND STAYS ON ALL DAY.  NO CLUMPING.  ALWAYS DEPENDABLE.</li>
            <li> This product was costly and while I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon before, this time it appeared to be expired and didn&#x27;t have a lot of mascara usage.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this expensive mascara that I finally decided to try it. I LOVE it. The lashes are so long &amp; pretty. Definitely will buy it again. Very pricey for mascara though.</li>
            <li> It stays on even when my eyes water. I have used this mascara for 14 years and have never found one that even compares. It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t collect in the corner of my eyes also.</li>
            <li> Lancome always delivers what it promises. I have been using its mascara line since the 90&#x27;s. Never disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love it Love it !!!  Drys out after about 2-3 months but love it.  Cant find a better mascara - I have tried them all</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  I use the Lancome Mascara regularly.  It does not clump and or have flaky appearance</li>
            <li> Good to do business with and always happy with this product. Never clumps, always thicken lashes and goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> Great mascara! I received the Lancome Jason Woo definicils. I was a little skeptical but it work great on my little eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I heard really good things about this product but i have not used mine yet.  I gave it 3 stars because i bought it due to other reviews.  Plus delivery time was very good</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years very happily.  Every  time I try something else for a while that promises to be better, I end up coming back.  For my lashes and the look I like, it is just perfect.  I used to have some problem with the mascara flaking over the course of the day, but I put on a coat of clear mascara over it, and there are no problems whatsoever.  This is a top notch product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about a decade now, and nothing else comes close to it. I have long, blonde lashes, and it&#x27;s difficult to find a product that covers my lashes completely and makes them stand out. Yes, it is pricey. And I&#x27;ve tried basically everything else looking for a lower price product. It was a waste of money. If you need volume or to add length, then maybe this isn&#x27;t for you. However, if you want your eyelashes to pop, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Having been familiar with Lancome products in the past, I went back to them because they are a product you can trust. After having tried the same in inexpensive products, I find it is not worth it! Stay with a product that delivers what it professes to do! This is the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very precise, it gets every lash every time, I would recommend it to anyone, and i already have mega long lashes it makes them colossal!</li>
            <li> This mascara was not the same as the one in the department stores.  Different consistency, not the product I fell in love with.  Returned.</li>
            <li> She liked it but complained that without the curved tip that the Definicils pro has, the application was more difficult. She was able to get used to it however and the mascara itself still works fine. Just getting accustomed to the different brush without a curve that fits your eyelashes was just slightly annoying she said.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t quite worth all the hype (and hence the price). Maybelline is just as good if not better and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This mascara works best for me - does not clump like the others. I have tried drugstore brands: they seem to do well at first, but then get too thick and lashes clump together.</li>
            <li> Been using Definicils for years and love it.  Tried others that claim they&#x27;re better but always go back to Definicils.  Great product!</li>
            <li> excellent for those of us who prefer not to look like the current trendy doll face. lengthens and thickens well.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  This is my favorite.  It&#x27;s a little pricey.. but I guess as they say, you get what you pay for.  I like how it lenghthens, and at the same time seperates your lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the way this mascara goes on without clumping, separates the lashes, and stays put for the day.  It&#x27;s a step up from what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Bummed that I don&#x27;t like this. One of my good friends said it&#x27;s her fave mascara. I find it to be not very thickening. It takes multiple coats for me to even notice it. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Have always used Lancome defincils.........lengths lashes while affording more volume than the store purchased type, is long lasting, ...........do not have to reapply unless maybe want to in 10 or more hours.  Is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara but I think I will stick to buying it at the department store.  This was shipped in a flimsy envelope and the mascara box was bent with the side flaps open. I don&#x27;t remember if this is typical but the mascara tube was not sealed.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons and mascaras.  This is worth the price.  Lashes are super long.  Layers well w other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands. When new and fresh this goes on smoothly, separates, lengthens, curls, defines .... it&#x27;s glamorous, not flaky, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and the brush is by far the best in the industry. I have used this product forever it seems and I keep going back to it. I only wish they hadn&#x27;t done away with the midnight blue. I miss it.</li>
            <li> This mascarra is so easy to use and makes my eyelashes look longer and helps pop the eye area! &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascara&#x27;s in search of something less expensive that will not bother my contacts.  I come back to this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT NO CLUMPS AND DOESNT HURT MY EYES. THANK YOU FOR AN AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have worn this product for at least 10 years, it is not only lash defining, but, stayproof, and like the name implies, defines the length and fullness of your lashes!  Do NOT be afraid to use on the bottom lashes as well, just not as much as on the top........one brush will do.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara based on all the great reviews (on this and other sites). I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras over the years, and this had to be one of the worst. Maybe I got a bad batch or old tube, but it did nothing for my lashes (in terms of adding length of volume).  I was really hoping to love this, but I didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m glad it worked well for others.</li>
            <li> its the best i&#x27;ve found! it lasts, does not clump, makes lashes longer. i live far from stores and have to order on line</li>
            <li> I have used and at one time even sold this product Lancome Defincils High Definition Mascara Black/Noir.  I exploryed many mascaras just to see the difference or which one is truly the better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question, I can honestly tell you that Lancome Definicils Hifh Definition Mascara Black/Noir is without question the best of the best..  I have tried over the past several years many other mascara&#x27;s just to see if anyone of of them could get even close to Lancome Definicils High Definition Mascara Black.  There is not one other product that even comes close to Lancome Definicils High Definition Mascars.  I have tried so many my head has is dizzy.  There is none better than Definicils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sincere, honest and true statement.  I purchased this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AK</li>
            <li> In spite of its&#x27; expense, this is the BEST mascara I have ever used.  It is not touted as being water proof, and yet, I have worn it in all condtions possible: heat, sweat, cold, crying, work, etc, and I have never had it flake or run.  I have been using it for over 6mo now.</li>
            <li> I have been searching walmart for the perfect mascara...stop looking its not there!  I finally decided to spent the 20$ and buy Lancome...wow I have been missing out! I was just about to get some Latisse due to the fact that I thought my lashes were diminishing...nope just my old mascara failing!! Wonderful purchase!</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely wet, and I find it to be very messy. I have deep set eyes and and this mascara gets all over my eye lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Lancome&#x27;s mascara.  I&#x27;m Asian and wished that I had more eyelashes but... Lancome&#x27;s mascara definitely helps them!</li>
