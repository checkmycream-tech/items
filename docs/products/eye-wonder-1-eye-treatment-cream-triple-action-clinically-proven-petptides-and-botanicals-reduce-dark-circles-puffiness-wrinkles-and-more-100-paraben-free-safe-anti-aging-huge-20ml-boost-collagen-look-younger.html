            <li>Vasanti - this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Vasanti Eye Wonder is amazing.</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say that i&#x27;ve seen a difference.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the cream.  </li>
            <li>Teamine is better at that for sure!</li>
            <li>Remember people, patience, water, and a good nights rest is important when using stuff like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky and very light weight</li>
            <li>Eye Wonder feels luxurious on my skin, absorbs quickly, and keeps my eye area moisturized and looking good.</li>
            <li>Around my eyes seem to be more moisturized</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not even sure if this is a result from this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad i purchased this product...</li>
            <li>I expect that over time I&#x27;ll see better results</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>atleast 6 more.</li>
            <li>At 66 years of age, what I found is the darkness is better</li>
            <li>many of my friends even noticed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye products over the years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think it lightens, but for some reason, my under eye seem more puffy.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>My eyes look brighter and I look forward to becoming a frequent&lt;br /&gt;buyer of this product.</li>
            <li>One jar lasts about a year too, so I consider that a good value given how much I like it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hereditary, chances are, it&#x27;s gonna take a lot more than just a cream to help improve the eye area significantly.  </li>
            <li>and now I can easily cover them with concealer.  </li>
            <li>I have used this eye cream on and off for 2 years and I can say it&#x27;s the best I have found in diminishing dark circles.</li>
            <li>It helped A LOT to reduce the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is fine for moisturizing, but that is all.</li>
            <li>My fine lines remain there   </li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC product.  </li>
            <li>It is a light cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many dark-circle treatments and have never had much luck.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, but have dark purple undereye circles that I just couldn&#x27;t cover up.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>What has happened is my skin around my eye area has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>that right there was a actually a huge benefit in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,fine lines have really started to appear.</li>
            <li>Truly this product is worth recommending.</li>
            <li>The upside is that they do give you your money&#x27;s worth  </li>
            <li>I notice when I start sleeping good for a whole week, there&#x27;s a big difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I only applied it once a day to my eyes</li>
            <li>But when I read all the ingredients in &#x27;Eye Wonder&#x27;, I decided it was worth giving it a try.     </li>
            <li>No cream that really works can do it that quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am using it on my right eye area only, as this is the side that needs the most help.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, I should have done a little more research but the reviews were so good on this product that I simply could not resist trying it for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now - just finished the first jar.  </li>
            <li>I began to see improvement in the first 2 to 3 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s different though, you may have a better reaction.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed twice a day and never saw any changes.</li>
            <li>Also, some products just don&#x27;t work for everyone, and when you do use creams and such like this, you should expect to be drinking more water, and changing up your diet, cut out salt and sweets.</li>
            <li>When I look at photos from 2 years ago, I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s defenitly heridtery because my dad has it also, and now that I&#x27;m about to order some more, I kinda want to have an extra one just so he can give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;well, maybe they&#x27;re not using it CONSISTENTLY</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for everyone, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the fine lines that were starting to look prominent are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that the results just get better after long term use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 full weeks, 2x per day as recommended, and have seen no improvement so far.</li>
            <li>I researched a number of products and found that those w/the ingredient Eyeliss seemed to be the most effective, but they were prohibitively expensive.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes until my cousin asked me what I was using.  </li>
            <li>For those who say it doesn&#x27;t work, give it a chance, it really works.  </li>
            <li>It works MUCH better than any other product I have tried before.</li>
            <li>Have been using the product for over  two weeks,,   see no change in  dark circles, but area does seem softer and more moisturized</li>
            <li>and I have had a problem with dark circles most of my life- even as a teenager.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t remove 100% of the darkness for me but it damn well brings it down more then 50% and that&#x27;s got my support.</li>
            <li>This is a decent moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>, my under eye circles are starting to lighten up and the skin around my eyes is starting to look more plump and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this treatment cream.</li>
            <li>Give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>The only people who would really show improvement are the people who are eating too much sweets or salty foods, or drinking too much water before bedtime.</li>
            <li>My bags and dark circles are due to heredity and maybe there aren&#x27;t great treatments for that in general.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I have very dark eye circles, which are genetic, but EYE WONDER worked the best out of the other creams and my dark circles are dramatically lighter.</li>
            <li>and I started seeing a difference in 36 days as they claim but the key is to use it consistently twice a day.    </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million eye creams and this is the first that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be very dry around my eyes and most concealers get dry and cakey around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Oh well, at least the jar is pretty good size that can be used for few months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m already seeing a difference; I look younger and more well-rested!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although when I think about it, I haven&#x27;t been too fixed on</li>
            <li>I started trying every cream on the market with minimal success.</li>
            <li>As I got older, the puffiness only accentuated the problem.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that no other reviews exist for &#x27;Eye Wonder&#x27; eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if they are real or not, I have tried it for 3 weeks and can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The product last a long time, and I am holding off any judgement, as my eyes really needed some help.  </li>
            <li>I can see the right side is softer with the lines, darkness is now the same as the left, and just a bit of the puffiness seems to be going down.  </li>
            <li>As an experiment, I would use this until the jar was empty then try another highly rated cream and compare the end results.</li>
            <li>It has evened the tone under my eyes, lightening my dark circles and making my whole eye area look brighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this and the puffiness that I have is definitely diminished and the dark circles are MUCH lighter than when I was using Teamine.  </li>
            <li>I was really skeptical because I LOVE Teamine (which helps dark circles but not puffiness very well).  </li>
            <li>Personally, I have not had a lot of success with other eye creams that say they will reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li>So, I see a lot of good reviews about this product, and some bad reviews.</li>

            <li> I am not sure if they are real or not, I have tried it for 3 weeks and can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> The product last a long time, and I am holding off any judgement, as my eyes really needed some help.  </li>
            <li> I can see the right side is softer with the lines, darkness is now the same as the left, and just a bit of the puffiness seems to be going down.  </li>
            <li> As an experiment, I would use this until the jar was empty then try another highly rated cream and compare the end results.</li>
            <li> It has evened the tone under my eyes, lightening my dark circles and making my whole eye area look brighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this and the puffiness that I have is definitely diminished and the dark circles are MUCH lighter than when I was using Teamine.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because I LOVE Teamine (which helps dark circles but not puffiness very well).  </li>
            <li> Personally, I have not had a lot of success with other eye creams that say they will reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> So, I see a lot of good reviews about this product, and some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are completely gone and the tiny wrinkles have smoothened out.</li>
            <li> Though I saw some minimal improvement in 2 weeks, it took 2-3 months for the major difference to occur.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time-</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to those who have dark circles due to hereditary, you shouldn&#x27;t expect for a cream to really DO anything for you.</li>
            <li> and honestly I think that it may have made my eye bags a little bit worse due to loosening of the skin or something.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for less than a week but have noticed that my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy, no more dark bags under my eyes, and the fine lines appear reduced.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, Mediterranean background, started seeing dark circles and puffiness under my eyes - was alarmed to look in the mirror and see my Italian grandmother looking back at me.  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 other products before starting to use this one</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dry skin under my eyes and this cream has also helped improve the quality of my skin under my eyes -</li>
            <li> The dark circles have reduced but pretty slowly.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are virtually gone and (when I get enough sleep) the puffiness too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a total miracle for me, because I still get the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I only have dark circles under my eyes, no puffiness or wrinkles, and this product has done nothing for the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is the wide mouth bottle.  </li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I have had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are not completely gone</li>
            <li> I will be using it on my left eye in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also found many of them to extremely thick and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Like other have said, this is not a miracle cream - my dark circles have not completely vanished and my fines lines  have not dissappeared.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that it worked at all other than moisterizing</li>
            <li> And like other individuals out there, I have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> That has not the case with other eye creams I have tried...</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this product, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do have some dark circles that are associated with genetics but was hoping it would help some...</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot that plays into having dark circles, lack of sleep is the number one.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circles were reduced along with the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t that expensive compared to others I have bought (without results).</li>
            <li> Especially when I stay up late or go out drinking the night before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how dark they&#x27;ve been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I have seen no difference in any of the areas (dark circles, puffiness, &amp; wrinkles) that the product claims that it addresses.</li>
            <li> My eyes remain dark under  </li>
            <li> There has not been an instantaneous improvement, but I swear the dark circles are diminishing and the puffiness around my eyes is reducing.</li>
            <li> My dark circles seem to be lightening up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles have lightened and the skin around my eye area feels firmer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it, I have noticed that dark circles became lighter and reduced puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I have perpetual dark circles under my eyes--they run in my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to also say  the puffines is well down too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alot for $40 unlike hylexin which is $100 for like half a teaspoon of cream.    </li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem less pronounced and eye area smoother.</li>
            <li> Spend a lot less on something else you can find in a drug store before investing in this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already wearing less concealer and wanted to share this product with others in my situation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few product with little or no results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you use it everyday, within a couple weeks, you&#x27;ll see a difference</li>
            <li> however they were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not to come off negative or hopeless, but if you have dark circles</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had dark under eye circles and now being in my late thirties</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried eye creams in the past, and they never did ANYTHING for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vasanti Eye Cream for about a year and a half now after having allergic reactions to every eye cream I tried, including Clinique and Teamine Complex and some other expensive eye creams sold to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have really bad under eye dark circles and this is the only cream that worked for me.</li>
            <li> i can say that the day after i tried this product i already see a difference, my eye bags seems lighter and my eyes are not puffy at all considering that i have slept late the night before.</li>
            <li> Does that mean it is working?</li>
            <li> but it seriously does)  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic change.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles that make me look a bit hindu/middle eastern because of my dark skin (no offense</li>
            <li> I even gave up my expensive Striveton eye cream (though I still use their face cream).</li>
            <li> however it IS expensive.    </li>
            <li> I was shocked when she said she noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> I feel uncomfortable and tried hylexin which was terrible    Eye wonder</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for EYE WONDER to work wonders....</li>
            <li> I base alot of my purchses on customer reviews but this continues to happen.  </li>
            <li> and i guess its genetic to have horrible under eye circles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 week now and I am seeing the difference with each use. This is one of the best I should say. I definitely recommend this ................</li>
            <li> This is the perfect eye cream for those who want to stop the clock for aging skin.  It helped A LOT to reduce the fine lines under my eyes. I tried 3 other products before starting to use this one and I noticed a difference within days. It has evened the tone under my eyes, lightening my dark circles and making my whole eye area look brighter and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  This is a FANTASTIC product.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for over  two weeks,,   see no change in  dark circles, but area does seem softer and more moisturized</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews posted here. I am not sure if they are real or not, I have tried it for 3 weeks and can&#x27;t really tell the difference. I do have some dark circles that are associated with genetics but was hoping it would help some... Pretty expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Oh well, at least the jar is pretty good size that can be used for few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve applied it every morning and every night, and my eyes have definitely lightened up. It doesnt work instantaneously, but what skin care product does? If you use it everyday, within a couple weeks, you&#x27;ll see a difference</li>
            <li> Hi, ive just tried this product for 4 days. applied it 2x a day. i can say that the day after i tried this product i already see a difference, my eye bags seems lighter and my eyes are not puffy at all considering that i have slept late the night before. Truly this product is worth recommending.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 months ago. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully twice a day but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic change.  Around my eyes seem to be more moisturized but I&#x27;m not even sure if this is a result from this product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this for the second time. The dark circles have reduced but pretty slowly. This is a good product to go with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now - just finished the first jar.  I have an olive complexion, Mediterranean background, started seeing dark circles and puffiness under my eyes - was alarmed to look in the mirror and see my Italian grandmother looking back at me.  I researched a number of products and found that those w/the ingredient Eyeliss seemed to be the most effective, but they were prohibitively expensive.  This product has that ingredient and is a good price for the volume of product.  Another plus is the wide mouth bottle.  This volume of product lasted a year for me, applied once daily.  I began to see improvement in the first 2 to 3 weeks of use.  Looking now at myself, I don&#x27;t notice any darkness or puffiness under my eyes.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Eye wonder why I continue to purchase these items that promise things that they can not deliver.  Who does this work for? I base alot of my purchses on customer reviews but this continues to happen.  So again, I wonder why?  Who writes the good reviews?</li>
            <li> This stuff does work!  I was really skeptical because I LOVE Teamine (which helps dark circles but not puffiness very well).  I decided to try this and the puffiness that I have is definitely diminished and the dark circles are MUCH lighter than when I was using Teamine.  They were almost purple before and now I can easily cover them with concealer.  Nothing is 100%, but this product is close.  I give it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t fight wrinkles like I would like it to.  Teamine is better at that for sure!</li>
            <li> this is the best ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a 30 day treatment of hylexin and might as well have just been rubbing vitamin E on my eyes  I&#x27;ve been trying eye wonder night and day (twice a day)  i carry it to school, to work, and to my boyfriend&#x27;s house so i definately don&#x27;t miss any.    I have horrible dark circles that make me look a bit hindu/middle eastern because of my dark skin (no offense but it seriously does)  I feel uncomfortable and tried hylexin which was terrible    Eye wonder i feel it may be too soon to tell i&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 1/2 weeks but i don&#x27;t see and improvement    The upside is that they do give you your money&#x27;s worth  it&#x27;s alot for $40 unlike hylexin which is $100 for like half a teaspoon of cream.    Everyone&#x27;s different though, you may have a better reaction.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now and I started seeing a difference in 36 days as they claim but the key is to use it consistently twice a day.    I have really bad under eye dark circles and this is the only cream that worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dark eye circles. I used it exactly as directed twice a day and never saw any changes. It is fine for moisturizing, but that is all.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, a little goes a long way. Wrinkles seem less pronounced and eye area smoother.</li>
            <li> So, I see a lot of good reviews about this product, and some bad reviews. My suggestion is to those who have dark circles due to hereditary, you shouldn&#x27;t expect for a cream to really DO anything for you. Not to come off negative or hopeless, but if you have dark circles and it&#x27;s hereditary, chances are, it&#x27;s gonna take a lot more than just a cream to help improve the eye area significantly.  The only people who would really show improvement are the people who are eating too much sweets or salty foods, or drinking too much water before bedtime. There&#x27;s a lot that plays into having dark circles, lack of sleep is the number one. I notice when I start sleeping good for a whole week, there&#x27;s a big difference. Also, some products just don&#x27;t work for everyone, and when you do use creams and such like this, you should expect to be drinking more water, and changing up your diet, cut out salt and sweets. Sleep on your back, and not your side or stomach. Go to bed around 9:30-10pm. Not one product is going to cure whatever you have, sometimes you need to do multiple things to even make a difference, and sometimes, all you need is patience.  I have noticed a difference (thankfully) and I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for 4 days. I&#x27;ve also tried eye creams in the past, and they never did ANYTHING for me. This is the only one that seems to be making a difference. I just hope it keeps on improving, but in order for it to do so, I must not rely solely on the cream.  Remember people, patience, water, and a good nights rest is important when using stuff like this. (:</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product based on the reviews. This is a decent moisturizing cream but it does nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help the circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for well over two months, and it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.  Scam!</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I have had dark circles under my eyes. Prior to using Vasanti&#x27;s Eye Wonder, I had tried numerous product,s however they were a waste of money.  I also found many of them to extremely thick and difficult to apply.  However, Vasanti&#x27;s eye wonder was completely different.  I noticed a difference within about a week.  The dark circles were reduced along with the puffiness.  Thanks Vasanti - this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have tried every eye cream out there. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;work miracles overnight but after using it for about a month (2x a day), I am slowly&lt;br /&gt;seeing resutls. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and it will last months before I have&lt;br /&gt;to buy a new one. My eyes look brighter and I look forward to becoming a frequent&lt;br /&gt;buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now. It works MUCH better than any other product I have tried before. I am over 50 and I have had a problem with dark circles most of my life- even as a teenager. As I got older, the puffiness only accentuated the problem. I started trying every cream on the market with minimal success. Then I tried Eye Wonder. What a difference! I even gave up my expensive Striveton eye cream (though I still use their face cream). The dark circles are virtually gone and (when I get enough sleep) the puffiness too. GREAT product. For those who said they used it for \\&quot;2 weeks\\&quot; and saw no difference. Give it a little more time. No cream that really works can do it that quickly. Though I saw some minimal improvement in 2 weeks, it took 2-3 months for the major difference to occur. When I look at photos from 2 years ago, I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li> At the time that I purchased this item it had mostly good reviews. I used it regularly according to the instructions for 2-3 months. I do not believe that it worked at all other than moisterizing and honestly I think that it may have made my eye bags a little bit worse due to loosening of the skin or something. I still have some of the product left but am concerned to use it and I can&#x27;t recommend it. My bags and dark circles are due to heredity and maybe there aren&#x27;t great treatments for that in general. I had no luck with this product and will look for something else. Best of luck to everyone else.</li>
            <li> I am of Indian descent and i guess its genetic to have horrible under eye circles. I&#x27;ve tried a few product with little or no results. After trying the Vasanti Eye Wonder cream for only 2 days, twice a day (morning and night) I have seen results- enough for others to notice. I am hoping that the results just get better after long term use. I would definitely recommend to everyone having an issue with under eye circles. I can&#x27;t say anything about helping with puffiness or wrinkles as i don&#x27;t have those issues (yet! thank god!) but its nice to know that this might be a great preventive measure. If it does even a fraction of what it does for the circles, i am set! It really isn&#x27;t that expensive compared to others I have bought (without results). Definitely worth a try for everyone, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for almost a month and don&#x27;t think i have seen any difference at all. i am thinking it is just another eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyecream for about 2 months now and i can honestly say that i&#x27;ve seen a difference. i&#x27;ve always had dark under eye circles and now being in my late thirties,fine lines have really started to appear. I use the eyecream for my undereyes but i&#x27;ve also been using it on my forehead. My dark circles are not completely gone but i can defintely see a difference and my friends have mentioned it too. In terms of wrinkles i have seen a big difference on my forehead...the fine lines that were starting to look prominent are starting to disappear. I&#x27;m really glad i purchased this product...it actually works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes until my cousin asked me what I was using.  I was shocked when she said she noticed a difference.  I of course denied using anything, but she went on to say that my eyes were alot darker last year, and how lighter they&#x27;ve gotten now. WOW!  Inside I was jumping around, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s not a total miracle for me, because I still get the dark circles. Especially when I stay up late or go out drinking the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although when I think about it, I haven&#x27;t been too fixed on how dark they&#x27;ve been.&lt;br /&gt;So that right there was a actually a huge benefit in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I only applied it once a day to my eyes not 2x like recommended.&lt;br /&gt;So now whenever I can remember to put it on at night I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s defenitly heridtery because my dad has it also, and now that I&#x27;m about to order some more, I kinda want to have an extra one just so he can give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  the same bottle for 3 months and I probably have another 2 months of cream left.&lt;br /&gt;I also  want an extra one so I can bring to work when I work overnights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conlcusion it didn&#x27;t remove 100% of the darkness for me but it damn well brings it down more then 50% and that&#x27;s got my support. Shoot as Im writting this I&#x27;m going to also say  the puffines is well down too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago and have been using it according to instructions faithfully.  However, I have seen no difference in any of the areas (dark circles, puffiness, &amp; wrinkles) that the product claims that it addresses. Perhaps, I should have done a little more research but the reviews were so good on this product that I simply could not resist trying it for myself. I am really disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for EYE WONDER to work wonders....</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this product and saw some people saying \\&quot;does not work\\&quot; I thought to myself \\&quot;well, maybe they&#x27;re not using it CONSISTENTLY and CORRECTLY.\\&quot; So, I applied it morning and night for the days recommended (I&#x27;m actually on day 50 now so I&#x27;ve been using it longer than recommended) and there has been no change at all.    My eyes remain dark under  My fine lines remain there   The skin underneath seems darker for about an hour after applying it.    I give this 2 stars for the amount sent. It does last a long time- however it IS expensive.    My recommendation? Spend a lot less on something else you can find in a drug store before investing in this.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that no other reviews exist for &#x27;Eye Wonder&#x27; eye cream. This product may be on the newer side. Personally, I have not had a lot of success with other eye creams that say they will reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. And like other individuals out there, I have tried a lot of them. But when I read all the ingredients in &#x27;Eye Wonder&#x27;, I decided it was worth giving it a try.     There has not been an instantaneous improvement, but I swear the dark circles are diminishing and the puffiness around my eyes is reducing. My boyfriend thought the same thing. That has not the case with other eye creams I have tried...so hey...it must be working.    I would recommend that others give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product. It helped reduce the puffiness of my under eye circle. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Have bin using this product for 6 weeks now and notice a big difference. My dark circles seem to be lightening up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky and very light weight</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this product, I decided to try it.  I am very fair, but have dark purple undereye circles that I just couldn&#x27;t cover up. I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for three weeks and I have to say that I&#x27;ve already seen a difference, my under eye circles are starting to lighten up and the skin around my eyes is starting to look more plump and moisturized.  I expect that over time I&#x27;ll see better results but I&#x27;m already wearing less concealer and wanted to share this product with others in my situation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 full weeks, 2x per day as recommended, and have seen no improvement so far. I only have dark circles under my eyes, no puffiness or wrinkles, and this product has done nothing for the dark circles.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many dark-circle treatments and have never had much luck.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2-weeks, but it seems to be working well.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I&#x27;ll repost in about a month on an update with my progression.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyecream based on the reviews. I&#x27;m so happy to say that I&#x27;m one of the ones that it has worked for! Like other have said, this is not a miracle cream - my dark circles have not completely vanished and my fines lines  have not dissappeared. (I don&#x27;t have puffiness, so I can&#x27;t comment on that) What has happened is my skin around my eye area has significantly improved. My dark circles have lightened and the skin around my eye area feels firmer and moisturized. I tend to be very dry around my eyes and most concealers get dry and cakey around my eyes. This is not the case anymore. Overall, I am very very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and it going to last me atleast 6 more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks now... and I have seen no difference whatsoever.   Might as well have been applying water all this time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million eye creams and this is the first that actually does what it says it will do.  Great!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 3 weeks.  The instructions say twice a day for 37 days.  At 66 years of age, what I found is the darkness is better and I am using it on my right eye area only, as this is the side that needs the most help.  I have another product for the left eye, which I have been using for awhile.  I can see the right side is softer with the lines, darkness is now the same as the left, and just a bit of the puffiness seems to be going down.  I will continue to use it, and probably twice a day.  The product last a long time, and I am holding off any judgement, as my eyes really needed some help.  I will use it all up, I like it and I might use it again, but it will be awhile before its gone.  I am very impressed with the wrinkles being minimized, and the darkness. Seeing a bit of puffiness gone is a good thing. I will be using it on my left eye in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using several Vasanti products and this cream is one of my favs.  Since I have been using it, I have noticed that dark circles became lighter and reduced puffiness.  It is a light cream and I also use it as an over all moisturizer.  For those who say it doesn&#x27;t work, give it a chance, it really works.  I have a lot of dry skin under my eyes and this cream has also helped improve the quality of my skin under my eyes - many of my friends even noticed.</li>
            <li> I have perpetual dark circles under my eyes--they run in my family. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m already seeing a difference; I look younger and more well-rested!</li>
            <li> I really liked the cream.  I used it everyday.  I did notice a difference.  I would buy again in future.</li>
            <li> I orderd this cream 3rd time.. I love it...! It works well over night...!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vasanti Eye Cream for about a year and a half now after having allergic reactions to every eye cream I tried, including Clinique and Teamine Complex and some other expensive eye creams sold to me by my dermatologist. Vasanti Eye Wonder is amazing. The dark circles under my eyes are completely gone and the tiny wrinkles have smoothened out. I only wish they made a face cream too (they don&#x27;t). I have not had any allergic reactions to this product at all.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for less than a week but have noticed that my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy, no more dark bags under my eyes, and the fine lines appear reduced. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Eye Wonder feels luxurious on my skin, absorbs quickly, and keeps my eye area moisturized and looking good. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye products over the years and this is my favorite. One jar lasts about a year too, so I consider that a good value given how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Great cream awesome size</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me, but the effect may vary individually.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream on and off for 2 years and I can say it&#x27;s the best I have found in diminishing dark circles. As an experiment, I would use this until the jar was empty then try another highly rated cream and compare the end results. I have very dark eye circles, which are genetic, but EYE WONDER worked the best out of the other creams and my dark circles are dramatically lighter. I would highly recommend this treatment cream.</li>
            <li> This tingles after I apply it. Does that mean it is working? I think it lightens, but for some reason, my under eye seem more puffy.</li>
