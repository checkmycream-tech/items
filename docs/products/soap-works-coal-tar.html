            <li>She took a bath with it in the evening and was able to get to sleep each evening!</li>
            <li>my favorite soap!</li>
            <li>Lovely smell!</li>
            <li>This is great soap, feels mild, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>amazing soap.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li>The soap suds are kind of gray, but not staining.</li>
            <li>Come to find out it REALLY dries out your skin which in my case was not the best thing to do.</li>
            <li>the scent is inoffensive and it suds up nicely.</li>
            <li>Extremely effective for me.</li>
            <li>Nice item, nice deal though I prefer pine tar soap for it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The soap was good however, in that it did not leave a film, and had a neutral smell which is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>soap is ok  packaging can be better</li>
            <li>Pine tar soap is better.</li>
            <li>When I started using coal tar soap, I learned my mother had been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>The redness and swelling has got a lot better.</li>
            <li>Most stroes do not carry this soap but it works for the skin conditions for most people.</li>
            <li>Guttate for sure.</li>
            <li>It really worked great for him.</li>
            <li>so be sure to use darker ones.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Dove soap.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if there was more coal tar in there</li>
            <li>NOT, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Too strong for me.</li>
            <li>, I normally see that as a good indication that it works</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>The two seem to work more quickly and thoroughly than either alone.</li>
            <li>Noticed my skin felt better with first use !</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>as a  psoriasis sufferer, I appreciate this effective, gentle soap.</li>
            <li>So far so good, no smell, lathers up well</li>
            <li>soap has a pleasant, light floral scent that the the manufacturer&#x27;s website informs us is from Eucalyptus, Geranium, and Rosemary essential oils.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderful, no more flareups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple no-nonsense tar soap, no fancy packaging (comes six bars in a plastic bag), and works as well as any other good tar soap, at a very good price.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling soft and smooth...and as a regular soap it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I just made sure to work it in really well and let it sit for a minute or so before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I do not have mild  psoriasis, so I use this in conjunction with MG 217 coal tar ointment, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li>the merchandise came quickly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>For comparison: T-Gel and similar shampoos contain 0.5% coal tar extract (about 15 times more); Psoriatrax contains 5.0% (about 150 times more).</li>
            <li>It is very soft and I am sure that its not a knock off product.</li>
            <li>has a nice light scent, works fine, BUT, it leaves a black residue all over your sink and tub.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more when we run out!</li>
            <li>Many people, of both sexes, enjoy the aroma of coal tar, likening it to fine leather or aged tobacco.</li>
            <li>Using regular soaps really irritates my skin, but using this soap makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.  </li>
            <li>- I guess I was expecting it to be more natural smelling.</li>
            <li>I love this soap so much that I WILL be ordering more shortly!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so worth it; I&#x27;m having a friend ship it to me in another part of the world.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, one word of caution was that I didn&#x27;t realize the coal tar makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>For the price this soap is well worth it.</li>
            <li>3 stars because after using the product for about a month now, the best I can say is that my psoriasis hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.</li>
            <li>This soap started to work right away.</li>
            <li>Good soap with no negative use attributes however, giving it a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; &#x27;cause it didn&#x27;t work in helping to minimize psoriasis plaques/minimizing itching at all after 3 month daily use.  </li>
            <li>This soap was an old fashioned tried and true help!</li>
            <li>This soap was really effective at soothing the psoriasis and helping with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li>good product but the black residue makes them lose a star.  </li>
            <li>It will take many years for me to use 6 bars, as I only need it periodically.</li>
            <li>daily dose ..... :)</li>
            <li>&amp; it sure didn&#x27;t back then.</li>
            <li>She loves the soap so much that she is continuing to use it now that the rash is gone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still just on the first bar</li>
            <li>I think I will be using this as a bath soap along with the Irish Spring that I already use and love.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described, timely delivered.</li>
            <li>Much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li>is the first thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>Be the first to review this product .Be</li>
            <li>the first to review this product</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot !</li>
            <li>Very nice bars, last a long time.</li>
            <li>Not magic, but pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I believe the soap is effective in caring for rosacea and other skin fungus.</li>
            <li>It works in much the same way as pine tar, but I think better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, two negatives don&#x27;t make a positive and whilst the soap seems to have worked on me, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>An old tried and true  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking isotretinoin, which makes my skin super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Such a bar would make both a fine soap and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I encourage them to produce a pure coal tar soap, without added perfumes and colorants, and containing enough coal tar extract to be effective (personally, I&#x27;d like to see 1%-3%).</li>
            <li>But I am trying a half dozen products and I feel better after using this soap than all the other products except one which seems equally effective.</li>
            <li>worked very well.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and this soap does have real coal tar in it.</li>
            <li>Not a much as I would like, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li>How much does it help?</li>
            <li>Dries out skin too much.</li>
            <li>and I wonder why so much dye is within the compound ...</li>
            <li>I suds my face with the soap and then run the brush over the bar, and then gently brush my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have really improved my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I see much improvement</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, does not feel harsh on the skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>This soap seems to do better than other products I ordered to deal with the case of psoriasis I have.</li>
            <li>smells pretty good and cleans really well without excess drying or leaving behind residue</li>
            <li>This is not quality and should bd avoided at all costs unless you enjoy dry cracking irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I do have to make sure I rinse shower as it leaves black &amp;#34;drips&amp;#34; if i splash after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>any event, now using regular Dove soap with much better results in both forgoing respects after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I do think for a person with mild psoriasis that this may be the only product you need to control it.</li>
            <li>Luckily this is a good price for regular soap, and the fun factor of making everything look dirty (because this soap is essentially just a bar of coal) is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I first used it in Minneapolis back in the late 1980&#x27;s and loved it, then could not find it again for decades</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Understand, this does not mean this product will not work in your case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well for those with itchy or sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>Product is fantastic and the seller provided everything as expected.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues, but I have been avoiding it like normal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have only gone through about half the first bar and have not gotten a chance to be sure of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Pretty much makes my soft white wash cloths look like you washed the car</li>
            <li>They both have eczema and very sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I noticed I only felt itchy after using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing and helps with dry skin and it has a subtle pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I get dry and flaky skin on my face in the winter months, and using this soap cleared that right up.</li>
            <li>Coal tar (and the previous coal tar products that I have used) is a rich mahogany brown.</li>
            <li>My pregnant daughter suffered from a extremely itchy rash called pups...</li>
            <li>I really like the light scent of this soap, but as far as helping with psoriasis, it seemed to work...at least until the 4th bar.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear up my psoriasis, but it&#x27;s a night and day difference in terms of comfort.  </li>
            <li>It helped my hands to clear up.  </li>
            <li>Gentle low odor.  </li>
            <li>,  nothing works so far.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and adult acne and this soap helps both a lot.</li>
            <li>I used to use a shampoo called TGel because it had tar in it and that relieves the itching immediately, but didn&#x27;t do much to help curb the actual outbreak.</li>
            <li>PEOPLE IN COMPANIES RUIN THE NATURAL COAL OIL AROMA BY ADDING STINK FLOWER PERFUME TO THE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>One bath nearly all the plaque psoriasis was near gone.</li>
            <li>Just as expected, a good size bar, that will last a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The bars are long lasting in that they do not desolve away quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap Life Boy soap of decades past.</li>
            <li>most soaps, if you have open wounds because of your psoriasis this soup will make you cry or at least you&#x27;ll see hell</li>
            <li>and I use it everyday in lieu of regular cheap soap or chemical Laden soaps.</li>
            <li>Had this psoriasis on my right foot for over two years, try getting a pair of shoes that don&#x27;t go up &amp; down</li>
            <li>It actually cleans well enough in general and doesn&#x27;t smell much at all</li>
            <li>this soap is nothign special, it&#x27;s generic sodium hydro chloride and tallow with a little bit of color...</li>
            <li>The important thing here is that it&#x27;s not a true soap to dry your hands out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it&#x27;s not that bad either.  </li>
            <li>OK but a little too harsh.</li>
            <li>Do not worry about the Canadian ban, in huge amounts coal tar is bad for mice but this soap does not have huge amounts and you are not a mouse.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this for my dog who has dry skin and had developed psoriasis all over.  </li>
            <li>Essential for a sensitive and dry skin caused by psoriasis .</li>

            <li> The soap was good however, in that it did not leave a film, and had a neutral smell which is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> soap is ok  packaging can be better</li>
            <li> Pine tar soap is better.</li>
            <li> When I started using coal tar soap, I learned my mother had been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> The redness and swelling has got a lot better.</li>
            <li> Most stroes do not carry this soap but it works for the skin conditions for most people.</li>
            <li> Guttate for sure.</li>
            <li> It really worked great for him.</li>
            <li> so be sure to use darker ones.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Dove soap.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if there was more coal tar in there</li>
            <li> NOT, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me.</li>
            <li> , I normally see that as a good indication that it works</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> The two seem to work more quickly and thoroughly than either alone.</li>
            <li> Noticed my skin felt better with first use !</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> as a  psoriasis sufferer, I appreciate this effective, gentle soap.</li>
            <li> So far so good, no smell, lathers up well</li>
            <li> soap has a pleasant, light floral scent that the the manufacturer&#x27;s website informs us is from Eucalyptus, Geranium, and Rosemary essential oils.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderful, no more flareups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple no-nonsense tar soap, no fancy packaging (comes six bars in a plastic bag), and works as well as any other good tar soap, at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling soft and smooth...and as a regular soap it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> so I just made sure to work it in really well and let it sit for a minute or so before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I do not have mild  psoriasis, so I use this in conjunction with MG 217 coal tar ointment, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> the merchandise came quickly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> For comparison: T-Gel and similar shampoos contain 0.5% coal tar extract (about 15 times more); Psoriatrax contains 5.0% (about 150 times more).</li>
            <li> It is very soft and I am sure that its not a knock off product.</li>
            <li> has a nice light scent, works fine, BUT, it leaves a black residue all over your sink and tub.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more when we run out!</li>
            <li> Many people, of both sexes, enjoy the aroma of coal tar, likening it to fine leather or aged tobacco.</li>
            <li> Using regular soaps really irritates my skin, but using this soap makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.  </li>
            <li> - I guess I was expecting it to be more natural smelling.</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much that I WILL be ordering more shortly!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so worth it; I&#x27;m having a friend ship it to me in another part of the world.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, one word of caution was that I didn&#x27;t realize the coal tar makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> For the price this soap is well worth it.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because after using the product for about a month now, the best I can say is that my psoriasis hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.</li>
            <li> This soap started to work right away.</li>
            <li> Good soap with no negative use attributes however, giving it a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; &#x27;cause it didn&#x27;t work in helping to minimize psoriasis plaques/minimizing itching at all after 3 month daily use.  </li>
            <li> This soap was an old fashioned tried and true help!</li>
            <li> This soap was really effective at soothing the psoriasis and helping with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> good product but the black residue makes them lose a star.  </li>
            <li> It will take many years for me to use 6 bars, as I only need it periodically.</li>
            <li> daily dose ..... :)</li>
            <li> &amp; it sure didn&#x27;t back then.</li>
            <li> She loves the soap so much that she is continuing to use it now that the rash is gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still just on the first bar</li>
            <li> I think I will be using this as a bath soap along with the Irish Spring that I already use and love.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described, timely delivered.</li>
            <li> Much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li> is the first thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Be the first to review this product .Be</li>
            <li> the first to review this product</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot !</li>
            <li> Very nice bars, last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not magic, but pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I believe the soap is effective in caring for rosacea and other skin fungus.</li>
            <li> It works in much the same way as pine tar, but I think better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, two negatives don&#x27;t make a positive and whilst the soap seems to have worked on me, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> An old tried and true  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking isotretinoin, which makes my skin super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Such a bar would make both a fine soap and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I encourage them to produce a pure coal tar soap, without added perfumes and colorants, and containing enough coal tar extract to be effective (personally, I&#x27;d like to see 1%-3%).</li>
            <li> But I am trying a half dozen products and I feel better after using this soap than all the other products except one which seems equally effective.</li>
            <li> worked very well.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and this soap does have real coal tar in it.</li>
            <li> Not a much as I would like, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> How much does it help?</li>
            <li> Dries out skin too much.</li>
            <li> and I wonder why so much dye is within the compound ...</li>
            <li> I suds my face with the soap and then run the brush over the bar, and then gently brush my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have really improved my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see much improvement</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, does not feel harsh on the skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> This soap seems to do better than other products I ordered to deal with the case of psoriasis I have.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good and cleans really well without excess drying or leaving behind residue</li>
            <li> This is not quality and should bd avoided at all costs unless you enjoy dry cracking irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I do have to make sure I rinse shower as it leaves black &amp;#34;drips&amp;#34; if i splash after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> any event, now using regular Dove soap with much better results in both forgoing respects after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do think for a person with mild psoriasis that this may be the only product you need to control it.</li>
            <li> Luckily this is a good price for regular soap, and the fun factor of making everything look dirty (because this soap is essentially just a bar of coal) is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I first used it in Minneapolis back in the late 1980&#x27;s and loved it, then could not find it again for decades</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Understand, this does not mean this product will not work in your case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well for those with itchy or sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic and the seller provided everything as expected.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues, but I have been avoiding it like normal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have only gone through about half the first bar and have not gotten a chance to be sure of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Pretty much makes my soft white wash cloths look like you washed the car</li>
            <li> They both have eczema and very sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I noticed I only felt itchy after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing and helps with dry skin and it has a subtle pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I get dry and flaky skin on my face in the winter months, and using this soap cleared that right up.</li>
            <li> Coal tar (and the previous coal tar products that I have used) is a rich mahogany brown.</li>
            <li> My pregnant daughter suffered from a extremely itchy rash called pups...</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent of this soap, but as far as helping with psoriasis, it seemed to work...at least until the 4th bar.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear up my psoriasis, but it&#x27;s a night and day difference in terms of comfort.  </li>
            <li> It helped my hands to clear up.  </li>
            <li> Gentle low odor.  </li>
            <li> ,  nothing works so far.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and adult acne and this soap helps both a lot.</li>
            <li> I used to use a shampoo called TGel because it had tar in it and that relieves the itching immediately, but didn&#x27;t do much to help curb the actual outbreak.</li>
            <li> PEOPLE IN COMPANIES RUIN THE NATURAL COAL OIL AROMA BY ADDING STINK FLOWER PERFUME TO THE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> One bath nearly all the plaque psoriasis was near gone.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, a good size bar, that will last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The bars are long lasting in that they do not desolve away quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap Life Boy soap of decades past.</li>
            <li> most soaps, if you have open wounds because of your psoriasis this soup will make you cry or at least you&#x27;ll see hell</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday in lieu of regular cheap soap or chemical Laden soaps.</li>
            <li> Had this psoriasis on my right foot for over two years, try getting a pair of shoes that don&#x27;t go up &amp; down</li>
            <li> It actually cleans well enough in general and doesn&#x27;t smell much at all</li>
            <li> this soap is nothign special, it&#x27;s generic sodium hydro chloride and tallow with a little bit of color...</li>
            <li> The important thing here is that it&#x27;s not a true soap to dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it&#x27;s not that bad either.  </li>
            <li> OK but a little too harsh.</li>
            <li> Do not worry about the Canadian ban, in huge amounts coal tar is bad for mice but this soap does not have huge amounts and you are not a mouse.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my dog who has dry skin and had developed psoriasis all over.  </li>
            <li> Essential for a sensitive and dry skin caused by psoriasis .</li>
            <li> It does dry out your skin, but I have not had an itch attack since after the first few days of using it!</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time per bar.  </li>
            <li> My husband suffers from periodic and this soap is most helpful as he uses it daily.  </li>
            <li> your food dishes reek like granny toilet roses.</li>
            <li> Prevents psorasis outbreaks more than other soaps, even beats expensive luxury soaps.  </li>
            <li> Not sure, but smells decent and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a shepherd/rottweiler/lab mix and her fur is 1 - 1.5 inches long</li>
            <li> Makes a grey foam.  </li>
            <li> I use this for a minor rash I get from one of my diabetes meds.</li>
            <li> Coal tar is one of the oldest treatment for psoriasis, I was expecting to be good and some how painful, I was right about the pain but wrong about being good.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give your skin that overall &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling after using like some other soaps.</li>
            <li> I also use several other things like cream.</li>
            <li> was making skin dry.</li>
            <li> For the dryness, I use a moisturizing bar soap after and put on lotion to get rid of the dry spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The soap HAS all but eliminated dry, flakiness around my eyebrows and parts of my scalp</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a novelty black soap that lathers up grey, then look no further.</li>
            <li> That these adulterants have been included to make a bar of black soap further confirms that this is produced for novelty purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (by the time the internet arrived I only remembered that it was a black soap...).</li>
            <li> a single bar lasted almost a month!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected &amp; the black suds make the tile look filthy.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;seems to have crushed coal in it?</li>
            <li> not much help for skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a month now and had expected thepatches to soften and stop itching.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a firm believer that everyone experiences different reactions to everything.</li>
            <li> It caused extreme dryness irritation and itch.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this soap EXCEPT it leaves a dark residue on towels, sinks, soap dish.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my dog who has skin issues resulting in extreme greasy, flaky, smelly skin and which caused him to scratch incessantly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap in conjunction with other medications.  </li>
            <li> Only issue, shower may get a little black just spray and wipe it down after use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the hot, muggy weather and my long hair which I wear up.  </li>
            <li> However, the unnecessary addition of charcoal and iron oxide as colorants produces a dingy grey lather that will leave a residue on your fixtures if not carefully rinsed away.</li>
            <li> I also wish that it were some other color thn black but understand where it comes from.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find real coal tar soap.</li>
            <li> She said it works to  cut down on the itching of psoriasis, but doesn&#x27;t make it go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a bit suspicious when a product arrives in a plain brown paper bag with no labelling and I should have known at that point, the product wasn&#x27;t what I might have expected</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin problems or trouble in the winter, you should give this soap a try !</li>
            <li> Not a very strong scent and</li>
            <li> Did not have the tar soap smell as in previous tar soap I have used.</li>
            <li> the suds have a black tint to it, it doesnt stain anything in the shower</li>
            <li> It also makes everything black.</li>
            <li> Do not be alarmed when you see black on your skin</li>
            <li> ALL IT DID WAS TURN MY TUB BLACK, IT DID NOTHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> i had it in other places on my body, but usually  it fades..but not on my foot</li>
            <li> the order came in a crinkly paper lunch bag which was a little sketchy.</li>
            <li> It works so well that I dont feel like I have to lotion up everyday &amp;</li>
            <li> Leaves small  chunks of like a black wax residue in soap dish.</li>
            <li> Should have bought plain TAR SOAP ...</li>
            <li> I had a bar of black soap before given to me by a friend which lathered very well but smelled bad</li>
            <li> I do not have a bad case of psoriasis, so the reults should have been evident by now.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t use it unless I want tiny itchy red bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> My case could be too severe, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it helps.</li>
            <li> is I&#x27;m just not sure it works that well.</li>
            <li> Not able to pinpoint this works</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with the itching, but the soap will leave dark soap residue behind.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s hardly any scent within the bars</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time in the winter and now I have something that really helps out !</li>
            <li> I have had persistent seborrhea on my face for 46 years and it was progressively getting worse</li>
            <li> , sadly it</li>
            <li> Weird</li>
            <li> And it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> This soap had to be thrown out as it is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t get as bad as it could have.</li>
            <li> did nothing for me, but smell bad</li>
            <li> You know that painful itchy feeling that you&#x27;ll die unless you scratch, then when you do you want to cut out your flesh with your fingernails?</li>
            <li> i am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> made this purchase for my mother who suffers with a very bad case of skin rash on her arms.</li>
            <li> Because of the dye, it leaves a nasty residue in the soap dish.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is hard to find. It is just what I needed. My only suggestion would be to offer it in smaller packages. It will take many years for me to use 6 bars, as I only need it periodically.</li>
            <li> has a nice light scent, works fine, BUT, it leaves a black residue all over your sink and tub. if you dont mind cleaning it off every day then no worries.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re concerned about the scent - this soap has a very pleasant herbaceous scent.</li>
            <li> very good soap for treatment of my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Did not have the tar soap smell as in previous tar soap I have used.</li>
            <li> this soap is nothign special, it&#x27;s generic sodium hydro chloride and tallow with a little bit of color...i am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> seems to be ok, I dont know if its the best coal tar soap out there or not&lt;br /&gt;seems to have crushed coal in it? the suds have a black tint to it, it doesnt stain anything in the shower&lt;br /&gt;and it does seem to help with the itch related to some skin issues, still on the 1st bar.</li>
            <li> Works.  Prevents psorasis outbreaks more than other soaps, even beats expensive luxury soaps.  Great price!  I leave a bar in the shower, bathrooms, travel kit, and even one in the bathroom at work.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with the itching, but the soap will leave dark soap residue behind.</li>
            <li> Gentle low odor.  Works as promised</li>
            <li> I have not had the itching since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Good soap with no negative use attributes however, giving it a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; &#x27;cause it didn&#x27;t work in helping to minimize psoriasis plaques/minimizing itching at all after 3 month daily use.  Quite the opposite, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand, this does not mean this product will not work in your case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, now using regular Dove soap with much better results in both forgoing respects after only 2 weeks. Will now supplement with 5000units Vitamin D3+K2 (combination) daily dose ..... :)</li>
            <li> My grandmother loved it, my mother loved it and I love it. Best baby shampoo out there. No cradle cap on my kids.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin really smooth. Leaves small  chunks of like a black wax residue in soap dish. Does not stain anything.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Because of the dye, it leaves a nasty residue in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as tar soap did in the 80&#x27;s at preventing poison ivy but it didn&#x27;t get as bad as it could have. It smells good to &amp; it sure didn&#x27;t back then.</li>
            <li> My pregnant daughter suffered from a extremely itchy rash called pups... This soap was an old fashioned tried and true help! She bathed with it and had some relief! She took a bath with it in the evening and was able to get to sleep each evening! She loves the soap so much that she is continuing to use it now that the rash is gone!</li>
            <li> I use this soap every time I take a shower. The bars are long lasting in that they do not desolve away quickly. I do think for a person with mild psoriasis that this may be the only product you need to control it.I do not have mild  psoriasis, so I use this in conjunction with MG 217 coal tar ointment, which I also recommend. Try I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, no smell, lathers up well, I even wash my hair with it. I like it, seems to have helped with my scalp issues. I&#x27;m still just on the first bar but it seems like it lasts a good bit</li>
            <li> Works very good for allergies</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple no-nonsense tar soap, no fancy packaging (comes six bars in a plastic bag), and works as well as any other good tar soap, at a very good price.</li>
            <li> worked very well. made this purchase for my mother who suffers with a very bad case of skin rash on her arms.</li>
            <li> This soap is a perfect adjunct to the coal tar gel.  The two seem to work more quickly and thoroughly than either alone.</li>
            <li> Works very well for those with itchy or sensitive skin . It works so well that I dont feel like I have to lotion up everyday &amp; the merchandise came quickly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> not much help for skin condition. was making skin dry.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend he loves it. Has a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and I bought this to treat psoriasis I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager and it did not do anything for me. It actually cleans well enough in general and doesn&#x27;t smell much at all but it did not do what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected &amp; the black suds make the tile look filthy.  It seems like there are a lot of perfumes in it - I guess I was expecting it to be more natural smelling.</li>
            <li> It has helped my psoriasis around my ears, so I presume it is helping on elbows and knees, although I use elba tar on them as well.</li>
            <li> Coal tar is one of the oldest treatment for psoriasis, I was expecting to be good and some how painful, I was right about the pain but wrong about being good.&lt;br /&gt;Like most soaps, if you have open wounds because of your psoriasis this soup will make you cry or at least you&#x27;ll see hell, I normally see that as a good indication that it works, sadly it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third Bar and I all can say is that it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it just get one bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, Smells really good, like really really good, there&#x27;s no coal tar smell at all. (maybe there&#x27;s not enough coal tar on it)</li>
            <li> It worked wonderful, no more flareups. Thank you</li>
            <li> Six bars of Coal Tar Soap arrived today in a zip lock plastic bag.  I think I will be using this as a bath soap along with the Irish Spring that I already use and love.  I had a bar of black soap before given to me by a friend which lathered very well but smelled bad and I threw it out.  This soap smells divine.  After I had purchased it I read that it contained coconut oil and I was prepared to not like it because I don&#x27;t like coconut fragrance in lotions and stuff like that which is used in some nail salons and in a lot of sun tan lotions.  Wonderful surprise, I do not smell the coconut if it is even there.  It just smells fresh and clean.  I bought this to use in the back of my hair where I am getting what I think is psoriasis.  Maybe it&#x27;s the hot, muggy weather and my long hair which I wear up.  However, the heat, sweat and salt have caused me some discomfort and I look forward to using this soap along with my shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it works just like it said it would. I don&#x27;t have anything else to say about this item.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but since my doctor recommended I find some coal tar soap for my psoriasis, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I found this product to be GREAT in helping with the itchiness and redness that come along with psoriasis. It does dry out your skin, but I have not had an itch attack since after the first few days of using it! For the dryness, I use a moisturizing bar soap after and put on lotion to get rid of the dry spots. I love this soap so much that I WILL be ordering more shortly!!</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and this soap does have real coal tar in it. Not a much as I would like, but better than nothing. I am giving it a try for my skin.</li>
            <li> His seems to have helped my psoriasis quite a bit.  It smells nice, does not feel harsh on the skin, etc.  The soap suds are kind of gray, but not staining.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it is supposed to do. It cleans and leaves a very nice smell to the body. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> clogs up the drain &amp; stains the tub. Does control the dandruff though</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, timely delivered.</li>
            <li> it a very good soap for my ichy body I recommend this soap for any body who has problems .</li>
            <li> Good produt buy for my sister</li>
            <li> Excellent.An old tried and true  remedy that helps psoraris, orignally recommended by a physician</li>
            <li> Coal Tar helps control chronic skin conditions like Psoriasis.  It works in much the same way as pine tar, but I think better.  Until I found this soap I just used Neutrogena shampoo as body wash.  I am almost out of it and I will be reordering regularly.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition.  This is the best soap for sensative skin.  It is very soft and I am sure that its not a knock off product.</li>
            <li> Soap did not help psoriasis. My case could be too severe, I&#x27;m not sure. The soap was good however, in that it did not leave a film, and had a neutral smell which is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Caution: the bars tend to stain wash clothes, but maybe I should have known this. How much does it help? Not sure, but smells decent and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> soap is ok  packaging can be better I think</li>
            <li> Did not help my psoriasis at all, used it every day with no improvement. I wonder if there is any coal tar in the soap, they ship it in brown paper bag like a lunch sack.</li>
            <li> After researching possible cures for my psoriasis/eczema I ordered this.  This was before it was diagnosed as psoriasis.  Come to find out it REALLY dries out your skin which in my case was not the best thing to do.</li>
            <li> OK but a little too harsh. Dries out skin too much. Pine tar soap is better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a bit suspicious when a product arrives in a plain brown paper bag with no labelling and I should have known at that point, the product wasn&#x27;t what I might have expected but, since I was specifically searching for an inexpensive coal-tar soap, I kept the bars &amp; used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap HAS all but eliminated dry, flakiness around my eyebrows and parts of my scalp but there&#x27;s hardly any scent within the bars and I wonder why so much dye is within the compound ... what are the makers trying to mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, two negatives don&#x27;t make a positive and whilst the soap seems to have worked on me, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, feels mild, and smells good.  I get dry and flaky skin on my face in the winter months, and using this soap cleared that right up.</li>
            <li> So now i am in a Delmar  buy it dont bu, it, it works, it don&#x27;t work......Had this psoriasis on my right foot for over two years, try getting a pair of shoes that don&#x27;t go up &amp; down and it&#x27;s like torture every step.....i had it in other places on my body, but usually  it fades..but not on my foot,  nothing works so far.  W.W.2Guy</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent and Pine Tar. He says it smells manly. I agree. You can, however, find it cheaper in health food stores.</li>
            <li> When I started using coal tar soap, I learned my mother had been using it for many years.  I use it to keep my eczema under control</li>
            <li> This soap had to be thrown out as it is very poor quality. It caused extreme dryness irritation and itch. Smells like cheap Life Boy soap of decades past. It also makes everything black. This is not quality and should bd avoided at all costs unless you enjoy dry cracking irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent of this soap, but as far as helping with psoriasis, it seemed to work...at least until the 4th bar. Scales started appearing again. It did leave my skin feeling soft and smooth...and as a regular soap it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried everything for your flakey skin arround your eyebrows and forehead...this is the answer. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my psoriasis and helps to keep it from flaring up, has a very pleasant odor, not like the coal tar odor that smells like medicine. I use it regularly.  Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as advertised. I get the occasional sweat rash from exercise in the heat. Much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a novelty black soap that lathers up grey, then look no further. If you are looking for a medicated soap, save your money and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a pleasant, light floral scent that the the manufacturer&#x27;s website informs us is from Eucalyptus, Geranium, and Rosemary essential oils. There is no discernible aroma of coal tar what-so-ever. When we asked the manufacturer for the percentage of coal tar in this product we were told \\&quot;we put 100 ml of coal tar into 360 kg of soap so the concentration is low. (August 22, 2014)\\&quot;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers well. However, the unnecessary addition of charcoal and iron oxide as colorants produces a dingy grey lather that will leave a residue on your fixtures if not carefully rinsed away. Coal tar (and the previous coal tar products that I have used) is a rich mahogany brown. That these adulterants have been included to make a bar of black soap further confirms that this is produced for novelty purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I hope the manufacturer reads this review. Many people, of both sexes, enjoy the aroma of coal tar, likening it to fine leather or aged tobacco. I encourage them to produce a pure coal tar soap, without added perfumes and colorants, and containing enough coal tar extract to be effective (personally, I&#x27;d like to see 1%-3%). Such a bar would make both a fine soap and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Using a standard density of 801 grams/liter for soap, this 360 kg &#x3D; 288 liters. 100 ml of coal tar extract would then yield soap with a concentration of 0.0347% coal tar. For comparison: T-Gel and similar shampoos contain 0.5% coal tar extract (about 15 times more); Psoriatrax contains 5.0% (about 150 times more).</li>
            <li> Works great on my husband and sons skin.  They both have eczema and very sensitive skins.  Tar soap clears in up, you do need to use regularly. Only issue, shower may get a little black just spray and wipe it down after use.</li>
            <li> I have had persistent seborrhea on my face for 46 years and it was progressively getting worse (it waxed and waned over the years but was in full-on waxing mode).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first thing that has worked for me. I also use the Olay cleansing brush sans their facial cleaner. I suds my face with the soap and then run the brush over the bar, and then gently brush my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so worth it; I&#x27;m having a friend ship it to me in another part of the world.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and adult acne and this soap helps both a lot. I first used it in Minneapolis back in the late 1980&#x27;s and loved it, then could not find it again for decades (by the time the internet arrived I only remembered that it was a black soap...). Then when I moved to Canada the local health food stores carried it and I was overjoyed - until Canada banned it. Now I am temporarily living in America again so I took the opportunity to buy 18 bars. Do not worry about the Canadian ban, in huge amounts coal tar is bad for mice but this soap does not have huge amounts and you are not a mouse. I am obsessive about health issues and my thorough research has found no reason to think this soap will harm anyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice bars, last a long time. I believe the soap is effective in caring for rosacea and other skin fungus. It is difficult to find real coal tar soap.</li>
            <li> I found out I was allergic to this. I thought I was going to scratch off all layers of my skin because I had waves of itchiness everywhere. You know that painful itchy feeling that you&#x27;ll die unless you scratch, then when you do you want to cut out your flesh with your fingernails? It was like that. It was like I had poison ivy all over. At first I didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I noticed I only felt itchy after using this. I had to stop using it. I&#x27;ll keep it for future purposes I guess. I&#x27;m taking isotretinoin, which makes my skin super sensitive. Maybe in the future it will work...or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good though. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it unless I want tiny itchy red bumps everywhere. Weird because I&#x27;ve never had allergies like this to anything. Oh well. C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li> the delivery was correct; the saler its responsable</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. I definitely will be buying more when we run out! Excellent seller! Will be buying from them again!</li>
            <li> BEST SOAP EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Cleared up my face and doesn&#x27;t have that weird pine smell most pine soaps have.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and as a body soap in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Also helped heal a tattoo I was having difficulty with that wasn&#x27;t healing properly.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me. Read cancer producing? Should have bought plain TAR SOAP ... NOT coal tar soap.&lt;br /&gt;For Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Coal tar works great for removal of scaling from psoriasis.</li>
            <li> did nothing for me, but smell bad</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my dog who has dry skin and had developed psoriasis all over.  This soap was really effective at soothing the psoriasis and helping with the dry skin.  She&#x27;s a shepherd/rottweiler/lab mix and her fur is 1 - 1.5 inches long so I just made sure to work it in really well and let it sit for a minute or so before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it worked for her, I tried it myself.  It&#x27;s soothing and helps with dry skin and it has a subtle pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t give your skin that overall &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling after using like some other soaps.</li>
            <li> I use these often I also use pin sol shampoo  both seems to work good</li>
            <li> good product but the black residue makes them lose a star.  Still I use a bar daily and the soap does help reduce skin irritations.</li>
            <li> CHRISTMAS GIFT - HE USES IT OFTEN FOR HIS PSORIASIS, TY!</li>
            <li> I like everything about this soap EXCEPT it leaves a dark residue on towels, sinks, soap dish.</li>
            <li> This work great. They have really improved my psoriasis. The redness and swelling has got a lot better. The lather up great and have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for psoriasis. It doesn&#x27;t clear up my psoriasis, but it&#x27;s a night and day difference in terms of comfort.  Using regular soaps really irritates my skin, but using this soap makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, one word of caution was that I didn&#x27;t realize the coal tar makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Haven&#x27;t had any issues, but I have been avoiding it like normal.</li>
            <li> I notice no difference in my condition. I do not have a bad case of psoriasis, so the reults should have been evident by now.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis all my life and refuse to take a prescription with side effects to &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; help it. I used to use a shampoo called TGel because it had tar in it and that relieves the itching immediately, but didn&#x27;t do much to help curb the actual outbreak. This soap started to work right away. The red imflammation went away and the patches themselves are subsiding.  For those who think you&#x27;ll smell like tar....NOT, it smells pretty good. For the price this soap is well worth it. For those who what relief without side effects, USE THIS.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, a good size bar, that will last a few weeks. Good price as well. Most stroes do not carry this soap but it works for the skin conditions for most people. Guttate for sure.</li>
            <li> COAL TAR IS A MIX OF ALL PLANTS, PERCOLATED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THRU ROCK. PEOPLE IN COMPANIES RUIN THE NATURAL COAL OIL AROMA BY ADDING STINK FLOWER PERFUME TO THE PRODUCTS. your food dishes reek like granny toilet roses. your clothes smell like urine from the ammonia detergent, and musk extract from a goats under arm. add flowers and...Wa La, your sense of smell goes all queer! DEMAND UNSCENTED PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Worked great just what we needed. Also used on tge dogs helped their summer skin proplems</li>
            <li> Not a very strong scent and the order came in a crinkly paper lunch bag which was a little sketchy.</li>
            <li> Relieves the itch of psoriasis, but that is it.</li>
            <li> well I use the soap every day. I&#x27;m not sure it helps. I also use several other things like cream. My psoriasis is clearing up slowly.the reason for not giving it 5 stars is I&#x27;m just not sure it works that well. And it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Not magic, but pleasant to use. as a  psoriasis sufferer, I appreciate this effective, gentle soap. the scent is inoffensive and it suds up nicely. It does stick to the sink, so I keep it on a sponge. Works fine. The  family also enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Relieved a lot of the itching from my eczema.</li>
            <li> My son has both and he swears by this soap. I also tried it on my dog who has skin issues resulting in extreme greasy, flaky, smelly skin and which caused him to scratch incessantly. It really worked great for him.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order.  My husband suffers from periodic and this soap is most helpful as he uses it daily.  A pleading fragrance also.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective for me. I use this every time I shower.</li>
            <li> amazing soap. smells like lavender. this is the best deal you can find!</li>
            <li> Great...seller was awesome to work with!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law.  She said it works to  cut down on the itching of psoriasis, but doesn&#x27;t make it go away.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t relly know if work or not but i still use the soap</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a month now and had expected thepatches to soften and stop itching.  But they have not.  I also wish that it were some other color thn black but understand where it comes from. Do not be alarmed when you see black on your skin</li>
            <li> Good quality. i will recomend this product. Be the first to review this product .Be the first to review this product</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap in conjunction with other medications.  Not able to pinpoint this works but it does make my legs and arms feel after a shower.  I do have to make sure I rinse shower as it leaves black &amp;#34;drips&amp;#34; if i splash after rinsing.  Pretty much makes my soft white wash cloths look like you washed the car so be sure to use darker ones.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because after using the product for about a month now, the best I can say is that my psoriasis hasn&#x27;t gotten worse. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> This soap is great ! Noticed my skin felt better with first use ! I have a horrible time in the winter and now I have something that really helps out ! If you have dry skin problems or trouble in the winter, you should give this soap a try !</li>
            <li> Gets rid of itchy skin.  Makes a grey foam.  Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it&#x27;s not that bad either.  Seems to last a long time per bar.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I read, I thought I would give it a try. I have now used almost an entire bar using it daily. Can&#x27;t say I see much improvement but I&#x27;m a firm believer that everyone experiences different reactions to everything. While it may have been great for some, might not be for others.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the bars and I still gave 4 stars because for the low price, I don&#x27;t feel cheated for trying this for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I use this for a minor rash I get from one of my diabetes meds. This is the best price I have ever seen and a single bar lasted almost a month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this soap for the problematic skin problems that I have, but have yet to see any difference or improved results. Luckily this is a good price for regular soap, and the fun factor of making everything look dirty (because this soap is essentially just a bar of coal) is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> One bath nearly all the plaque psoriasis was near gone. No prescription has done what this soap does</li>
            <li> good price. fast shipping</li>
            <li> my favorite soap! smells pretty good and cleans really well without excess drying or leaving behind residue</li>
            <li> We are so happy to be able to get this product for my husbands psoriasis...  it&#x27;s the only thing that works!!  Thank you Amazon for carrying it!!</li>
            <li> The best Tar soap. Others Have changer over the years. This soap is great for all skin types.</li>
            <li> ALL IT DID WAS TURN MY TUB BLACK, IT DID NOTHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my psoraisis, as recommended. It seems to be helping. I would recommend it to others for this problem.</li>
            <li> Nice item, nice deal though I prefer pine tar soap for it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea dermtitis and the soap is a blessing.  It stops the itching and clears up the skin on my face and body.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This soap seems to do better than other products I ordered to deal with the case of psoriasis I have. It has a pleasant scent and lathers well also. Furthermore, it is relatively inexpensive! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have only gone through about half the first bar and have not gotten a chance to be sure of its effectiveness. But I am trying a half dozen products and I feel better after using this soap than all the other products except one which seems equally effective.</li>
            <li> THE ONE AND ONLY SOAP FOR PSORISES,VERYGOOD</li>
            <li> Lovely smell! Good for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> My husband will not be without this soap.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This soap is helping to relieve the itching associated with eczema.  I am very happy with it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Essential for a sensitive and dry skin caused by psoriasis . Thanks a lot !</li>
            <li> one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever found for acne without severely drying the skin. Overall an excellent product and I use it everyday in lieu of regular cheap soap or chemical Laden soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Dove soap.  It helped my hands to clear up.  It would be better if there was more coal tar in there but it may not be allowed.  The important thing here is that it&#x27;s not a true soap to dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic and the seller provided everything as expected.  Highly recommended!</li>
