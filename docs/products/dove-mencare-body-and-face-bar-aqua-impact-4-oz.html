            <li>Nice soap.</li>
            <li>In looking for a soap without too much scent, I stumbled onto this &#x27;Dove for Men&#x27; line of products and thought great!</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will purchase more when this purchase is done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this new flavor, Aqua Impact, now for about a month and can tell you it&#x27;s the best yet.</li>
            <li>Use it, Love it, needs some more!</li>
            <li>Great Smell lots of moisturizing (good feel after showering ) seems to last good and would buy again nice product.</li>

            <li>Very good smell and really worthable.</li>
            <li>It lathers better than the others and it has a nice fragrance.</li>

            <li>He has sensitive skin and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great,  very clean smell and washes off clean.</li>

            <li>These have a good scent and it does what I need it to do, and that&#x27;s clean me.</li>
            <li>I find the smell appealing but its very light, you probably won&#x27;t notice it after you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Love how this soap leaves my skin feeling during the day.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and no nasty residue on the skin!</li>
            <li>Fragrance is not too overwhelming and the extra moisturizers within are great!</li>

            <li>I like this soap because it does leave your skin feeling better after a shower.</li>
            <li>You can find more videos and photos that I have posted here http://goo.gl/7gdV6q .  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>you go to a store and the soap aisle, you&#x27;ll find more types or flavors of Dove soap than a radio station has on its grid rate card.</li>
            <li>my son love the smell</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is ok, it does not stay with you.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I know most people use shower gel now days, but if you are like me and still use a wash cloth and soap in the shower then check out this soap.  </li>
            <li>what more can I say?</li>
            <li>many hours</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I also approve of the scent. :)</li>
            <li>I love DMC..</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite brands of deorderant soap.</li>
            <li>Made me clean, smells nice</li>
            <li>It does however get you nice and clean, and it seems to prevent you from stinking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>So in summary, these bars of soap smell great, are a good deal for the price, and save me some time in my daily routine each day which outweighs how quickly they run out!</li>
            <li>Aqua Green has like a cooling feel when it touches the skin &amp; has a wonderful fresh scent &amp; great moisturizing for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smells very nice and lasts longer than the normal dove.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li>And being a women it&#x27;s not bad for me too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to be able to bring a bar with me on a trip instead of a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I also switched laundry detergents to Wisk in order to better clean my clothes which also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Works well, smells fine</li>
            <li>leaves you feeling smooth and smelling refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Dove Men+Car soap bars are fantastic and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it shipped free with Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was available in an unscented version</li>
            <li>The smell is manly, but not annoyingly so.</li>
            <li>Maybe cheaper soap followed by using an odorless moisturizer all over would work out more economical</li>
            <li>I used to have to spend a bit of time after showers applying lotion so that my skin didn&#x27;t get too ashy, but with this soap I only have to use lotion maybe once or twice a week as opposed to each and every day which is great.</li>
            <li>So far so good, so reallyl no complaints here.</li>
            <li>Great bar of soap with a good subtle scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but not overwhelming and the color is great.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and by no means over-powering, but more importantly, the bars leave your skin feeling soft and cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It does the job it was created to do very well, leaving you clean, your skin soft and the scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>B002TSA90W Dove Care Clean Ounce Count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B002TSA90W Dove Care Clean Ounce Count]]</li>
            <li>Keeps me clean.</li>
            <li>The cost was low and it is a good soap bar.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good soap.</li>
            <li>Since this one was so much cheaper than the others I decided to try it, and I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to last for a good while too.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>Now I can use soap that isn&#x27;t so full of perfume that I reek of it</li>
            <li>He adds a little Dove Mens moisturizer and he is good to go!</li>
            <li>Great for the skin and keeps well, does not fall apart when its used up like other soaps.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This soap helps tremendously with the battle.</li>
            <li>Simply super&#x27;b.</li>
            <li>I love the Dove Men line of products, so when I decided to try this product, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good soap for men, wont dry out your skin but also wont leave it oily.</li>
            <li>I started using it because I liked it more than some of the other Dove bar soaps I used to use!</li>
            <li>Bar has a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; feel to it, and I clean up pretty well with it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would ever buy it, but it is intriguing.</li>
            <li>As a soap I do get clean but was surprised by strong scent.</li>
            <li>I rather have the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>This really is a great value for soap and it has no strong odor.  </li>
            <li>it just keeps coming right around the time I need it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are OK, I don&#x27;t use cream, so Dove soaps are cool enough for me.</li>
            <li>Have a fresh feeling right out of the shower, without too much drying.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>To tell you the truth, the regular Dove bar soap does a better job.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something that I dislike about many similar soaps.</li>
            <li>Doctors have told me that over the past many years and I&#x27;ve endured many theories from them as to how to effect a remedy.  </li>
            <li>Exact bars as you can buy in the malls.</li>
            <li>Not only dry skin but skin prone to rashes and scales that fly when scratched.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice,  doesn&#x27;t dry the skin as much</li>
            <li>The Dove Men + Deep Clean (or Extra Fresh) is 100x better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>We really like the Dove Men + Care Deep Care better than this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves him clean, fresh scented &amp; moisturized after his daily</li>
            <li>one definitely lathers better than the Deep Clean version probably because it lacks those scrubbing beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the smell and doesnt dry your skin</li>
            <li>Love the scent and doesn&#x27;t dry me out b</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I both use this stuff and it keeps our skin so super soft.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin like regular soap and leaves nice scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the bars run out a little quicker than the irish spring I used to use</li>
            <li>I dissolves twice as fast</li>
            <li>i really like the whole Dove 4 Men line.</li>
            <li>This is very fragranced, I imagine to cover up the men&#x27;s BO.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my guy and used it myself, but it&#x27;s just really too fragranced.</li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy these bars and will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li>Very picky.</li>
            <li>thanks lot.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped his skin a lot in these colder months with drier air from heating the home, office, cars, etc.  </li>
            <li>in addition to a more-than-necessary-or-otherwise-warranted persistence of smell, this soap really belongs in that box of flower-shaped soaps</li>
            <li>They are gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use daily and they are cheaper here with the free shipping than locals.</li>
            <li>but it really does work.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>i would get the red kind dove for men next time.  </li>
            <li>As good as regular Dove, but it doesn&#x27;t get all soft and mushy after several days.  </li>
            <li>The entire Dove Men+Care line of soap is nice, but I now only buy the Aqua Impact after trying all of them.</li>
            <li>I had better experiences with the 2 other Dove Men soaps:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love the other 2 smells that they have but had not tried this one.  </li>
            <li>B002TSA90W Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean, 4 Ounce, 8 Count]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Care Deep has a clean smell without the overpowering smell of the Aqua Impact.</li>
            <li>I got this as a body wash sample with a pack of Dove Deep Clean.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to smell like a guy, go with the other soaps in this line, such as the &#x27;Deep-Clean&#x27; or &#x27;Fresh&#x27; scented varieties which do not linger as this one does, and which smell altogether more manly than this perfumed soap here.</li>
            <li>(what is that other guy talking about) but the main thing is that it lathers better than the Dove extra fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34; sounds more macho than the standard &amp;#34;beauty bar with deep moisturizing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I hope by the next time we buy it will be a choice in the Subscribe &amp; Save as the Amazon price seems to be better than my local pricing.!)</li>
            <li>Do not like the scent of this particular product.</li>
            <li>is a division of Unilever and this particular scent, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, used to be produced by Unilever in the Lever 2000 series.</li>
            <li>works well on face even with my sensitive (very acne prone) skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling all dried out like most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li>extra fresh is moisturizing &amp; smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having naturally dry skin, I constantly struggle to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the irish spring does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little hesitant at first because this one seemed to have more of a scent on the outside of the box.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just an issue with the bar/batch that I&#x27;m using or if it&#x27;s a normal characteristic of this particular product, either way, I&#x27;m willing to keep using it to see if it changes plus, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for</li>
            <li>very simple.. i will keep using it as long as it is available to buy and shipped</li>
            <li>Does not leave my skin dry, and makes me feel fresh</li>
            <li>only downside of this soap that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the same silky smooth feeling that the other Dove soaps leave, including the Deep Clean version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what people&#x27;s problem is with this; if you like soap that makes you smell CLEAN, then this is it!</li>
            <li>The scent is more noticeable in the shower when you&#x27;re using it, but once you rinse off it&#x27;s hardly there or noticeable</li>
            <li>Other Dove For Men products are mild this one is not</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>he has asked me the next time I order his cleansing bar, he wants the Dove Aqua Impact for Face &amp; Body.  </li>
            <li>(like Axe or Old Spice products sometimes tend to be).</li>
            <li>At least for me :)</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t make the cut, and only a select few are reordered.</li>
            <li>My skin always gest super dry and itchy in the winter if I use regular soap.</li>
            <li>Soap breaks down quick.</li>
            <li>With this soap, as soon as I dry off, my face feels clean and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li>, they seem far softer than other brands and cost a little more.  </li>
            <li>This soap cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>being that he lives in a dry area this soap works very well</li>
            <li>Naturally men don&#x27;t want soaps that smell like perfume or have a scent that last for hours.</li>
            <li>Sent this soap to my son in the military and it was received with much appreciation.  </li>
            <li>It is still soft next day,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too badly and smells pretty good</li>
            <li>This is a great soap because it helps to fight dry skin during cold weather months.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Dove Deep Clean.  </li>
            <li>husband has now tried the Deep Clean (pink), Extra Fresh (green), &amp; now this the Aqua Green (Impact) Dove Men Face &amp; Body Bars.&lt;br /&gt;While the deep clean version has like a skin scrub built in to remove dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The soap is very soft on hands and face and is not nearly as drying as regular soap.</li>
            <li>I like the bar, but I don&#x27;t like the way it become soft and doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>With my old soap, my face used to get really dry  after a shower</li>
            <li>I like the soap a lot but not sure it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The soap does a fine job of cleaning, but it leaves behind the smell of eggs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A refreshing and good scented soap.</li>

            <li> Nice soap.</li>
            <li> Nice soap.</li>
            <li> In looking for a soap without too much scent, I stumbled onto this &#x27;Dove for Men&#x27; line of products and thought great!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and will purchase more when this purchase is done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this new flavor, Aqua Impact, now for about a month and can tell you it&#x27;s the best yet.</li>
            <li> Use it, Love it, needs some more!</li>
            <li> Great Smell lots of moisturizing (good feel after showering ) seems to last good and would buy again nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild on the skin and it has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Very good smell and really worthable.</li>
            <li> It lathers better than the others and it has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best bar soap i have used so far.</li>
            <li> must admit, this scent is the one I like the best so far too.  </li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great,  very clean smell and washes off clean.</li>
            <li> Good, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> These have a good scent and it does what I need it to do, and that&#x27;s clean me.</li>
            <li> I find the smell appealing but its very light, you probably won&#x27;t notice it after you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Love how this soap leaves my skin feeling during the day.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and no nasty residue on the skin!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not too overwhelming and the extra moisturizers within are great!</li>

            <li> I like this soap because it does leave your skin feeling better after a shower.</li>
            <li> You can find more videos and photos that I have posted here http://goo.gl/7gdV6q .  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> you go to a store and the soap aisle, you&#x27;ll find more types or flavors of Dove soap than a radio station has on its grid rate card.</li>
            <li> my son love the smell</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is ok, it does not stay with you.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I know most people use shower gel now days, but if you are like me and still use a wash cloth and soap in the shower then check out this soap.  </li>
            <li> what more can I say?</li>
            <li> many hours</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I also approve of the scent. :)</li>
            <li> I love DMC..</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of deorderant soap.</li>
            <li> Made me clean, smells nice</li>
            <li> It does however get you nice and clean, and it seems to prevent you from stinking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> So in summary, these bars of soap smell great, are a good deal for the price, and save me some time in my daily routine each day which outweighs how quickly they run out!</li>
            <li> Aqua Green has like a cooling feel when it touches the skin &amp; has a wonderful fresh scent &amp; great moisturizing for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> smells very nice and lasts longer than the normal dove.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li> And being a women it&#x27;s not bad for me too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to be able to bring a bar with me on a trip instead of a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I also switched laundry detergents to Wisk in order to better clean my clothes which also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells fine</li>
            <li> leaves you feeling smooth and smelling refreshed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Dove Men+Car soap bars are fantastic and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it shipped free with Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was available in an unscented version</li>
            <li> The smell is manly, but not annoyingly so.</li>
            <li> Maybe cheaper soap followed by using an odorless moisturizer all over would work out more economical</li>
            <li> I used to have to spend a bit of time after showers applying lotion so that my skin didn&#x27;t get too ashy, but with this soap I only have to use lotion maybe once or twice a week as opposed to each and every day which is great.</li>
            <li> So far so good, so reallyl no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Great bar of soap with a good subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but not overwhelming and the color is great.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and by no means over-powering, but more importantly, the bars leave your skin feeling soft and cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does the job it was created to do very well, leaving you clean, your skin soft and the scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>

            <li> B002TSA90W Dove Care Clean Ounce Count]]</li>
            <li> Keeps me clean.</li>
            <li> The cost was low and it is a good soap bar.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good soap.</li>
            <li> Since this one was so much cheaper than the others I decided to try it, and I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to last for a good while too.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Now I can use soap that isn&#x27;t so full of perfume that I reek of it</li>
            <li> He adds a little Dove Mens moisturizer and he is good to go!</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and keeps well, does not fall apart when its used up like other soaps.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This soap helps tremendously with the battle.</li>
            <li> Simply super&#x27;b.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Men line of products, so when I decided to try this product, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good soap for men, wont dry out your skin but also wont leave it oily.</li>
            <li> I started using it because I liked it more than some of the other Dove bar soaps I used to use!</li>
            <li> Bar has a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; feel to it, and I clean up pretty well with it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would ever buy it, but it is intriguing.</li>
            <li> As a soap I do get clean but was surprised by strong scent.</li>
            <li> I rather have the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This really is a great value for soap and it has no strong odor.  </li>
            <li> it just keeps coming right around the time I need it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are OK, I don&#x27;t use cream, so Dove soaps are cool enough for me.</li>
            <li> Have a fresh feeling right out of the shower, without too much drying.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, the regular Dove bar soap does a better job.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something that I dislike about many similar soaps.</li>
            <li> Doctors have told me that over the past many years and I&#x27;ve endured many theories from them as to how to effect a remedy.  </li>
            <li> Exact bars as you can buy in the malls.</li>
            <li> Not only dry skin but skin prone to rashes and scales that fly when scratched.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice,  doesn&#x27;t dry the skin as much</li>
            <li> The Dove Men + Deep Clean (or Extra Fresh) is 100x better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We really like the Dove Men + Care Deep Care better than this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves him clean, fresh scented &amp; moisturized after his daily</li>
            <li> one definitely lathers better than the Deep Clean version probably because it lacks those scrubbing beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the smell and doesnt dry your skin</li>
            <li> Love the scent and doesn&#x27;t dry me out b</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use this stuff and it keeps our skin so super soft.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin like regular soap and leaves nice scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the bars run out a little quicker than the irish spring I used to use</li>
            <li> I dissolves twice as fast</li>
            <li> i really like the whole Dove 4 Men line.</li>
            <li> This is very fragranced, I imagine to cover up the men&#x27;s BO.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my guy and used it myself, but it&#x27;s just really too fragranced.</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy these bars and will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Very picky.</li>
            <li> thanks lot.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped his skin a lot in these colder months with drier air from heating the home, office, cars, etc.  </li>
            <li> in addition to a more-than-necessary-or-otherwise-warranted persistence of smell, this soap really belongs in that box of flower-shaped soaps</li>
            <li> They are gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use daily and they are cheaper here with the free shipping than locals.</li>
            <li> but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i would get the red kind dove for men next time.  </li>
            <li> As good as regular Dove, but it doesn&#x27;t get all soft and mushy after several days.  </li>
            <li> The entire Dove Men+Care line of soap is nice, but I now only buy the Aqua Impact after trying all of them.</li>
            <li> I had better experiences with the 2 other Dove Men soaps:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love the other 2 smells that they have but had not tried this one.  </li>
            <li> B002TSA90W Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean, 4 Ounce, 8 Count]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Care Deep has a clean smell without the overpowering smell of the Aqua Impact.</li>
            <li> I got this as a body wash sample with a pack of Dove Deep Clean.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to smell like a guy, go with the other soaps in this line, such as the &#x27;Deep-Clean&#x27; or &#x27;Fresh&#x27; scented varieties which do not linger as this one does, and which smell altogether more manly than this perfumed soap here.</li>
            <li> (what is that other guy talking about) but the main thing is that it lathers better than the Dove extra fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34; sounds more macho than the standard &amp;#34;beauty bar with deep moisturizing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I hope by the next time we buy it will be a choice in the Subscribe &amp; Save as the Amazon price seems to be better than my local pricing.!)</li>
            <li> Do not like the scent of this particular product.</li>
            <li> is a division of Unilever and this particular scent, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, used to be produced by Unilever in the Lever 2000 series.</li>
            <li> works well on face even with my sensitive (very acne prone) skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling all dried out like most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li> extra fresh is moisturizing &amp; smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having naturally dry skin, I constantly struggle to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the irish spring does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant at first because this one seemed to have more of a scent on the outside of the box.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just an issue with the bar/batch that I&#x27;m using or if it&#x27;s a normal characteristic of this particular product, either way, I&#x27;m willing to keep using it to see if it changes plus, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for</li>
            <li> very simple.. i will keep using it as long as it is available to buy and shipped</li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin dry, and makes me feel fresh</li>
            <li> only downside of this soap that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the same silky smooth feeling that the other Dove soaps leave, including the Deep Clean version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people&#x27;s problem is with this; if you like soap that makes you smell CLEAN, then this is it!</li>
            <li> The scent is more noticeable in the shower when you&#x27;re using it, but once you rinse off it&#x27;s hardly there or noticeable</li>
            <li> Other Dove For Men products are mild this one is not</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> he has asked me the next time I order his cleansing bar, he wants the Dove Aqua Impact for Face &amp; Body.  </li>
            <li> (like Axe or Old Spice products sometimes tend to be).</li>
            <li> At least for me :)</li>
            <li> Most products don&#x27;t make the cut, and only a select few are reordered.</li>
            <li> My skin always gest super dry and itchy in the winter if I use regular soap.</li>
            <li> Soap breaks down quick.</li>
            <li> With this soap, as soon as I dry off, my face feels clean and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> , they seem far softer than other brands and cost a little more.  </li>
            <li> This soap cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> being that he lives in a dry area this soap works very well</li>
            <li> Naturally men don&#x27;t want soaps that smell like perfume or have a scent that last for hours.</li>
            <li> Sent this soap to my son in the military and it was received with much appreciation.  </li>
            <li> It is still soft next day,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too badly and smells pretty good</li>
            <li> This is a great soap because it helps to fight dry skin during cold weather months.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Dove Deep Clean.  </li>
            <li> husband has now tried the Deep Clean (pink), Extra Fresh (green), &amp; now this the Aqua Green (Impact) Dove Men Face &amp; Body Bars.&lt;br /&gt;While the deep clean version has like a skin scrub built in to remove dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The soap is very soft on hands and face and is not nearly as drying as regular soap.</li>
            <li> I like the bar, but I don&#x27;t like the way it become soft and doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> With my old soap, my face used to get really dry  after a shower</li>
            <li> I like the soap a lot but not sure it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The soap does a fine job of cleaning, but it leaves behind the smell of eggs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than other soaps, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when they discontinued that particular soap&#x27;s line because the scent was so great.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive other</li>
            <li> It is very aromatic and kind of peaceful in a way, but it also stinks weird.</li>
            <li> the old story is so far is dry you out its not true with these</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to say what exactly it smells like though.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I have found that doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin (since it contains moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> And if you live in a small apartment like I do, it manages to stink-up your entire</li>
            <li> A lot of these kinds of items are overpriced since people stuck working in remote locations often rely on places like Amazon to get basic needs to them.</li>
            <li> Strange odor but acceptable</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor point.</li>
            <li> It is strange.</li>
            <li> Only compliant is that this soap seems to dissolve faster than other soaps I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> At first I hated it because it has a sickly dead fish kind of smell.</li>
            <li> He has not had any problems with skin cracking or itchiness from dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active person I work outside this</li>
            <li> It looks and smells similar to the harsh deodorant soap he has used in the shower and on his face forever - making his face redder.</li>
            <li> Plus, the 8 count pack will last for a few months.</li>
            <li> My husbank won&#x27;t use any other soap</li>
            <li> I like Dove but will stick to the other ones (sensitive/shea butter).</li>
            <li> I discarded my eight pack due to the smell and not it&#x27;s cleaning abilities.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I run out of my other soaps.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the way your body smells after swimming in the ocean or other ocean scented products I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I like fresh smelling soaps, but this is so bad I smell like fish for an entire day.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt dry out my skin, use it all the time, year round.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these bars also don&#x27;t seem to last as long as some other soap bars that I have bought before.</li>
            <li> If the bar melts a little bit in the soap holder, the \\&quot;mush</li>
            <li> (A little esoteric humor for my radio industry bros and sisters).  </li>
            <li> It is certainly a price mark up, but not too crazy.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those select few.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to waste anything</li>
            <li> this soap has a weird smell to it, and doesnt have any of the gritty cleaning power that the other dove men soaps have.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a brand of soap that was a little cheaper than this brand, but dried my skin out, especially in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a lazy guy at that.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t seem to notice any difference or, at least, hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> Seriously, why are you even reading these reviews?</li>
            <li> Oh yea, does wonders for my skin during the chilly dry months.</li>
            <li> Actually, this soap&#x27;s bouquet--a flowery bouquet--overwhelms any order in the bathroom, in a bad way.</li>
            <li> We use well water that is very hard and this soaps up well.  </li>
            <li> Dove is the name in the game when it comes to bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because this scent is not great.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed that you cannot purchase the other scent without getting a pantry box.</li>
            <li> It smells like weird potpourri and eggs.</li>
            <li> Maybe soap is the wrong word.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> Its soap how can it be bad?</li>
            <li> I bought these because I hated smelling fruity.</li>
            <li> and i hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A lot of these kinds of items are overpriced since people stuck working in remote locations often rely on places like Amazon to get basic needs to them. It is certainly a price mark up, but not too crazy.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best soap for men. I have been using dove for men for two years. Great value, great quality, and feels good on my skin. Does not leave my skin dry, and makes me feel fresh</li>
            <li> We are a Dove household and my guys like this scent.  It&#x27;s nice but not overwhelming and the color is great.</li>
            <li> Read about it, and decided to try.  Very pleased and will purchase more when this purchase is done.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love how this soap leaves my skin feeling during the day. Have a fresh feeling right out of the shower, without too much drying. works well on face even with my sensitive (very acne prone) skin.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price! Love the scent and no nasty residue on the skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this when my local store ran out of the [[ASIN:B002TSA90W Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean, 4 Ounce, 8 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant at first because this one seemed to have more of a scent on the outside of the box. Naturally men don&#x27;t want soaps that smell like perfume or have a scent that last for hours. This soap definitely lives up to the Dove for Men brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definitely there, it&#x27;s hard to say what exactly it smells like though. The scent is more noticeable in the shower when you&#x27;re using it, but once you rinse off it&#x27;s hardly there or noticeable but it does leave enough so you smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one definitely lathers better than the Deep Clean version probably because it lacks those scrubbing beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this soap that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the same silky smooth feeling that the other Dove soaps leave, including the Deep Clean version. I don&#x27;t know if this is just an issue with the bar/batch that I&#x27;m using or if it&#x27;s a normal characteristic of this particular product, either way, I&#x27;m willing to keep using it to see if it changes plus, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I also learned that this soap does not leave blue melted marks. If the bar melts a little bit in the soap holder, the \\&quot;mush/melted\\&quot; stuff is white.</li>
            <li> My husbank won&#x27;t use any other soap</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap. It smells wonderful and also it is a great facial soap too...leaves you feeling smooth and smelling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I usually use Dove Deep Clean.  My local grocer didn&#x27;t have it so I bought this instead.  I dissolves twice as fast and I don&#x27;t appreciate the scent.</li>
            <li> Great soap, feels good on the skin and smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> Finally got my guy to use a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s care&amp;#34; product by giving this to him as a gift. It looks and smells similar to the harsh deodorant soap he has used in the shower and on his face forever - making his face redder. He doesn&#x27;t seem to notice any difference or, at least, hasn&#x27;t complained. The redness on the skin of his face is greatly reduced and his skin looks softer. Victory!</li>
            <li> used for stocking stuffers and everyone liked.</li>
            <li> Great smell and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Soap is great, just ran out but got more on the way!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Having naturally dry skin, I constantly struggle to keep my skin healthy. This soap helps tremendously with the battle.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not too overwhelming and the extra moisturizers within are great!</li>
            <li> My husband likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive other then that Good sh*t!</li>
            <li> Soap breaks down quick. Go through a bar a week-7showers a week</li>
            <li> i really like the whole Dove 4 Men line.</li>
            <li> They use to sell these at my local rite aid but stopped stocking them so I found them here and there perfect !</li>
            <li> Its soap but it is nice. It makes me think of donkeys. It does the job and makes you not smell like ass</li>
            <li> Sent this soap to my son in the military and it was received with much appreciation.  He said he loved it and requested more.</li>
            <li> My skin always gest super dry and itchy in the winter if I use regular soap. Found this stuff and it doesnt dry out my skin, use it all the time, year round. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used. I am allergic to anti-bacterial soap. I carry a bar with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Gentle, smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bottled version of the Dove Men +Care for a couple of months now and decided to try the bars instead. I love it! They lather much better than the soap and hydrate better as well. It&#x27;s also nice to be able to bring a bar with me on a trip instead of a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Seriously, why are you even reading these reviews? You&#x27;ve got bigger decisions in life to make. Just buy the soap already!</li>
            <li> I just reviewed another Dove soap and I will say the same here.  It does the job it was created to do very well, leaving you clean, your skin soft and the scent is very mild and pleasant.  I use only Dove for men products as all of them have proven to work and work well.</li>
            <li> Good, clean smell.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> Very nice very soft and very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> love the smell and doesnt dry your skin</li>
            <li> Strange odor but acceptable</li>
            <li> Have you ever been to a hotel and they have those soap bars in the shower? After you use them, your skin feels drier than sandpaper! Well, I&#x27;m hear to let you know that all soap bars are NOT created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Dove Men+Car soap bars are fantastic and long-lasting. The smell is refreshing and by no means over-powering, but more importantly, the bars leave your skin feeling soft and cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these soap bars is also quite cost-effective as they typically last between 1-2 weeks per bar and you get 8 bars for $8.25 (equates to about $1 a bar). No brainer. Dove is the name in the game when it comes to bar soaps. In Dove I trust.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Why does this soap have anything above 3 stars? Is everyone else delusional? It smells like weird potpourri and eggs. Maybe I got a bad batch or something. Either way, it was enough for my girlfriend and coworkers to notice the smell. The Dove Men + Deep Clean (or Extra Fresh) is 100x better in my opinion. I would not recommend this soap unless you want to repel people.</li>
            <li> This is very fragranced, I imagine to cover up the men&#x27;s BO. I bought this for my guy and used it myself, but it&#x27;s just really too fragranced. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference post-shower in effectiveness of this versus the regular Dove soap. I like Dove but will stick to the other ones (sensitive/shea butter).</li>
            <li> As a soap I do get clean but was surprised by strong scent. Other Dove For Men products are mild this one is not</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it does leave your skin feeling better after a shower. I find the smell appealing but its very light, you probably won&#x27;t notice it after you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, the regular Dove bar soap does a better job.  I tried this because of the manly packaging and marketing. &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34; sounds more macho than the standard &amp;#34;beauty bar with deep moisturizing&amp;#34;.  Will I buy it again?  No.</li>
            <li> I like all the various flavors of Men&#x27;s Dove Bars. Does not dry out skin like regular soap and leaves nice scent.</li>
            <li> The cost was low and it is a good soap bar. Plus, the 8 count pack will last for a few months.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap because it helps to fight dry skin during cold weather months.  You can find more videos and photos that I have posted here http://goo.gl/7gdV6q .  This really is a great value for soap and it has no strong odor.  That&#x27;s something that I dislike about many similar soaps.</li>
            <li> feel great afterwards and smells good.</li>
            <li> A refreshing and good scented soap. 1 month per bar. The moisturizing effect is also very good. I didn&#x27;t have to use a separate moisturizer at all. I loved using this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use . Get&#x27;s the job done without smelling too feminine I guess . Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great,  very clean smell and washes off clean. cant say much more about it! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap.  I bought this because it shipped free with Amazon prime.  I like the soap a lot but not sure it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Great value for this bar soap and it also has a great scent</li>
            <li> I like this.  We use well water that is very hard and this soaps up well.  Maybe soap is the wrong word. It&#x27;s probably some kind of detergent.  I wish it was available in an unscented version but that&#x27;s a minor point.</li>
            <li> Great bar of soap with a good subtle scent. This is definitely a good soap for men, wont dry out your skin but also wont leave it oily.</li>
            <li> The soap does a fine job of cleaning, but it leaves behind the smell of eggs.  I had better experiences with the 2 other Dove Men soaps:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002TSA90W Dove Care Clean Ounce Count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002TSA90W Dove Care Clean Ounce Count]]</li>
            <li> this soap has a weird smell to it, and doesnt have any of the gritty cleaning power that the other dove men soaps have.  i would get the red kind dove for men next time.  this one feels too girly.</li>
            <li> I got it through a promo and have been using it.  So far so good, so reallyl no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Great Smell lots of moisturizing (good feel after showering ) seems to last good and would buy again nice product.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, not overpowering to me.  Bar has a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; feel to it, and I clean up pretty well with it.  Skin does not appear to be drying out (I&#x27;m through 2 or 3 bars now).  Overall, I enjoy these bars and will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed that you cannot purchase the other scent without getting a pantry box. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because this scent is not great. I rather have the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product! It&#x27;s mild on the skin and it has a very nice smell. And being a women it&#x27;s not bad for me too!</li>
            <li> I like the bar, but I don&#x27;t like the way it become soft and doesn&#x27;t dry. It is still soft next day,</li>
            <li> My husband is picky. Very picky. Most products don&#x27;t make the cut, and only a select few are reordered. This is one of those select few. I&#x27;m happy with it- he smells great after a shower. The smell is manly, but not annoyingly so. Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Works Great and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too badly and smells pretty good</li>
            <li> This soap cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  The thing that I couldn&#x27;t get over was the smell, I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s something that you would have to get used to.  I discarded my eight pack due to the smell and not it&#x27;s cleaning abilities.  I&#x27;ll try a different variant of the Dove bar next time.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Very good smell and really worthable. I love it very much. Simply super&#x27;b. thanks lot.</li>
            <li> I have used all the various Dove Men+care bar soaps.  I prefer this one over the others.  It lathers better than the others and it has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good for my skin care.</li>
            <li> As good as regular Dove, but it doesn&#x27;t get all soft and mushy after several days.  Pleasant scent.  Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li> Made me clean, smells nice</li>
            <li> We really like the Dove Men + Care Deep Care better than this one. The Care Deep has a clean smell without the overpowering smell of the Aqua Impact.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  Doctors have told me that over the past many years and I&#x27;ve endured many theories from them as to how to effect a remedy.  Not only dry skin but skin prone to rashes and scales that fly when scratched.  Finally, about 20 years ago, a physician recommended that I start using Dove soap for its moisturizing and gentleness.  I did and all those problems went away.  I also switched laundry detergents to Wisk in order to better clean my clothes which also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to a store and the soap aisle, you&#x27;ll find more types or flavors of Dove soap than a radio station has on its grid rate card. (A little esoteric humor for my radio industry bros and sisters).  I&#x27;ve used this new flavor, Aqua Impact, now for about a month and can tell you it&#x27;s the best yet.</li>
            <li> This soap Smells like fish oil.  I like fresh smelling soaps, but this is so bad I smell like fish for an entire day.  Threw them all out couldn&#x27;t take it. I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive nose but this reeks!</li>
            <li> my son love the smell</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing bars for dudes!</li>
            <li> Best bar soap i have used so far. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling all dried out like most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is ok, it does not stay with you. It does however get you nice and clean, and it seems to prevent you from stinking by the end of the day. Overall it&#x27;s a good soap. What more is there to say? Happy soaping!</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Men line of products, so when I decided to try this product, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed. The soap is very soft on hands and face and is not nearly as drying as regular soap.</li>
            <li> Smells nice,  doesn&#x27;t dry the skin as much but I&#x27;ve noticed I do tend to go through the bars of soap faster, they seem far softer than other brands and cost a little more.  Maybe cheaper soap followed by using an odorless moisturizer all over would work out more economical but hey, I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m a lazy guy at that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the irish spring does.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and the person I gave it to...loves it!!</li>
            <li> My husband smells so good after he uses this soap in the shower.  He has tried all the Dove Men soaps, and he likes this one the best.  He likes the way his skin feels and smells.  He adds a little Dove Mens moisturizer and he is good to go!</li>
            <li> I know most people use shower gel now days, but if you are like me and still use a wash cloth and soap in the shower then check out this soap.  The entire Dove Men+Care line of soap is nice, but I now only buy the Aqua Impact after trying all of them.</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Good shape for handling and use.</li>
            <li> Arrived quic! Love the scent and doesn&#x27;t dry me out b</li>
            <li> I smell good when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Who would read a review for soap?</li>
            <li> I have been buying the Dove Men+Care soap for a while now.  It is the only soap I have found that doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin (since it contains moisturizer).  I love the other 2 smells that they have but had not tried this one.  Since this one was so much cheaper than the others I decided to try it, and I absolutely love the smell.  It has a very strong smell when using it, but after rinsing off it leaves a very pleasant very light scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and I don&#x27;t have to pick it up at the store equals win/win.</li>
            <li> I used to use a brand of soap that was a little cheaper than this brand, but dried my skin out, especially in the cold winter months. My brother had a bar of this that he wasn&#x27;t using (he uses body wash from another brand) and gave it to me to try. Well, I&#x27;m totally converted and will always buy this specific brand of soap. Smells really nice and leaves my combination skin feeling good. It also seems to last for a good while too. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than other soaps, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Soapy soap. Lots of bars of soap for my stinky family. It&#x27;s on the Ship n Save program. I don&#x27;t even remeber ordering this stuff it just keeps coming right around the time I need it. Smells manly too.</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers well. what more can I say? Oh yea, does wonders for my skin during the chilly dry months.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the smell of this soap.  That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Dove Aqua Impact Face &amp; Body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has now tried the Deep Clean (pink), Extra Fresh (green), &amp; now this the Aqua Green (Impact) Dove Men Face &amp; Body Bars.&lt;br /&gt;While the deep clean version has like a skin scrub built in to remove dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;The extra fresh is moisturizing &amp; smells good.&lt;br /&gt;The Aqua Green has like a cooling feel when it touches the skin &amp; has a wonderful fresh scent &amp; great moisturizing for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, this scent is the one I like the best so far too.  It has really helped his skin a lot in these colder months with drier air from heating the home, office, cars, etc.  He has not had any problems with skin cracking or itchiness from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves him clean, fresh scented &amp; moisturized after his daily shower.&lt;br /&gt;I know he likes the three he has tried but he has asked me the next time I order his cleansing bar, he wants the Dove Aqua Impact for Face &amp; Body.  (Hey, gotta save when you can these days &amp; I hope by the next time we buy it will be a choice in the Subscribe &amp; Save as the Amazon price seems to be better than my local pricing.!)</li>
            <li> In looking for a soap without too much scent, I stumbled onto this &#x27;Dove for Men&#x27; line of products and thought great! Now I can use soap that isn&#x27;t so full of perfume that I reek of it many hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in addition to a more-than-necessary-or-otherwise-warranted persistence of smell, this soap really belongs in that box of flower-shaped soaps the lady of the house might leave in the bathroom for guests. Actually, this soap&#x27;s bouquet--a flowery bouquet--overwhelms any order in the bathroom, in a bad way. And if you live in a small apartment like I do, it manages to stink-up your entire place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to smell like a guy, go with the other soaps in this line, such as the &#x27;Deep-Clean&#x27; or &#x27;Fresh&#x27; scented varieties which do not linger as this one does, and which smell altogether more manly than this perfumed soap here.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Dove Men +Care soaps.  They are gentle on the skin.  I love the &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34; scent.  It is very refreshing.  It makes the bathroom and my husband smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I misunderstood the description. I thought this was a gift box of Dove products... it&#x27;s just 8 bars of soap.</li>
            <li> was on sale so i gave it a try.  smells very nice and lasts longer than the normal dove.  i would buy again</li>
            <li> got the package about 2 weeks ago I&#x27;m going to my second soap bar the old story is so far is dry you out its not true with these I&#x27;m an active person I work outside this is just like the soap with a loofah good stuff is always coming from dove</li>
            <li> Do not like the scent of this particular product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the red ones and decided to try these.&lt;br /&gt;They are OK, I don&#x27;t use cream, so Dove soaps are cool enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap with moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue on skin. I use daily and they are cheaper here with the free shipping than locals.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, it is the only soap he uses. He has sensitive skin and this works perfectly. I also approve of the scent. :)</li>
            <li> I bought these because I hated smelling fruity. These have a good scent and it does what I need it to do, and that&#x27;s clean me.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the bars run out a little quicker than the irish spring I used to use but I like everything dove men!</li>
            <li> Its soap how can it be bad? Use it, Love it, needs some more!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y lleg&amp;oacute; en buenas condiciones, sin da&amp;ntilde;os ni problemas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people&#x27;s problem is with this; if you like soap that makes you smell CLEAN, then this is it! My boyfriend and I both use this stuff and it keeps our skin so super soft. I started using it because I liked it more than some of the other Dove bar soaps I used to use!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not the manliest thing to get soap that has a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; lotion side for your face but it really does work. With my old soap, my face used to get really dry  after a shower and i hated it. With this soap, as soon as I dry off, my face feels clean and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all. Only compliant is that this soap seems to dissolve faster than other soaps I&#x27;ve used but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Cant say enough about this soap. Great for the skin and keeps well, does not fall apart when its used up like other soaps.</li>
            <li> I got this as a body wash sample with a pack of Dove Deep Clean. In a way I like and dislike the smell of this product. I use it when I run out of my other soaps. At first I hated it because it has a sickly dead fish kind of smell. There is seaweed to it and something else that I just can&#x27;t place. I don&#x27;t like to waste anything so I kept it around in the shower. It is very aromatic and kind of peaceful in a way, but it also stinks weird. I don&#x27;t think I would ever buy it, but it is intriguing. If you don&#x27;t like the way your body smells after swimming in the ocean or other ocean scented products I wouldn&#x27;t buy it. If it comes as a sample with something else you already like try it. It is strange.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have always been hearing good things about it and now I know why? Its just like the caption says.</li>
            <li> Exact bars as you can buy in the malls. Seems cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I love DMC.. very simple.. i will keep using it as long as it is available to buy and shipped</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too strong. Keeps me clean. Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> being that he lives in a dry area this soap works very well</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a really fantastic deal and the soap&#x27;s smell has an ideal balance between smelling good without being overpowering (like Axe or Old Spice products sometimes tend to be). Unfortunately, these bars also don&#x27;t seem to last as long as some other soap bars that I have bought before. It seems like they last two weeks or so when showering once a day. However, this may be because they are not entirely made up of soap but of the moisturizing cream as well. Of course, the moisturizing cream is the best thing about this product. I used to have to spend a bit of time after showers applying lotion so that my skin didn&#x27;t get too ashy, but with this soap I only have to use lotion maybe once or twice a week as opposed to each and every day which is great. So in summary, these bars of soap smell great, are a good deal for the price, and save me some time in my daily routine each day which outweighs how quickly they run out!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of deorderant soap.</li>
            <li> Great product as always</li>
            <li> Dove is the brand. I will use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Its soap it cleans you off and smells good.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells fine (what is that other guy talking about) but the main thing is that it lathers better than the Dove extra fresh scent.  Very happy with it, doesn&#x27;t melt quickly or anything.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! The scent is fantastic and it lathers extremely well. These soaps hydrate the skin and are dermatologist approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is a division of Unilever and this particular scent, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, used to be produced by Unilever in the Lever 2000 series. I was very disappointed when they discontinued that particular soap&#x27;s line because the scent was so great. However, they have now improved on the soap / scent by including it in this hydrating bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Aqua Impact is the perfect soap! At least for me :)</li>
