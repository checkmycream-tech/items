            <li>I LOVE it and will buy again if I need to.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more experience</li>
            <li>but I think tweezers works much better.</li>
            <li>The glue is nice and the little tray to line it on is excellent.</li>
            <li>This applicator makes putting on these eyelashes quite easy.  </li>
            <li>Still trying to figure it out instructions are in Chinese but its a nice handy item</li>
            <li>Its very useful.</li>
            <li>The Blue applicator is handy and much better than trying to apply faux lashes with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for a little price.</li>
            <li>as described although I liked the color of it in the picture and when I got it it was a darker blue, which I did not like.</li>
            <li>kinda fun to use</li>
            <li>didnt grip the lashes right</li>
            <li>well while you apply the adhesive, and helps to line the lashes up right.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t even try again after the first time.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s interesting and</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of false eyelashes and this tool is just awesome.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to apply my eyelashes with this item.</li>
            <li>but it helps me put the whole lash on at once.</li>
            <li>other than that i love the idea..</li>
            <li>so the shipping time was a bit long, but if you are patient it is well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I normally use tweezers when applying my lashes</li>
            <li>I used the clear device to apply a strip of glue, put the lash in the applicator and pressed the lash band into the glue strip.  </li>
            <li>it looked old</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that I wish I hadn&#x27;t recieved a product that looked used and YEARS old.</li>

            <li> My daughter really like the applicator and its small enough to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> Also, I was expecting it to take a long time to receive my package, but it only took a week.</li>
            <li> The package it came in was STAPLED closed.</li>
            <li> The rubber stand looked aged, had a brown tint to it.</li>
            <li> but I am new to false eyelashes and still need practice.</li>
            <li> This clip was definitely sitting around for a while as the rubber where the applicator is is hard and cracked off the applicator itself.  </li>
            <li> What a help this little tool is...</li>
            <li> As if it had been in storage a few years.</li>
            <li> It works but does waste glue.  </li>
            <li> I think my eyelashes may be too stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bad at applying lashes and this product really helps.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and it broke before she got to use it :-/</li>
            <li> it was a small investment, it went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using it and had to use my hand after all anyway.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> It is hard plastic</li>
            <li> The quality is not good and the plastic not useable since the arrival</li>
            <li> im not happy with the product.. when i received the eyelash tool it was dirty</li>
            <li> so it makes it difficult to use tweezers.  </li>
            <li> This item is a must have for false lash application!</li>

            <li> No instructions came with product. Still haven&#x27;t quite figured it out.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. as described although I liked the color of it in the picture and when I got it it was a darker blue, which I did not like. tried using it but I am new to false eyelashes and still need practice. I think my eyelashes may be too stiff. they may make more flexible ones.</li>
            <li> i just recently received mine and the edges were damaged therefor  didnt grip the lashes right.. is there an exchange policy?? .. other than that i love the idea..</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and it broke before she got to use it :-/</li>
            <li> very cheaply made product.  had to throw away.</li>
            <li> This item is a must have for false lash application! Where has this been all my Life?? I LOVE it and will buy again if I need to. I would definitely recommend this item. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for a little price. It is so much easier to apply my eyelashes with this item. I love it. Also, I was expecting it to take a long time to receive my package, but it only took a week.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using it and had to use my hand after all anyway. Maybe I need more experience but I didn&#x27;t even try again after the first time.</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Was hoping this will save me time on applying my lashes but I think tweezers works much better. Overall I think it&#x27;s interesting and kinda fun to use but it isn&#x27;t a must have!</li>
            <li> What a help this little tool is...I am new to the world of false eyelashes and this tool is just awesome.  Holds the lash well while you apply the adhesive, and helps to line the lashes up right.  I often have tremors in my hands so it makes it difficult to use tweezers.  This is greatly helpful.  What a deal for the price too!  It did ship from overseas so the shipping time was a bit long, but if you are patient it is well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I would rate this seller as excellent.  Arrived as stated (ships from China, so expect a wait ). It is hard plastic so I don&#x27;t expect a lifetime of use, but with proper care it should last me awhile. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This applicator makes putting on these eyelashes quite easy.  The glue is nice and the little tray to line it on is excellent.</li>
            <li> My daughter really like the applicator and its small enough to keep in your purse. I will need to order another one because I can never get my hands on this one.</li>
            <li> Its very useful. I&#x27;m really bad at applying lashes and this product really helps. you&#x27;&#x27;ll still have to use your hands for a perfect application.</li>
            <li> The package it came in was STAPLED closed. The rubber stand looked aged, had a brown tint to it. The applicator looked fine though, and worked great it&#x27;s just that I wish I hadn&#x27;t recieved a product that looked used and YEARS old. As if it had been in storage a few years.</li>
            <li> The Blue applicator is handy and much better than trying to apply faux lashes with your fingers.  I used the clear device to apply a strip of glue, put the lash in the applicator and pressed the lash band into the glue strip.  It works but does waste glue.  I  prefer the bottle/brush glue for glue application.  Now I am eagerly awaiting the fish tail clip faux lash applicator I ordered.</li>
            <li> The quality is not good and the plastic not useable since the arrival</li>
            <li> This clip was definitely sitting around for a while as the rubber where the applicator is is hard and cracked off the applicator itself.  Thank goodness it was a small investment, it went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Great for begginers with applying eyelashes. I normally use tweezers when applying my lashes so I bought this because I thought it would be faster. Its not faster but it helps me put the whole lash on at once. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> This clip holds the lashes nicely. Very easy to use. I haven&#x27;t tried the glue applicator but the clip is why I ordered this anyway.</li>
            <li> that does&#x27;nt work very grateful that it was only a few cents as they say &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34;....</li>
