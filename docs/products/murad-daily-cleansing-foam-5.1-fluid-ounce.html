    <ol>
            <li>Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Happy with my order</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>the price was great.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning without over drying my face.</li>
            <li>It is a really good sized bottle for a face wash and the price is more than fair.</li>
            <li>and I love all murad products!</li>
            <li>and I love the foam!  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>Once you wash the product off and touch you face it clean!!</li>
            <li>Super happy .</li>
            <li>However, my best friend that has oily non sensitive skin loves it.</li>
            <li>it smells nice and light, it does not sting or feel medicinal like some face washes do and does not leave any feeling of a residue like some face washes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended this cleanser for my combination skin that is mostly oily.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff , it is cheaper on line than in stores ...</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Works great for me and I have sensitive skin, been using it for almost 10 years</li>
            <li>The pump fills perfectly the right amount needed for your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>This in combination with the skin perfecting lotion has really helped my acne prone skin, even more so during pregnancy!</li>
            <li>Murad makes great skin care products - and with the convenience of ordering with Amazon prime, my wife will not ever have to run out to refill at the last minute.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh clean scent and its gentle enough on my face but gives me a refreshing clean feeling!!!</li>
            <li>Never had a product made my skin squeaky clean</li>
            <li>so I run out of it quick.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product.</li>
            <li>Really leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Really does help clean your face well</li>
            <li>She also appreciated the gift!</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li>Really like this product and</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it to remove eye makeup specifically, but my eyes are so sensitive that even when I keep them tightly closed while washing my face, most cleansers cause them to burn.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will re-use</li>
            <li>So far I have zero complaints and would absolutely purchase again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and makes it feel smooth but not tight.</li>
            <li>This still needs to complete the three month trail.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product was too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if what I bought is the original Murad cleansing foam.</li>
            <li>and I mean squeaky clean.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but this is literally the only facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried so many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it to remove eye makeup specifically, but my eyes are so sensitive that even when I keep them tightly closed while washing my face, most cleansers cause them to burn.</li>
            <li> Murad makes great skin care products - and with the convenience of ordering with Amazon prime, my wife will not ever have to run out to refill at the last minute.</li>
            <li> Happy with my order and I love all murad products!</li>
            <li> This is terrific. Really leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> it smells nice and light, it does not sting or feel medicinal like some face washes do and does not leave any feeling of a residue like some face washes. It is a really good sized bottle for a face wash and the price is more than fair. So far I have zero complaints and would absolutely purchase again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Great price and I love the foam!  Really does help clean your face well</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I used to go to ultra every couple of Months to replenish, but I can grab it faster and cheaper from prime.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and I have sensitive skin, been using it for almost 10 years</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! The pump fills perfectly the right amount needed for your entire face and neck. I love the fresh clean scent and its gentle enough on my face but gives me a refreshing clean feeling!!! Highly recommend and will re-use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if what I bought is the original Murad cleansing foam. It may be an imitation of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 1 month and 2x/day.  It&#x27;s slowly improving my skin and reducing the pore size and oiliness.  It&#x27;s not harsh like some of the other face washes, and I have not experienced any peeling or redness.  I will continue to use this in conjunction with the T-Zone pore refining serum, weekly face steaming &amp; Elizabeth Arden clay mask.  Prior to this, I was using Dove sensitive skin soap - no special type of face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash seems to be a slow process.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my skin type as everyone is different.  Also, I use lots of sunscreen (SPF 30+) and Off Outdoors bug spray (heavy deet &amp; very greasy) every day during the summer, reapplying hourly which probably reduces the effectiveness of this facewash.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser but the bottle sucks so I run out of it quick.  Plus the bottle often brakes so the concentrated fluid sprays out not in foam form so a lot is wasted.</li>

            <li> My esthetician recommended this cleanser for my combination skin that is mostly oily. It does a great job of cleaning without over drying my face. Price on Amazon from Murad (seller) is half the price of my spa. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Never had a product made my skin squeaky clean and I mean squeaky clean. Once you wash the product off and touch you face it clean!! This still needs to complete the three month trail. Other than that its a good product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last long due to it being a foaming cleanser, but it does the job.  This in combination with the skin perfecting lotion has really helped my acne prone skin, even more so during pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I always buy this product bc it always works</li>
            <li> Love this stuff , it is cheaper on line than in stores ... Super happy .</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! Great for sensitive skin!</li>
