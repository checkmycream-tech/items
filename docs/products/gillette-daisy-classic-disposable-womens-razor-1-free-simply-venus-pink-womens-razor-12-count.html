            <li>Gillette is my favorite brand of razors and these are just anothe great product from them!</li>
            <li>Really good bargain for 4 bucks with coupon and subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>I assume this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I even used one once when I couldn&#x27;t find my good razor.</li>
            <li>but for the price, I get about 3 good uses out of each one..</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>It works great, better than the blades made for your face.</li>
            <li>Very easy and a good product.</li>
            <li>I love these razors, I have been using them for years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a pack of disposables on hand to grab one, or to take to the gym.</li>
            <li>These are easy to hold onto, feel good in your hand, and give a close shave.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but these were just a good price.</li>
            <li>they were perfectly fine -- I honestly don&#x27;t need razors to pivot or have a million blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GLAD</li>
            <li>These Daisys are just ok.</li>
            <li>I can use them more than once or twice</li>
            <li>The blades are good enough but I didn&#x27;t find anything all that great about them.  </li>
            <li>I like the Daisy that doesn&#x27;t pivot much better.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite razors for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I have used Daisy razors forever and love them.</li>
            <li>They offer a smooth and complete shave and seem to me the best low-priced razor for women.</li>
            <li>My favorite razors.</li>
            <li>I use baby oil to shave with and these are my favorite razors to use in conjunction with that product to shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for years and they are still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Amazons price is better than I can find in stores.</li>
            <li>the double blade and comfort strip make them glide and shave so smooth and quickly, and this deal was absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>I actually really liked that they were all one piece and very minimally designed (great for travel).</li>
            <li>Cheap, breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>Ok, if you&#x27;re looking for something super cheap then go ahead and buy.  </li>
            <li>egash did i hear about it when i bought these cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>Wife cut her self on them and was like &amp;#34;don&#x27;t ever get the cheap razors again&amp;#34;  9 of them ended up donated to the shelter</li>
            <li>and they are gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>I also like getting one free.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth shave as desired.</li>
            <li>and they are cheap.</li>
            <li>and they are a great basic razor.</li>
            <li>These razors don&#x27;t shave smoothly.</li>
            <li>Cheap and efficient.</li>
            <li>Saved a lot with subscribe and save, but its no longer available.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t nick and I have smooth legs for two days.</li>
            <li>These felt cheap.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a great price, lower than the big box stores.</li>
            <li>The grip on them is comfortable and they give a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t glide easily and it went duel rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Good deal, the 1 free razor in the kit is a good quality razor, but the remaining 10 feel like dull blades out of the box.</li>
            <li>My legs are always super smooth.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THESE RAZORS FOR MANY YEARS AND WOULD BE VERY PERTURBED</li>
            <li>Each razor is only good for two or three uses.</li>
            <li>they are great on the legs also, a really great bargain in a cute girly pink color, and don&#x27;t take up hardly any room when traveling.</li>
            <li>the distance between the blade and the outside is very short, making them perfect for the bikini area (which i don&#x27;t like to wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could shave perfectly and quickly with these, and a pack would last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for years, and no matter how many times I try new ones always return to my old favorite.  </li>
            <li>That is my challenge - as soon as I change my blade, my teen son steals my razor, though he has 2-3 of his own.  </li>
            <li>I actually love the pivot action for a closer shave, the moisture strip and durability.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and most razors are problematic for me.</li>
            <li>But I was looking for something that worked reasonably well even as a disposable and this just wasn&#x27;t it--even immediately after the shave felt prickly all over!</li>
            <li>so  I was dismayed when I opened my most recent package and saw they changed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using Daisy since they first came out.</li>
            <li>Great price and convenient way of purchasing a commonly used item.</li>
            <li>i love these razors for the bikini line and similar areas!</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s too much information!</li>
            <li>Scratched from the first shave.</li>
            <li>I unsubscribed from the auto-delivery program after my first delivery.</li>
            <li>They really irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>The first razor I tried the handle broke.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but not as well as the super cheap double blade disposables you can get at 10/$2 anywhere.</li>
            <li>They generally feel cheap to hold to me.  </li>
            <li>A NEW RAZOR HUNT!!</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Not as much plastic in these, as they are lighter than what you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t grow a lot of hair and my hair isn&#x27;t even course.</li>
            <li>Most of them make me feel like I&#x27;m participating in a death by a 1000 paper cuts torture ritual, so I was so pleasantly surprised when these gave as good of a shave as the more expensive, less disposable models.  </li>
            <li>the new moisturizing strip they switched to bloats and peels off much sooner</li>
            <li>The protective guards can easily come off, so be careful when handling.</li>
            <li>Not as great as the expensive razors, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Good deal but with such coarse; thick hair, these razors don&#x27;t last more than two times for legs and under arms.</li>
            <li>I love these razors for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Good price, but some were broken and</li>
            <li>Works fine, just like any other disposable razor.</li>
            <li>so I can use a new razor that&#x27;s not rusty.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure, but it really seems like the blades go dull faster too.</li>
            <li>Very soft for a disposable</li>
            <li>The price is right, but these razors have the blades at an odd angle and seem to wear out very fast.  </li>
            <li>It worked ok, I guess, but was lacking the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of my usual razor.</li>
            <li>They did not last as long as the original Daisy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The little strip that has moisturizer makes them so comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>When used regularly, Daisy razors easily eliminate all and any unwanted body hair with minimal blood and gore!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>The description doesn&#x27;t really state well that the 10 disposables only have 2 blades in each.</li>
            <li>It completely gets rid of hair with very few swipes and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Better than the other disposable razors I have used, for less cost.</li>
            <li>I would just be careful not to go too fast when shaving with them and not to reuse them.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer strip gets really slimy when wet and then sticky when it dries.</li>
            <li>They work for just as long as a disposable razor, so you are basically getting 11 blades that would normally cost over 20 dollars at walmart with reusable razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a woolly mammoth or anything; I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a bad razor.  </li>

            <li> Better than the other disposable razors I have used, for less cost.</li>
            <li> I would just be careful not to go too fast when shaving with them and not to reuse them.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strip gets really slimy when wet and then sticky when it dries.</li>
            <li> They work for just as long as a disposable razor, so you are basically getting 11 blades that would normally cost over 20 dollars at walmart with reusable razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a woolly mammoth or anything; I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a bad razor.  </li>
            <li> They are light and have small enough heads to get in tight spots.  </li>
            <li> They last me a long time.</li>
            <li> :/ Trying new ones now, but I may just start buying at a big box store because I&#x27;m so used to these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they work just as well as any of the other more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> While I really like the pivot aspect, these blades seem really dull.</li>
            <li> I usually use them for 3-4 weeks then get a new one.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pink, so they aren&#x27;t easily confused with other razors - and your significant other is likely to leave them alone.  </li>
            <li> Its too big in my hand, and is a waste.  </li>
            <li> they are not like other razors that can cut you at any corner or turn.</li>
            <li> I have never cut myself using these pink Daisy razors!</li>
            <li> They are average but they do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I never get razor burn and notice that they last for a couple weeks at least.</li>
            <li> so they are not so irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then I found them at Grocery Outlet for less price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find razors without the fluff</li>
            <li> and if one goes missing you can just grab another.  </li>
            <li> Dull for some reason.</li>
            <li> the pivot head and rubber handle are totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> (sorry ladies)</li>
            <li> (besides the fact that I always found those to be useless anyway).</li>
            <li> I felt like painting my nails afterwards, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that!</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed at the quality of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I hate those click on razor heads with 3,4,5,different blades in them.</li>
            <li> hate* having to keep up with cartridge refills, which means I need disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> However, I hated the pivot style.</li>
            <li> And, the blade was awful.  </li>
            <li> worst razors ever!</li>
            <li> terrible quality even the bonus &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; was horrible to use!</li>

            <li> I WAS HAVING A PROBLEM FINDING THESE RAZORS!!!! I TRIED NUMEROUS STORES. I&#x27;M GLAD I FOUND THEM ON AMAZON. I DON&#x27;T THINK THEY ARE BEING DISCONTINUED BUT ARE BEING UPDATED TO 3 BLADES WITH PIVOTING. I HAVE USED THESE RAZORS FOR MANY YEARS AND WOULD BE VERY PERTURBED IF I HAD TO GO ON A FIND A NEW RAZOR HUNT!! I ALWAYS GET A CLOSE, SMOOTHE AND NO NIK SHAVE. I RECOMMEND.  FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Best Razors! I have used these razors for over 20 years. Excellent product/ price!</li>
            <li> These Daisys are just ok. Not the best. Dull for some reason.</li>
            <li> Ok, if you&#x27;re looking for something super cheap then go ahead and buy.  But I was looking for something that worked reasonably well even as a disposable and this just wasn&#x27;t it--even immediately after the shave felt prickly all over!</li>
            <li> egash did i hear about it when i bought these cheap razors.  Wife cut her self on them and was like &amp;#34;don&#x27;t ever get the cheap razors again&amp;#34;  9 of them ended up donated to the shelter (sorry ladies)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find razors without the fluff so they are not so irritating to my sensitive skin. They work for just as long as a disposable razor, so you are basically getting 11 blades that would normally cost over 20 dollars at walmart with reusable razors.</li>
            <li> These are great razors at a good price. The grip on them is comfortable and they give a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors since the 80s. they were perfectly fine -- I honestly don&#x27;t need razors to pivot or have a million blades. I could shave perfectly and quickly with these, and a pack would last me a long time. I actually really liked that they were all one piece and very minimally designed (great for travel). so  I was dismayed when I opened my most recent package and saw they changed. the pivot head and rubber handle are totally unnecessary. the new moisturizing strip they switched to bloats and peels off much sooner (besides the fact that I always found those to be useless anyway). I can&#x27;t be sure, but it really seems like the blades go dull faster too. I can&#x27;t justify buying these anymore. gilette ruined them.</li>
            <li> Really good bargain for 4 bucks with coupon and subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> These are the best disposable razors I have- they are not like other razors that can cut you at any corner or turn. I can use them more than once or twice and they are gentle, but effective. Better than the other disposable razors I have used, for less cost.</li>
            <li> They are average but they do the trick.  I would just be careful not to go too fast when shaving with them and not to reuse them.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, I have been using them for years! It completely gets rid of hair with very few swipes and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years, and no matter how many times I try new ones always return to my old favorite.  They&#x27;re pink, so they aren&#x27;t easily confused with other razors - and your significant other is likely to leave them alone.  The little strip that has moisturizer makes them so comfortable to use.  Great brand and great product, though I wish they&#x27;d quit putting the \\&quot;Simply Venus\\&quot; razor in the pack.  Its too big in my hand, and is a waste.  I have a collection of them that have come in the packages that I just don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> The blades are good enough but I didn&#x27;t find anything all that great about them.  They generally feel cheap to hold to me.  I am used to regular razors with replacable blades I suppose, and going to these was rather a shock.  They are light and have small enough heads to get in tight spots.  I haven&#x27;t got cut with one yet, but they don&#x27;t glide to me- there is a strip but it never feels like it is providing moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price though - and if one goes missing you can just grab another.  That is my challenge - as soon as I change my blade, my teen son steals my razor, though he has 2-3 of his own.  It&#x27;s nice to have a pack of disposables on hand to grab one, or to take to the gym.</li>
            <li> Bought several of these for my neice and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Great if you like razor burn.  I like the Daisy that doesn&#x27;t pivot much better.</li>
            <li> A great razor for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am happy  with the job that it does as well as the price it costs. I also like getting one free.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth shave as desired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65-year-old man and I&#x27;ve been using Daisy since they first came out. No not my legs, on my face! I have really sensitive skin, Regular razors just tear my face apart. These are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I hate those click on razor heads with 3,4,5,different blades in them. you can&#x27;t get a close trim in on your beard. My wife started using them about 10 years ago when she tried mine. Now I only buy them  20 to 40 at a time. Amazon has the best price and of course prime delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great price and convenient way of purchasing a commonly used item.</li>
            <li> i love these razors for the bikini line and similar areas! the double blade and comfort strip make them glide and shave so smooth and quickly, and this deal was absolutely wonderful! the distance between the blade and the outside is very short, making them perfect for the bikini area (which i don&#x27;t like to wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sorry if that&#x27;s too much information! they are great on the legs also, a really great bargain in a cute girly pink color, and don&#x27;t take up hardly any room when traveling. thank you!</li>
            <li> The price is right, but these razors have the blades at an odd angle and seem to wear out very fast.  I&#x27;m not a woolly mammoth or anything; I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a bad razor.  It does the job, but not as well as the super cheap double blade disposables you can get at 10/$2 anywhere.</li>
            <li> Like these razors. Don&#x27;t nick and cut my legs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Daisy disposables for years.  I signed up for auto-delivery of these and I was disappointed at the quality of the razor.  I held it up along side one I purchased in a brick and mortar store and the difference was noticeable. The handle is shorter and flimsy.  Not as much plastic in these, as they are lighter than what you buy in the store.  And, the blade was awful.  Scratched from the first shave. I unsubscribed from the auto-delivery program after my first delivery.</li>
            <li> Best deal for razors on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not so great they really don&#x27;t do a good job. I really don&#x27;t grow a lot of hair and my hair isn&#x27;t even course. Won&#x27;t be buying these again</li>
            <li> Great product! This is one of my favorite razors for many reasons. I actually love the pivot action for a closer shave, the moisture strip and durability. My legs are always super smooth.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Not as great as the expensive razors, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I can&#x27;t find these in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> These work great and they are cheap. I buy these razors every time.</li>
            <li> I *hate* having to keep up with cartridge refills, which means I need disposable razors.  Most of them make me feel like I&#x27;m participating in a death by a 1000 paper cuts torture ritual, so I was so pleasantly surprised when these gave as good of a shave as the more expensive, less disposable models.  These are easy to hold onto, feel good in your hand, and give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have used Daisy razors forever and love them. However, I hated the pivot style. They did not last as long as the original Daisy&#x27;s. Cut my legs all up! I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> They are razors...they do what they are suppose to do...each one lasts quite a bit before dulling. They last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Substitutes have caused burning, unlike these.  They offer a smooth and complete shave and seem to me the best low-priced razor for women.</li>
            <li> Good deal, the 1 free razor in the kit is a good quality razor, but the remaining 10 feel like dull blades out of the box. You get what you pay for and I knew coming into this that I didn&#x27;t expect great quality.</li>
            <li> everything as described</li>
            <li> Yuck!  The lubricant is slimy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and use this for shaving my head bald. It works great, better than the blades made for your face.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. I just throw one in my makeup case and take it with me to my destination then throw it away when I am done.</li>
            <li> Good and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Good deal but with such coarse; thick hair, these razors don&#x27;t last more than two times for legs and under arms.</li>
            <li> Great deal and this will be a stocking stuffer for one of my granddaughters!</li>
            <li> Cheap, breaks easily. The moisturizer strip gets really slimy when wet and then sticky when it dries. Each razor is only good for two or three uses.</li>
            <li> YIKES!!!  They are all 2 blade except the 1 extra one.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  Then I found them at Grocery Outlet for less price.</li>
            <li> When used regularly, Daisy razors easily eliminate all and any unwanted body hair with minimal blood and gore! You go Daisy Razors! Good job!</li>
            <li> These were posted on a deal site and I thought that I&#x27;d jump on it via Subscribe and Save. I placed some of them in my daughters&#x27; bathroom and our bathroom. The ladies used them and I heard nothing. I assume this is a good thing. I even used one once when I couldn&#x27;t find my good razor. It worked ok, I guess, but was lacking the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of my usual razor. I felt like painting my nails afterwards, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that!</li>
            <li> worst razors ever! terrible quality even the bonus &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; was horrible to use!</li>
            <li> While I really like the pivot aspect, these blades seem really dull. Acceptable I suppose, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling!!</li>
            <li> I have never cut myself using these pink Daisy razors! I&#x27;ve used them for years and they are a great basic razor. I usually use them for 3-4 weeks then get a new one. Very easy and a good product.</li>
            <li> Very soft for a disposable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these razors in stores before but they had 3 blades instead of 2. The description doesn&#x27;t really state well that the 10 disposables only have 2 blades in each. I would&#x27;ve purchased something else.</li>
            <li> These razors don&#x27;t shave smoothly. They really irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Works fine, just like any other disposable razor. Nothing special, but these were just a good price.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors. Cheap and efficient. I&#x27;ve used these for years and they work just as well as any of the other more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> I use baby oil to shave with and these are my favorite razors to use in conjunction with that product to shave.  Gillette is my favorite brand of razors and these are just anothe great product from them!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and most razors are problematic for me. The Daisy is the best disposable on the market.</li>
            <li> I love these razors for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Not the BEST razors.. but for the price, I get about 3 good uses out of each one.. They will last longer, but it won&#x27;t be as close a shave. Saved a lot with subscribe and save, but its no longer available. :/ Trying new ones now, but I may just start buying at a big box store because I&#x27;m so used to these.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and they are still my favorite. They don&#x27;t nick and I have smooth legs for two days.</li>
            <li> These felt cheap. The first razor I tried the handle broke. I didn&#x27;t like how the razor felt on my skin, it didn&#x27;t glide easily and it went duel rather quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good deal. I don&#x27;t use razors that often. So I rather  have disposables so I can use a new razor that&#x27;s not rusty. Amazons price is better than I can find in stores.</li>
            <li> Good price, but some were broken and I guess you pay for the quality you want. Next time I will buy some of the 3 or 4 blade kinds and use a coupon.</li>
            <li> Amazon had a great price, lower than the big box stores. I never get razor burn and notice that they last for a couple weeks at least. The protective guards can easily come off, so be careful when handling.</li>
            <li> Acceptable product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for packing when travelling!</li>
