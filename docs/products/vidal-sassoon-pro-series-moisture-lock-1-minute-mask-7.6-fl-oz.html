    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>As for adding a mask to it the way a hair mask should do, Its not the best one I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>This is the best you can get</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>And the price is great as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product but was honestly suspicious since it&#x27;s quite cheap.&lt;br /&gt;After putting it on my hair and leaving it in for 2 hours (watched a movie during this time), when i went in the shower to rinse it out, my hair was AMAZINGLY silky and incredibly</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it !!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I tried it yesterday and now I think I&#x27;m in love with my hair!</li>
            <li>Also it seems to help amazingly with shaving.</li>
            <li>How can something so cheap be so good?</li>
            <li>but it FEELS more brittle, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>but you need to use more.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li>but dang, it was like it turned it to straw real quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a glazing mask..</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft, smooth, and smell great!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i thought its way better than the vidal sassoon conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair looks like I just did Brazilian blowout or smth better.</li>
            <li>I find that using a homemade olive oil and yogurt mask works better for my hair, even though it takes a bit more time.</li>
            <li>The 1 minute mask, was just ok.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would be great.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Truly an awesome extra good conditioner for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>but hey, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>and  it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>It is conditioning, and smells ok (that is, it doesn&#x27;t smell much at all) but is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t think it has true nutrient properties based on the ingredients..</li>
            <li>the difference between the two - the conditioner has a lot more and much cheaper than the mask.</li>
            <li>but rather buy the conditioner instead much cheaper and has a lot more</li>
            <li>straight like I just straighten then and super shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would HIGHLY reccommend this, it&#x27;s even better than some Professional Salon brands, and who can beat this price for the quality?</li>
            <li>I was anticipating more of a conditioning cream, especially because it comes in a canister type container rather than a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how this was going to work on my fine hair especially with the low price I purchased it at.</li>
            <li>Very shiny results.</li>
            <li>This product is very runny.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll create problems for people who&#x27;re very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But with this hair mask, my hair is still very silky even though I didn&#x27;t do anything this morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Not as thick as a hair mask should be, a little like the quality of Gigi Products (not the best of quality), but it did condition the hair as well as get out my knots.</li>
            <li>and I only paid a little more than a buck for it.</li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t really stick to my hair, and it didn&#x27;t make any lasting change to my hair.</li>
            <li>This is just wow.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks shiny after using this.</li>
            <li>; it makes individual strands lay better but overall, my hair feels mush more rough or coarse; not smooth or soft.</li>
            <li>I have unnaturaly thick hair and this product makes it much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Same as the Vidal Sassoon Extreme Smooth Shampoo</li>
            <li>I like it fine, but I usually keep it in for about three to four minutes instead of one minute.</li>
            <li>hair hasnt felt this soft in an extremely long</li>
            <li>Compared to the Intense Moisture mask product I used before (BCX), this one is a little watery--still works</li>

            <li> I have really dry, course and colored hair (blonde).</li>
            <li> I used this product until it was empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it as extremely moisturizing...</li>

            <li> you are not sure, maybe give it a try!</li>
            <li> We had put up a pool the week before and the chlorine had done really creepy things to my hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve alternated with the Sebastian Potion 9, as this is a rinse out product. Very shiny results.</li>
            <li> Same as the Vidal Sassoon Extreme Smooth Shampoo; it makes individual strands lay better but overall, my hair feels mush more rough or coarse; not smooth or soft. It LOOKS smoother b/c there are less frizzies but it FEELS more brittle, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This product is very runny.  I was anticipating more of a conditioning cream, especially because it comes in a canister type container rather than a bottle.  It should have been in a bottle; it felt like trying to scoop up regular conditioner with your fingers.  It is conditioning, and smells ok (that is, it doesn&#x27;t smell much at all) but is nothing special.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Does the job. That&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. The scent is pleasing, and it stays on your hair a little bit after you wash it off. It&#x27;s not strong, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll create problems for people who&#x27;re very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Compared to the Intense Moisture mask product I used before (BCX), this one is a little watery--still works okay, but you need to use more. Well given the price (I got it with a coupon so it was only $3) nothing to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting it on, and either wrap up your hair with a towel or enclose them in a bathcap, and wait for 15 to 20 minutes before washing it off. It seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like a conditioner to me. The smell didn&#x27;t really stick to my hair, and it didn&#x27;t make any lasting change to my hair. It helped detangle, but not more than that. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! I purchased it couple days ago when there was a $2 off coupon and I only paid a little more than a buck for it. I tried it yesterday and now I think I&#x27;m in love with my hair! I have really thin and fragile hair, never really smooth and silky even with leave in. But with this hair mask, my hair is still very silky even though I didn&#x27;t do anything this morning.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure, maybe give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a  whim because I found it on clearance for $3. We had put up a pool the week before and the chlorine had done really creepy things to my hair. I was blessed with a lot of silky blonde hair but dang, it was like it turned it to straw real quick. I used this, left it in for 2 minutes, combed though and it was like the damage never even happened. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t think it has true nutrient properties based on the ingredients.. it&#x27;s more like a glazing mask.. but for the price and quickness of it.. I have no complaints. I will still use some argon oil on my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong. :( I don&#x27;t see it as extremely moisturizing...but hey, it&#x27;s cheap. But I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it !!!</li>
            <li> I have unnaturaly thick hair and this product makes it much more manageable. Also it seems to help amazingly with shaving.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve never only left it in for a minute, I always let it sit for ten or twenty minutes before I wash it out. It makes my hair feel really soft, smooth, and smell great!</li>
            <li> How can something so cheap be so good? Now I understand why this product currently has 5*s which is why I&#x27;ve chosen it. Recommended to all.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as a hair mask should be, a little like the quality of Gigi Products (not the best of quality), but it did condition the hair as well as get out my knots. As for adding a mask to it the way a hair mask should do, Its not the best one I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.  Truly an awesome extra good conditioner for dry scalp.  I even use it on my beard and helps keep my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this was going to work on my fine hair especially with the low price I purchased it at. It makes my hair soft and smells very nice. I use it almost everyday and I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Leave it in between one and three minutes once or twice a week and  it works fabulously.</li>
            <li> i thought its way better than the vidal sassoon conditioner but they just work the same and consistency is the same as well. the difference between the two - the conditioner has a lot more and much cheaper than the mask. I wont buy it anymore but rather buy the conditioner instead much cheaper and has a lot more cause they just work the same</li>
            <li> This is just wow. My hair looks like I just did Brazilian blowout or smth better. No frizz silky straight like I just straighten then and super shiny. I don&#x27;t remembered  other mask that gave these kinda results! And believe me I tried a lot, and much more expensive. So for 5 bucks??? This is the best you can get</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy, frizzy, long hair. This product works great! My hair feels soft and looks shiny after using this. I can tell the difference immediately when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. And the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> I like it fine, but I usually keep it in for about three to four minutes instead of one minute.</li>
            <li> I used this product until it was empty. It only lasted about four weeks using it twice a week. I do have thick, moderately long hair. I didn&#x27;t find it did much for my hair. It just seemed like a thick conditioner to me. I find that using a homemade olive oil and yogurt mask works better for my hair, even though it takes a bit more time.</li>
            <li> The 1 minute mask, was just ok. I was really hoping it would be great. I use the vidal sassoon shampoo and conditioner(pro series). I thought my hair felt the same as just using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, course and colored hair (blonde). I bought this product but was honestly suspicious since it&#x27;s quite cheap.&lt;br /&gt;After putting it on my hair and leaving it in for 2 hours (watched a movie during this time), when i went in the shower to rinse it out, my hair was AMAZINGLY silky and incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;My hair hasnt felt this soft in an extremely long time.&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair air dry without putting any extra products in it, and the next morning when i woke up, it felt like heaven.&lt;br /&gt;Would HIGHLY reccommend this, it&#x27;s even better than some Professional Salon brands, and who can beat this price for the quality?</li>
