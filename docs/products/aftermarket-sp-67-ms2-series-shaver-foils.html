    <ol>
            <li>We are very happy with the price of foils.  </li>
            <li>The foil, fits perfectly onto the razor.  </li>
            <li>This works, and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li>Good product !!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>So I ordered these shaver foils (best price I saw--got good delivery speed too).  </li>
            <li>these are a great screen almost a year on one set</li>
            <li>Remington always make a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product , great price</li>
            <li>Very thoughtful and very intelligent.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit and performance.</li>
            <li>Good business.</li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>I bought a good non-complicated Norelco razor from Amazon and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED.  </li>
            <li>So nice to find just the foils .</li>
            <li>It was very easy to change after looking on YouTube on how to change it.</li>
            <li>good product and fine service, and quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to replace just the needed parts</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t fit perfectly and you&#x27;ll hear a louder than normal vibration noise when using.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the foils wear out more than the cutters.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll pay more the authentic versions, but they&#x27;ll save you money in the end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the foils that take the beating, so need to be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>My experience with These foils was that they worked ok</li>
            <li>When I bought these I thought they didn&#x27;t shave as close and dragged more than the orignals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they are okay.  </li>
            <li>They came real quick.  </li>
            <li>Price was right, delivery was quick, it fit the shaver, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I found if I use Shaver Saver often on the blades that this foil works much better, catch free.</li>
            <li>very affordable and good product as replacement</li>
            <li>I appreciate the price and speed of the replacements and they work fine.</li>
            <li>or they&#x27;re a cheap look-alike.</li>
            <li>Cheap, but with a catch.</li>
            <li>They fit.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good until I need the next set!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, item as described.</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and quick response.</li>
            <li>As I said this is an exact replacement part and seems to be of the same quality, good price and buy.</li>
            <li>THE OLD FOIL COMES OUT THE TOP OF THE HEAD, AND THE NEW ONE GOES IN THE TOP.  </li>
            <li>and these are worth buying.</li>
            <li>Found these and figure it was worth the risk after reading some 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I did far better at replacing them  than whoever put them on my razor the first time.  </li>
            <li>It is repackaged but new, and works fine.</li>
            <li>I was careful, and able to maneuver the new ones in through the top of the head.</li>
            <li>The old ones didn&#x27;t really snap out, but the new ones kind of snapped in.    </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thicker and wears longer than original Remmington foils but does not shave near as close.</li>
            <li>great cost...have not used because I decided to buy new saver....will use as I have in the past</li>
            <li>But I had nothing to lose except a damaged head with a large hole in it.</li>
            <li>Have used these before and found that although they take a little while to bed in, and never get to shave quite as closely as the Remington genuine foils, they are kind to the skin and last way longer the OE foils.</li>
            <li>It is gratifying to buy the foils separately from the cutters, as they wear out much sooner that the cutters, thus being a saving in cost..</li>
            <li>The seller delivered  the foils fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to make life much easier for myself</li>
            <li>PRICING WAS REASONABLE...</li>
            <li>Very convenient and the cheapest price around.</li>
            <li>and if you shave too fast it will punish you by pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>these last longer than the original equipment and others I have purchased from others ...</li>
            <li>After buying the new OEM Reminton screens and trying them, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li>been ordering these particular foils for years now.  </li>
            <li>The foils look like the real thing, but when you use them, it&#x27;s clear that they don&#x27;t meet std quality specifications.</li>
            <li>The foils did not fit correctly and they pull out more hairs than they cut.</li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t know that it helped, but I pulled the 2 rubber thingies off the end of the one I was removing, that gave it some wiggle-room, and in a few minutes I had the foil pulled out of the top of the head.  </li>
            <li>Here we have a company providing only what we need and just the right price.</li>
            <li>They must wear into each other to fit, and I know from years of experience that replacing just one of the two will never yield satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>To install the new ones I DID NOT remove the rubber off the new ones.  </li>
            <li>They are new.  </li>
            <li>when the new shavers foils wear out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new razor.</li>
            <li>Always buy the new foil AND cutter set together.</li>
            <li>It is just what I needed and it makes my Shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>Most places only carry SP-69 which includes the cutters and is more expensive.    </li>
            <li>Took a while to figure out how to get the old foils off to replace them.</li>
            <li>(I couldn&#x27;t do a side by side comparison because my old ones had a hole worn in them.)</li>
            <li>They work well with my shaver, and last about normal...</li>
            <li>Finding foils for my old razor is getting more difficult.  </li>
            <li>I wish that I had gotten the Norelco first and not put up with all the trouble from the Remington.</li>
            <li>After being able to do a side by side comparison, (I actually shaved half my face with each), I can say there is a very little difference</li>

            <li> foils are stiff in their mount, as opposed to floating as the REAL Remington Parts do.</li>
            <li> was not very good,  cheaply made, did not last long, had to replace after a few months.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on durability.</li>
            <li> And they do seem to wear long.</li>
            <li> Slow mitigates the speed of the normal electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The poor fit results in excessive friction from the cutter on the foil, which eventually results in tears in the foil (and cuts on your face, if you don&#x27;t notice it).</li>
            <li> It takes about half an hour extra to shave with this</li>
            <li> They are hard to get now because the razer is a old one.  </li>
            <li> These Shaver Foils are needed to replace every other month or so and are not   available at the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> gets holes in it after a few months; tired of using electric blades; shifted to regular shave every other day</li>
            <li> Received these foils and they were not original Remington parts as described.</li>
            <li> and I shave everyday sometimes twice ...</li>
            <li> There is also a large gap between the plastic and the metal foil, which leads to hair being pulled into it and plucked out painfully, instead of being cut</li>
            <li> Usually the kits have the blades and the foils.</li>
            <li> Hard to find just the foils for the MS-2 Remington.</li>
            <li> To reduce this I have to shave verrrry slowly.</li>
            <li> Work well with the razor and greatly decreased the razor burn that had crept into my shaves over the past month or two.</li>
            <li> In 2-3 other cases, one of the foils pulled away from the foil frame within one use and was worthless.</li>
            <li> I finally noticed that the cutters do not travel all the way to the ends of the screens thus the non cutting holes pull hairs!!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be sorry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too sad that this is described in the title as a Remington part when it is not.</li>
            <li> Just got a refurbished  razor--and found to my dismay, that Remington doesn&#x27;t do ANY factory refurbs or warrent any, and I had a razor with bad foils.  </li>
            <li> These are the worst I have used.</li>

            <li> It is gratifying to buy the foils separately from the cutters, as they wear out much sooner that the cutters, thus being a saving in cost..</li>
            <li> We had no problems with the seller.  We are very happy with the price of foils.  They are hard to get now because the razer is a old one.  The seller delivered  the foils fast.</li>
            <li> White box package of Remington Shaver foils. No documentation or instructions included. Perfect fit and performance. Shipping and handling charges offset savings. I would purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> Received the foils within 5 days of placing the order.  Work well with the razor and greatly decreased the razor burn that had crept into my shaves over the past month or two. Would order from them again!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, item as described. Took a while to figure out how to get the old foils off to replace them. I finally found a link (can&#x27;t remember where) to a site with a photo of some instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the foils wear out more than the cutters. These are labeled as a \\&quot;Remington\\&quot; product, but either they&#x27;re Remington rejects or they&#x27;re a cheap look-alike. The foils look like the real thing, but when you use them, it&#x27;s clear that they don&#x27;t meet std quality specifications. The don&#x27;t fit perfectly and you&#x27;ll hear a louder than normal vibration noise when using. The poor fit results in excessive friction from the cutter on the foil, which eventually results in tears in the foil (and cuts on your face, if you don&#x27;t notice it). In 2-3 other cases, one of the foils pulled away from the foil frame within one use and was worthless. In the end, stay away from these!! You&#x27;ll pay more the authentic versions, but they&#x27;ll save you money in the end.</li>
            <li> This razor foil, works well with my Remington Razor.  The foil, fits perfectly onto the razor.  Thanks.  A+ seller. Good business.</li>
            <li> These Shaver Foils are needed to replace every other month or so and are not   available at the stores anymore. I appreciate the price and speed of the replacements and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Shaver foils have to be replaced constantly and it&#x27;s a shame we have to buy for the pocket with the foils plus blades when we don&#x27;t need the blades since those don&#x27;t get ruined that soon. Here we have a company providing only what we need and just the right price. Very thoughtful and very intelligent.</li>
            <li> I have a Remington razor, and one of the foils tore. It would cut my face, so the razor was unusable until I got them replaced. This works, and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are the worst I have used. They tend to grab and pull some of the wiskers. This is painfull. To reduce this I have to shave verrrry slowly. Slow mitigates the speed of the normal electric shaver. I would never buy them again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find just the foils for the MS-2 Remington. Most places only carry SP-69 which includes the cutters and is more expensive.    Product delivered quickly. It is repackaged but new, and works fine.</li>
            <li> So nice to find just the foils . Usually the kits have the blades and the foils. It&#x27;s the foils that take the beating, so need to be replaced more often. Tnanks.</li>
            <li> Received these foils and they were not original Remington parts as described. The foils did not fit correctly and they pull out more hairs than they cut. I finally noticed that the cutters do not travel all the way to the ends of the screens thus the non cutting holes pull hairs!! Do not buy unless you like pain!!</li>
            <li> these last longer than the original equipment and others I have purchased from others ... these are a great screen almost a year on one set and I shave everyday sometimes twice ...</li>
            <li> Remington always make a great product.</li>
            <li> Came apart soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> My experience with These foils was that they worked ok but they wore out all the time. But the Remington ones wore out too. So I decided to make life much easier for myself and I bought a triple head Norelco razor. I wish that I had gotten the Norelco first and not put up with all the trouble from the Remington. I bought a good non-complicated Norelco razor from Amazon and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> When I bought these I thought they didn&#x27;t shave as close and dragged more than the orignals. (I couldn&#x27;t do a side by side comparison because my old ones had a hole worn in them.) I wrote a review saying these worked, but I was going back to the originals.  After buying the new OEM Reminton screens and trying them, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference so I put these back in. After being able to do a side by side comparison, (I actually shaved half my face with each), I can say there is a very little difference and these are worth buying. I&#x27;ll get them again.</li>
            <li> Just got a refurbished  razor--and found to my dismay, that Remington doesn&#x27;t do ANY factory refurbs or warrent any, and I had a razor with bad foils.  So I ordered these shaver foils (best price I saw--got good delivery speed too).  I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED.  My only concern is a lack of instructions.  But in 15 minutes I had the damaged one replaced and was using my razor.  I did far better at replacing them  than whoever put them on my razor the first time.  Only hint I can give--I don&#x27;t know that it helped, but I pulled the 2 rubber thingies off the end of the one I was removing, that gave it some wiggle-room, and in a few minutes I had the foil pulled out of the top of the head.  THE HINT: THE OLD FOIL COMES OUT THE TOP OF THE HEAD, AND THE NEW ONE GOES IN THE TOP.  Next time I&#x27;ll try to see if I can get the damaged one off without removing the rubber ends.  But I had nothing to lose except a damaged head with a large hole in it. To install the new ones I DID NOT remove the rubber off the new ones.  I was careful, and able to maneuver the new ones in through the top of the head. The old ones didn&#x27;t really snap out, but the new ones kind of snapped in.    WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t advertised as &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; on Amazon.  Thicker and wears longer than original Remmington foils but does not shave near as close.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but with a catch. It catches and pulls sometimes! Debating whether to reorder. I found if I use Shaver Saver often on the blades that this foil works much better, catch free. And they do seem to wear long. But if I don&#x27;t lube the blades a couple times a week, I will start to get bit.</li>
            <li> Great product , great price I would recommend it to anyone. Nice to be able to replace just the needed parts</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I&#x27;m sure they are okay.  Blah, blah, blah.  They came real quick.  The package looked alright.  They are new.  They fit.</li>
            <li> Finding foils for my old razor is getting more difficult.  Nobody local carried them anymore so I looked on Amazon.  Found these and figure it was worth the risk after reading some 1 star reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months and they seem to work just like the name brand foils I use to get at Wally World.  I&#x27;ll buy again, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Have used these before and found that although they take a little while to bed in, and never get to shave quite as closely as the Remington genuine foils, they are kind to the skin and last way longer the OE foils.</li>
            <li> Can&amp;#34;t beat the price</li>
            <li> been ordering these particular foils for years now.  They work well with my shaver, and last about normal... Good product !!</li>
            <li> there not Remington just a cheep knock off and they pop out when shaving there not even usable don&#x27;t wast your money and time you&#x27;ll be sorry</li>
            <li> This shaver screen for my Remington shaver meets all expectations.  Price was right, delivery was quick, it fit the shaver, and it works great.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on durability.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised........great cost...have not used because I decided to buy new saver....will use as I have in the past when the new shavers foils wear out</li>
            <li> was not very good,  cheaply made, did not last long, had to replace after a few months.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USED THESE SHAVER REPLACEMENT FOILS YET...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT THEM AS A SPARE...PRICING WAS REASONABLE...HOPE THEY ARE QUALITY AND NOT JUNK FOILS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY SPEEDY SERVICE...</li>
            <li> very affordable and good product as replacement</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor. Very convenient and the cheapest price around. Fits  no problem in my Remington Titanium MS 280. Works fantastic. I&#x27;m good until I need the next set! Great! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Well packaged and quick response. Good Product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> gets holes in it after a few months; tired of using electric blades; shifted to regular shave every other day</li>
            <li> RAZOR DID NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS IT DID WITH THE FOIL WHICH WAS REPLACED.&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE OF THIS i NO LONGER USE THIS RAZOR......</li>
            <li> Even those these are being sold as \\&quot;Remington\\&quot; parts, they are NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foils are stiff in their mount, as opposed to floating as the REAL Remington Parts do. There is also a large gap between the plastic and the metal foil, which leads to hair being pulled into it and plucked out painfully, instead of being cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too sad that this is described in the title as a Remington part when it is not.</li>
            <li> Always buy the new foil AND cutter set together. Noever buy just the foil or just the cutter head.  They must wear into each other to fit, and I know from years of experience that replacing just one of the two will never yield satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> good product and fine service, and quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I pierced my foil and replaced it with this set.  It was very easy to change after looking on YouTube on how to change it.</li>
            <li> As I said this is an exact replacement part and seems to be of the same quality, good price and buy.</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed and it makes my Shaver work like new. When these wear out, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It takes about half an hour extra to shave with this and if you shave too fast it will punish you by pulling your hair.</li>
