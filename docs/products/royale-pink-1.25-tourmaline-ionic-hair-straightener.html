            <li>so I was really thrilled about using it.</li>
            <li>glad it looked at the original website before jumping on this  purchase!!</li>
            <li>Like most I saw at the mall, they curled my pin straight hair beautifully with this straighter.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my teenage daughter who praises this as the best hair straightener she has ever owned.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $20 on it as it pulled on my hair instead of gliding through.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>and they both love them.</li>
            <li>:) Would I reccommend it?</li>
            <li>Yeah, but if you have the money to buy something better, go for it.</li>
            <li>The room  and my hair didnt smell like fire and my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>however they aren&#x27;t even authentic</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE it</li>
            <li>But, the fact that I was able to put this guy on full heat and gave it time to warm up but still was able to touch the plates with no issues is baffling.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It straightens hair pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair easily (without burning it)</li>
            <li>I have tried many other straighteners and this is one of the best for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and good quality, Thanks again !!!</li>
            <li>I have paid as much as $250 for a royale straightener before and this one worked every bit as good.</li>
            <li>Product was as described, easy to use and my hair didn&#x27;t feel fried afterwords.</li>
            <li>When I first received this straightener, I was thrilled with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>She had to have it - and when I went into the mall to buy it for her - the price was $150.00 - with a free hair sheen product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say $30 is about the right price, but don&#x27;t pay any more</li>
            <li>This straightener is nothing special.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I got a defective one and this isn&#x27;t true for all.</li>
            <li>The envy of all her friends and we got it at a super deal.</li>
            <li>I have very unruly, wiry hair with natural waves, so I need a straightener that can handle that and give me good results.</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve never bought it in the first place!</li>
            <li>it leave your here looking very shiny and smooth .</li>
            <li>It WILL NOT compare to anything like a Babyliss, but hey if you&#x27;re a broke college student like me, it will be worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I normally go for the cheap ones in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the amazon mobile UPC app numerous times - and have been nothing but satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used a Sedu and a Babyliss Titanium flat iron and it works waaaaaaaayyyy better for straightening hair.</li>
            <li>Please be careful when purchasing this item that you are satisfied with your return policy and also from a safety perspective please be aware that this happened and the company offered no apology whatsoever for either my injury nor the faulty product.</li>
            <li>It certainly gets my hair straight, but it also catches my hair on the corner and breaks strands off each time I use it.</li>
            <li>and it is stick straight in the morning.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t the salon quality they like to advertise.</li>
            <li>I then came on amazon (much cheaper) and bought 2 as gifts for my sisters...</li>
            <li>and it was completely straight.</li>
            <li>I am very upset</li>
            <li>but i expected it was going to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one of these at one of the stands in the middle of the mall (ridiciulously overpriced).</li>
            <li>Probably will just stick to my hot tools curling iron for soft curls.</li>
            <li>I really needed healthy because i have had back to back children and my hair has taken a toll.</li>
            <li>im sure thinner hair would take less time.</li>
            <li>Both sets were the &#x27;Classic Diamond&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>you may as well buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I had to go purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>My set worked well on my hair however not any better than a rival product which I had used without incident for the past 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I was so sad because I LOVED it so much, how it left my curly~wavy hair looking  Shiny,smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>and it stopped heating up completely.</li>
            <li>I have naturally CURLY hair</li>
            <li>I have natural botticelli curls that go down to the middle of my back, normal thickness and after air drying my hair, I was able to straighten my hair in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Some of us do have wonderful hair but the other half I like to call, the is Serious nap.</li>
            <li>These are not the real Royale flat irons I have the real ones and ordered these to have an extra pair</li>
            <li>The first one stopped heating and the second one had a short in the cord.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the Serum was a little different than the one the lady used on my head at the mall, but nevertheless it made my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>After owning the Royale 1.5 before, I was wanting to purchase another one but didn&#x27;t want to pay $150 for a new one as I had before at the Local Mall.</li>
            <li>I am of caribbean decent (not that pretty carribbean, that nap of all naps no flat iron or relaxer can tame</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sent 2 back so far.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I only had to pass over my hair once</li>
            <li>Since my hair is halfway down my back and pretty thick, this issue is pretty much unavoidable unless I have the time to go super slowly (which takes 2-3 times longer than my normal routine - who has time for that?).  </li>
            <li>I telephoned the company directly who said that they would replace them but only if I paid the postage AND an extra $20 to them so that they could run tests on them to find out the cause of the damage.</li>
            <li>, This is the same exact Royale as the one I purchased at the mall, only paid $49 for it and purchased 2 of them, one for me and the other for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Also because its so hot, which i did kinda like, it dried out my hair and caused it to be brittle.</li>

            <li> Also because its so hot, which i did kinda like, it dried out my hair and caused it to be brittle.</li>
            <li> Usually with uneven hair the roots dont get straigten to easy you have to pass and pass over it.</li>
            <li> This was the second flat iron that I have ever bought in my life</li>
            <li> so I bought the whole line of products that she offered which included two flat irons (big and small), shampoo, conditioner, and the Royale serum.</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron</li>
            <li> and it has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> After using my flat iron for 9months it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with it in the past not getting hot enough</li>
            <li> and i barely used it because I hated how I had to scorch my hair to get it straight as with many other straighting products.</li>
            <li> So I went on a search after watching a few reviews on youtube, and heard several ladies mention how they had purchased theirs on Amazon,the price they had paid and how it was the same one as the one they sale at the malls.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of these straightners at my local mall less than 5 weeks ago one for me and the other for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Royale Pink 1.25&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Because it is 100% ceramic,you have to be careful because it can break a lot easier than ones that are with other things.</li>
            <li> Although it has a five year warranty, we are not willing to pay the shipping costs and $20 fee for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Having used it for the first time, I was not nearly as impressed as the demonstration at the mall, I can get a curl but it falls out immeiadetly.</li>
            <li> kinda small and takes a little extra time to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I can purchase comparable brand for less money that will last at least two years.</li>
            <li> When I saw it here less than half the price I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my iPhone and scanned the UPC code on the device and found it on Amazon for less than $35.00.</li>
            <li> My previous had drop onto my tile floor and broke</li>
            <li> I have had my straigtners last me at least four to five years in the past</li>
            <li> I had this product for a little over two years</li>
            <li> I ordered it immediately from my phone and told my daughter it would arrive in a few days - her not understanding why she couldn&#x27;t have immediately - I mubbled something about the boxes being a marketing gimmick - and when would have it in three days.</li>
            <li> and i have uneven hair.</li>
            <li> I will never order from here again tomorrow what a waste of time and my my money</li>
            <li> My first was the CHI which I was slightly disappointed in</li>
            <li> unfortunately it was a used item and NOT a NEW one as described.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for really thick hair.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t bad, not worth a penny over $40 though.</li>
            <li> I lost $40 and I am really unhappy about it!!</li>
            <li> or you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very mad about this and will never buy another Royale ever!!</li>

            <li> I bought the Royale Pink 1.25&amp;#34; Tourmaline Ionic Hair Straightener shortly on Amazon, but unfortunately it was a used item and NOT a NEW one as described. Plus, it does NOT work. I lost $40 and I am really unhappy about it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair straightener as a Christmas gift for my daughter two years ago.  She reports that it is no longer heating.  Although it has a five year warranty, we are not willing to pay the shipping costs and $20 fee for a replacement.  I can purchase comparable brand for less money that will last at least two years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who praises this as the best hair straightener she has ever owned. The envy of all her friends and we got it at a super deal.</li>
            <li> Very good straightener. Product was as described, easy to use and my hair didn&#x27;t feel fried afterwords. Would definitely recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> Like most I saw at the mall, they curled my pin straight hair beautifully with this straighter. But I refused to pay $150, so while they were finishing my hair I was online searching for prices. I found it here on amazon and bought it. Having used it for the first time, I was not nearly as impressed as the demonstration at the mall, I can get a curl but it falls out immeiadetly. Overall as straighteners go this isn&#x27;t bad, not worth a penny over $40 though. Probably will just stick to my hot tools curling iron for soft curls.</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron and it is amazing! My hair looks like I got a keratin treatment. I almost bought it at the mall kiosk for $130. When I saw it here less than half the price I jumped on it. Don&#x27;t hesitate, it is the identical iron that they sell at the mall. Sturdy, very good quality and it has an extra long cord. I have natural botticelli curls that go down to the middle of my back, normal thickness and after air drying my hair, I was able to straighten my hair in 20 minutes. Just needed one swipe for each 1 inch section. I slept on it overnight and it is stick straight in the morning. I didn&#x27;t even brush it out. I love it!</li>
            <li> When I first received this straightener, I was thrilled with it&#x27;s performance. I have paid as much as $250 for a royale straightener before and this one worked every bit as good. My only problem with it is, I&#x27;ve had it 2 months and when I went to use it, it just never worked again. I&#x27;ve never dropped it, it looks perfect, it just won&#x27;t turn on.  Hopefully, I got a defective one and this isn&#x27;t true for all. Nice product for the price if it just worked!</li>
            <li> [...]    check out the website, it says on the homepage that the ones sold on ebay and amazon are imitations. glad it looked at the original website before jumping on this  purchase!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener about 2 years ago.  I&#x27;ve sent 2 back so far.  The first one stopped heating and the second one had a short in the cord.  The warranty is either for 5 years or a lifetime; however, by the time you send the $19.99 for them to ship a replacement plus pay for the shipping to send the damaged one back (about $20.00) you may as well buy a new one.  Should&#x27;ve never bought it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I got suckered into buying this hair straightner from one of the kiosks at the mall. It certainly gets my hair straight, but it also catches my hair on the corner and breaks strands off each time I use it. Since my hair is halfway down my back and pretty thick, this issue is pretty much unavoidable unless I have the time to go super slowly (which takes 2-3 times longer than my normal routine - who has time for that?).  I&#x27;d say $30 is about the right price, but don&#x27;t pay any more or you will be disappointed! It really isn&#x27;t the salon quality they like to advertise.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of these straightners at my local mall less than 5 weeks ago one for me and the other for my daughter.  Both sets were the &#x27;Classic Diamond&#x27; product. My set worked well on my hair however not any better than a rival product which I had used without incident for the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;As I was using my set last week they literally gave a bang, started to give out smoke and stopped working altogether.  I sustained a burn to my hand as the smoke escaped from the straightners. I telephoned the company directly who said that they would replace them but only if I paid the postage AND an extra $20 to them so that they could run tests on them to find out the cause of the damage. Please be careful when purchasing this item that you are satisfied with your return policy and also from a safety perspective please be aware that this happened and the company offered no apology whatsoever for either my injury nor the faulty product.</li>
            <li> Was not the Tourmaline ionic straightener.....was a ceramic one. Did not receive the one that what was shown or ordered.</li>
            <li> I have had my straigtners last me at least four to five years in the past and I normally go for the cheap ones in the grocery store. I had this product for a little over two years and it stopped heating up completely. I&#x27;ve had trouble with it in the past not getting hot enough and it finally just decided to stop working all together. I had to go purchase a new one. But, the fact that I was able to put this guy on full heat and gave it time to warm up but still was able to touch the plates with no issues is baffling. I don&#x27;t think I would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This straightener is nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $20 on it as it pulled on my hair instead of gliding through.</li>
            <li> kinda small and takes a little extra time to straighten hair. that&#x27;s for really thick hair. im sure thinner hair would take less time.</li>
            <li> I saw these demonstrated at a mall kiosk. The price was exorbitant, so I hunted around and found this one. I have very unruly, wiry hair with natural waves, so I need a straightener that can handle that and give me good results. I have tried many other straighteners and this is one of the best for the price. My daughter has a CHI and I think this one is as good as hers. I am pleased with the product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these at one of the stands in the middle of the mall (ridiciulously overpriced). I have naturally CURLY hair and I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair easily (without burning it) and you would never know my hair is curly. I then came on amazon (much cheaper) and bought 2 as gifts for my sisters...and they both love them.</li>
            <li> My daughter was introduced to this device at a kiosk in a local mall. She had to have it - and when I went into the mall to buy it for her - the price was $150.00 - with a free hair sheen product. I pulled out my iPhone and scanned the UPC code on the device and found it on Amazon for less than $35.00. I ordered it immediately from my phone and told my daughter it would arrive in a few days - her not understanding why she couldn&#x27;t have immediately - I mubbled something about the boxes being a marketing gimmick - and when would have it in three days. Well - the device arrived - and I got megga kudos from her - and Amazon saved me money again. I&#x27;ve used the amazon mobile UPC app numerous times - and have been nothing but satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used a Sedu and a Babyliss Titanium flat iron and it works waaaaaaaayyyy better for straightening hair. The good thing is, that it gets the job done well for the price. Because it is 100% ceramic,you have to be careful because it can break a lot easier than ones that are with other things. It&#x27;s great for making waves.It straightens hair pretty good for the price. It WILL NOT compare to anything like a Babyliss, but hey if you&#x27;re a broke college student like me, it will be worth the money. DON&#x27;T buy this iron from the people at the mall, theyll try to make you pay $100 for it and that&#x27;s a rip off. :) Would I reccommend it? Yeah, but if you have the money to buy something better, go for it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, she and I both are very happy with the purchase. Shipped very fast and good quality, Thanks again !!!</li>
            <li> I am of caribbean decent (not that pretty carribbean, that nap of all naps no flat iron or relaxer can tame carribean)yes, my hair is NAAAAAPPY! Some of us do have wonderful hair but the other half I like to call, the is Serious nap. This is the best flat iron I have ever had. The last one I purchased was the chi 2 yrs ago and i barely used it because I hated how I had to scorch my hair to get it straight as with many other straighting products. My hair is natural and I only had to pass over my hair once and it was completely straight. All the way to the root and i have uneven hair. Usually with uneven hair the roots dont get straigten to easy you have to pass and pass over it. I also think the floating plates played a part in gettin the ends too.  When i finished doing my hair in 20 min I didnt nkow what to do with myself. The room  and my hair didnt smell like fire and my hair looks healthy. I really needed healthy because i have had back to back children and my hair has taken a toll. Buy this product it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> These are not the real Royale flat irons I have the real ones and ordered these to have an extra pair however they aren&#x27;t even authentic I am very upset and I will be sending these back I will never order from here again tomorrow what a waste of time and my my money</li>
            <li> This is a great straightner. It heats up very fast.  the best thing  it leave your here looking very shiny and smooth . this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> After owning the Royale 1.5 before, I was wanting to purchase another one but didn&#x27;t want to pay $150 for a new one as I had before at the Local Mall. My previous had drop onto my tile floor and broke, I was so sad because I LOVED it so much, how it left my curly~wavy hair looking  Shiny,smooth and straight. It wouldn&#x27;t break off my hair as others did. So I went on a search after watching a few reviews on youtube, and heard several ladies mention how they had purchased theirs on Amazon,the price they had paid and how it was the same one as the one they sale at the malls. So, I researched it and found it on Amazon and purchased it from the Seller. I received it as promised in 2 days. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it, This is the same exact Royale as the one I purchased at the mall, only paid $49 for it and purchased 2 of them, one for me and the other for my daughter. Quick delivery and  Awesome product...SO SO HAPPY..I LOVE IT! Thank you</li>
            <li> It gets me by but i expected it was going to work a lot better. Cant complain very good investment for the price.</li>
            <li> This was the second flat iron that I have ever bought in my life so I was really thrilled about using it. My first was the CHI which I was slightly disappointed in so I gave that one away. Anyway, I was introduced to Royale at a mall by a vender. She used it on my hair and I loved the results so I bought the whole line of products that she offered which included two flat irons (big and small), shampoo, conditioner, and the Royale serum. I felt like the Serum was a little different than the one the lady used on my head at the mall, but nevertheless it made my hair smooth. After using my flat iron for 9months it stopped working. I have tried to call customer service but I dont get any help. I am very mad about this and will never buy another Royale ever!! Also because its so hot, which i did kinda like, it dried out my hair and caused it to be brittle. Would I recommend this, maybe or maybe not, all I have to say is \\&quot;Buyer beware!\\&quot;</li>
