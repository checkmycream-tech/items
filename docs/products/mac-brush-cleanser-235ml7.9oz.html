            <li>This is a Great Product to have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled when it came to finding a great working Brush Cleanser, but once i heard about this product i ordered my bottle, cleaned my brushes, and loved it!</li>
            <li>This product is great, works really good and cleans as is says...</li>
            <li>Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>you get quite a good amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of amazing to watch.  </li>
            <li>I take care of everything i own and</li>
            <li>It is a nice way to maintain my brushes in-between wash/shampooing.</li>
            <li>As a MUA this is one of my best, very convenient n keeps my brush clean</li>
            <li>I love this product it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>My feelings on this product are mostly &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It works for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s outstanding in any way.</li>
            <li>ilove this brush cleanser, &amp;&amp; ijust love mac products.</li>
            <li>Love this product, works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY USE IN CLEANING ALL OF MY EYE SHADOW AND EYE LINER BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>And the price is way higher than I would like, as with most MAC products.</li>
            <li>For solvent type brush cleaner, this is a more gentle cleaner (compared with Parian Spirits for instance).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product around four years ago and it&#x27;s still halfway full.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>That said, this product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol based and will make your brushes clean really fast.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order this again!</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This way I can spray the head of the brush over a clean white wash cloth, and buff the bristles clean.</li>
            <li>The pigment positively pours out....  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my makeup brushes and it doesn&#x27;t leave any harsh odors on the brush when I pick it up for its next use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $15 on Mac.com with Free Shipping.</li>
            <li>I never gave much thought to how I cleaned my brushes until I saw this product at work.  </li>
            <li>I had a pile of dirty brushes and this stuff was wonderful.</li>
            <li>My white bristled blending brush comes clean in moments.  </li>
            <li>I also mix with water for a biweekly deep clean of my brushes (with spot cleaning every day).  </li>
            <li>You can get it for $13-$14 in store or online direct.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to spend $15 extra dollars on a product just because it is made by MAC even if it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>You can get a similar product much cheaper at your local convenience store.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t much, but a little addition like that really makes a big impression.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried to branch out to other cleansers, but I may for the sake of my wallet.</li>
            <li>I did a test of washing my brushes with my old cleanser and letting them dry...</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my little cousin, She said it cleans her brushes very well.</li>

            <li> my make-up brushes deserve the same amount of respect as my other things.</li>
            <li> A decent price ($13 I mean) for 8 ounces, so</li>
            <li> If you have ever used Mac brushes to apply MAC makeup especially you know that they are not cheap brushes and you have to take care of them.  </li>
            <li> I spent on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $30</li>
            <li> I like to put my solvent based cleaners (MAC is one of a few I have had) in a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> so much more crap came out of the brushes that i was grossed out!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I found a small emery board included.</li>
            <li> However, I give it only 3 stars because it is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTIONS FROM DIRTY BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> That is not what made me rank it with five stars though.</li>

            <li> Great product!  Excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> This is ideal for cleaning make-up brushes!! I&#x27;ve always struggled when it came to finding a great working Brush Cleanser, but once i heard about this product i ordered my bottle, cleaned my brushes, and loved it! I take care of everything i own and my make-up brushes deserve the same amount of respect as my other things. So i am very happy with this Brush Cleanser and encourage everyone to purches and use it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $15 on Mac.com with Free Shipping. I suggest buying this from there. It works great! I wouldn&#x27;t switch brands for anything.</li>
            <li> This cleaner works well. You can pour a little in a jar and dip your brushes, then blot on a paper towel when you really have to break down some of the long-wearing product formulations that just wash/shampooing alone cannot handle. I like to put my solvent based cleaners (MAC is one of a few I have had) in a small spray bottle. This way I can spray the head of the brush over a clean white wash cloth, and buff the bristles clean. It is a nice way to maintain my brushes in-between wash/shampooing. For solvent type brush cleaner, this is a more gentle cleaner (compared with Parian Spirits for instance).</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously overpriced. People, please VISIT THE MACCOSMETIC website. It is only $13 !!!  I have bought it from mac and it&#x27;s really good. A decent price ($13 I mean) for 8 ounces, so you get quite a good amount. It&#x27;s alcohol based and will make your brushes clean really fast.</li>
            <li> I never gave much thought to how I cleaned my brushes until I saw this product at work.  The pigment positively pours out....  It&#x27;s kind of amazing to watch.  My white bristled blending brush comes clean in moments.  One bottle lasted several years.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used Mac brushes to apply MAC makeup especially you know that they are not cheap brushes and you have to take care of them.  This is a Great Product to have!</li>
            <li> I love this product it gets the job done. To save the cleanser I put it in a spray bottle and did 50% cleanser, 50% bottled water. Do not use tap water because it has chemicals in it and it will reuin the cleanser. It&#x27;s not worth the $30 I spent on it that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY USE IN CLEANING ALL OF MY EYE SHADOW AND EYE LINER BRUSHES.  LESSENS THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTIONS FROM DIRTY BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> My feelings on this product are mostly &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. It works for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s outstanding in any way. And the price is way higher than I would like, as with most MAC products. I haven&#x27;t really tried to branch out to other cleansers, but I may for the sake of my wallet.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy overpriced on amazon. You can get it for $13-$14 in store or online direct.  That said, this product is worth every penny.  I transfer mine to a travel size spritz bottle for immediate cleaning of my eyeliner and shadow brushes.  I also mix with water for a biweekly deep clean of my brushes (with spot cleaning every day).  I did a test of washing my brushes with my old cleanser and letting them dry...and then did it again with this and so much more crap came out of the brushes that i was grossed out! Have permanently switched to this product</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time. I had a pile of dirty brushes and this stuff was wonderful. That is not what made me rank it with five stars though. When I opened the package I found a small emery board included. It isn&#x27;t much, but a little addition like that really makes a big impression. I will certainly order this again!</li>

            <li> ilove this brush cleanser, &amp;&amp; ijust love mac products. to me this is a must have! it gets all the color &amp;&amp; eyeshadow out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot just don&#x27;t see the difference in using this as opposed to baby shampoo on my Mae up brushes</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> As a MUA this is one of my best, very convenient n keeps my brush clean</li>
