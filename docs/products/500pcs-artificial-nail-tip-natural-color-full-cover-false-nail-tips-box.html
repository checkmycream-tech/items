            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>When I saw fake toenails in the store for the first time I laughed and laughed!!</li>
            <li>The quality is very good with each false nail being very strong and yet flexible.  </li>
            <li>Full cover.</li>
            <li>Sizes are more realistic.</li>
            <li>come in all sizes and I quickly found a full hand&#x27;s worth for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for, I have smaller/petite nails and there are sizes in here to fit every nail.</li>
            <li>Arrived a full month earlier than expected which was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>The seller delivers in a timely manner and again, the quality is so good compared to other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>No matter how I put them on, they don&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I used to do the tips myself but the full cover nail remain fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing tips, very high quality, I am definitely buying these tips everytime.</li>
            <li>I like shaping them into an almond shape there really pretty, and sturdy, the don&#x27;t get messed up from water like the ones from china.</li>
            <li>I do use some numbers more than others and do wish I could purchase the individual numbers separately</li>
            <li>but the price of these nail covers makes up for not being able to purchase individual ones.  </li>
            <li>I do like them as they look natural and they fit all sizes.  </li>
            <li>It is not thin nor breaks easily like lesser quality full cover nails.  </li>
            <li>Long and able to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>They are for the whole nail.</li>
            <li>and they came fast.  </li>
            <li>it looks real</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast too, they came weeks before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>And the nails where more white in color than natural.</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered the wrong item and the supplier was real nice handling it.</li>
            <li>Break a little too easily for my liking, I would like the nails to last more than a week</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy enough to trim down, I bought a cheap nail tip trimmer at my local beauty supply shop and it works just fine with these.</li>
            <li>With Amazons prices you will save considerable amount of money per year!</li>
            <li>They came in the exact same box as the picture and all sizes were there.</li>
            <li>so I just have to file down a 9 to have it fit, which isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said: these false nails are very beautiful and are about as thick as a normal nail.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>adhere well and very tough, good nails</li>
            <li>I thought the nails were suppose to be clear, but they are white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not rough with my nails.  </li>
            <li>They hold polish well and also cut and file very well with little chipping or breaking.  </li>

            <li> They take long taking off.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> the box will not stay closed.</li>
            <li> but when I placed a 2nd order, it didn&#x27;t come with the box and were too narrow &amp; flimsy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> For the price I can recommend  these nails for office/ average use.</li>
            <li> I have average nail beds and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re preference is thin, natural colored nails</li>
            <li> Broke and crumbled the first day, the rest in the following few days &amp;#62;:[</li>
            <li> They did not really fit my nail beds though - they are too rounded at the nail bed end.</li>
            <li> I have small nail-beds</li>
            <li> My previous nails from Amazon would just bend!!</li>
            <li> Remember to order these at least one month before you need them as they ship from China.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic box they came in was broken so now</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I saw they were not &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> Before I close, consider Fake TOENAILS!!  </li>
            <li> I wear my nails about a week and around day seven I wiggle the base lose and twist the nail off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Never received the box for the nails. And the nails where more white in color than natural.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. No matter how I put them on, they don&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li> Love them! Thanks for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the tips they use in the salon</li>
            <li> Remember to order these at least one month before you need them as they ship from China. I have small nail-beds and I threw away 4 sizes of these nails. Other than those problems these is awesome full-sized nails and would be perfect for anyone will large nail-beds.</li>
            <li> Love these nails! I like shaping them into an almond shape there really pretty, and sturdy, the don&#x27;t get messed up from water like the ones from china.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> so they take a really long time to ship, and the nails are kinda see through and you need to paint over them with nail polish but overall, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Great for girly partys,, my daughter and friends love to do nails when they come over so this is a great hit for them..</li>
            <li> Amazing tips, very high quality, I am definitely buying these tips everytime.</li>
            <li> It is great.  Sizes are more realistic.</li>
            <li> Having used products like this over the years I can tell you that not all are created equal.  Some products just can&#x27;t hold up but this product delivers.  The quality is very good with each false nail being very strong and yet flexible.  It is not thin nor breaks easily like lesser quality full cover nails.  They hold polish well and also cut and file very well with little chipping or breaking.  I do use some numbers more than others and do wish I could purchase the individual numbers separately but the price of these nail covers makes up for not being able to purchase individual ones.  The seller delivers in a timely manner and again, the quality is so good compared to other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Broke and crumbled the first day, the rest in the following few days &amp;#62;:[</li>
            <li> I thought they would be just tips (for acrylic nails) and they are not. They are for the whole nail. Also the plastic box they came in was broken so now the box will not stay closed.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic; cracks if you simply just touch something. I took them off after just 2 days</li>
            <li> Love love love great but</li>
            <li> Full cover. Nicely packaged. Great price. Durable. Long and able to be trimmed. Will order again. Variety of sizes for perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Love these! So great for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these! Easy to shape and paint and VERY worth the price. I use these for myself and resell!</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered these tips, well nails and they came fast.  I do like them as they look natural and they fit all sizes.  However, I was disappointed when I saw they were not &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> these are PERFECT so easy to change color any day. Push cuticles for the best look.Going on 1 1/2weeks with no problems.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations.  Good product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great! Love it! They are not flimsy and the sizes have a great range.</li>
            <li> adhere well and very tough, good nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these  nails &amp; i&#x27;m so happy that...... they came early,i mean a month early,this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Break a little too easily for my liking, I would like the nails to last more than a week</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and they work well.</li>
            <li> I wore these for about one week and they held up fair. I was unloading groceries and my thumb took a blow and it did crack and the crack portion fell off. My previous nails from Amazon would just bend!! That said, these may not do well in a warehouse, supply, grocery, and  laborious settings. For the price I can recommend  these nails for office/ average use. I have average nail beds and these fit great. Nails too long: they file and trim easily. They hold color well.  I used to do the tips myself but the full cover nail remain fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wear my nails about a week and around day seven I wiggle the base lose and twist the nail off. No soaking in acetone for removing. This will give your nail beds a &amp;#34;beat down&amp;#34; consider a nail supplement to strengthen the nail beds. Before I close, consider Fake TOENAILS!!  When I saw fake toenails in the store for the first time I laughed and laughed!! With practice your nails will look great!! With Amazons prices you will save considerable amount of money per year! You do the math!! The amount saved for me is a portion of my car insurance in PA.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re preference is thin, natural colored nails these are the tips for you.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong item and the supplier was real nice handling it. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> fit just right it looks real</li>
            <li> Perfect FULL cover nails I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these nails since I bought them which is about two months and they break easily and split.  I&#x27;m not rough with my nails.  They take long taking off.  I prefer KISS nails.</li>
            <li> I love these so much! They are super easy to paint, cut, and they fit my fingers perfectly!!!!! I will definitely buy more when i run out!!!!!!!! They look so good i love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These came really fast, which was surprising.  They did not really fit my nail beds though - they are too rounded at the nail bed end.</li>
            <li> Love  these tips. They fit well and are very strong. Would  buy them again</li>
            <li> The 1st time I ordered these, they were great but when I placed a 2nd order, it didn&#x27;t come with the box and were too narrow &amp; flimsy. What happened!?</li>
            <li> great do it yourself kit</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for, I have smaller/petite nails and there are sizes in here to fit every nail. They&#x27;re easy enough to trim down, I bought a cheap nail tip trimmer at my local beauty supply shop and it works just fine with these. I&#x27;ve had them on for almost a week now and they&#x27;re not peeling up yet. Shipping was really fast too, they came weeks before the estimated delivery date. Definitely recommend giving these a try for the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered these on December 12th and got them January 19th.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of experience ordering things from China, and this order took quite a while, even for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said: these false nails are very beautiful and are about as thick as a normal nail.&lt;br /&gt;They come in all sizes and I quickly found a full hand&#x27;s worth for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using them, now that they&#x27;re finally here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. But it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this</li>
            <li> Arrived a full month earlier than expected which was a very pleasant surprise. They came in the exact same box as the picture and all sizes were there. I happen to need an 11 for my very tiny pinkie nails so I just have to file down a 9 to have it fit, which isn&#x27;t a problem. These are great nails for the value and I&#x27;m already wearing them!</li>
            <li> These are literally the Best nails I&#x27;ve ever bought. Better quality than the ones u buy in store.</li>
            <li> I thought the nails were suppose to be clear, but they are white. SOLID WHITE.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price!!!</li>
            <li> these are perfect for their price they do the job</li>
