            <li> This product detangles my wet hair enough for painless combing, feels hydrating, yet manages not to be greasy.</li>
            <li> And then after I blow dry it</li>
            <li> Regular conditioners weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t use any conditioner since it usually weighs it down and becomes unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how other people have such a different experience with this product than me</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem healthy, but something in it leaves my hair feeling and looking really bad!</li>
            <li> I am trying to use it up because it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good solution to apply just the amount needed without being too heavy on my hair; unfortunately  the product has such an awful smell that I had to wash my hair right after applying it in order to get rid of the nasty odor.</li>
            <li> my hair just feels weird and puffy and sticky, not soft and manageable at all.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s fairly thick and part of it is processed from bleaching.</li>
            <li> It also has a really unpleasant smell in my opinion which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it actually did what it promises.</li>
            <li> It is not a good solution for my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible product in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Love the way this product smells!  Doesn&#x27;t de-tangle as well as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t use any conditioner since it usually weighs it down and becomes unmanageable.  This seemed like a good solution to apply just the amount needed without being too heavy on my hair; unfortunately  the product has such an awful smell that I had to wash my hair right after applying it in order to get rid of the nasty odor. üòÅ</li>
            <li> Works great. Hair looks and feels fabulous with this produce. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product gets so many good reviews. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s fairly thick and part of it is processed from bleaching. Naturally my hair has a bit of a wave, but it&#x27;s still pretty smooth and not frizzy or coarse. This product does absolutely nothing for my hair. The more of it I spray on the stickier my hair feels and it actually becomes more difficult to brush through. When I brush my hair after using this product I actually rip out a lot more hairs when brushing it than with other products or no product at all. It also has a really unpleasant smell in my opinion which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it actually did what it promises. I am not sure how other people have such a different experience with this product than me but I totally don&#x27;t understand why anyone would repurchase this. I am trying to use it up because it&#x27;s not cheap and I don&#x27;t want to throw it out but every time I use it I just want to wash my hair immediately after, it feels so gross. And then after I blow dry it my hair just feels weird and puffy and sticky, not soft and manageable at all. It&#x27;s a terrible product in my opinion. The ingredients seem healthy, but something in it leaves my hair feeling and looking really bad!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any benefit to using the leave-in conditioner - I will go back to my humectress by nexxus once the bottle is done</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;m excited about the concept of the Kevin Murphy products. My hair is over processed from color so I needed something that would improve the condition of my hair and make it easy to comb when wet. It is not a good solution for my hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Morrocan oil and it simply works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Works great to get out tangles from my really fine hair. Also gives hair a refreshed look.</li>
            <li> I have extra, super, baby-fine hair. Regular conditioners weigh it down. I eliminated \\&quot;cream rinse\\&quot; style conditioners from my shower routine and am never going back. This product detangles my wet hair enough for painless combing, feels hydrating, yet manages not to be greasy. And like all Kevin Murphy products, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> If there was any downside, it was the lack of a signature Kevin Murphy fragrance.  Great control without being heavy.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Did not like this Hair product for my Hair but gave it away made my hair dry and did absolutely  nothing.</li>
            <li> only used once, jury still out on this product</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out, since I really like their shampoo and conditioner.  But it falls short. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner I have used! Would definitely recommend trying it along with KM born again cream leave in.</li>
            <li> KM does another bit of magic.  This is like food for your hair.  I use it after every shampoo.  I love this product.  My hair looks nice, feels nice and is conditioned.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have really wavy hair and it tends to get frizzy. I use this product before putting in any product and then again at night after brushing it. I put my hair in a bun at night and the product helps to keep it looking good between washes.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend it especially if you have fine hair</li>
