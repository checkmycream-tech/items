    <ol>
            <li> it must have been a bad batch they were all dull</li>
            <li> Just as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My son liked the razor and blades. He was looking for something like this before. So when I gave it to him, he was excited</li>
            <li> I tried all the bargain brands and clubs razors and these are still the best and stay sharp the longest.</li>
            <li> Got a pack of these as a promotion from Gillette to bring awareness to the subscription deal they are doing. I&#x27;ve seen other companies doing the same thing, so it&#x27;s really no surprise. The big difference is the brand. Gillette&#x27;s cartridges are hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I always get a great close shave with very little effort and rarely ever a nick. The subscription is convenient, and can save to a bit of money if you go though these quickly. The promo info we got is that you can set it up to get a pack from anywhere to a few weeks to up to 6 months. I personally don&#x27;t go through 4 cartridges that fast. It&#x27;s one of the reasons I like these cartridges. But the flexibility might be nice to other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ProGlide blades for a few months and think they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  I started off using them as a result of a free trial by Gillette.  A longtime Gillette fan, these really provide a noticeable closer shave without any irritation.  Combined with the FlexBall handle the blades allow a consistently close shave across all countours of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get these as part of a subscription so that you always have blades handy. A nifty idea.  I tend to use them longer than I should and like the ease of always having a backup stash versus having to remember to go to the store or order them (plus, ordering online and with a subscription is cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you give these a try!  I think you will love them.</li>
            <li> My wife says my face and head have never been so smooth. Is there anything else that needs added?</li>
            <li> Good service and price</li>
            <li> got them quick and they are great easy to open not hard like the ones you buy in the store</li>
            <li> Best razors ever.&lt;br /&gt;Good price</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does</li>
            <li> The best razors at cheaper cost! Totally awesome!</li>
            <li> Great value and quality!</li>
            <li> Love these blades... ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> I got this to try out from bzzagent and it&#x27;s great I&#x27;ve been using the ProGlide razor for months so it&#x27;s really awesome that I can easily get new blades sent to me monthly! These razors cut nice and smooth and are great over all!</li>
            <li> Great price, great packaging and great razors.</li>
