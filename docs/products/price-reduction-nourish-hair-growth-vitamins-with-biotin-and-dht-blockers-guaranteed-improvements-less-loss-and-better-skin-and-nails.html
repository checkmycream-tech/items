            <li>I will know more as time goes on.</li>
            <li>No nasty after taste either!</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT I&#x27;M RECOMMENDING TO MY WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li>Many are similar and I am always up for trying newer products and I was impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li>more.</li>
            <li>Nourish vitamins have many health benefits.</li>
            <li>I do lead a healthy lifestyle..</li>
            <li>I love this vitamin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many biotin vitamins in an effort to improve my hair loss and brittle nail issues and none can compare to this one.</li>
            <li>It cost more than the hairfinity and nature valley vitamins</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>but when I rec&#x27;d the vitamins, they were huge, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to swallow them.</li>
            <li>However, I am having a great experience so far.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and healthy ingredients !!</li>
            <li>and I hear other people saying good review about it!!!</li>
            <li>it’s also sooo easily damaged.</li>
            <li>Good product with high quality.</li>
            <li>then I will switch and use a popular brand hairfinity&amp;#34; To my surprise this pill really works!</li>
            <li>Work fine.</li>
            <li>#34;good hair&amp;#34;, always just fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine textured hair 3b/ 4c luscious curls .</li>
            <li>Since my hair is so fine</li>
            <li>What an amazing company, not only producing an amazing vitamin to assist with our hair growth but to also let us read up with a guide.</li>
            <li>I got these cheap for testing.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>After only 1 wash, my hair feels great.  </li>
            <li>The supplement is&lt;br /&gt;Gluten free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I just started using it and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good results so far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this p product!!!!</li>
            <li>and I see significant increase in hair around that area which is a relief because I don&#x27;t want to be balding at my age.</li>
            <li>I love the offers they send you because that makes it even more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Another hair pill, yeh right!</li>
            <li>have been taking 2 tablets every day with a full glass of water before dinner and</li>
            <li>After using this product for three weeks we noticed that her hair are much fuller, heavier, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>but this product is good to help maintain the hair (what is left).</li>
            <li>My hair has started to grow back, I have received compliments already from my wife and good friend that my hair looks way thicker.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free but it is still worth the money.</li>
            <li>and since then my hair has grown a full inch… and</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>but if you love your hair as much as I do, then it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li>received this for free in exchange of my personal review based on my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Quick Update</li>
            <li>The vitamins are large, but easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>Less hair in the comb for me is always great.</li>
            <li>I have been losing a fair amount of hair on a steady basis for several years now, and when I saw an offer to try this product for nearly free, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Even one of my daughters commented recently on how healthy my hair looked!  </li>
            <li>Was excited till I saw that it really doesn&#x27;t have 6000 mcg of biotin!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that I will definitely continue using and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>My hair is now fuller and looks more alive than ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>If anything, they helped my skin look a bit more clear as I got some compliments on that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just try for the fun of it</li>
            <li>As far as hair length and strength-so far so good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>however, my experience with these two products has been very positive.  </li>
            <li>What that means, is that my body needs it right now.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my hair seems to be thinning right in the part of my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair growth (in all the right places) is just one of them.</li>
            <li>so no need to worry about that on here, plus they do down nice and smooth</li>
            <li>but I’ve also noticed new hair growth (hairline) and my hair feels/looks thicker - which is ALWAYS a plus with baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Well  so far so good it has only been a week</li>
            <li>I will note, I do NOT use the shampoo through this company because it is not sulfate free, if/when they introduce a sulfate free version I will be all over that like white on rice.</li>
            <li>If you announce that above in huge writing than I would hope it would be correct!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed so much difference in my hair since I have been taking these!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE VITAMINS!!</li>
            <li>3 to be exact.</li>
            <li>for I&#x27;m sure ill love the results more.</li>
            <li>I notice hair growth on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>At first, he has been reluctant to use.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this comes with a ebook (The Ultimate Hair Growth Guide) as well.</li>
            <li>, I have been in constant communication with the company and they are always will and able to answer and questions I may have had before purchasing.</li>
            <li>JUST USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since the first couple of weeks of using the products.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product on 02/03 and for the first week</li>
            <li>So far, I have experienced less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, everyone I know has been talking about how beautiful my hair is lately!</li>
            <li>I could see that this met my satisfaction with for using clean, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also, I took a bottle of it to my herbalist, and when she muscle tested me with it, I tested positive.</li>
            <li>The first bottle worked really well</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so not much works for me.</li>
            <li>No after taste with pill and easy to include in daily routine of supplements.</li>
            <li>Since I wear tape-in hair extensions I can easily track hair growth - the last time I touched up my hair was 01/19</li>
            <li>This is also helping my formerly brittle nails, which are now strong.</li>
            <li>Right off I noticed a new shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>First off Im amazed I can take these without food and get no nasty side effects like I do with other vitamins.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 weeks I noticed thickness and softness but no growth, but how realistic would that be.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, been using it for a week now and can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li>The next month I decided to try the offer to buy 2 shampoos and get a vitamin free....</li>
            <li>This combination of vitamins seems to be very well balanced to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>Maybe not for those with weaker stomachs I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>it really dosn&#x27;t do what it promises i have been on it for a while</li>
            <li>I like this product I have tried many products for hair growth and did not get the results I expected to see&lt;br /&gt;Also  </li>
            <li>However, I was really taking it to try to help me grow my hair faster.  </li>
            <li>Really it&#x27;s like Centrum pills..  </li>
            <li>My hair grow so fast with this product</li>
            <li>Product seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li>They have been very responsive when I have had a question.</li>
            <li>and this really works.</li>
            <li>(like Nisim FAST, with-sulfate and sulfate-free versions) but haven’t found one that makes my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>So much so I have reordered.</li>
            <li>That coupled with taking the vitamin twice a day has done more for the texture and feel of my hair that any other hair growth chemical out there.  </li>
            <li>but at a fraction of the big name brand price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered these vitamins at a special price to product test and review.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair growing at a tremendous rate, my nails are thicker and much healthier than ever before.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that he got his full hair back</li>
            <li>I am not using/doing anything new besides taking this product, so I know that it’s the NOURISH hair pills causing my hair to grow faster and feel healthier!  </li>
            <li>It might just be me but it did take a while for results to show up so minus one star but don&#x27;t let that stop you from purchasing these&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy to swallow pill.</li>
            <li>More than half of the tablets were cracked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make my urine super yellow.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use long enough to  really tell you if they work.</li>
            <li>They are a little more expensive compared to some brands, but it should be noted they also have more ingredients/vitamins than most bands.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, will buy again and again.</li>
            <li>so i have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would need to complete the whole bottle before giving a conclusive review on that.</li>
            <li>After just a few weeks I could see  that hairs stopped falling, and together with the shampoo as part of the treatment, I have a much better and stronger hair than I had 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>I am wishing you a big success ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shafie</li>
            <li>I will update my review after a few more weeks of using these.</li>
            <li>I keep track each time I start taking a new hair growth pill before and after to see the results after finishing a bottle of pills.</li>
            <li>It has helped with new hair growth as well as my nails.</li>
            <li>However, those habits are nothing new...  </li>
            <li>I bleached out 3 years of perm black dye and in Feb 2014 I did a quick 10 minute bleach job to get out more of the dark remaining dye.</li>
            <li>;) it had some similar ingredients to the shampoo the company has</li>
            <li>I thought this product Nourish Hair Growth worked pretty well for only one month.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty big pill though; I wish they came in capsules so that they could be easier to swallow.</li>
            <li>I have been using this vitamins for hair growth for a few months now and my hair has stopped falling out in patches where there was bald spots on my scalp fine hairs</li>
            <li>Keep the offers coming</li>
            <li>I have so far used a 30 day supply.</li>
            <li>These supplements seem to be working for me so far.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell yet..</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair growing, but my nails are thicker and much healthier also.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair with no chemicals or anything.</li>
            <li>Patience is the key and this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I am taking these pills for near 3 weeks, but see no improvement.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for two weeks and have seen  noticeable differences thus far.</li>
            <li>She definitely stop loosing as much hair as she used to before.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this pill motivates me to continue grow my hair from the TWA stage.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle and took out a tablet, I was surprised it had cracked.</li>
            <li>It was like the powder in the middle of each was too much for the coating on the&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products are working for me - and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  </li>
            <li>I tried different shampoos, Rogaine, then Nioxin with absolutely nothing changing.</li>
            <li>Hair feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and I will be back with an honest opinion to all of you that have tried so many and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to see where my hair growth progress is a few months from now -</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first, as I would not be willing to take a product that I feel is not safe.</li>
            <li>I got these vitamins and a shampoo for my relative who started to lose a lot of hairs due to a special blood pressure medication.</li>
            <li>At first I took these on an empty stomach- not recommended.</li>
            <li>I started noticing tiny new hairs.</li>
            <li>New hairstyle which was not possible before</li>
            <li>but, being a woman who is getting older but not old by any means, I do not want to lose anymore of my hair.</li>
            <li>so no need to worry about it being imported from some old shack in central america</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a little more than half way through bottle.</li>
            <li>After taking having tried these vitamins, I can honestly say they have helped slow down on my hair loss and promote healthier, shinier, stronger hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used for 3 weeks so far, so thats not enough time for me to see results yet.</li>
            <li>Anxious to try another bottle after a deep discount a whooping 40% off, coupon to I right away.</li>

            <li> I will know more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> No nasty after taste either!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT I&#x27;M RECOMMENDING TO MY WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li> Many are similar and I am always up for trying newer products and I was impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> more.</li>
            <li> Nourish vitamins have many health benefits.</li>
            <li> I do lead a healthy lifestyle..</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many biotin vitamins in an effort to improve my hair loss and brittle nail issues and none can compare to this one.</li>
            <li> It cost more than the hairfinity and nature valley vitamins</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> but when I rec&#x27;d the vitamins, they were huge, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to swallow them.</li>
            <li> However, I am having a great experience so far.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and healthy ingredients !!</li>
            <li> and I hear other people saying good review about it!!!</li>
            <li> it’s also sooo easily damaged.</li>
            <li> Good product with high quality.</li>
            <li> then I will switch and use a popular brand hairfinity&amp;#34; To my surprise this pill really works!</li>
            <li> Work fine.</li>
            <li> #34;good hair&amp;#34;, always just fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair 3b/ 4c luscious curls .</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so fine</li>
            <li> What an amazing company, not only producing an amazing vitamin to assist with our hair growth but to also let us read up with a guide.</li>
            <li> I got these cheap for testing.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After only 1 wash, my hair feels great.  </li>
            <li> The supplement is&lt;br /&gt;Gluten free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good results so far.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this p product!!!!</li>
            <li> and I see significant increase in hair around that area which is a relief because I don&#x27;t want to be balding at my age.</li>
            <li> I love the offers they send you because that makes it even more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Another hair pill, yeh right!</li>
            <li> have been taking 2 tablets every day with a full glass of water before dinner and</li>
            <li> After using this product for three weeks we noticed that her hair are much fuller, heavier, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> but this product is good to help maintain the hair (what is left).</li>
            <li> My hair has started to grow back, I have received compliments already from my wife and good friend that my hair looks way thicker.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free but it is still worth the money.</li>
            <li> and since then my hair has grown a full inch… and</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> but if you love your hair as much as I do, then it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> received this for free in exchange of my personal review based on my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Quick Update</li>
            <li> The vitamins are large, but easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> Less hair in the comb for me is always great.</li>
            <li> I have been losing a fair amount of hair on a steady basis for several years now, and when I saw an offer to try this product for nearly free, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Even one of my daughters commented recently on how healthy my hair looked!  </li>
            <li> Was excited till I saw that it really doesn&#x27;t have 6000 mcg of biotin!  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I will definitely continue using and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> My hair is now fuller and looks more alive than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> If anything, they helped my skin look a bit more clear as I got some compliments on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just try for the fun of it</li>
            <li> As far as hair length and strength-so far so good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> however, my experience with these two products has been very positive.  </li>
            <li> What that means, is that my body needs it right now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair seems to be thinning right in the part of my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair growth (in all the right places) is just one of them.</li>
            <li> so no need to worry about that on here, plus they do down nice and smooth</li>
            <li> but I’ve also noticed new hair growth (hairline) and my hair feels/looks thicker - which is ALWAYS a plus with baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Well  so far so good it has only been a week</li>
            <li> I will note, I do NOT use the shampoo through this company because it is not sulfate free, if/when they introduce a sulfate free version I will be all over that like white on rice.</li>
            <li> If you announce that above in huge writing than I would hope it would be correct!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed so much difference in my hair since I have been taking these!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE VITAMINS!!</li>
            <li> 3 to be exact.</li>
            <li> for I&#x27;m sure ill love the results more.</li>
            <li> I notice hair growth on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> At first, he has been reluctant to use.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this comes with a ebook (The Ultimate Hair Growth Guide) as well.</li>
            <li> , I have been in constant communication with the company and they are always will and able to answer and questions I may have had before purchasing.</li>
            <li> JUST USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since the first couple of weeks of using the products.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product on 02/03 and for the first week</li>
            <li> So far, I have experienced less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, everyone I know has been talking about how beautiful my hair is lately!</li>
            <li> I could see that this met my satisfaction with for using clean, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also, I took a bottle of it to my herbalist, and when she muscle tested me with it, I tested positive.</li>
            <li> The first bottle worked really well</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so not much works for me.</li>
            <li> No after taste with pill and easy to include in daily routine of supplements.</li>
            <li> Since I wear tape-in hair extensions I can easily track hair growth - the last time I touched up my hair was 01/19</li>
            <li> This is also helping my formerly brittle nails, which are now strong.</li>
            <li> Right off I noticed a new shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> First off Im amazed I can take these without food and get no nasty side effects like I do with other vitamins.</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 weeks I noticed thickness and softness but no growth, but how realistic would that be.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, been using it for a week now and can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> The next month I decided to try the offer to buy 2 shampoos and get a vitamin free....</li>
            <li> This combination of vitamins seems to be very well balanced to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for those with weaker stomachs I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> it really dosn&#x27;t do what it promises i have been on it for a while</li>
            <li> I like this product I have tried many products for hair growth and did not get the results I expected to see&lt;br /&gt;Also  </li>
            <li> However, I was really taking it to try to help me grow my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> Really it&#x27;s like Centrum pills..  </li>
            <li> My hair grow so fast with this product</li>
            <li> Product seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li> They have been very responsive when I have had a question.</li>
            <li> and this really works.</li>
            <li> (like Nisim FAST, with-sulfate and sulfate-free versions) but haven’t found one that makes my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> So much so I have reordered.</li>
            <li> That coupled with taking the vitamin twice a day has done more for the texture and feel of my hair that any other hair growth chemical out there.  </li>
            <li> but at a fraction of the big name brand price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered these vitamins at a special price to product test and review.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair growing at a tremendous rate, my nails are thicker and much healthier than ever before.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that he got his full hair back</li>
            <li> I am not using/doing anything new besides taking this product, so I know that it’s the NOURISH hair pills causing my hair to grow faster and feel healthier!  </li>
            <li> It might just be me but it did take a while for results to show up so minus one star but don&#x27;t let that stop you from purchasing these&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy to swallow pill.</li>
            <li> More than half of the tablets were cracked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll make my urine super yellow.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use long enough to  really tell you if they work.</li>
            <li> They are a little more expensive compared to some brands, but it should be noted they also have more ingredients/vitamins than most bands.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> so i have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would need to complete the whole bottle before giving a conclusive review on that.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I could see  that hairs stopped falling, and together with the shampoo as part of the treatment, I have a much better and stronger hair than I had 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am wishing you a big success ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shafie</li>
            <li> I will update my review after a few more weeks of using these.</li>
            <li> I keep track each time I start taking a new hair growth pill before and after to see the results after finishing a bottle of pills.</li>
            <li> It has helped with new hair growth as well as my nails.</li>
            <li> However, those habits are nothing new...  </li>
            <li> I bleached out 3 years of perm black dye and in Feb 2014 I did a quick 10 minute bleach job to get out more of the dark remaining dye.</li>
            <li> ;) it had some similar ingredients to the shampoo the company has</li>
            <li> I thought this product Nourish Hair Growth worked pretty well for only one month.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty big pill though; I wish they came in capsules so that they could be easier to swallow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this vitamins for hair growth for a few months now and my hair has stopped falling out in patches where there was bald spots on my scalp fine hairs</li>
            <li> Keep the offers coming</li>
            <li> I have so far used a 30 day supply.</li>
            <li> These supplements seem to be working for me so far.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell yet..</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair growing, but my nails are thicker and much healthier also.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair with no chemicals or anything.</li>
            <li> Patience is the key and this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I am taking these pills for near 3 weeks, but see no improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for two weeks and have seen  noticeable differences thus far.</li>
            <li> She definitely stop loosing as much hair as she used to before.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this pill motivates me to continue grow my hair from the TWA stage.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle and took out a tablet, I was surprised it had cracked.</li>
            <li> It was like the powder in the middle of each was too much for the coating on the&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products are working for me - and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  </li>
            <li> I tried different shampoos, Rogaine, then Nioxin with absolutely nothing changing.</li>
            <li> Hair feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and I will be back with an honest opinion to all of you that have tried so many and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to see where my hair growth progress is a few months from now -</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first, as I would not be willing to take a product that I feel is not safe.</li>
            <li> I got these vitamins and a shampoo for my relative who started to lose a lot of hairs due to a special blood pressure medication.</li>
            <li> At first I took these on an empty stomach- not recommended.</li>
            <li> I started noticing tiny new hairs.</li>
            <li> New hairstyle which was not possible before</li>
            <li> but, being a woman who is getting older but not old by any means, I do not want to lose anymore of my hair.</li>
            <li> so no need to worry about it being imported from some old shack in central america</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little more than half way through bottle.</li>
            <li> After taking having tried these vitamins, I can honestly say they have helped slow down on my hair loss and promote healthier, shinier, stronger hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used for 3 weeks so far, so thats not enough time for me to see results yet.</li>
            <li> Anxious to try another bottle after a deep discount a whooping 40% off, coupon to I right away.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the Nioxin and other chemical products without success and wasted hundreds of dollars.  </li>
            <li> However, I have forced myself to continue taking them consistently anyway, hoping that I&#x27;d finally found a product would work differently for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and it seems to be working, my hair is breaking less, and getting some new hair growth around my edges.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is very coarse, but lately it has been super soft.</li>
            <li> My hair and eyelashes have started to thicken and grow much faster than usual .  </li>
            <li> But I really noticed my hair being dull, flat and visibly thinner several months ago - could be hereditary, or menopause or age -</li>
            <li> After chemo for 1 year my hair did grow back but very thin and fine.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews sound suspiciously fake and for the 2 week I&#x27;ve used this product my hair has gotten thinner. ...</li>
            <li> wondrous Locks look luxurious shinier and healthier in Lord knows how long.</li>
            <li> I like that the  ingredients contains herbs and it has a gradual release of vitamin c and b over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Two week results are in and my hair has already grown half an inch and the hair loss has decreased tremendously!</li>
            <li> and i am really seeing the difference little by little.</li>
            <li> Just the other night I put brand new tape-in extensions in and noticed little inch long sprouts of hair where the baldish spots had been!   </li>
            <li> I reluctantly gave up my various other shampoos that I felt</li>
            <li> For the last 12 months I have been EXTREME babying my hair…  </li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work for my thin, damaged hair that falls out constantly.</li>
            <li> The vitamins along with the shampoo same to have made my hair around the edges a little thicker but it still a little to soon the actually say since I&#x27;ve only been using it approx.</li>
            <li> I will be using your shampoo for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Regularly my hair grows maybe a half an inch a month..</li>
            <li> Not only did it help my hair overall, my gray isn&#x27;t as gray....  very odd, but works for me!</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair left a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have really seen an improvement in my hair strength and growing faster than usual!!</li>
            <li> When you get older things slow down.</li>
            <li> I have super thin and slow growing hair.so taking Biotin and other hair growth products are definitely what I use.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail 2 days before I expected it</li>
            <li> I will go back to buying it again in a few months.  </li>
            <li> But, at first I received the pills broken in half inside.</li>
            <li> the next day after I take a shower, I am noticing less and less hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair previously felt dry and just couldnt style it.</li>
            <li> There’s a mere 1.5 inches left of that hair, everything else is new growth.</li>
            <li> Extremely unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that these are are too much different than an over the counter prenatal.</li>
            <li> This product is helping my hair loss due to surgery.</li>
            <li> Helped save my loss of hair due to spinning around on my head a lot&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I have lost a lot of hair due to hormonal changes after having my son so I needed something to help my hair regrow.  </li>
            <li> extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger, thicker and extremely hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair and can usually never get it to grow past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I open my second bottle and all of my tablets are broken.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> They surpassed all my expectations unlike other companies I have purchased from!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> About two and a half weeks into taking this product</li>
            <li> that’s including the week and a half</li>
            <li> Have seen a little difference in the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I tried Nourish vitamins for a month and felt that my hair was not so dried out and the strands themselves seemed thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have now been taking this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After having a baby, you get to lose a tons of hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> My hair was getting extremely thin on the back of my scalp.</li>
            <li> biggest waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I always test them for a few days and see if I breakout.</li>
            <li> I measured and wouldnt you know it my hair has grown about half an inch!</li>
            <li> Although they were expensive, I felt that if they worked..... it would still not cost me anymore than other products and various shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have read that it takes at least a bottle before seeing a change, although there were some claims of it happening sooner with a few other people.</li>
            <li> The Nourish Beaute hair growth vitamins are easy to take don&#x27;t smell horrible like some other vitamins I have had before.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little dull too.</li>
            <li> Literally no hair loss in the shower drain anymore and very little hair in my brush</li>
            <li> I have mixed emotions about this product, as it is expensive...</li>
            <li> Healthy and improved after a real bad dye job.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that is just getting worse as I get older.  </li>
            <li> I am normally very skeptical in  trying new products.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> My hair is so delicate that the difference between using sulfate-free and with-sulfate shampoo is noticeable…  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been forced to keep trimming.</li>
            <li> The Vitmain shampoo is like thick conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that for the amount I spent, I had to throw away half of the tablets away.</li>
            <li> The caplets are on the larger side &amp; have a bad after taste IMO, but that goes away rather soon.</li>
            <li> They taste bad and are way too big.</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> Not good for anything..</li>
            <li> My hair has also never grown fast which I always hated.</li>
            <li> I take the pills as the bottle directs and I have not experienced any negative side effects (like nausea).  </li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THESE BECAUSE MY HAIR IS THIN.  </li>
            <li> Still thin, still falling out, and my nails keep chipping.</li>
            <li> I can send a picture of how thin my hair part was.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if I just look at it wrong the ends break off - and I’ve been struggling with this for about 8 years… Nov 2013</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t seen dramatic growth like others but hoping it will help.</li>
            <li> I hve seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> these made me extremely ill.</li>
            <li> and i am not impressed</li>
            <li> but I realized that all the reviews look fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth, after 30 days of taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Prior to my discovery of tape in extensions I was wearing keratin bonded hair extensions (which are awful) for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been nauseous and they don&#x27;t have a nasty after taste.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair grow, but tastes kinda nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing customer support, sent instructions immediately after purchase on how to use product.  Highly recommend, been using it for a week now and can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> Noticable results around week 2-3</li>
            <li> Extremely unimpressed. Did not do as advertised, and is pricey. I gave them a couple weeks to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and it seems to be working, my hair is breaking less, and getting some new hair growth around my edges.</li>
            <li> These hair growth pills are so awesome! I have noticed so much difference in my hair since I have been taking these! My hair, that never grows, actually has!!! It&#x27;s softer, silkier, and shinier! It just feels 10 times helthier than before! I am happy to recieve these to review!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, everyone I know has been talking about how beautiful my hair is lately! my eyelashes and nails have grown longer. On top of longer lashes, my skin is glowing. This is an amazing product that I will definitely continue using and recommend to everyone! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve seen results already and I&#x27;m half way through the bottle. I ordered the shampoo and I Cant wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure yet how this is coming along. The vitamins along with the shampoo same to have made my hair around the edges a little thicker but it still a little to soon the actually say since I&#x27;ve only been using it approx. 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m still anticipating that good results will occur.  One thing for sure the shampoo has made my hair softer and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that is just getting worse as I get older.  I have tried all of the Nioxin and other chemical products without success and wasted hundreds of dollars.  I decided to search for something else and came across Nourish vitamins.  Although they were expensive, I felt that if they worked..... it would still not cost me anymore than other products and various shampoos.  I tried Nourish vitamins for a month and felt that my hair was not so dried out and the strands themselves seemed thicker.  The next month I decided to try the offer to buy 2 shampoos and get a vitamin free.... to me this was a heck of a deal and probably the only reason I tried the shampoo.  I reluctantly gave up my various other shampoos that I felt were doing okay and tried the Nourish Shampoo.  I let it sit on my hair for the 3-4 minutes it says then wash out and condition it.  That coupled with taking the vitamin twice a day has done more for the texture and feel of my hair that any other hair growth chemical out there.  My hair has more shine, bounce and life to it than it has in years.  I love the offers they send you because that makes it even more affordable.  Keep the offers coming and you have me for life.</li>
            <li> I have so far used a 30 day supply. It is packed with vitamins and I think it is helping with my hair loss. I am also using a shampoo to control my receding hairline. I think both the products being used together is helping. I have not noticed any side effects from this product. I will post another review in a couple months and will update on any noticeable progress.</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THESE BECAUSE MY HAIR IS THIN.  SINCE USING THESE, MY HAIR IS THICKER AND FULLER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE VITAMINS!!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews sound suspiciously fake and for the 2 week I&#x27;ve used this product my hair has gotten thinner. ...</li>
            <li> This combination of vitamins seems to be very well balanced to promote hair growth. The caplets are on the larger side &amp; have a bad after taste IMO, but that goes away rather soon. I&#x27;ve only used for 3 weeks so far, so thats not enough time for me to see results yet. I will continue taking &amp; will update this review after 3 mths or so.</li>
            <li> These supplements seem to be working for me so far. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would but I can definitely feel a difference is the strength and fullness of my hair. I have very fine hair, so not much works for me. However, NOURISH contains biotin, plus 23 vitamins and herbs that help strengthen my hair and help stop hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking 2 tablets every day with a full glass of water before dinner and the next day after I take a shower, I am noticing less and less hair loss. I would have to say these hair growth vitamins work as well as the big name brand vitamins but at a fraction of the big name brand price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered these vitamins at a special price to product test and review. After taking having tried these vitamins, I can honestly say they have helped slow down on my hair loss and promote healthier, shinier, stronger hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nourish Hair growth Vitamins, they arrived sooner than I expexted. Though I&#x27;ve only been taking them a short period of time (10 days) I&#x27;ve not been nauseous and they don&#x27;t have a nasty after taste. Customer Service has been beyond great. It&#x27;s too soon for me to tell how the vitamins affect m hair, but, I will keep you posted</li>
            <li> Too early to tell yet..</li>
            <li> I have been losing a fair amount of hair on a steady basis for several years now, and when I saw an offer to try this product for nearly free, I decided to give it a try. I read the reviews first, as I would not be willing to take a product that I feel is not safe. I could see that this met my satisfaction with for using clean, natural ingredients. I have now been taking this for a few weeks. Honestly, I have not seen a difference yet. I have read that it takes at least a bottle before seeing a change, although there were some claims of it happening sooner with a few other people. However, I did decide to purchase more bottles of it. 3 to be exact. I want to give it a fair chance. Also, I took a bottle of it to my herbalist, and when she muscle tested me with it, I tested positive. What that means, is that my body needs it right now. Actually, for me, instead of the recommended dosage of two tablets, I actually need three. Maybe that will help me see some results. I have mixed emotions about this product, as it is expensive...but, being a woman who is getting older but not old by any means, I do not want to lose anymore of my hair. I would like to gain some of it back. So, I cross my fingers....</li>
            <li> AWESOME product!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking them for maybe two weeks and see great results. My hair is shiny, thicker and longer. Will definitely be a regular&lt;br /&gt;customer. Thank you for such an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> Big difference. Healthy and improved after a real bad dye job. Thank you. It&#x27;s growing out fast and looking great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair seems to be thinning right in the part of my hair. Right off I noticed a new shine to my hair. It looked healthier than it had in years. About two and a half weeks into taking this product I started noticing tiny new hairs. My hair is now fuller and looks more alive than ever. I am amazed at what this product can do. I highly highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really love these vitamins. After having a baby, you get to lose a tons of hair everyday. These pills along with a good diet helped me a lot to regrow my hair. But, at first I received the pills broken in half inside. Then, I&#x27;ve contacted the company, and they&#x27;ve sent me a replacement for the broken pills and a free shampoo. Their customer service is really great. Please try out their vitamins and see the result for yourself.</li>
            <li> A bunch of people have told me about this product and said it&#x27;s amazing and it works. I just started using it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for those with weaker stomachs I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that these are are too much different than an over the counter prenatal. However, men likely wouldnt but prenatals so if they were looking for a way to grow their hair this might be a great option for them!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully! Started growing hair within 3 weeks of getting the vitamins!</li>
            <li> I do notice more hair growth and I intend on buying more.</li>
            <li> Have seen a little difference in the health of my hair.  Still haven&#x27;t seen dramatic growth like others but hoping it will help.</li>
            <li> Then stop my hair from falling out didn&#x27;t see a difference either</li>
            <li> When you get older things slow down. I&#x27;m 50. I cut my hair short last year and it just won&#x27;t grow back. I had been relaxing my hair and coloring my gray so I&#x27;ve been forced to keep trimming. Ive stopping coloring and now embracing my gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little more than half way through bottle. Within the first 2 weeks I noticed thickness and softness but no growth, but how realistic would that be. My hair previously felt dry and just couldnt style it. The end of the 2nd week I relaxed my hair. One week after I relaxed my hair there is a 1/4 of an inch growth compared to before the product I had 1/4 inch growth after 3-4 weeks (which ended up getting trimmed off). My hair feels very healthy. So I have to say this works for me. I will be ordering another bottle. Note: I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the breakouts on the face.</li>
            <li> This product is helping my hair loss due to surgery. I thought I would never find a product that would aid and protect during my hair thinning. I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 weeks now and my edges have reappeared..Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion... This is a really nice hair growth supplement. Not only is my hair growing, but my nails are thicker and much healthier also. My hair is getting thicker.I have natural hair with no chemicals or anything. This is a great product. I recommend taking these after you have eaten something.</li>
            <li> these made me extremely ill. i stopped use after 3 vitamins. do they work? i dont know. i took them with and without food to the same end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
            <li> made hair thicker , but not in places that I lost hair</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I WAS GIVEN A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to say. I&#x27;m a break dancer and spend a lot of time spinning on my head which seems to cause bald spots specifically on the area around my colic and I see significant increase in hair around that area which is a relief because I don&#x27;t want to be balding at my age. So here are some pros&lt;br /&gt;1) Made in the US in an FDA certified laboratory so no need to worry about it being imported from some old shack in central america&lt;br /&gt;2) Helped save my loss of hair due to spinning around on my head a lot&lt;br /&gt;3) It might just be me but it did take a while for results to show up so minus one star but don&#x27;t let that stop you from purchasing these&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy to swallow pill. If there&#x27;s one thing I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s an over sized pill so no need to worry about that on here, plus they do down nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Not bad. I only bought one bottle to try out but seemed like it made a difference</li>
            <li> Ive had this product for a week and I&#x27;m loving it!!! I will update my review once i finish the bottle for I&#x27;m sure ill love the results more.</li>
            <li> These are big pills. Work fine. Alot of benefits as well. Less hair in the comb for me is always great. These were given to me to review.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair look better and shine since i start to use this product. Im very happy whit my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product and my hair is growing longer and faster...as well as my fingers and toe nails!  No after taste with pill and easy to include in daily routine of supplements.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail 2 days before I expected it so that is amazing ;) it had some similar ingredients to the shampoo the company has and I love the shampoo. So I am expecting to love this as well.</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> I Willie Cline will like to get that coupon also send me a link to where I can take advantage and utilize all the benefits so be it. Purchased 7/14/2014 Product is perfect and is working way wondrous Locks look luxurious shinier and healthier in Lord knows how long. Anxious to try another bottle after a deep discount a whooping 40% off, coupon to I right away. Have a blessed day. Thank you in advance.</li>
            <li> I tried another shampoo for quite a while without seeing the improvement that I&#x27;ve seen in the short time I&#x27;ve been using NOURISH Vitamins!  Even one of my daughters commented recently on how healthy my hair looked!  That was certainly a nice compliment for me, but quite a good endorsement for your product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!  I will be using your shampoo for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I got these cheap for testing. These vitamins are jam packed with the nutrients needed to provide hair growth. I haven&#x27;t been able to use long enough to  really tell you if they work. But my hair does feel healthier, softer. No growth notice though.</li>
            <li> I received the Vitamins and started the very next day. I started to notice the decrease of lost hair. It wasn&#x27;t like over night but gradually. I bought the shampoo also to double the strength and as a pair and it works. Patience is the key and this stuff really works. I bought more so I don&#x27;t ran out of it. Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey but if you love your hair as much as I do, then it&#x27;s all worth it. There&#x27;s a discount too if you buy both. Highly recommend it and you won&#x27;t regret. Thumbs up for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;Much Highly recommended, will buy again and again. this product works I&#x27;m happy i got thicker and healthier hair again.</li>
            <li> it really dosn&#x27;t do what it promises i have been on it for a while and i am not impressed</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d an email from the company telling me to be patient with results but when I rec&#x27;d the vitamins, they were huge, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to swallow them. They are made for a horse, not a human. I sent them back after reading the ingredient label.</li>
            <li> I notice hair growth on my first bottle. I open my second bottle and all of my tablets are broken.</li>
            <li> Not good for anything.. Gave me pimples instead..</li>
            <li> No improvemnet. I will use one more bottle before discontinuin...I am actually using there shampoo too</li>
            <li> I have been shedding a lot of hair...a lot. My hair is a little dull too. This product has the nutrients to help the hair grow longer and more beautiful. Biotin is one of the great ingredients for a fuller beautiful looking hair. This one has a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in exchange of my personal review based on my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Good product with high quality. I was pleased with this product and use it with the Vitamins Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is helping me grow my hair back Thank you for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am taking these pills for near 3 weeks, but see no improvement.</li>
            <li> I have super thin and slow growing hair.so taking Biotin and other hair growth products are definitely what I use. The Nourish Beaute hair growth vitamins are easy to take don&#x27;t smell horrible like some other vitamins I have had before. I keep track each time I start taking a new hair growth pill before and after to see the results after finishing a bottle of pills. I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I have lost a lot of hair due to hormonal changes after having my son so I needed something to help my hair regrow.  I think its great product and works.  I think it better than store brand kinds. I ordered this product through a discount/promo amount.</li>
            <li> This product seemed interesting to me but I realized that all the reviews look fake. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo on a daily basis as well as the vitamins.  I am normally very skeptical in  trying new products. however, my experience with these two products has been very positive.  My hair and eyelashes have started to thicken and grow much faster than usual .  I have been using the product for two weeks and have seen  noticeable differences thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks i am using  this product for hair growth and i am really seeing the difference little by little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I got these vitamins and a shampoo for my relative who started to lose a lot of hairs due to a special blood pressure medication. After using this product for three weeks we noticed that her hair are much fuller, heavier, healthy and shiny. She definitely stop loosing as much hair as she used to before. I think it is a great product; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I use 2month with shampoo.realy work</li>
            <li> Paired with the shampoo, this combo is unstoppable! I love this vitamin. Not only is my hair growing at a tremendous rate, my nails are thicker and much healthier than ever before. At first I took these on an empty stomach- not recommended. I now take them after dinner and my stomach doesn&#x27;t get upset.</li>
            <li> Brother in-law will be happy to try this.</li>
            <li> Just started yesterday, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see</li>
            <li> Helped my hair grow, but tastes kinda nasty. They crack open after a month too, but they were still useable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this vitamins for hair growth for a few months now and my hair has stopped falling out in patches where there was bald spots on my scalp fine hairs can now be seen there I like this product I have tried many products for hair growth and did not get the results I expected to see&lt;br /&gt;Also  I like that the  ingredients contains herbs and it has a gradual release of vitamin c and b over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> This product did make my hair a bit healthier.  However, I was really taking it to try to help me grow my hair faster.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth, after 30 days of taking the vitamins. Perhaps it is because I didn&#x27;t buy the shampoo that goes with it. This product has obviously worked for others based on the reviews, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair growth supplement based on the reviews but It turned out to disappoint me. It does not work as stated.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work for my thin, damaged hair that falls out constantly. If anything, they helped my skin look a bit more clear as I got some compliments on that. But my hair? Still thin, still falling out, and my nails keep chipping. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again but I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Really it&#x27;s like Centrum pills..  It&#x27;ll make my urine super yellow.  The Vitmain shampoo is like thick conditioner.  After several months of using their products, my hair remains the same.  It might work for you but deffiniely not for me.</li>
            <li> I like it. My hair grow so fast with this product</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work, just like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Product seems very suspicious. Stay away! extremely dissatisfied. Does not do all that it claims. Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> This product was offered to me without charge as a trial to test its quality, and to my surprise, now 10 months later I still buy it regularly. After just a few weeks I could see  that hairs stopped falling, and together with the shampoo as part of the treatment, I have a much better and stronger hair than I had 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I been using this hair vitamins but no different in my hair but will continue use it - I love the smell and continue using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received the shampoo and vitamin.  After only 1 wash, my hair feels great.  i have severe hair and scalp damage so i have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good product, time will tell if it works, hope that it does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some results on the second week that I was using this product. My hair was falling and nothing that I used before help. I highly recommend this product. Ben Hayyim</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this p product!!!! I was skeptical at first. &amp;#34;What?  Another hair pill, yeh right! I&#x27;ll just try for the fun of it then I will switch and use a popular brand hairfinity&amp;#34; To my surprise this pill really works! 1 month and 1 week! My nails are healthy and growing, my skin looks beautiful and my hair is growing and feels healthy as well. I have natural hair and this pill motivates me to continue grow my hair from the TWA stage. I am definitely going to continue using this product. Another thing that I forgot to mention, is that in addition to this product I am using a 5000mcg biotin supplement. Buyah! magic combination!!. Love ! Love!</li>
            <li> I believe that my hair is feeling fuller after only a month. I will know more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I am using Nourish Hair Growth Supplements along with the Shampoo. My hair is getting thicker and the texture is improving.  My hair is shinier and looks healthier. This is also helping my formerly brittle nails, which are now strong. I like that this product has quality ingredients and does no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is also great to work with. They have been very responsive when I have had a question. I appreciate no animal testing and part of their sales goes to charity.</li>
            <li> I just started taking these vitamins and I see a difference in the texture of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> It works perfect for me and I hear other people saying good review about it!!! It is all natural and healthy ingredients !!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I tried !!! I am wishing you a big success ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shafie</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift so idk how it is. It arrived on time tho and the friend likes it</li>
            <li> I bought these vitamins for my husband. At first, he has been reluctant to use. But since he started using them regularly, he has seen some improvements in the quality and texture of his hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say that he got his full hair back but this product is good to help maintain the hair (what is left). His hair looks and seems fuller as they are getting the nourishing they need with biotin and saw palmetto in vitamins. We will continue using them.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair and can usually never get it to grow past my shoulders. I decided to give these a try and Ive been taking 2 pills a day. First off Im amazed I can take these without food and get no nasty side effects like I do with other vitamins. No nasty after taste either! I honestly wasnt expecting anything because I have been dissapointed so many times before but while I was taking a shower today and washing my hair I noticed my hair left a little longer. I measured and wouldnt you know it my hair has grown about half an inch! I love it! I will update once I finish the bottle but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I must say it works. My hair was getting extremely thin on the back of my scalp. My hair has started to grow back, I have received compliments already from my wife and good friend that my hair looks way thicker. Very pleased, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free but it is still worth the money. I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing! You just have to take a vitamin for hair growth and watch it grow. I am sure there are many ladies out there that can relate with me when I say, that is amazing. Nourish made it happen! Great Job! I love the fact that this comes with a ebook (The Ultimate Hair Growth Guide) as well. What an amazing company, not only producing an amazing vitamin to assist with our hair growth but to also let us read up with a guide. I give this a 5 star AND I have to say, I have been in constant communication with the company and they are always will and able to answer and questions I may have had before purchasing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! They surpassed all my expectations unlike other companies I have purchased from! Thank You!</li>
            <li> JUST USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I&#x27;M 63 BUT MY HAIR FEELS LIKE IT DID WHEN I WAS 30 GREAT PRODUCT I&#x27;M RECOMMENDING TO MY WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li> I just doesnt work.... biggest waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying it again</li>
            <li> The first sight is very good.</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews I read, I was very excited about placing the order. When I opened the bottle and took out a tablet, I was surprised it had cracked. I took the next one and then the following one. They too were cracked. More than half of the tablets were cracked. I&#x27;m disappointed that for the amount I spent, I had to throw away half of the tablets away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working!!! Just ordered vitamin bottles #3 and 4.</li>
            <li> I thought this product Nourish Hair Growth worked pretty well for only one month.  I went from one regrowth product to this one and found no hair loss at all and it did appear that my hair actually felt thicker and came in faster than the one taken prior to this one.  Many are similar and I am always up for trying newer products and I was impressed with this one.  I had been taking one product for about 2 years and thought maybe a change would be needed and I&#x27;m glad I did. I will go back to buying it again in a few months.  I am currently trying another one.  So give me some time and I will be back with an honest opinion to all of you that have tried so many and have been disappointed.  I can send a picture of how thin my hair part was.  After chemo for 1 year my hair did grow back but very thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I just got my vitamins last week, but they seem to be working. I will be updating my review as time progresses to give you an update.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for about a week along with the vitamin shampoo sold by the same company. So far, I have experienced less hair loss in the shower. I even accused my husband of cleaning the drain!  Usually my hair is very coarse, but lately it has been super soft. The vitamins are large, but easy to swallow. I will update my review after a few more weeks of using these.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent vitamins to support hair growth.  We purchased this supplement&lt;br /&gt;in a promotion for testing and review.  The tablets contain essential vitamins,&lt;br /&gt;minerals and amino acids plus Biotin for hair growth.  The supplement is&lt;br /&gt;Gluten free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. It has helped with new hair growth as well as my nails. Defininately will keep using this product!!!</li>
            <li> Getting compliments on my nails and hair.  New hairstyle which was not possible before</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom for her hair loss and this really works. Her hair is growing an inch per week and we can say that it is a very good progress.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product thru Amazon that I placed. The first bottle worked really well that&#x27;s why I I ordered another. The second&lt;br /&gt;bottle was the problem.  Each pill in the bottle was cracked. It was like the powder in the middle of each was too much for the coating on the&lt;br /&gt;pills. May be on this batch they did not use enough coating to keep the powder together.  Just because of this is will not be ordering the item&lt;br /&gt;any more. But the product does work well. Already I&#x27;m using a different product.</li>
            <li> These products are working for me - and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  I&#x27;ve been taking the vitamins and using the shampoo for about 6 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since the first couple of weeks of using the products.  Literally no hair loss in the shower drain anymore and very little hair in my brush, so I know my hair is staying on my head instead of losing it.  I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34;, always just fine hair.  But I really noticed my hair being dull, flat and visibly thinner several months ago - could be hereditary, or menopause or age - but I wanted to do something about it.  I tried different shampoos, Rogaine, then Nioxin with absolutely nothing changing. After using the Nourish products my hair has incredible shine and more volume.  I&#x27;ll be ordering my 3rd bottle of vitamins soon, and know I&#x27;ll be using these products from now on.</li>
            <li> love love love this product!  Not only did it help my hair overall, my gray isn&#x27;t as gray....  very odd, but works for me!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product along with the Vitamins Shampoo before leaving a review. I have always had a problem with finding lots of hair around my home especially in my bathroom. My hair has also never grown fast which I always hated. Two week results are in and my hair has already grown half an inch and the hair loss has decreased tremendously! Will definitely continue to use these products!</li>
            <li> Nourish vitamins have many health benefits. Hair growth (in all the right places) is just one of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had pills for 2 weeks. Time will tell, but I am hopeful. Going to purchase shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I  purchased NOURISH  shampoo and vitamins on Amazon, I begin taking the vitamins and using the shampoo on 12/12/2014. Well  so far so good it has only been a week but I feel that I&#x27;m going to experience exceptional growth and healthy hair. My hair feels stronger, thicker and extremely hydrated.  The texture of my hair feels very smooth and enriched. I will update my progress and growth in 90 days.  I have fine textured hair 3b/ 4c luscious curls . I have no chemicals of any kind in my hair and I don&#x27;t use any heat.</li>
            <li> i DID NOT SEE THE DIFFERENCE YET</li>
            <li> Was excited till I saw that it really doesn&#x27;t have 6000 mcg of biotin!  Only 2000mcg!  If you announce that above in huge writing than I would hope it would be correct!  Lie from the start..</li>
            <li> Whoa! No facial breakouts! I dont know what it is, but some hair vitamins break me out (regardless of water intake). I always test them for a few days and see if I breakout. Thank goodness, there was no breakout at all. They are pretty big pill though; I wish they came in capsules so that they could be easier to swallow. They are a little more expensive compared to some brands, but it should be noted they also have more ingredients/vitamins than most bands. As far as hair length and strength-so far so good. I would need to complete the whole bottle before giving a conclusive review on that. However, I am having a great experience so far.</li>
            <li> great item!!  I have really seen an improvement in my hair strength and growing faster than usual!!</li>
            <li> Great supplement. Hair feels really soft and silky. Been taking them for over a month. Good results so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome love this works great . M S</li>
            <li> I first used this product on 02/03 and for the first week or so I was only taking 1 pill a day (the recommended is 2 a day). Since I wear tape-in hair extensions I can easily track hair growth - the last time I touched up my hair was 01/19 and since then my hair has grown a full inch… and that’s including the week and a half I wasn’t using Nourish Hair Loss Vitamins. Regularly my hair grows maybe a half an inch a month.. My hair isn’t thinning (yet) but I’ve also noticed new hair growth (hairline) and my hair feels/looks thicker - which is ALWAYS a plus with baby fine hair. I am not using/doing anything new besides taking this product, so I know that it’s the NOURISH hair pills causing my hair to grow faster and feel healthier!  I take the pills as the bottle directs and I have not experienced any negative side effects (like nausea).  I will note, I do NOT use the shampoo through this company because it is not sulfate free, if/when they introduce a sulfate free version I will be all over that like white on rice. Sulfates will not necessarily damage your hair and depending on you hair type - they may not affect your hair at all. My hair is so delicate that the difference between using sulfate-free and with-sulfate shampoo is noticeable…  Since my hair is so fine it’s also sooo easily damaged. Seriously, if I just look at it wrong the ends break off - and I’ve been struggling with this for about 8 years… Nov 2013 I bleached out 3 years of perm black dye and in Feb 2014 I did a quick 10 minute bleach job to get out more of the dark remaining dye. There’s a mere 1.5 inches left of that hair, everything else is new growth. For the last 12 months I have been EXTREME babying my hair…  ~ Prior to this product I was taking a 10 000 mg biotin pill daily and did not see any improvements in the rate of growth... ~ I’ve tried shampoos that claim to help hair grow faster (like Nisim FAST, with-sulfate and sulfate-free versions) but haven’t found one that makes my hair grow faster. ~ I use a product called Biosil but my hair did not grow any faster while using Biosil. I still use the product though because it’s good for joints, etc.  I do lead a healthy lifestyle.. I take an additional multivitamin, workout regularly, drink the daily recommended amount of water, 90% of what I eat is home cooked and non-processed, I don’t do drugs or smoke, no soda/juice - However, those habits are nothing new...  I am so excited to see where my hair growth progress is a few months from now - so much so it makes me teary-eyed thinking about it… We all have our insecurities and my hair is mine, if this pill helps change that - Well I don’t even have words for how grateful I will be.  ** Quick Update **  Prior to my discovery of tape in extensions I was wearing keratin bonded hair extensions (which are awful) for quite awhile. From time to time one would rip out leaving me with a bald spot and these spots were not growing in well/at all… Just the other night I put brand new tape-in extensions in and noticed little inch long sprouts of hair where the baldish spots had been!   Sorry for the long review, I hope it is helpful!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this production since last 20 days and my hair fall increased. I&#x27;m very unhappy with the purchase. Today decided to stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s making a difference. They taste bad and are way too big. However, I have forced myself to continue taking them consistently anyway, hoping that I&#x27;d finally found a product would work differently for me. Obviously, not everything works the same for everyone. I don&#x27;t plan to order a third bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin. I have tried many biotin vitamins in an effort to improve my hair loss and brittle nail issues and none can compare to this one. I&#x27;ve been taking these for a month n I hve seen dramatic results. It cost more than the hairfinity and nature valley vitamins but it&#x27;s well worth the money. So much so I have reordered. Also the shampoo is awesome too. I knw for a fact it&#x27;s the ingredients. I wear it as a leave in conditioner when I&#x27;m around the house.</li>
