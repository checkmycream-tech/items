    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>strips are not the greatest.</li>
            <li>it is still the ideal method</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Great concept for a product.</li>
            <li>If you have lots of time or just one or two hairs, this might work, otherwise, it&#x27;s a great concept</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great for my neck, and for my wife as well.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product for at-home waxing.</li>
            <li>BUT this product worked great for us, and I tested it on myself and my teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>However it took a good forty minutes for the wax to reach the desired temperature.</li>
            <li>comfort level for Tria &amp; Dermaroller - Made in USA]]are good ones.)  </li>
            <li>The epilator does a really good job</li>
            <li>The idea is good but there are some issues to work out.  </li>
            <li>and I would have liked some guidance for how to avoid this int</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those things we endure for the greater good...</li>
            <li>This review is based on my own experience using it on myself and others.</li>
            <li>You can rinse them in warm water and reuse them once or twice, but they start to fall apart after that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: go for it, but be ready to commit some time to figuring out how to make it work best for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I didn&#x27;t love this product, I do think it&#x27;s worth a try if you have the patience to figure out the best way to use it for your desired results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be very interested if this was GREATLY improved by Remington or another company.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that while the wax does get very warm, the QUALITY is not up to par with what you would be used to at hair and nail salons.</li>
            <li>Hey, those strips are huge!  </li>
            <li>Maybe this would work better on a Grizzly Bear.  </li>
            <li>course that&#x27;s a reference to the movie :), but that scene of Steve Carell getting his chest wax was all that I could think about as I ripped that strip off.  </li>
            <li>Okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried wax to remove hair, but thought this would be a better choice then a razor.</li>
            <li>Better results and faster using a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a roller at the top</li>
            <li>I have thicker hair than most.</li>
            <li>A better name would be Skippy and Sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this</li>
            <li>I have used pre-waxed strips, which don&#x27;t work at all, and microwave tub wax with paper strips which work ok.</li>
            <li>This wax works like the tub wax, maybe better for</li>
            <li>Maybe we got a better unit.</li>
            <li>At this point I stopped trying because the famous quote (source unverifiable) kept popping into my brain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the wax came up.  </li>
            <li>It stung more than anything but</li>
            <li>and all I&#x27;d say this is ok - if wax works for you</li>
            <li>I think it probably work better if you have a helper</li>
            <li>&amp; I can go over areas to make sure all the hair is removed.</li>
            <li>makes it work much better.</li>
            <li>It took a lot longer than the recommended 20 minutes to heat up (more like an hour).</li>
            <li>I had so many problems</li>
            <li>The Remington Roll-On Wax Kit took quite awhile to warm up sufficiently for use, although the gadget itself felt pretty warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>--their basically isn&#x27;t much-- nor surprisingly the sting of me ripping off the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you need to work fast to get good contact.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to come up with some redeeming qualities when it comes to the Roll-On Wax Kit, but the only thing good to say is the wax leaves a softer and more smooth leg than one gets with shaving.</li>
            <li>The roller worked fine for me, and the wax came out in a consistent-width strip.  </li>
            <li>but even there they would tell my my hair was just too fine for wax to work well.  </li>
            <li>I have sparse, fine body hair which may be the problem - it just did not seem to grab a hold of it, at all, even with repeated efforts.</li>
            <li>As the wax is heating I invert the holder whenever I walk by to help the wax heat more evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, easy to use, dispensed wax well for me, easy to clean up and store, and seems made well.  </li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to do this as I figured it would hurt), taking about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I did a strip on my stomach, but because I enjoy what comes in six-packs</li>
            <li>way to keep legs smooth.</li>
            <li>On Wax Kit is that it is neither smooth nor silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight we are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I looked at my leg expecting to see a silky smooth area, but instead I saw hair.  </li>
            <li>It did go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps users with coarser hair would experience more success.</li>
            <li>directions say to plug in and allow to warm for 20 minutes and if that isn&#x27;t warm enough to add another 5 or so.</li>
            <li>The idea of this wax kit is good but the actual product has many shortcomings.</li>
            <li>The applicator didn&#x27;t distribute the wax very nicely but that&#x27;s only the beginning.</li>
            <li>First, the good was that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.</li>
            <li>Once warmed up, the part where you pick it up isn&#x27;t very hot at all and was easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I quickly stuck on the paper strip, pressed and smoothed the paper into the wax and hair, and yanked the paper free in one smooth motion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that I&#x27;m never...</li>
            <li>(She was really excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I let my daughter do the &#x27;ripping&#x27; this time as she was excited to see if she could cause me pain, and make me squeal  </li>
            <li>practice, it is clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Remington smooth and silky electric roll on wax kit looks pretty, and heats up really easy...</li>
            <li>The wax was very sticky and seemed not to want to roll on very smoothly even after 30 minutes in the warmer.</li>
            <li>I also wonder if I might get better at it or figure it out more clearly with more experience, but I can&#x27;t really know that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, MAYBE if you have extremely fine hair, it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>What a cool idea...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the process we used was to heat for the full 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you have the strips ready to put over the wax - don&#x27;t dilly dally.  </li>
            <li>Pull it off really fast to get the most hair</li>
            <li>It hurt a bit but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Also, the unit is pretty compact and easy to manage/store.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)</li>
            <li>The first thing you need to know about the Remington Smooth and Silky Electric Roll-</li>
            <li>if you want the best job possible, I found this to be a fine little wax kit that was easy enough to use and about as effective as any wax kit one could hope for.  </li>
            <li>I liked the roll-on nature (significantly less messy than many another method) and the whole kit was wonderfully compact and idiot-proof.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s detailed instructions on the actual procedure to follow - they are VERY easy.  </li>
            <li>Good lord, I don&#x27;t want to wait that long!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)t be worth a look.  </li>
            <li>, this is a very neat, easy way to do it.  </li>
            <li>The wax really does wipe away easily with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I really want something that removes hair and is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take hours to do from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that rolling the wax over the same exact strip of skin 3 times before applying the paper left the perfect amount of wax</li>
            <li>because shaving isn&#x27;t fun either</li>
            <li>The warm liquid wax rolls onto clean, dry skin in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>It probably had the same &#x27;pulling&#x27; power as scotch tape, which is to say, not at all effective for waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, effective, alnd does its job.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why we had success where others ran into problems.</li>
            <li>No one product is right for every person.</li>
            <li>The unit keeps it at the right temp.</li>
            <li>so her fine blonde leg hair came out easily.  </li>
            <li>Once I tried it from the top down, my results were much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li>4 Oz Topical Anesthetic proven more effective than Emla Numbing Cream for Tattoo, Electrolysis, Piercing, Brazilian Waxing at European Wax Centers - Max.</li>
            <li>I kept it plugged in so that the wax didn&#x27;t cool too much &amp; did another strip.  </li>
            <li>Although I find it easy and clean, a lot of people disagree, but once again, if one product worked for everyone, there would only be one product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used with a model with very little growth and fine hair, this is not as an effective of a method.</li>
            <li>For you seasoned waxers, it&#x27;s nothing.  </li>
            <li>but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I tried this Remington Electric Roll-On Wax Kit on several parts of my body, and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>actual leg hair is sparse, but I let it grow for more than 7 days before I tried this.  </li>
            <li>So, I am rating it a two for my experience, but the rating might be significantly better from a user with a different hair type.</li>
            <li>The long hair issue is one most non-waxers won&#x27;t be able to get over; and I&#x27;ve never waxes consistently enough to know if your hair will in fact become finer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can imagine heating up a block of wax in an old pot, or using one of those mini crock-pots to keep it warm next to you as you go about waxing.  </li>
            <li>Second, the wax takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to warm up and even after 45 minutes of waiting, the wax still wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do a thorough job removing hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After that stunning defeat, I decided to check on a new theory: Maybe Video Reviewer is not Italian.</li>
            <li>Anesthetic - Strong Fast Acting POWER NUMB® - 1x10g - Lidocaine 5%</li>
            <li>Even my eyebrows do not wax well, it seems I am covered in ultra fine white fuzz that the wax just won&#x27;t stick to.  </li>
            <li>found it easy to use, and each cloth strip can be re-used a few times, just hand wash in water warm enough to remove the remaining wax.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re already a dedicated hot waxer, then I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I tried it on my legs but did not see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>You can regulate how much comes out by how much pressure you use.</li>
            <li>I saw this product, I was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li>So I tried it on the peach fuzz on my arm instead, and that worked reasonably well.</li>
            <li>14 had experimented with shaving before, but really hasn&#x27;t had to do it</li>
            <li>very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I will play with it to see if it the problem is as much attributable to my lack of technique as it is with the system</li>
            <li>Although I really wanted to like the product, it just did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your wax will be ready.</li>
            <li>that too much to ask for?</li>
            <li>thing that I liked was that you can unplug the unit and take it to the bathroom with you and it will stay hot long enough to get the job</li>
            <li>The wax took a while to get hot, more than half an hour.  </li>
            <li>Also, as with any similar product, it does not work well on short hair or super fine hair, and this unit is NOT meant for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried anyway, but sure enough, NOT A SINGLE HAIR WAS REMOVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>left the wax plugged in for nearly an hour, and when I began rolling it on, it was easy</li>
            <li>It took me a few different tries to figure out how to best use this.</li>
            <li>Once I got past the frustration level of first-time use, there were some things I liked about this product.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with professional waxing and at-home microwaveable kits, and thought the idea of this product is great - neatly roll on the wax rather than spread it on with a stick, but the execution was disappointing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to waxing, want to try something different, or are just looking for a convenient and cheap way to torture your younger siblings when the parents are away, then this might be worth a look.  </li>
            <li>It warmed up quick enough (granted</li>
            <li>You have to work quickly with any wax, this is no different.</li>
            <li>I rolled the wax back &amp; forth over my leg to make sure I had enough wax on</li>
            <li>I was mildly irritated as I waited around the extra time needed for it to</li>
            <li>But I do want to say upfront that I have very oily hair and skin, so this natural oil may be keeping the wax from doing its job</li>
            <li>For the price (only $20), I think it&#x27;s not a bad product, and if you can&#x27;t afford salon waxing and want to do it yourself, this is an option that could work for you provided that you developed some expertise (which I apparently lack) or were willing to be patient and work with it over time to remove all hair.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair shaved pretty short, and since it doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore (not at all in some places), my wife will wax my neck on occasion.</li>
            <li>but it does get more firm</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did an OK job but not all the hair was removed and I&#x27;m not talking just a few stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going through the trouble &amp; expense of waxing, I want more hair removed.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully it will last longer which will make it worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire process of how to do the waxing is easy and explained well in the short instruction book.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have new found respect for Steve, and for all of you ladies out there that wax.  </li>
            <li>have a feeling that, with repeated use, this might work fine overall, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use it repeatedly in a short time on the same area (especially for facial hair) as it would damage your skin.</li>
            <li>I am blonde with very fine hair on my legs, it is almost not worth removing.</li>
            <li>(it got stickier as I continued, but at least at first it was easy).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure a better solution exists for waxing.</li>
            <li>Generic replacements are cheap, or you can tear an old sheet or similar into strips and reuse indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have ultra fine hair like I do, and wax hasn&#x27;t done much for you in the past, this might not work for you either.</li>
            <li>wax was not hot enough to burn, but warm enough to work with.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of a roll on, less mess, easier application, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my pot of wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll skip the torture treatment and go straight for the razor next time.</li>
            <li>and I do not have a lot of body hair naturally.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>As you can see in the video, the model has considerable growth on her legs.</li>
            <li>I just KNEW it wasn&#x27;t going to work because the wax, even after 20+ minutes of heating, was far too clumpy and sticky BUT NOT ADHESIVE TO HAIR.</li>
            <li>I watched the video review on this product and felt empowered to give it a shot... despite the many negative reviews, I thought I could just follow the video reviewer&#x27;s tips and be successful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but as far as hair removal goes, it does not work well for my hair.</li>
            <li>While having a professional do</li>
            <li>Hair came off and her skin was so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This part of the process actually worked reasonable well.  </li>
            <li>Plug it in, and 20 minutes later the wax is ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not being a complete masochist, I used the time to slather numbing cream over myself.</li>
            <li>Going over the area to be stripped three or four times helped considerably.</li>
            <li>Then on my third try I figured out that letting it heat up for 30-40 mins and leaving it plugged in the whole time</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother testing it at various intervals to see if it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just waiting to see if the hair removal really does last six weeks.</li>
            <li>and I am really relieved to know I am not the only one.</li>
            <li>tried a few more times with different thickness of wax, but my results were always unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li>But whatever mess there is with this kit is contained and easier to clean up.</li>
            <li>Once it got hot, it was easy to roll on my leg but since the hair on my legs is really thin, I couldn’t pull it out.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- be ready to take a shower as soon as you&#x27;re done, there is no other way to remove extra wax from your body</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with waxing and there were some good points and bad ones.</li>
            <li>B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Facial Wax Hair Remover, 0.50 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>First, it tries to solve the wax-dripping-all-over-the-place issue.</li>
            <li>I love the idea and would try again, but this just left to much hair behind, if I&#x27;m going to go through the process and the pain</li>
            <li>I have used the typical microwave wax and thought this would be a great alternative (less mess).  </li>
            <li>The product has potential and seemed promising during the heating and application process but for some reason it simply did not remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li>I hate doing all three of these things, but if you have to do it, then get a proper tool, take your time, and learn to use the tool to the best of your ability.  </li>
            <li>heated the wax for approximately 45 minutes till it was warm and fluid.  </li>
            <li>kit might work better if you have a lot of thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For one, it takes forever to heat up (it still wasn&#x27;t &#x27;smooth&#x27; even after letting it heat up twice as long as instructed), and it cools down in about 2-3 minutes (not even close to the promised 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the results did not last six weeks (as the product claims) on very little hair that I was able to wax.</li>
            <li>The wax didn&#x27;t roll on very well, so not much hair came off my legs.</li>
            <li>At least the wax did come off easily, but it was totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inexperienced waxing (aside from a flirtation with Nad&#x27;s in the 90s, and another attempt every few years), and was still able to apply a large smear and fumble around for the strips before it dried.</li>
            <li>(it was not super hot).  </li>
            <li>much more serious problem occurred when I actually attempted hair removal -- it simply did not work.</li>
            <li>Even after I got it hot enough, it was extremely difficult to roll on in a smooth, even layer.  </li>
            <li>While it did take almost twice as long as specified (35 min vs the 20 in the manual), it applies a relatively clean, very even, thin layer of wax.</li>
            <li>Having the wax dispenser and heating element all in one unit is handy, and I did find it to be less messy than other waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The roll on system was awkward at best and the wax did not seem thick enough.</li>
            <li>and finally I was able to get some of that thin hair after three strips on the same spot.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to set up and is less messy than the microwave waxing systems.</li>
            <li>Really wasn&#x27;t a mess</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> strips are not the greatest.</li>
            <li> it is still the ideal method</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Great concept for a product.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of time or just one or two hairs, this might work, otherwise, it&#x27;s a great concept</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for my neck, and for my wife as well.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product for at-home waxing.</li>
            <li> BUT this product worked great for us, and I tested it on myself and my teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> However it took a good forty minutes for the wax to reach the desired temperature.</li>
            <li> comfort level for Tria &amp; Dermaroller - Made in USA]]are good ones.)  </li>
            <li> The epilator does a really good job</li>
            <li> The idea is good but there are some issues to work out.  </li>
            <li> and I would have liked some guidance for how to avoid this int</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those things we endure for the greater good...</li>
            <li> This review is based on my own experience using it on myself and others.</li>
            <li> You can rinse them in warm water and reuse them once or twice, but they start to fall apart after that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: go for it, but be ready to commit some time to figuring out how to make it work best for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I didn&#x27;t love this product, I do think it&#x27;s worth a try if you have the patience to figure out the best way to use it for your desired results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be very interested if this was GREATLY improved by Remington or another company.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that while the wax does get very warm, the QUALITY is not up to par with what you would be used to at hair and nail salons.</li>
            <li> Hey, those strips are huge!  </li>
            <li> Maybe this would work better on a Grizzly Bear.  </li>
            <li> course that&#x27;s a reference to the movie :), but that scene of Steve Carell getting his chest wax was all that I could think about as I ripped that strip off.  </li>
            <li> Okay,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried wax to remove hair, but thought this would be a better choice then a razor.</li>
            <li> Better results and faster using a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a roller at the top</li>
            <li> I have thicker hair than most.</li>
            <li> A better name would be Skippy and Sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this</li>
            <li> I have used pre-waxed strips, which don&#x27;t work at all, and microwave tub wax with paper strips which work ok.</li>
            <li> This wax works like the tub wax, maybe better for</li>
            <li> Maybe we got a better unit.</li>
            <li> At this point I stopped trying because the famous quote (source unverifiable) kept popping into my brain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the wax came up.  </li>
            <li> It stung more than anything but</li>
            <li> and all I&#x27;d say this is ok - if wax works for you</li>
            <li> I think it probably work better if you have a helper</li>
            <li> &amp; I can go over areas to make sure all the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> makes it work much better.</li>
            <li> It took a lot longer than the recommended 20 minutes to heat up (more like an hour).</li>
            <li> I had so many problems</li>
            <li> The Remington Roll-On Wax Kit took quite awhile to warm up sufficiently for use, although the gadget itself felt pretty warm to the touch.</li>
            <li> --their basically isn&#x27;t much-- nor surprisingly the sting of me ripping off the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you need to work fast to get good contact.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to come up with some redeeming qualities when it comes to the Roll-On Wax Kit, but the only thing good to say is the wax leaves a softer and more smooth leg than one gets with shaving.</li>
            <li> The roller worked fine for me, and the wax came out in a consistent-width strip.  </li>
            <li> but even there they would tell my my hair was just too fine for wax to work well.  </li>
            <li> I have sparse, fine body hair which may be the problem - it just did not seem to grab a hold of it, at all, even with repeated efforts.</li>
            <li> As the wax is heating I invert the holder whenever I walk by to help the wax heat more evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, easy to use, dispensed wax well for me, easy to clean up and store, and seems made well.  </li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to do this as I figured it would hurt), taking about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I did a strip on my stomach, but because I enjoy what comes in six-packs</li>
            <li> way to keep legs smooth.</li>
            <li> On Wax Kit is that it is neither smooth nor silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight we are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I looked at my leg expecting to see a silky smooth area, but instead I saw hair.  </li>
            <li> It did go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps users with coarser hair would experience more success.</li>
            <li> directions say to plug in and allow to warm for 20 minutes and if that isn&#x27;t warm enough to add another 5 or so.</li>
            <li> The idea of this wax kit is good but the actual product has many shortcomings.</li>
            <li> The applicator didn&#x27;t distribute the wax very nicely but that&#x27;s only the beginning.</li>
            <li> First, the good was that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.</li>
            <li> Once warmed up, the part where you pick it up isn&#x27;t very hot at all and was easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I quickly stuck on the paper strip, pressed and smoothed the paper into the wax and hair, and yanked the paper free in one smooth motion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that I&#x27;m never...</li>
            <li> (She was really excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I let my daughter do the &#x27;ripping&#x27; this time as she was excited to see if she could cause me pain, and make me squeal  </li>
            <li> practice, it is clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Remington smooth and silky electric roll on wax kit looks pretty, and heats up really easy...</li>
            <li> The wax was very sticky and seemed not to want to roll on very smoothly even after 30 minutes in the warmer.</li>
            <li> I also wonder if I might get better at it or figure it out more clearly with more experience, but I can&#x27;t really know that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, MAYBE if you have extremely fine hair, it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> What a cool idea...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the process we used was to heat for the full 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure you have the strips ready to put over the wax - don&#x27;t dilly dally.  </li>
            <li> Pull it off really fast to get the most hair</li>
            <li> It hurt a bit but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Also, the unit is pretty compact and easy to manage/store.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)</li>
            <li> The first thing you need to know about the Remington Smooth and Silky Electric Roll-</li>
            <li> if you want the best job possible, I found this to be a fine little wax kit that was easy enough to use and about as effective as any wax kit one could hope for.  </li>
            <li> I liked the roll-on nature (significantly less messy than many another method) and the whole kit was wonderfully compact and idiot-proof.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s detailed instructions on the actual procedure to follow - they are VERY easy.  </li>
            <li> Good lord, I don&#x27;t want to wait that long!</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)t be worth a look.  </li>
            <li> , this is a very neat, easy way to do it.  </li>
            <li> The wax really does wipe away easily with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I really want something that removes hair and is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take hours to do from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that rolling the wax over the same exact strip of skin 3 times before applying the paper left the perfect amount of wax</li>
            <li> because shaving isn&#x27;t fun either</li>
            <li> The warm liquid wax rolls onto clean, dry skin in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> It probably had the same &#x27;pulling&#x27; power as scotch tape, which is to say, not at all effective for waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, effective, alnd does its job.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why we had success where others ran into problems.</li>
            <li> No one product is right for every person.</li>
            <li> The unit keeps it at the right temp.</li>
            <li> so her fine blonde leg hair came out easily.  </li>
            <li> Once I tried it from the top down, my results were much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li> 4 Oz Topical Anesthetic proven more effective than Emla Numbing Cream for Tattoo, Electrolysis, Piercing, Brazilian Waxing at European Wax Centers - Max.</li>
            <li> I kept it plugged in so that the wax didn&#x27;t cool too much &amp; did another strip.  </li>
            <li> Although I find it easy and clean, a lot of people disagree, but once again, if one product worked for everyone, there would only be one product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used with a model with very little growth and fine hair, this is not as an effective of a method.</li>
            <li> For you seasoned waxers, it&#x27;s nothing.  </li>
            <li> but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I tried this Remington Electric Roll-On Wax Kit on several parts of my body, and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> actual leg hair is sparse, but I let it grow for more than 7 days before I tried this.  </li>
            <li> So, I am rating it a two for my experience, but the rating might be significantly better from a user with a different hair type.</li>
            <li> The long hair issue is one most non-waxers won&#x27;t be able to get over; and I&#x27;ve never waxes consistently enough to know if your hair will in fact become finer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can imagine heating up a block of wax in an old pot, or using one of those mini crock-pots to keep it warm next to you as you go about waxing.  </li>
            <li> Second, the wax takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to warm up and even after 45 minutes of waiting, the wax still wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do a thorough job removing hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After that stunning defeat, I decided to check on a new theory: Maybe Video Reviewer is not Italian.</li>
            <li> Anesthetic - Strong Fast Acting POWER NUMB® - 1x10g - Lidocaine 5%</li>
            <li> Even my eyebrows do not wax well, it seems I am covered in ultra fine white fuzz that the wax just won&#x27;t stick to.  </li>
            <li> found it easy to use, and each cloth strip can be re-used a few times, just hand wash in water warm enough to remove the remaining wax.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already a dedicated hot waxer, then I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I tried it on my legs but did not see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> You can regulate how much comes out by how much pressure you use.</li>
            <li> I saw this product, I was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li> So I tried it on the peach fuzz on my arm instead, and that worked reasonably well.</li>
            <li> 14 had experimented with shaving before, but really hasn&#x27;t had to do it</li>
            <li> very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will play with it to see if it the problem is as much attributable to my lack of technique as it is with the system</li>
            <li> Although I really wanted to like the product, it just did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your wax will be ready.</li>
            <li> that too much to ask for?</li>
            <li> thing that I liked was that you can unplug the unit and take it to the bathroom with you and it will stay hot long enough to get the job</li>
            <li> The wax took a while to get hot, more than half an hour.  </li>
            <li> Also, as with any similar product, it does not work well on short hair or super fine hair, and this unit is NOT meant for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried anyway, but sure enough, NOT A SINGLE HAIR WAS REMOVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> left the wax plugged in for nearly an hour, and when I began rolling it on, it was easy</li>
            <li> It took me a few different tries to figure out how to best use this.</li>
            <li> Once I got past the frustration level of first-time use, there were some things I liked about this product.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with professional waxing and at-home microwaveable kits, and thought the idea of this product is great - neatly roll on the wax rather than spread it on with a stick, but the execution was disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to waxing, want to try something different, or are just looking for a convenient and cheap way to torture your younger siblings when the parents are away, then this might be worth a look.  </li>
            <li> It warmed up quick enough (granted</li>
            <li> You have to work quickly with any wax, this is no different.</li>
            <li> I rolled the wax back &amp; forth over my leg to make sure I had enough wax on</li>
            <li> I was mildly irritated as I waited around the extra time needed for it to</li>
            <li> But I do want to say upfront that I have very oily hair and skin, so this natural oil may be keeping the wax from doing its job</li>
            <li> For the price (only $20), I think it&#x27;s not a bad product, and if you can&#x27;t afford salon waxing and want to do it yourself, this is an option that could work for you provided that you developed some expertise (which I apparently lack) or were willing to be patient and work with it over time to remove all hair.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair shaved pretty short, and since it doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore (not at all in some places), my wife will wax my neck on occasion.</li>
            <li> but it does get more firm</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did an OK job but not all the hair was removed and I&#x27;m not talking just a few stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going through the trouble &amp; expense of waxing, I want more hair removed.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully it will last longer which will make it worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The entire process of how to do the waxing is easy and explained well in the short instruction book.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have new found respect for Steve, and for all of you ladies out there that wax.  </li>
            <li> have a feeling that, with repeated use, this might work fine overall, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use it repeatedly in a short time on the same area (especially for facial hair) as it would damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with very fine hair on my legs, it is almost not worth removing.</li>
            <li> (it got stickier as I continued, but at least at first it was easy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure a better solution exists for waxing.</li>
            <li> Generic replacements are cheap, or you can tear an old sheet or similar into strips and reuse indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have ultra fine hair like I do, and wax hasn&#x27;t done much for you in the past, this might not work for you either.</li>
            <li> wax was not hot enough to burn, but warm enough to work with.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of a roll on, less mess, easier application, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my pot of wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll skip the torture treatment and go straight for the razor next time.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a lot of body hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> As you can see in the video, the model has considerable growth on her legs.</li>
            <li> I just KNEW it wasn&#x27;t going to work because the wax, even after 20+ minutes of heating, was far too clumpy and sticky BUT NOT ADHESIVE TO HAIR.</li>
            <li> I watched the video review on this product and felt empowered to give it a shot... despite the many negative reviews, I thought I could just follow the video reviewer&#x27;s tips and be successful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but as far as hair removal goes, it does not work well for my hair.</li>
            <li> While having a professional do</li>
            <li> Hair came off and her skin was so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This part of the process actually worked reasonable well.  </li>
            <li> Plug it in, and 20 minutes later the wax is ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not being a complete masochist, I used the time to slather numbing cream over myself.</li>
            <li> Going over the area to be stripped three or four times helped considerably.</li>
            <li> Then on my third try I figured out that letting it heat up for 30-40 mins and leaving it plugged in the whole time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother testing it at various intervals to see if it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just waiting to see if the hair removal really does last six weeks.</li>
            <li> and I am really relieved to know I am not the only one.</li>
            <li> tried a few more times with different thickness of wax, but my results were always unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li> But whatever mess there is with this kit is contained and easier to clean up.</li>
            <li> Once it got hot, it was easy to roll on my leg but since the hair on my legs is really thin, I couldn’t pull it out.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- be ready to take a shower as soon as you&#x27;re done, there is no other way to remove extra wax from your body</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with waxing and there were some good points and bad ones.</li>
            <li> B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Facial Wax Hair Remover, 0.50 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> First, it tries to solve the wax-dripping-all-over-the-place issue.</li>
            <li> I love the idea and would try again, but this just left to much hair behind, if I&#x27;m going to go through the process and the pain</li>
            <li> I have used the typical microwave wax and thought this would be a great alternative (less mess).  </li>
            <li> The product has potential and seemed promising during the heating and application process but for some reason it simply did not remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I hate doing all three of these things, but if you have to do it, then get a proper tool, take your time, and learn to use the tool to the best of your ability.  </li>
            <li> heated the wax for approximately 45 minutes till it was warm and fluid.  </li>
            <li> kit might work better if you have a lot of thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For one, it takes forever to heat up (it still wasn&#x27;t &#x27;smooth&#x27; even after letting it heat up twice as long as instructed), and it cools down in about 2-3 minutes (not even close to the promised 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the results did not last six weeks (as the product claims) on very little hair that I was able to wax.</li>
            <li> The wax didn&#x27;t roll on very well, so not much hair came off my legs.</li>
            <li> At least the wax did come off easily, but it was totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inexperienced waxing (aside from a flirtation with Nad&#x27;s in the 90s, and another attempt every few years), and was still able to apply a large smear and fumble around for the strips before it dried.</li>
            <li> (it was not super hot).  </li>
            <li> much more serious problem occurred when I actually attempted hair removal -- it simply did not work.</li>
            <li> Even after I got it hot enough, it was extremely difficult to roll on in a smooth, even layer.  </li>
            <li> While it did take almost twice as long as specified (35 min vs the 20 in the manual), it applies a relatively clean, very even, thin layer of wax.</li>
            <li> Having the wax dispenser and heating element all in one unit is handy, and I did find it to be less messy than other waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The roll on system was awkward at best and the wax did not seem thick enough.</li>
            <li> and finally I was able to get some of that thin hair after three strips on the same spot.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to set up and is less messy than the microwave waxing systems.</li>
            <li> Really wasn&#x27;t a mess</li>
            <li> The first hurdle to get past is waiting for it to heat up; as another reviewer mentioned, just let it go for a long time and come back to it.  </li>
            <li> Even then, it was hard to get out very much wax at a time.</li>
            <li> So I knew that it would be difficult to find a wax system that would actually catch all my fine hair.</li>
            <li> You can get wax too hot, wax dripping all over place, wax hard to remove from your skin, and lack the overall dexterity and careful attention and patience required to get the job done</li>
            <li> I quickly pressed the thick paper down on the wax and yanked at about a 30degree angle.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the hair was removed only in spots in which there was enough wax on the strip that it seeped through to the other side.</li>
            <li> bad part was that it was inconsistently effective</li>
            <li> However, the guide is so minimal that it does not offer such help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I say &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; because the texture was really strange.</li>
            <li> recommend ignoring the directions about how long to let the wax heat.</li>
            <li> How long do you have to wait for it to heat up?</li>
            <li> but I prefer waxing due to the longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, unlike methods for recently shaved/fine hair, this is 100%</li>
            <li> I tried different temperatures, dryness of the wax, even other strips that I had</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little black cap on the wax that you have to take off when you first get it - other than that there is no real assembly or bother.  </li>
            <li> I had to shower off because there were a few tiny bits left that were sticky.  </li>
            <li> Starting with the clunky shape that is too hard to hold and maneuver when applying wax to smaller areas like the upper lip or sides of the face.</li>
            <li> Usually at hair and nail salons, they used soft, cotton strips.</li>
            <li> (Yeah, I&#x27;m only half joking about that torture thing</li>
            <li> (Yeah, I&#x27;m only half joking about that torture thing</li>
            <li> I have waxed for years and have gotten to the point where I only have to shave a little.  </li>
            <li> I imagine ripping hair out by the roots rather painfully, but this didn&#x27;t really hurt much at all (it helps if you do as the instructions say and hold skin taut).</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> This is just another approach that tries to simplify things.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using a few times, I have a tip if the wax isn&#x27;t coming out enough.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s ever tried to do waxing at home knows how messy the entire process can get.</li>
            <li> Do a few strips of wax-and-remove, and then plug the unit back in for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> I am not very hairy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the consistency of the wax or the material the waxing strips are made of, but not all hairs are removed, no matter how carefully you follow</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re finished, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a loofah or other scrubber on the waxed area for awhile to keep those hair follicles from getting clogged, which can lead to very painful ingrown</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no mess.</li>
            <li> I finally got the wax hot enough, I was frustrated because even with careful following of instructions, very little of the hair on my legs was coming off.</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t compare this to other ways of doing it.  </li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, trembled in fear at the sight of them and wussed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other area</li>
            <li> In small areas, I did manage (sort of), but in larger areas, it was a joke.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It was EXTREMELY neat for a wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> So if it doesn&#x27;t work for you one direction, try the other.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other waxing methods before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to.</li>
            <li> When you take a sub-par waxing product that results in a substantial amount of hair left behind that you then have to shave, you&#x27;ve essentially tortured yourself for no reason.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second time I attempted to try it was a complete fail.</li>
            <li> You will use significantly less wax and the mess is minimal (but, still wax, so expect a learning curve to handle it</li>
            <li> Waxing is not fun.</li>
            <li> I let this heat for about 45 minutes: it was not warm enough at 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t thick enough to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> I cut one down to size.  </li>
            <li> This is unfortunate, though, because waxing is something few people want to anticipate and look forward to, and as with any other heating element, you really don&#x27;t want to turn it on and forget about it.  </li>
            <li> About half the hair in the treated area was on the paper, and the other half of the hair was still firmly attached to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I was trying this out laying down on a bed, the container stayed upright without any mess when I set it off to the side in order to put on a waxing strip.  </li>
            <li> Remove the cartridge and press the wax out slightly, like a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But they seriously need to improve the quality of the wax and the &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; waxing strips so that they actually do the job of waxing.</li>
            <li> let the wax heat about half an hour and keep the unit plugged in while you are waxing&lt;br</li>
            <li> About half the hair in the treated section hadn&#x27;t been yanked out.  </li>
            <li> This kit promised in home convenience with less fuss and muss.  </li>
            <li> And half the time, it didn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> pull your skin tight to apply the wax as well as to remove&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to an inferior wax or an inadequate amount applied by the roller but</li>
            <li> I tried it on my forearms and it rolled on a little bit here, a littler bit there, with missed patches</li>
            <li> And that it worked for us with little fuss or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this one per the instructions with little luck.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just make a mess and waste the waxing strips that come with</li>
            <li> mean, not one single hair came off.</li>
            <li> short, this it itself will not win any converts to waxing, but if you&#x27;re already waxing with a tongue depressor and the microwave, buy it now.</li>
            <li> I can understand missing a couple of hairs, but taking off?</li>

            <li> It was closer to thirty-five minutes which although not a huge issue, did not start things off well.</li>
            <li> But alas, the hair removed was minimal, not really worth the effort and inconvenience of scrubbing sticky wax remnants off.</li>

            <li> Maybe she does not have thick, well-rooted hair.</li>
            <li> The roll on applicator does not distribute a thick amount of wax, and as a result hair removal on areas of my arms and legs is spotty, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was my first experience with waxing and there were some good points and bad ones. First, the good was that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all. I imagine ripping hair out by the roots rather painfully, but this didn&#x27;t really hurt much at all (it helps if you do as the instructions say and hold skin taut). Also, the unit is pretty compact and easy to manage/store. The entire process of how to do the waxing is easy and explained well in the short instruction book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part was that it was inconsistently effective and I&#x27;m not sure why. The wax was very sticky and seemed not to want to roll on very smoothly even after 30 minutes in the warmer. Perhaps I needed to wait longer, but the instructions said &amp;#34;less than 20 minutes&amp;#34;. I noticed that the hair was removed only in spots in which there was enough wax on the strip that it seeped through to the other side. If the wax wasn&#x27;t leeching through, then no hair came off. So, it removed well in some places, but not in others and I would have liked some guidance for how to avoid this int he future. However, the guide is so minimal that it does not offer such help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that, with repeated use, this might work fine overall, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use it repeatedly in a short time on the same area (especially for facial hair) as it would damage your skin. I also wonder if I might get better at it or figure it out more clearly with more experience, but I can&#x27;t really know that. For the price (only $20), I think it&#x27;s not a bad product, and if you can&#x27;t afford salon waxing and want to do it yourself, this is an option that could work for you provided that you developed some expertise (which I apparently lack) or were willing to be patient and work with it over time to remove all hair.</li>
            <li> Waxing is not fun. It&#x27;s one of those things we endure for the greater good... because shaving isn&#x27;t fun either but I prefer waxing due to the longer lasting results. When you take a sub-par waxing product that results in a substantial amount of hair left behind that you then have to shave, you&#x27;ve essentially tortured yourself for no reason. That&#x27;s basically what we have here. The product has potential and seemed promising during the heating and application process but for some reason it simply did not remove all of the hair. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to an inferior wax or an inadequate amount applied by the roller but either way the end result was frustrating. Would I use this product again? No thanks. If I&#x27;m going to have to shave anyway I&#x27;ll skip the torture treatment and go straight for the razor next time.</li>
            <li> Maybe this would work better on a Grizzly Bear.  I don&#x27;t think I have enough hair for it to pull anything out.  The wax took a bit of time to heat up and I tried it on my legs but did not see much of a difference.  I wanted this to work well but I cannot say that it does.  If it did, my wife could stop going to the salon but I doubt she would allow her hair to grow to Grizzly Bear proportions to use this and I do not have a lot of body hair naturally.  Sorry but if you want salon results, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12PJ47CDFZFS7]]Of course that&#x27;s a reference to the movie :), but that scene of Steve Carell getting his chest wax was all that I could think about as I ripped that strip off.  \\&quot;&amp;iquest;C&amp;oacute;mo se llama?!!\\&quot;  Eeeeyaaah!  \\&quot;Kelly Clarkson!\\&quot;  Wow.  Just...wow.  I have new found respect for Steve, and for all of you ladies out there that wax.  I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that I&#x27;m never...ever...going to do that again.  I did a strip on my stomach, but because I enjoy what comes in six-packs - I don&#x27;t have one.  So, I&#x27;m not showing off a video of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title implies, I&#x27;ve never waxed before.  Anything.  Ever.  So, I can&#x27;t compare this to other ways of doing it.  I can imagine heating up a block of wax in an old pot, or using one of those mini crock-pots to keep it warm next to you as you go about waxing.  This is just another approach that tries to simplify things.  It warmed up quick enough (granted, I wasn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to do this as I figured it would hurt), taking about 20 minutes.  Once warmed up, the part where you pick it up isn&#x27;t very hot at all and was easy to handle.  The roller worked fine for me, and the wax came out in a consistent-width strip.  Even though I was trying this out laying down on a bed, the container stayed upright without any mess when I set it off to the side in order to put on a waxing strip.  Well, part of a waxing strip.  Okay, yeah - I cheated.  I cut one down to size.  Hey, those strips are huge!  For you seasoned waxers, it&#x27;s nothing.  I, on the other hand, trembled in fear at the sight of them and wussed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, easy to use, dispensed wax well for me, easy to clean up and store, and seems made well.  At $20, it&#x27;s not too pricey, either.  If you like your current waxing method, there&#x27;s probably no reason to try this.  If you&#x27;re new to waxing, want to try something different, or are just looking for a convenient and cheap way to torture your younger siblings when the parents are away, then this might be worth a look.  (Yeah, I&#x27;m only half joking about that torture thing - I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)t be worth a look.  (Yeah, I&#x27;m only half joking about that torture thing - I&#x27;m counting my lucky stars that my brothers didn&#x27;t have access to one of these.)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8ff3364baca49ac828e5a3f35061324f]] Let me start by saying that this product worked for me. It may not work for YOU. No one product is right for every person. This review is based on my own experience using it on myself and others. As you can see in the video, the model has considerable growth on her legs. When used with a model with very little growth and fine hair, this is not as an effective of a method. On the other hand, unlike methods for recently shaved/fine hair, this is 100% painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wax cartridge is heated in the chamber of this unit, that takes 20 minutes. The warm liquid wax rolls onto clean, dry skin in the direction of hair growth. Then the cloth is smoothed on, skin held taut as it is removed, along with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;After using a few times, I have a tip if the wax isn&#x27;t coming out enough. Remove the cartridge and press the wax out slightly, like a tube of toothpaste. You can regulate how much comes out by how much pressure you use. You have to work quickly with any wax, this is no different. Also, as with any similar product, it does not work well on short hair or super fine hair, and this unit is NOT meant for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easy to use, and each cloth strip can be re-used a few times, just hand wash in water warm enough to remove the remaining wax. The wax itself doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of sticky residue, a common pitfall of strip type waxes.&lt;br /&gt;With practice, it is clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I can remember the days when you&#x27;d heat the tin of wax on the heated plate of a drip coffeemaker. Then those horrible sugar waxes and microwave waxes. Now there are a lot of choices. For face, I like [[ASIN:B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Facial Wax Hair Remover, 0.50 Ounce]]. Although I find it easy and clean, a lot of people disagree, but once again, if one product worked for everyone, there would only be one product.&lt;br /&gt;The wax was not hot enough to burn, but warm enough to work with. The unit keeps it at the right temp. No irritation afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe way to keep legs smooth.rwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe way to keep legs smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried wax to remove hair, but thought this would be a better choice then a razor. I was wrong! The Remington Roll-On Wax Kit took quite awhile to warm up sufficiently for use, although the gadget itself felt pretty warm to the touch. The wax didn&#x27;t roll on very well, so not much hair came off my legs. The whole process was too time consuming and messy. Better results and faster using a razor in the shower. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s ever tried to do waxing at home knows how messy the entire process can get. You can get wax too hot, wax dripping all over place, wax hard to remove from your skin, and lack the overall dexterity and careful attention and patience required to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this product, I was very eager to try it. First, it tries to solve the wax-dripping-all-over-the-place issue. The package comes with a casing containing a cartridge of wax inside it. There&#x27;s a roller at the top so all you have to do is roll the heated wax (the casing comes with a detachable cord that you plug into a wall outlet) onto the parts of you you would like to wax. This part actually works. You plug the thing in and wait the recommended 20 minutes or so, and then come back and start working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that while the wax does get very warm, the QUALITY is not up to par with what you would be used to at hair and nail salons. I just KNEW it wasn&#x27;t going to work because the wax, even after 20+ minutes of heating, was far too clumpy and sticky BUT NOT ADHESIVE TO HAIR. It probably had the same &#x27;pulling&#x27; power as scotch tape, which is to say, not at all effective for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other area this product fell short was the quality of the &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; strips they provided for waxing. I say &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; because the texture was really strange. Usually at hair and nail salons, they used soft, cotton strips. But this product came with &amp;#34;cloths&amp;#34; that were in texture similar to DRYER SHEETS. I opened the plastic packaging and just knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work. There just wasn&#x27;t enough adhesive power between the wax and the strips to do ANYTHING. I tried anyway, but sure enough, NOT A SINGLE HAIR WAS REMOVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw everything away in the trash. I don&#x27;t like keeping junk around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Great concept for a product. I&#x27;d be very interested if this was GREATLY improved by Remington or another company. But they seriously need to improve the quality of the wax and the &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; waxing strips so that they actually do the job of waxing.</li>
            <li> I watched the video review on this product and felt empowered to give it a shot... despite the many negative reviews, I thought I could just follow the video reviewer&#x27;s tips and be successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the wax plugged in for nearly an hour, and when I began rolling it on, it was easy (it got stickier as I continued, but at least at first it was easy). Decided to do the bikini area because &amp;#34;Go big or go home&amp;#34; is my motto. I put on the cloth, rubbed it, pulled it off, and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, not one single hair came off. At least the wax did come off easily, but it was totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had to be doing something wrong, considering video reviewer had done this with such ease. So I tried again and again, in different areas. Thigh, calf. Nothing. Wait, no: one hair. I did get one hair. I want to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that stunning defeat, I decided to check on a new theory: Maybe Video Reviewer is not Italian. Maybe she does not have thick, well-rooted hair. So I tried it on the peach fuzz on my arm instead, and that worked reasonably well. I say &amp;#34;reasonably&amp;#34; because it didn&#x27;t leave me with a bald patch on my arm as it should have, but it did at least take off about 50% of the hair in that spot on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, MAYBE if you have extremely fine hair, it might be worth trying. Otherwise, skip it.</li>
            <li> The Remington smooth and silky electric roll on wax kit looks pretty, and heats up really easy...but as far as hair removal goes, it does not work well for my hair. I have thicker hair than most. The roll on applicator does not distribute a thick amount of wax, and as a result hair removal on areas of my arms and legs is spotty, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for women with finer hair, however.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I can compare this to a glue gun or a soldering iron.  The first hurdle to get past is waiting for it to heat up; as another reviewer mentioned, just let it go for a long time and come back to it.  This is unfortunate, though, because waxing is something few people want to anticipate and look forward to, and as with any other heating element, you really don&#x27;t want to turn it on and forget about it.  After that, it takes a lot of practice, just like the two tools mentioned above.  I hate doing all three of these things, but if you have to do it, then get a proper tool, take your time, and learn to use the tool to the best of your ability.  I&#x27;m not sure a better solution exists for waxing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already a dedicated hot waxer, then I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. While it did take almost twice as long as specified (35 min vs the 20 in the manual), it applies a relatively clean, very even, thin layer of wax. I&#x27;m inexperienced waxing (aside from a flirtation with Nad&#x27;s in the 90s, and another attempt every few years), and was still able to apply a large smear and fumble around for the strips before it dried. You will use significantly less wax and the mess is minimal (but, still wax, so expect a learning curve to handle it elegantly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from application, I had the usual problems: not effective on short hair, difficult along uneven surfaces (knees, ankles), etc. The long hair issue is one most non-waxers won&#x27;t be able to get over; and I&#x27;ve never waxes consistently enough to know if your hair will in fact become finer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are not the greatest. You can rinse them in warm water and reuse them once or twice, but they start to fall apart after that. Generic replacements are cheap, or you can tear an old sheet or similar into strips and reuse indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this it itself will not win any converts to waxing, but if you&#x27;re already waxing with a tongue depressor and the microwave, buy it now.</li>
            <li> Largely I&#x27;m a daily shaver.  It&#x27;s simple, effective, alnd does its job.  But I do like the look and long-lasting effect of waxed legs.  While having a professional do it is still the ideal method if you want the best job possible, I found this to be a fine little wax kit that was easy enough to use and about as effective as any wax kit one could hope for.  I liked the roll-on nature (significantly less messy than many another method) and the whole kit was wonderfully compact and idiot-proof.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of time or just one or two hairs, this might work, otherwise, it&#x27;s a great concept but it just doesn&#x27;t work. I keep my hair shaved pretty short, and since it doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore (not at all in some places), my wife will wax my neck on occasion. I thought this would be great for my neck, and for my wife as well. Wrong! Trying it on my neck, I had to lay on my stomach to get it flow....ok....when it was peeled, it TOOK off a couple of hairs. I can understand missing a couple of hairs, but taking off? At this rate it would have been easier AND faster to pluck them. My wife had the same experience.....back to shaving, or duct tape (for me, not my wife)!</li>
            <li> What a cool idea...what a terrible execution. The first thing you need to know about the Remington Smooth and Silky Electric Roll-On Wax Kit is that it is neither smooth nor silky.  A better name would be Skippy and Sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, it takes forever to heat up (it still wasn&#x27;t &#x27;smooth&#x27; even after letting it heat up twice as long as instructed), and it cools down in about 2-3 minutes (not even close to the promised 15 minutes).  Even after I got it hot enough, it was extremely difficult to roll on in a smooth, even layer.  In small areas, I did manage (sort of), but in larger areas, it was a joke.  I tried it on my forearms and it rolled on a little bit here, a littler bit there, with missed patches everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I attempted to try it was a complete fail. Wax had solidified on the roller, and the heat from the device simply would not extent to the roller in order to melt it.  After about 20 minutes of trying, I gave up and this went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but it works pretty well. Worst part is growing out the hair long enough to use the wax</li>
            <li> I have had salon waxing done but it is too expensive for my budget. I have used pre-waxed strips, which don&#x27;t work at all, and microwave tub wax with paper strips which work ok. This wax works like the tub wax, maybe better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t shower before waxing (like the directions advise), your hair/skin will be moist and the wax will never stick&lt;br /&gt;- let the wax heat about half an hour and keep the unit plugged in while you are waxing&lt;br /&gt;- pull your skin tight to apply the wax as well as to remove&lt;br /&gt;- I found that rolling the wax over the same exact strip of skin 3 times before applying the paper left the perfect amount of wax&lt;br /&gt;- be ready to take a shower as soon as you&#x27;re done, there is no other way to remove extra wax from your body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this twice now and I am sold on it. Way easier than the microwave tub wax. As the wax is heating I invert the holder whenever I walk by to help the wax heat more evenly and quickly. I think it&#x27;s a great product for at-home waxing. Will totally get the refill when the wax runs out.</li>
            <li> I know, I know... I read the other reviews.  BUT this product worked great for us, and I tested it on myself and my teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we read the instruction and plugged the Wax unit in. Left it plugged in for 20 minutes.  Then I had my daughter sit on a chair with her leg out on another chair. (She was really excited to try this. She just turned 14)  We unplugged the unit and applied a layer of wax. I quickly pressed the thick paper down on the wax and yanked at about a 30degree angle.  Hair came off and her skin was so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 14 had experimented with shaving before, but really hasn&#x27;t had to do it so her fine blonde leg hair came out easily.  She didn&#x27;t complain about the heat --their basically isn&#x27;t much-- nor surprisingly the sting of me ripping off the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was my turn. I have waxed for years and have gotten to the point where I only have to shave a little.  Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t shaved over winter so there were a few rugged survivors beginning to show.  I was wondering whether this system would work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did.  I let my daughter do the &#x27;ripping&#x27; this time as she was excited to see if she could cause me pain, and make me squeal  No pain, and again, this product worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why we had success where others ran into problems. Maybe we got a better unit. Maybe it helped that there were two of us.  I do know that this was easier and less painful for my daughter than the other wax-at-home product we tried.  And that it worked for us with little fuss or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the process we used was to heat for the full 20 minutes. Do a few strips of wax-and-remove, and then plug the unit back in for a minute or two.  This means that the process is a bit time consuming, but it was easier to use than the Sally Hansen method where you spread a wax substance with sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this Remington Electric Roll-On Wax Kit on several parts of my body, and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results. The process seemed to leave a lot of hair behind.  But I do want to say upfront that I have very oily hair and skin, so this natural oil may be keeping the wax from doing its job properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my workflow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heated the wax for approximately 45 minutes till it was warm and fluid.  I rolled the applicator on a section of my leg and the wax was deposited in a thin layer over my skin and hair.  This part of the process actually worked reasonable well.  The layer of wax was thin but not too thin.  I quickly stuck on the paper strip, pressed and smoothed the paper into the wax and hair, and yanked the paper free in one smooth motion.  I looked at my leg expecting to see a silky smooth area, but instead I saw hair.  Lots and lots of hair.  About half the hair in the treated section hadn&#x27;t been yanked out.  I was so disappointed.  I treated the same area again with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried it on my underarms.  It was a little awkward trying to keep the applicator upside down (so the wax would flow) and positioning it under my arms, but in the I got it to work.  But sadly my results were the same.  About half the hair in the treated area was on the paper, and the other half of the hair was still firmly attached to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few more times with different thickness of wax, but my results were always unsatisfactory.  I tried the process both before showering and after.  Same results.  At this point I stopped trying because the famous quote (source unverifiable) kept popping into my brain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen appliances almost identical to this in salons.  I&#x27;ve had wax treatments in salons but even there they would tell my my hair was just too fine for wax to work well.  Even my eyebrows do not wax well, it seems I am covered in ultra fine white fuzz that the wax just won&#x27;t stick to.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My actual leg hair is sparse, but I let it grow for more than 7 days before I tried this.  It heated up in about 20 minutes.  There&#x27;s a little black cap on the wax that you have to take off when you first get it - other than that there is no real assembly or bother.  Plug it in, and 20 minutes later the wax is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a roller ball on the end that you roll it on with, then you put the strips on it- there&#x27;s detailed instructions on the actual procedure to follow - they are VERY easy.  Then you pull up the clothes.  Most of the wax came up.  It hurt a bit but not bad.  It stung more than anything but very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 1/2 of the hair off my legs. I had to shower off because there were a few tiny bits left that were sticky.  It was EXTREMELY neat for a wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I liked was that you can unplug the unit and take it to the bathroom with you and it will stay hot long enough to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I&#x27;d say this is ok - if wax works for you and you want to try it at home, this is a very neat, easy way to do it.  If you have ultra fine hair like I do, and wax hasn&#x27;t done much for you in the past, this might not work for you either.</li>
            <li> I am not very hairy so I cannot justify expensive salon treatments. This kit promised in home convenience with less fuss and muss.  The product is easy to set up and is less messy than the microwave waxing systems. However it took a good forty minutes for the wax to reach the desired temperature. Not being a complete masochist, I used the time to slather numbing cream over myself. ( [[ASIN:B00BGWO63I Numbing Cream Anesthetic - Strong Fast Acting POWER NUMB® - 1x10g - Lidocaine 5% Topical Skin Numbing Cream - Stop Pain Now - Used Worldwide for Tattoos, Waxing, Laser, Piercings, Derma Roller, Botox, Injections - Guaranteed to Work - BUY NOW]] and[[ASIN:B005KNUHA0 Laser Hair Removal Lidocaine Gel GREENCAINE 4 Oz Topical Anesthetic proven more effective than Emla Numbing Cream for Tattoo, Electrolysis, Piercing, Brazilian Waxing at European Wax Centers - Max. comfort level for Tria &amp; Dermaroller - Made in USA]]are good ones.)  The roll on system was awkward at best and the wax did not seem thick enough. Going over the area to be stripped three or four times helped considerably. But alas, the hair removed was minimal, not really worth the effort and inconvenience of scrubbing sticky wax remnants off. I think it probably work better if you have a helper but I will play with it to see if it the problem is as much attributable to my lack of technique as it is with the system itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit might work better if you have a lot of thick, coarse hair. I do give it points for convenience but ultimately it didn&#x27;t work well for me. Pass.</li>
            <li> I let the hair on my legs grow for a week without shaving before using this so I had a quite a lot to work with - HA!  I let this heat for about 45 minutes: it was not warm enough at 20 minutes.  My legs had no lotion on them prior to waxing.  I rolled the wax back &amp; forth over my leg to make sure I had enough wax on (it was not super hot).  It did go on smoothly.  Yes, it removed hair.  I kept it plugged in so that the wax didn&#x27;t cool too much &amp; did another strip.  You need to make sure you have the strips ready to put over the wax - don&#x27;t dilly dally.  The wax does not get  hard but it does get more firm so  you need to work fast to get good contact.  Pull it off really fast to get the most hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did an OK job but not all the hair was removed and I&#x27;m not talking just a few stray hairs.  It was an annoying amount of hair.  If I&#x27;m going through the trouble &amp; expense of waxing, I want more hair removed.  In the end, I think I&#x27;ll keep using my epilator &amp; toss this wax kit.  The epilator does a really good job &amp; I can go over areas to make sure all the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> I have used the typical microwave wax and thought this would be a great alternative (less mess).  The idea is good but there are some issues to work out.  The wax took a while to get hot, more than half an hour.  Once it got hot, it was easy to roll on my leg but since the hair on my legs is really thin, I couldn’t pull it out.  I tried different temperatures, dryness of the wax, even other strips that I had and finally I was able to get some of that thin hair after three strips on the same spot.  Might work for people with coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I wax, I have a wax warmer and I get a tub o&#x27; wax and toss it in, it warms and I use Popsicle sticks to glop the wax on, wait a few seconds, and rip the hair from my body. It works. I loved the idea of a roll on, less mess, easier application, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my pot of wax. I guess to get the wax thin enough to roll on it isn&#x27;t thick enough to get all the hair. I love the idea and would try again, but this just left to much hair behind, if I&#x27;m going to go through the process and the pain I want all the hair gone.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with professional waxing and at-home microwaveable kits, and thought the idea of this product is great - neatly roll on the wax rather than spread it on with a stick, but the execution was disappointing. Although I really wanted to like the product, it just did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an egregious problem, but the wax took longer to melt than the advertised under twenty minutes. It was closer to thirty-five minutes which although not a huge issue, did not start things off well. I was mildly irritated as I waited around the extra time needed for it to sufficiently liquefy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much more serious problem occurred when I actually attempted hair removal -- it simply did not work. I have sparse, fine body hair which may be the problem - it just did not seem to grab a hold of it, at all, even with repeated efforts. Perhaps users with coarser hair would experience more success. So, I am rating it a two for my experience, but the rating might be significantly better from a user with a different hair type.</li>
            <li> It took me a few different tries to figure out how to best use this. I am blonde with very fine hair on my legs, it is almost not worth removing. So I knew that it would be difficult to find a wax system that would actually catch all my fine hair. I tried this one per the instructions with little luck. Then on my third try I figured out that letting it heat up for 30-40 mins and leaving it plugged in the whole time makes it work much better. It definitely is time consuming though, I could have shaved my legs in 1/4 of the time but hopefully it will last longer which will make it worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: go for it, but be ready to commit some time to figuring out how to make it work best for you.</li>
            <li> Once I got past the frustration level of first-time use, there were some things I liked about this product. Having the wax dispenser and heating element all in one unit is handy, and I did find it to be less messy than other waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried. That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no mess. Wax is sticky. That&#x27;s how it removes hair. But whatever mess there is with this kit is contained and easier to clean up. Just keep a basin or plastic tub of water and a washcloth nearby so you can wipe away residual wax. The wax really does wipe away easily with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend ignoring the directions about how long to let the wax heat. Plug in the unit, and come back about 90 minutes later. Your wax will be ready. Don&#x27;t bother testing it at various intervals to see if it&#x27;s ready. You&#x27;ll just make a mess and waste the waxing strips that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I finally got the wax hot enough, I was frustrated because even with careful following of instructions, very little of the hair on my legs was coming off. Then I figured out the problem. I was pulling away the waxing strips from the bottom up, like I shave. Once I tried it from the top down, my results were much more satisfactory. It seems to depend on which way your hairs grow. So if it doesn&#x27;t work for you one direction, try the other. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the consistency of the wax or the material the waxing strips are made of, but not all hairs are removed, no matter how carefully you follow procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re finished, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a loofah or other scrubber on the waxed area for awhile to keep those hair follicles from getting clogged, which can lead to very painful ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I didn&#x27;t love this product, I do think it&#x27;s worth a try if you have the patience to figure out the best way to use it for your desired results. Now I&#x27;m just waiting to see if the hair removal really does last six weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to come up with some redeeming qualities when it comes to the Roll-On Wax Kit, but the only thing good to say is the wax leaves a softer and more smooth leg than one gets with shaving. Now for the reality of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to plug in and allow to warm for 20 minutes and if that isn&#x27;t warm enough to add another 5 or so. I waited 55 minutes before it was &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; enough to roll. The applicator didn&#x27;t distribute the wax very nicely but that&#x27;s only the beginning. After setting it aside to apply the strips, the wax cools on the roller and makes it difficult to use again. It was a never ending process of cleaning the roller between strips. It was a LOT of work and frustration to do just one leg, and after all was said and done, the kit only does one pair of legs! You must buy a refill for every time you want to wax. Even if this did work well, the refills are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roll on wax? What were they thinking when they designed this?!!! Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The idea of this wax kit is good but the actual product has many shortcomings. Starting with the clunky shape that is too hard to hold and maneuver when applying wax to smaller areas like the upper lip or sides of the face. Second, the wax takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to warm up and even after 45 minutes of waiting, the wax still wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do a thorough job removing hair. Lastly, the results did not last six weeks (as the product claims) on very little hair that I was able to wax. It was back within a week. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results and I simply can&#x27;t recommend this waxing kit.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. I have never used any other waxing methods before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to. It took a lot longer than the recommended 20 minutes to heat up (more like an hour). I had a hard time trying to get the wax to roll on to my legs. It didn&#x27;t want to come out of the tube. I ended up taking the wax refill out of the heating compartment and squeezing it to make the wax come out. Even then, it was hard to get out very much wax at a time.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product. I had so many problems and I am really relieved to know I am not the only one. I tried several times, several different ways but nothing worked. How long do you have to wait for it to heat up? Two hours? Good lord, I don&#x27;t want to wait that long! And half the time, it didn&#x27;t remove the hair. Really wasn&#x27;t a mess but I really want something that removes hair and is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take hours to do from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that too much to ask for?</li>
