            <li>We love this soap.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>so I have to try something else :)</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>so glad it is carried here.</li>
            <li>Washes off very clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li>It cleans the clothes beautifully and naturally.</li>
            <li>It is a great natural alternative to soaps with harmful additives.</li>
            <li>All natural, smells great, works and a lil</li>
            <li>Not as cheap as store soaps.  </li>
            <li>This soap is gentle but effective and lathers</li>
            <li>so IDK if that was for leak prevention or if they just weren&#x27;t as good as I used to be when I opened my Christmas presents too early and had to cover it up.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I started buying it by the gallon!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem as rich as the others.</li>
            <li>All around environmentally friendly-</li>
            <li>I love the crisp lemon scent, and always feel wonderfully clean...</li>
            <li>The clothes come out clean and have no scent.</li>
            <li>I feel clean</li>
            <li>Special kudos to how they packaged it.</li>
            <li>Lathers up real nice with just a little.  </li>
            <li>We mostly use it for showering, but have used it to clean some things and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid castile soaps.</li>
            <li>Very hard to find in our area, so being able to buy it in this large, economical size is perfect for us.</li>
            <li>The investment in the gallon size is worth it.</li>
            <li>I like to buy the larger containers of the soap to save money, and to make sure I always have it on hand...</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than your standard body wash stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought the orange citrus.</li>
            <li>So overall I am satisfied with the cleanliness it gives me</li>
            <li>The scent itself is light and satisfactory but the soap is not worth the price if it&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and natural!</li>
            <li>Suds up just the right amount, and rinses fast and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Love the grease cutting power of this great smelling concentrated soap.</li>
            <li>I am the kind of person that wants quality with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your help.</li>
            <li>Shipping from this vendor is fast.</li>
            <li>Always better to be too subtle than too strong.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars to anything unless it wows me, and how much can soap wow one?</li>
            <li>We have tried a bunch of the other scented versions of this Castile soap and the citrus version seems to produce the most suds.  </li>
            <li>but as compared to their other products I give it an OK.  </li>
            <li>I will look more closely at my final check out in the future</li>
            <li>Love the lather, the long time lingering after smell, the versatility of the Dr. Bronners soap, I need just a little dab to get mounds of clean.</li>
            <li>We have had several different scents, the citrus is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>So considering the little effort part, I wash my dishes as well as my hair and sometimes my laundry with Dr Bronners and things work out just fine or better, concerning my hair, which is blonde and hates more fancy and expensive shampoos evidently.</li>
            <li>You pay so much less per cup, and with the free shipping it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li>so far problem solved.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is all natural is icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>(an understatement)...I have found that the one gallon containers are more difficult to find, but it is worth the effort...</li>
            <li>I am using it for dish washing, hand washing, bathroom cleaning and general household cleaning.</li>
            <li>I live on a tiny island so must order several products online.</li>
            <li>It has saved me from buying ANY other household chemical or toxic muck and does the job very well.</li>

            <li> Recently I found a small bottle of the citrus soap at Whole Foods...</li>
            <li> It goes a long way</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped somewhat strangely, but I think that was to reduce the risk of leakage in transport.</li>
            <li> The last few years, my family of two has ordered a gallon of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap, which lasts the entire year.</li>
            <li> As a time saver, I order several products at a time so did not notice their little underhanded move.</li>
            <li> Personally I like a little stronger orange aroma, but that&#x27;s a quibble.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as expected-</li>
            <li> it tends to congeal in the pump mechanism, and will not consistently pump in the correct manner...</li>
            <li> Does not contain all the chemicals and perfumes of other soap.  </li>
            <li> It works like all the other bronner soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Hard to get this scent in the gallon size anywhere locally</li>
            <li> I also thought the soap was less viscous than their Peppermint and Almond soaps which contributes to overuse when you combine that with two children</li>
            <li> I have tried every scent of this soap previous to trying the orange and none of them seemed as watery as this one.  </li>
            <li> Less plastic to recycle is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> so I was a little disapponted to find that this has very slight orange scent (unlike bbw&#x27;s Satsuma).  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> have used crazy dr bonners&#x27;s soaps 30 years.</li>
            <li> I also was disappointed in the lather capability in this soap as compared to their Peppermint soap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid castile soaps! I use the citrus scent for my homemade laundry detergent. It cleans the clothes beautifully and naturally. The clothes come out clean and have no scent. I also use this scent for my homemade liquid dish soap and dish packs. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid castile soaps. I love it so much I started buying it by the gallon!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem as rich as the others.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person that wants quality with little effort.  So considering the little effort part, I wash my dishes as well as my hair and sometimes my laundry with Dr Bronners and things work out just fine or better, concerning my hair, which is blonde and hates more fancy and expensive shampoos evidently.</li>
            <li> This soap does what is says and smells great. A bit pricey but Amazon has the best price. I use this for laundry and cleaning and it does a great job with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Dr. Bonners soap. He uses for his shampoo also. If I run out he keeps reminding me to get more. I buy it by the gallon.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it cause it makes him literally &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> like the fragrance of citris</li>
            <li> I was charged $20 for a $54 item. I live on a tiny island so must order several products online. I chose this product because it read &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; when in fact, later on, they tacked on $20 for a P.O. box. As a time saver, I order several products at a time so did not notice their little underhanded move. I will look more closely at my final check out in the future but I will never, ever use this company again.</li>
            <li> This is the only body soap I use. I love the smell &amp; feel. It goes a long way and I like the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; properties.</li>
            <li> I love this liquid soap...I have been using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s peppermint castile liquid soap for years...Recently I found a small bottle of the citrus soap at Whole Foods...thus started my change over to the citrus products by Dr. Bonner...including his hand soap. I use the citrus liquid soap daily in the shower. I love the crisp lemon scent, and always feel wonderfully clean...I like to buy the larger containers of the soap to save money, and to make sure I always have it on hand...(I transfer the soap to a smaller container to use in the shower). One word of caution about this liquid style of soap...and the bottle warns you..(if you can get through all of the reading material on the label!)...don&#x27;t transfer the soap into a pump bottle, unless you want to be wearing it on your clothes, or cleaning up the walls...it tends to congeal in the pump mechanism, and will not consistently pump in the correct manner...(an understatement)...I have found that the one gallon containers are more difficult to find, but it is worth the effort...Amazon always has some dealers who carry Dr.Bonner line of products...and the service is wonderful...</li>
            <li> Love the grease cutting power of this great smelling concentrated soap. I am using it for dish washing, hand washing, bathroom cleaning and general household cleaning. Did I say I love the scent? : )</li>
            <li> We use this for everything and I love how this one smells. It is nice and not over powering. It is good for the kids, my husband and me.</li>
            <li> We love this soap.  The citrus has a nice smell to it.  We have tried a bunch of the other scented versions of this Castile soap and the citrus version seems to produce the most suds.  Seems to work better than your standard body wash stuff.  Its soapy enough where my wife can use it to shave her legs with it as well.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  We mostly use it for showering, but have used it to clean some things and it works very well.  I am currently starting to use it as my dish soap (check out the dilution ratios before).  The dish soap I used to use I can no longer get so I have to try something else :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, bubbles up well.....Expensive. The seal on the top wasn&#x27;t on the bottle?!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product! I was so happy to find it in this size!</li>
            <li> I like Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  This is the first time I bought the orange citrus. I love orange smell so I was a little disapponted to find that this has very slight orange scent (unlike bbw&#x27;s Satsuma).  I also was disappointed in the lather capability in this soap as compared to their Peppermint soap.  I also thought the soap was less viscous than their Peppermint and Almond soaps which contributes to overuse when you combine that with two children( get the picture).  So overall I am satisfied with the cleanliness it gives me but as compared to their other products I give it an OK.  Would I buy it again?  Yes I would, when my children are grown and/or if I could dole out what amount is given to them (lol).</li>
            <li> GOOD SMELL AND GOOD CLEANING POWER.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bonners, use to to make my own foaming hand soap.  Does not contain all the chemicals and perfumes of other soap.  Use it for everything, hands, hair, and you can even brush your teeth with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, great ingredients.  Suds up just the right amount, and rinses fast and thoroughly.  It&#x27;s a little pricy or else I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> nice scent, invigorating, I use in a soap foam dispenser</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap for a couple years now. We use it in all our soap dispensers as well as making my own laundry detergent with it. It is a great natural alternative to soaps with harmful additives.</li>
            <li> have used crazy dr bonners&#x27;s soaps 30 years. started when we were taking boats from palm beach florida to dive and fish in the Bahamas and needed soap that would lather in salt water. I never found a good reason to use anything else. we rotate between peppermint and just started using citrus . have also had reports from a female that it helped with a female related issue. Doctor said it might be related to soap she was using she started using dr bonners peppermint and so far problem solved.</li>
            <li> The last few years, my family of two has ordered a gallon of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap, which lasts the entire year. We use it as a shower gel, shaving gel, dog shampoo, and people shampoo. I refill smaller containers from the gallon jug to keep throughout the house. We have had several different scents, the citrus is my favorite so far. It smells so clean and natural!</li>
            <li> Been using this exclusively as body wash for 3 yrs and I like the simplicity of the product. All natural, smells great, works and a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Personally I like a little stronger orange aroma, but that&#x27;s a quibble. Always better to be too subtle than too strong. It works like all the other bronner soaps I&#x27;ve used. Special kudos to how they packaged it. Very secure to prevent leaks, which is always a problem when shipping fluids. I rarely give 5 stars to anything unless it wows me, and how much can soap wow one?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Washes off very clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have  ton of extra chemicals that may screw with your body.</li>
            <li> I have tried every scent of this soap previous to trying the orange and none of them seemed as watery as this one.  The product came unsealed and with tape around the cap so IDK if that was for leak prevention or if they just weren&#x27;t as good as I used to be when I opened my Christmas presents too early and had to cover it up.  The scent itself is light and satisfactory but the soap is not worth the price if it&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
            <li> I read that Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid soaps are ideal for dishwashing in the sink from an animal cruelty and ecological view.  Has anyone used it for dishes?  Thanks for your help.</li>
            <li> Organic, cleans anything and everything. It has saved me from buying ANY other household chemical or toxic muck and does the job very well. Thank you Dr. Bonner!</li>
            <li> smells awesome and very good soap</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in our area, so being able to buy it in this large, economical size is perfect for us. Less plastic to recycle is the way to go. The fact that it is all natural is icing on the cake. We like several of the Dr. Bronners scents. All around environmentally friendly- try it!</li>
            <li> All natural.  Lathers up real nice with just a little.  I feel clean the scent is awesome.  I only buy gallons and save lots.  Not as cheap as store soaps.  However I can read the label.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful liquid Castile soap! So glad to buy the gallon size and save money! I bought this to use in my homemade cleaning products that call for Castile liquid soap. I like that the ingredients are healthy and safe and the lemon oil makes my laundry soap gel smell lovely! The investment in the gallon size is worth it. You pay so much less per cup, and with the free shipping it&#x27;s a bargain. Shipping from this vendor is fast. This should supply my cleaning product needs for well over a year. I can&#x27;t find this in any of the stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Love the lather, the long time lingering after smell, the versatility of the Dr. Bronners soap, I need just a little dab to get mounds of clean.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as expected- we use this throughout our home, it&#x27;s especially great as a hand soap in the kitchen as the citrus negates cooking odors (chopping garlic etc.) Came wrapped somewhat strangely, but I think that was to reduce the risk of leakage in transport.</li>
            <li> Nice light citrus scent. This soap is gentle but effective and lathers/rinses well. Hard to get this scent in the gallon size anywhere locally so glad it is carried here.</li>
