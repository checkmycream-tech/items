            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>(Paul Mitchell is known to, but with PM it is more like 2oz difference).</li>
            <li>It is more like 22oz of product and not 32oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love Mizani</li>
            <li>I believe it is; it was very clean and didn&#x27;t seem tampered</li>

            <li>Great product hair come back beatuiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different types of shampoo but this works the best!</li>
            <li>There was no stay fresh seal on it</li>
            <li>I do not feel like I am getting my monies worth.</li>
            <li>I used the condition Shampoo first.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and smooth and really does help to minimize tangling.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my hair to restore moisture.  </li>
            <li>the company itself makes their products this way then it is VERY overpriced.</li>
            <li>really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item was not full all the way to the top of the jar.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended it about a year ago and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>bought this jar supposedly brand new.</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft (natural hair).</li>
            <li>If you are natural or have relaxed hair this product will work either way!</li>
            <li>My stylist used this on me and my hair was so soft and moisturized after!</li>
            <li>product makes my hair unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was recommended to me by a hair care professional.</li>
            <li>This 32oz jar for $36 would be well worth it over the 6oz tube for $16, but only if they actually gave me 32oz!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thick hair, so buying this 32oz size was better for me than the tiny 6oz tube they also have available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some companies are known to not fill all the way to the top, so it wouldn&#x27;t have been a nasty surprise if I had a fair warning of what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But with this particular item, I was missing a WHOLE lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work from all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>African American,  relaxed hair trying to go natural.</li>
            <li>I am caucasian with dyed Type 3 B/C curls which are dry but soft.  </li>

            <li> My daughters hair was frinzy and came undone. This I have used it twice my daughter locs are longer and stronger. I used the condition Shampoo first. But this is amazing and it tingles. I washed her hair twice and its getting cutlery and curlier</li>

            <li> my only complaint is that I need a tube to keep me from useing too much!</li>
            <li> Has this used on my hair at the salon due to having natural, extremely dry curly hair which was 10x worse after a protein treatment. My stylist used this on me and my hair was so soft and moisturized after! I had to ask her what she used. She told me and I ran to amazon to buy it. Glad I have prime got it in two days.:-)</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair dried out and crunchy.  I am caucasian with dyed Type 3 B/C curls which are dry but soft.  I really wanted it to work from all the other reviews.  Now I have a lot of conditioner to pass to my other curly friends.</li>
            <li> I love this condition.  I know that a lot of hair stylist use it.  The clients love the way that it makes their hair and scalp feel.  Even after the perm it make your scalps feels so good.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! The crazy thing is I buy this item all the time in the store but its a pleasure to have it shipped to you.</li>
            <li> This is a product I used after doing chemo,and I luv how it made my head feel. Great product hair come back beatuiful.</li>
            <li> Although I love this conditioner I noticed that my tub didn&#x27;t seem completely full when opened. Seems as if the tub was refilled.  There was no stay fresh seal on it either when I opened it.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on me in the salon. I really liked it, so I decided to buy my own tub for home use.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair unbelievably soft.

I believe it is; it was very clean and didn&#x27;t seem tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was not full all the way to the top of the jar. Sometimes companies do this (Paul Mitchell is known to, but with PM it is more like 2oz difference). But with this particular item, I was missing a WHOLE lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company itself makes their products this way then it is VERY overpriced. It is more like 22oz of product and not 32oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this conditioner but probably will not purchase again because of this. I do not feel like I am getting my monies worth. This 32oz jar for $36 would be well worth it over the 6oz tube for $16, but only if they actually gave me 32oz! The 6oz tube is probably only 3 or 4oz itself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish the seller would have mentioned this since it isn&#x27;t factory sealed &amp; they had a chance to say something in their ad. Some companies are known to not fill all the way to the top, so it wouldn&#x27;t have been a nasty surprise if I had a fair warning of what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Design Essentials (or seller...). I really love this product. I&#x27;m stuck on whether to buy again or not. Until then I will just use up this jar. I also love Mizani so maybe I will look into their moisturizing deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Received as promised.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was recommended to me by a hair care professional. Left my hair super soft (natural hair). Loved the tingling sensation as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
