            <li>I&#x27;m in love with all the applications for this oil - as well as the smell.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Great product and delivered fast</li>
            <li>The odor is strong, stimulating and energizing and SWEET!</li>
            <li>I think there was actually more than 30 ml because the bottle was FULL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm, slightly sweet and woodsy, very uplifting.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to use in my diffuser, did not realize it would have such a pleasant aromas.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet basil smell that you might expect.</li>
            <li>Nice strong and lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I received the Basil eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery &amp; Oil just as described.</li>
            <li>I have found Plant Therapy quality to be every bit as excellent as the &amp;#34;higher priced&amp;#34; Dotera and Young Living and other brands.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the batch of soap I used this in filled the whole house for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it, love the smell of it, the quality, how it makes me feel and the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am sure you can find other uses if you do more research on what you need it to do for you.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy oils and especially that they are quality and in my budget range!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>I made some &amp;#34;de-stress and get creative&amp;#34; mists for friends and family with the EO as a major component, and it works &amp; smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Cathy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pepperish</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of MANY of Plant Therapy Essential oils, both individual oils, and their blends.  </li>
            <li>I have asthma and basil essential oil is known to clean the sinuses and promote circulation.</li>
            <li>Sure glad I found this essential oil since basil is hard to locate.</li>
            <li>and it is (personally) too sweet for what I was planning on using.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This one is unusually strong, and I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s typical of basil EO.</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>It burns nicely and blends well with other oils, and the strength of the fragrance seems to indicate that the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>part of a recipe for natural bug spray for horses.</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing the trick so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great to smell like a pizza all day, but it was nice to see a lot of milk when my daughter was nursing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be in touch as I am trying a few companies right now.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Beth S.</li>
            <li>The drip of the oil is rather fast so you may run out of it a bit faster than with other bottles or brands that is the only thing I noticed that could take a star off.</li>

            <li> Good quality.  Using for candle making, no issues.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the Basil oil didn&#x27;t assist in controlling the itch from my yearly eczema outbreak.  If you have an alternate recommendation/ solution do let me know.  Thanks, Cathy.</li>
            <li> Great smell and consistency.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>

I love it and in a way it is 5 stars because it is a superb essential oil, I never had it before and am so glad I tried it. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Very happy with all my oils!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for my breakout (acne), and it seems to work just well. It&#x27;s very pepperish so I blended it with Sea Buckthorn Oil that I have... worked perfectly thus far! :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting just basil, but when it arrived the label on the top said &amp;#34;sweet basil,&amp;#34; and it is (personally) too sweet for what I was planning on using.</li>
            <li> This is a good product .  I goiing to have this basil oil in my possesion all the time. Again thus is great.</li>
            <li> Basil essential oil is working awesomely for the purpose in which I purchased it. The smell is nice and not harsh. I mix with some carrier oils for my hair growth regimen and this has truly assisted in that progression. I am sure you can find other uses if you do more research on what you need it to do for you. I just use as a stable in my homemade hair puddings and butters and oil mixtures.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils in soapmaking. This one is unusually strong, and I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s typical of basil EO. The scent of the batch of soap I used this in filled the whole house for a couple of weeks. I got a bit tired of it, as a matter of fact. Use with caution. But it certainly seems to be good quality!</li>
            <li> I am a fervent believer in organics and using essential oils is part of my daily regimen.  I have asthma and basil essential oil is known to clean the sinuses and promote circulation. I have been using it with my eucalyptus and lemon oils and have been getting good relief from my asthma. A few drops of each in my diffuser and I&#x27;m good for the night. I wake up with a clear head and hardly any congestion.</li>
            <li> The oil worked perfect for my issue.  It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The product met it&#x27;s description and I&#x27;m more than satisfied. The odor is strong, stimulating and energizing and SWEET! I am glad that I bought the 30 ml size because I love it! I think there was actually more than 30 ml because the bottle was FULL. :] I definitely want to buy this Basil from Plant Therapy again! You should try it. Try a little for cooking, too.....</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of MANY of Plant Therapy Essential oils, both individual oils, and their blends.  I have found Plant Therapy quality to be every bit as excellent as the &amp;#34;higher priced&amp;#34; Dotera and Young Living and other brands.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I love Plant Therapy oils and especially that they are quality and in my budget range!  THANK YOU Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I received the Basil eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think this smells like basil, I think it smells like anise...which is a smell I hate. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this if you&#x27;re looking for a real, true basil smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this to spay in the yard as mosquito repellent and it needed to be 100% pure and not old. Works like a charm so I&#x27;m thinking this is legit.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use in my diffuser, did not realize it would have such a pleasant aromas. Good quality oil for the price, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good oil. Fresh smelling and good color. Packaged well so it didn&#x27;t leak like alot of oils that I order do. Much better deal than the oils sold thru distributors</li>
            <li> part of a recipe for natural bug spray for horses.</li>
            <li> I am not kidding when I say......the BASIL is the BEST smelling E.O. I&#x27;ve yet to purchase. I will be ordering a fair amount of these oils. I&#x27;ll have to look into your company more closely. Really impressed with the quality of the oil. thank you. I used to buy blends, now I am doing my own. I&#x27;ll be in touch as I am trying a few companies right now.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Beth S.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help increase my milk supply. I think it helped at least to a small degree. It&#x27;s not great to smell like a pizza all day, but it was nice to see a lot of milk when my daughter was nursing.</li>
            <li> Mistake purchase but it has health benefits.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; Oil just as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help ward off seasonal insects in my apartment. Seems to be doing the trick so far. It burns nicely and blends well with other oils, and the strength of the fragrance seems to indicate that the bottle will last a long time. Blends great with orange oil!</li>
            <li> Item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with all the applications for this oil - as well as the smell. It&#x27;s warm, slightly sweet and woodsy, very uplifting. I&#x27;m using it in body oils and aroma therapy - particularly to deal with stress and help me focus on difficult projects. I made some &amp;#34;de-stress and get creative&amp;#34; mists for friends and family with the EO as a major component, and it works &amp; smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> great company. I am loving getting used to the oils, and each one as it reacts to my body chemistry. :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils. Perfect in soapmaking. Nice strong and lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Just what I was after.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Sure glad I found this essential oil since basil is hard to locate.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Another hit from Plant Therapy.  They make excellent products.</li>
            <li> I have used this in my homemade soap. When I use the soap, I feel like I am standing in my herb garden. Perfect! Very natural. Basil is a favorite smell!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet basil smell that you might expect. The scent is a little more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t tried it in a diffuser, so I&#x27;m unsure if the scent itself changes.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
