            <li>Now I smell great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nonscented, works great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>No odor &#x3D; Perfect!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li>I suggest using your blow dryer to soften it up for about 10 seconds for best results.</li>
            <li>This is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good!</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too great.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the rashes or any stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li>The screw-closed container is AWESOME, because my husband travels a lot and if he leaves this in a warm place, like in a suitcase in his car, and it melts,</li>
            <li>I guess that tells you a lot about how great the product is, that I didn&#x27;t just stop buying it after the company ticked me</li>
            <li>And they are great for travel, gym bags etc too...</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>am I happy</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>and I thought it might be a good idea to not wear deodorant to see if that would take the pain</li>
            <li>This does a relatively good job and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>Works good but after about 6-8 hours feels sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making an exception for this product because it is, I think, exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but be sure to reapply midday.</li>
            <li>I saw so many great reviews for this product that I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This is a great option if you&#x27;re looking for a safe deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.    </li>
            <li>So happy with product and have recommended to many friends.</li>
            <li>but I think I am feeling better too!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I tried Primal Pit Paste for a couple days and it wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!.....</li>
            <li>Why put chemically-laden ingredients found in store-bought brand names when you can safely use this product?!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Works better than the chemically-based deodorants and anti-perperants out there!  </li>
            <li>Ordering a bunch more!</li>
            <li>So all in all, despite its less-than-elegant name, this is a product to try if you are looking for an effective and healthy deodorant!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, albeit too pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice unscented stick, seems to work well.</li>
            <li>I have followed the directions by letting it sit against my skin for a minute to warm it...</li>
            <li>The unscented has a kind of &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell (we didn&#x27;t like it) and both of us were stinky (as in b.o.) by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I find that it takes about 10 seconds for the product to warm up.  </li>
            <li>I had used Crystal Essence which I really liked</li>
            <li>It might as well be the kind where you have to use your fingers to apply.</li>
            <li>Sample sizes are also a nice way to try converting friends, coworkers &amp; relatives to healthier scent-free deodorant, or to offer house guests if you have to keep your home fragrance-free as we do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of costly</li>
            <li>I liked the lemongrass and thyme.</li>
            <li>The others were partially effective, but Primal Pit Paste stops all odor all day.</li>
            <li>Awesome product that really works...</li>
            <li>Otherwise liked the product.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant ever!</li>
            <li>no chemicals smeared right where important glands are &#x3D; best stuff.  </li>
            <li>I wish I liked the stick version of the pit paste because it is definitely more convenient.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant stick I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I suppose for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re impressed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Works the best of any natural deodorants that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>He says it is the best natural one he has tried, and we have tried many.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to warm up soon, so maybe I&#x27;ll be able to handle it better.</li>
            <li>I ordered the unscented and it works great and no weird staining.</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and there&#x27;s no noticable residue after one day.  </li>
            <li>But I was fine!</li>
            <li>No BO smell at all...even better than some antiperspirants I have tried.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found to combat stinky pits even in 100+ degree temperatures.</li>
            <li>Much better than Tom&#x27;s, much better than underarm crystal.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not terribly sweaty people and just sit at a desk most of the day, but this did not work for either me or my husband.</li>
            <li>Update: still love it,</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I just feel better about using this product than a product that has aluminum in it.</li>
            <li>If you want to extend your appeal beyond places like Santa Cruz and Berkeley, you need to come up with a better name for the product and better packaging too.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of non-toxic deodorants.</li>
            <li>The more I learn as a consumer, the more attention I pay to the products we buy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so glad I found Primal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Works wonders and is chemical free!</li>
            <li>but I like Primal Pit Paste much better</li>
            <li>sure this is 2-3 times the price of the stinky stuff I used to buy at the corner store.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe for me to use and not worry about if my children touch it.</li>
            <li>this is great stuff- works very well</li>
            <li>Might even be able to get the hubby to try with this one.</li>
            <li>Glad I got the stick.</li>
            <li>I am completely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Now he says that it works better than the brand he used to buy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Best of all no unsightly white antiperspirant all over my shirts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants, and despite being a cute, petite girl, I have some stinky pits.</li>
            <li>Their customer service was outstanding and made sure that I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>but just layer it on more than the two swipes recommended.</li>
            <li>I still give it five stars because I love having a safe option to use for most of the time.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  :)</li>
            <li>Most days, it&#x27;s does the trick.</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything I have tried in the mainstream stores.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find anything to combat odor and this works most of the time.</li>
            <li>, the ingredients are simple, easy to read and pronounce and, best of all, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>have tried others that weren&#x27;t as good, this seems to work really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy there is a functional alternative to the harmful chemicals I am now trying to avoid, even though it is costly I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I justify another purchase.</li>
            <li>It holds up pretty good.</li>
            <li>I apply this on top of an application (mist) of aloe vera juice which helps it to go on smoothly and absorb better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Maybe their sensitive Happy Pits one will work better, because it has clay in it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many types of Natural Deodorants and this one works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is all natural - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li>I love Primal Pit Paste unscented in the jar so much that I thought having the stick would be a great quick on the go deoderant.  </li>
            <li>you are extremely sensitive, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that they do sell lip-balm-sized samples of it for just a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>It still works but until they change the ingredients or ratio of ingredients to make it go on more smoothly, I&#x27;ll stick to their jarred version.</li>
            <li>But other than that, very happy and have reordered twice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to apply and quite a lot for the price.</li>
            <li>I tried the strong unscented paste in the jar and although it took about a week for the redness to subside, it worked *</li>
            <li>Anyway, this works and works for DAYS just fine (except for those two days a month) without any issues in between showers or even after working out in the yard.  </li>
            <li>though).&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to be able to order it through Amazon because my first time buying it, I ordered directly from the company.</li>
            <li>Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so it was important to find a pit stick that doesn&#x27;t contain any risky ingredients (like fragrance).</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pit paste&amp;#34; can get kind of crumbly if you try to slather your arm pit with too much of it.</li>
            <li>this is a good natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Still a good natural option.</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and this by far is the best one I have used.  </li>
            <li>so I was worried about the hot temps, but this works!!</li>
            <li>The first couple days were great, but then I had an extremely busy day at work</li>
            <li>Sometimes you need more if its hot out.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a more natural deodorant, but if you actally sweat (and I do!), this isn&#x27;t helpful.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, uses healthy ingredients, is effective as a deodorant, and does not deteriorate the fabric of my clothing (which, after many years of use, I realized my previously much-loved deodorant does!).  </li>
            <li>So far loving this.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural deodorant, and I even thought about making my own, but I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>This has really helped plus I feel it is safe to use.</li>
            <li>Even though the jar is more of a hassle to apply, it is much smoother and soaks in with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I was even more stinky after that, even though I didn&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li>A safe deodorant that really works.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I liked knowing that I was very well protected.  </li>
            <li>That said, if you have a kid that wants deodorant like mom/dad, this would be a great product to give them the experience without the junk in traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed sweating much more than I used to using the normal chemical-filled, toxic stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li>Another faulty product referral from Lisa Leake and 100 Days of Real Food!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply (don&#x27;t apply too much, I got a red rash when I tried more than one light swipe) and in a convenient container.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural non-aluminum deodorants and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>After trying SO many natural, aluminum-free deodorants I had almost given up.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply it every day and when you do, hold it on your skin to warm it up so it can spread without leaving a red rash.</li>
            <li>I love this natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate (I think some have too much grit or too strong an alkalinity) or smell funny (like those with neem or tea tree etc).</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s &#x27;unscented&#x27; it has a slight nice smell of coconut surf wax!</li>
            <li>I put it on right after showering (and shaving) and I don&#x27;t have to worry about odor all day.</li>
            <li>and it actually has a modest but pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>As far as providing me with stench control (I&#x27;m going through chemo treatments right now), it WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I will give a good rating to products that I buy and feel good about, but I don&#x27;t usually take the extra time needed to do reviews very often.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is hard to apply, but if you hold it to your arm for a minute it will warm it up which allows it to be applied better.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well for eliminating smell, but in the cooler climates it is not very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This does exact what it says but I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a natural, carcinogen free, deodorant.</li>
            <li>I smelled like I hadn&#x27;t showered and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot sweaty day.</li>
            <li>I saw a recommendation for this on YouTube and thought I’d give it a try, after all it’s not that much different in price from most of the clinical strength stuff sold off the shelf, and that is what I was using before.  </li>
            <li>But, it has really worked!  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I recommend getting a baking soda free deodorant.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that works and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>she told me it keeps her pits fresh even after her intense UFC classes.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to settle with one I&#x27;d found that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin any more than I could handle and lasted for a solid half-day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Of note, it is a bit of a shock to use the first time if you&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You can roll the dice for a couple of days a month, ladies, or use the old aluminum stuff as a back-up if needed for an important day.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but this deodorant is definitely worth a try if you are looking for an effective natural product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great for people who react to most toiletries because who wants to risk buying a whole container when there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll be unable to use it.</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot climate and perspiring and odor</li>
            <li>the essential oils in the scented one I tried were too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>This certainly helped with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s like rubbing a large pencil eraser under your arm -</li>
            <li>Used this for a few weeks now and love it!  </li>
            <li>so you kind of have to hold it under your pit until it warms up a little to glide on.</li>
            <li>It works really well for preventing odors</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>The texture is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I was really REALLY wanting this to work.</li>
            <li>Keeps me free from odor for a solid 24 hours, even through workouts!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking to make the change from using toxic products!</li>
            <li>#34;Pit Paste&amp;#34;, really?  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I really like this deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so much safer for you, the environment, and those around you, compared to the toxic, reeking mainstream deodorants.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so much safer for you, the environment, and those around you, compared to the toxic, reeking mainstream deodorants.</li>
            <li>It keeps me free of odor, even in the middle of summer when I&#x27;m drenched in sweat after working in the yard.</li>
            <li>I really put it on, maybe 5-7 swipes.</li>
            <li>Works very well with a neutral scent.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the pit paste stick.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>This product left me scent free.</li>
            <li>so I really want this to work, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple enough that you could probably make your own-</li>
            <li>Not every product works for everyone since all of our bodies are different, but this is by far his favorite.</li>
            <li>Not too effective though if you perspire heavily.</li>
            <li>I only ran into issues when it was super hot</li>
            <li>So I was very surprised that the first Primal Pit deodorant I tried was everything I&#x27;d been looking for all this time - no aluminum,</li>
            <li>I normally make my own but with two little ones I wanted to save time and buy this to try.</li>
            <li>It cost more that other deodorants</li>
            <li>Better than any other I&#x27;ve used and no aluminum.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth it, but I can&#x27;t seem to help bit feel that those of us who care about our health are being taken for a ride by some of these companies with their ridiculously high prices for natural and organic products.</li>
            <li>was looking for a sensitive skin compatible deodorant, this one works pretty well</li>
            <li>Its so much like normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that he was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>but it some how keeps your pits dry without aluminum filled antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical by the time I decided to try primal pit paste, but given the good reviews I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>The primal pit paste has worked for me better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I did not experience any major detox symptoms since I live a pretty clean life in spite of my red meat proclivities.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Some other natural deodorants make me stink more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I live in a very hot climate and that&#x27;s not really possible (to not wear deodorant).  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make sure to update my post in a few months.</li>
            <li>Eventually I decided it was time to give a more natural approach a try (previous attempts with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, the crystal stick, etc., did nothing for me, either sweat or odor-wise.).</li>
            <li>and you can get dressed right away with no white antiperspirant residue to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix</li>
            <li>it showed on my shirt since I live in FL and wear tanks all year</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to wash your hands after applying, but really, is that really that big a deal?</li>
            <li>It took my body about a week to adjust to it, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues with body odor or anything (and I live in a super hot, humid climate where I&#x27;m pretty much constantly sweating a little bit).</li>
            <li>Overall I would say it is a good product just a little different for those not used to this type of deodorant.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural to get away from other deodorants that are filled with chemicals and aluminum.</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised!  </li>
            <li>Overall this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have searched for years for something that works that is natural and this is it!  </li>
            <li>I developed a rash after using this product for a couple of days but during those couple of days I didn&#x27;t smell at all!  </li>
            <li>All natural!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product because I could actually read and understand the ingredients as I am a big go all natural freak</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very stinky person, especially in the winter, but just sitting at my desk on the computer, I stunk after several hours, more than I normally do with nothing on.</li>
            <li>I guess I am too sensitive to the baking soda.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that combats smell and sweat.</li>
            <li>only really regret is getting the unscented deodorant, but this can probably be combined with an oil or perfume of your choice.</li>
            <li>I am a really sweaty person as well as I have nearly constant pain under my arms</li>
            <li>but I developed redness and itching after using it for awhile</li>
            <li>The only gripe is that I have never gotten razor burn before I used this, it may be because it is very oily</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there</li>
            <li>This product does what it says it will do naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using natural, non-toxic deodorant since 2010.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the effort of creating natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>All natural and no aluminum.</li>
            <li>My son likes this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I still have not found a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li>I really hoped that PPP would be the answer, but my search for a non-aluminum deodorant that actually works continues...</li>
            <li>I think warming it under your arm to apply it isn&#x27;t too big a deal, but they recommend that you don&#x27;t put much on.</li>
            <li>Getting one for my young daughter too.</li>
            <li>Only used it a week, but really works for me.  </li>
            <li>I have shopped around for a good natural deodorants on and off for years- always to sadly return to my unscented chemical-laden antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 other non aluminum deodorants, but none lasted very long and had a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>This does both all the while saving me from Alzheimer and other problems resulting from toxic metals being put right by my underarm lymph nodes</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended but it rolls on difficulty and doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>feels pretty unfordable and not much</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit more time to apply than conventional deodorant, and I mean just seconds more.</li>
            <li>After several months of using this product (and dealing with large crumbs of this stuff falling on the bathroom floor during every application), I finally happened to notice that there were instructions on the bottle for applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li>I’m not overly fastidious about using organic stuff, but for certain products that I use every single day, I do try to lean away from majorly toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But the deodorant is so firm, that the Pit Paste folks suggest you hold the product under your arm for a few seconds to warm it up and allow it to soften.  </li>
            <li>I understand that some have not found this effective and/or irritating, so obviously bodies differ.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the effectiveness of this deodorant at actually preventing odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very active person and it keeps me smelling fresh all day without irritation, darkening or my underarms, etc.</li>
            <li>This has held up to my pregnant hormone temperature swings, running after my toddler all day, even grocery shopping on a busy Saturday in a heavy wool winter coat (something that always makes me sweat!)</li>
            <li>To be clear to those who don&#x27;t know, this is a deodorant only.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural alternative to regular deodorant which could cause breast cancer and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li>I had to quit using another natural deodorant because it stopped working after several months, so I wonder if I&#x27;ll just have to alternate from one product to another, but so far it&#x27;s still working</li>
            <li>I have looked for 9 years to find a natural product that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the only deodorant I use</li>
            <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s natural &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; deodorant and it simply did not work.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>This deodorant, and another natural one I used with baking soda, burned my underarms and they turned red after using it for about 5 to 7 days.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants in my effort to avoid aluminum.</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to apply at first, but once it warms up it goes on fine.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because I like to use natural products if I can, especially if it is in my price range; however, after using this consistently over a few weeks I noticed that my arm pits got dry and red and itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have too much trouble with B.O., so I thought it would be no big deal to use this instead of the Dove Sensitive Skin that I normally use.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so that might make a difference to some in their experience.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a little sticky being talc-free (another known carcinogen), and it&#x27;s odor protection may not be as long-lasting as the poisonous stuff, but I personally feel reapplying late in the day is better than risking cancer!</li>
            <li>As someone who had always used regular aluminum deodorant with great results, I didn&#x27;t even know I could smell bad until I tried Kiss my Face and Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, it seems to work well as far as odor with maybe not as much &#x27;dampness&#x27; control as a heavy duty RightGuard.</li>
            <li>I have tried only four brands, so I am not a huge expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth, this is my favourite.</li>
            <li>I broke out after the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I still sweat (which I consider a natural part of being HUMAN), but it doesn&#x27;t stink, even after a long day.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions (&amp;#34;Place the open stick on your pit and let your body heat soften it up for a few seconds.&amp;#34;) kept the crumbles away.</li>
            <li>The only time this doesn&#x27;t work is when hormones are crashing - i.e. the first few days of a female&#x27;s cycle.  </li>
            <li>And feels good to know I&#x27;m not adding anymore chemicals and bad stuff into my body.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> This stuff is perfect.</li>

            <li> Now I smell great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nonscented, works great!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> No odor &#x3D; Perfect!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li> I suggest using your blow dryer to soften it up for about 10 seconds for best results.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too great.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the rashes or any stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> The screw-closed container is AWESOME, because my husband travels a lot and if he leaves this in a warm place, like in a suitcase in his car, and it melts,</li>
            <li> I guess that tells you a lot about how great the product is, that I didn&#x27;t just stop buying it after the company ticked me</li>
            <li> And they are great for travel, gym bags etc too...</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> am I happy</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> and I thought it might be a good idea to not wear deodorant to see if that would take the pain</li>
            <li> This does a relatively good job and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> Works good but after about 6-8 hours feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making an exception for this product because it is, I think, exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but be sure to reapply midday.</li>
            <li> I saw so many great reviews for this product that I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a great option if you&#x27;re looking for a safe deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.    </li>
            <li> So happy with product and have recommended to many friends.</li>
            <li> but I think I am feeling better too!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I tried Primal Pit Paste for a couple days and it wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!.....</li>
            <li> Why put chemically-laden ingredients found in store-bought brand names when you can safely use this product?!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Works better than the chemically-based deodorants and anti-perperants out there!  </li>
            <li> Ordering a bunch more!</li>
            <li> So all in all, despite its less-than-elegant name, this is a product to try if you are looking for an effective and healthy deodorant!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, albeit too pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice unscented stick, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions by letting it sit against my skin for a minute to warm it...</li>
            <li> The unscented has a kind of &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell (we didn&#x27;t like it) and both of us were stinky (as in b.o.) by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I find that it takes about 10 seconds for the product to warm up.  </li>
            <li> I had used Crystal Essence which I really liked</li>
            <li> It might as well be the kind where you have to use your fingers to apply.</li>
            <li> Sample sizes are also a nice way to try converting friends, coworkers &amp; relatives to healthier scent-free deodorant, or to offer house guests if you have to keep your home fragrance-free as we do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of costly</li>
            <li> I liked the lemongrass and thyme.</li>
            <li> The others were partially effective, but Primal Pit Paste stops all odor all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that really works...</li>
            <li> Otherwise liked the product.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> no chemicals smeared right where important glands are &#x3D; best stuff.  </li>
            <li> I wish I liked the stick version of the pit paste because it is definitely more convenient.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant stick I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I suppose for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re impressed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Works the best of any natural deodorants that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> He says it is the best natural one he has tried, and we have tried many.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to warm up soon, so maybe I&#x27;ll be able to handle it better.</li>
            <li> I ordered the unscented and it works great and no weird staining.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and there&#x27;s no noticable residue after one day.  </li>
            <li> But I was fine!</li>
            <li> No BO smell at all...even better than some antiperspirants I have tried.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found to combat stinky pits even in 100+ degree temperatures.</li>
            <li> Much better than Tom&#x27;s, much better than underarm crystal.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not terribly sweaty people and just sit at a desk most of the day, but this did not work for either me or my husband.</li>
            <li> Update: still love it,</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I just feel better about using this product than a product that has aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> If you want to extend your appeal beyond places like Santa Cruz and Berkeley, you need to come up with a better name for the product and better packaging too.  </li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of non-toxic deodorants.</li>
            <li> The more I learn as a consumer, the more attention I pay to the products we buy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m so glad I found Primal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and is chemical free!</li>
            <li> but I like Primal Pit Paste much better</li>
            <li> sure this is 2-3 times the price of the stinky stuff I used to buy at the corner store.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe for me to use and not worry about if my children touch it.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff- works very well</li>
            <li> Might even be able to get the hubby to try with this one.</li>
            <li> Glad I got the stick.</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Now he says that it works better than the brand he used to buy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Best of all no unsightly white antiperspirant all over my shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants, and despite being a cute, petite girl, I have some stinky pits.</li>
            <li> Their customer service was outstanding and made sure that I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> but just layer it on more than the two swipes recommended.</li>
            <li> I still give it five stars because I love having a safe option to use for most of the time.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  :)</li>
            <li> Most days, it&#x27;s does the trick.</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything I have tried in the mainstream stores.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to find anything to combat odor and this works most of the time.</li>
            <li> , the ingredients are simple, easy to read and pronounce and, best of all, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> have tried others that weren&#x27;t as good, this seems to work really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy there is a functional alternative to the harmful chemicals I am now trying to avoid, even though it is costly I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I justify another purchase.</li>
            <li> It holds up pretty good.</li>
            <li> I apply this on top of an application (mist) of aloe vera juice which helps it to go on smoothly and absorb better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Maybe their sensitive Happy Pits one will work better, because it has clay in it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many types of Natural Deodorants and this one works great.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is all natural - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li> I love Primal Pit Paste unscented in the jar so much that I thought having the stick would be a great quick on the go deoderant.  </li>
            <li> you are extremely sensitive, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that they do sell lip-balm-sized samples of it for just a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> It still works but until they change the ingredients or ratio of ingredients to make it go on more smoothly, I&#x27;ll stick to their jarred version.</li>
            <li> But other than that, very happy and have reordered twice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to apply and quite a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> I tried the strong unscented paste in the jar and although it took about a week for the redness to subside, it worked *</li>
            <li> Anyway, this works and works for DAYS just fine (except for those two days a month) without any issues in between showers or even after working out in the yard.  </li>
            <li> though).&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to be able to order it through Amazon because my first time buying it, I ordered directly from the company.</li>
            <li> Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so it was important to find a pit stick that doesn&#x27;t contain any risky ingredients (like fragrance).</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pit paste&amp;#34; can get kind of crumbly if you try to slather your arm pit with too much of it.</li>
            <li> this is a good natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Still a good natural option.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and this by far is the best one I have used.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried about the hot temps, but this works!!</li>
            <li> The first couple days were great, but then I had an extremely busy day at work</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need more if its hot out.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a more natural deodorant, but if you actally sweat (and I do!), this isn&#x27;t helpful.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, uses healthy ingredients, is effective as a deodorant, and does not deteriorate the fabric of my clothing (which, after many years of use, I realized my previously much-loved deodorant does!).  </li>
            <li> So far loving this.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, and I even thought about making my own, but I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This has really helped plus I feel it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Even though the jar is more of a hassle to apply, it is much smoother and soaks in with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I was even more stinky after that, even though I didn&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li> A safe deodorant that really works.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I liked knowing that I was very well protected.  </li>
            <li> That said, if you have a kid that wants deodorant like mom/dad, this would be a great product to give them the experience without the junk in traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t noticed sweating much more than I used to using the normal chemical-filled, toxic stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li> Another faulty product referral from Lisa Leake and 100 Days of Real Food!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply (don&#x27;t apply too much, I got a red rash when I tried more than one light swipe) and in a convenient container.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural non-aluminum deodorants and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> After trying SO many natural, aluminum-free deodorants I had almost given up.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply it every day and when you do, hold it on your skin to warm it up so it can spread without leaving a red rash.</li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate (I think some have too much grit or too strong an alkalinity) or smell funny (like those with neem or tea tree etc).</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s &#x27;unscented&#x27; it has a slight nice smell of coconut surf wax!</li>
            <li> I put it on right after showering (and shaving) and I don&#x27;t have to worry about odor all day.</li>
            <li> and it actually has a modest but pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> As far as providing me with stench control (I&#x27;m going through chemo treatments right now), it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I will give a good rating to products that I buy and feel good about, but I don&#x27;t usually take the extra time needed to do reviews very often.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to apply, but if you hold it to your arm for a minute it will warm it up which allows it to be applied better.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well for eliminating smell, but in the cooler climates it is not very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This does exact what it says but I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a natural, carcinogen free, deodorant.</li>
            <li> I smelled like I hadn&#x27;t showered and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot sweaty day.</li>
            <li> I saw a recommendation for this on YouTube and thought I’d give it a try, after all it’s not that much different in price from most of the clinical strength stuff sold off the shelf, and that is what I was using before.  </li>
            <li> But, it has really worked!  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I recommend getting a baking soda free deodorant.</li>
            <li> and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that works and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> she told me it keeps her pits fresh even after her intense UFC classes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to settle with one I&#x27;d found that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin any more than I could handle and lasted for a solid half-day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Of note, it is a bit of a shock to use the first time if you&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You can roll the dice for a couple of days a month, ladies, or use the old aluminum stuff as a back-up if needed for an important day.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, but this deodorant is definitely worth a try if you are looking for an effective natural product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great for people who react to most toiletries because who wants to risk buying a whole container when there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll be unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot climate and perspiring and odor</li>
            <li> the essential oils in the scented one I tried were too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li> This certainly helped with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s like rubbing a large pencil eraser under your arm -</li>
            <li> Used this for a few weeks now and love it!  </li>
            <li> so you kind of have to hold it under your pit until it warms up a little to glide on.</li>
            <li> It works really well for preventing odors</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> The texture is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I was really REALLY wanting this to work.</li>
            <li> Keeps me free from odor for a solid 24 hours, even through workouts!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking to make the change from using toxic products!</li>
            <li> #34;Pit Paste&amp;#34;, really?  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so much safer for you, the environment, and those around you, compared to the toxic, reeking mainstream deodorants.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so much safer for you, the environment, and those around you, compared to the toxic, reeking mainstream deodorants.</li>
            <li> It keeps me free of odor, even in the middle of summer when I&#x27;m drenched in sweat after working in the yard.</li>
            <li> I really put it on, maybe 5-7 swipes.</li>
            <li> Works very well with a neutral scent.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes the pit paste stick.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This product left me scent free.</li>
            <li> so I really want this to work, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are simple enough that you could probably make your own-</li>
            <li> Not every product works for everyone since all of our bodies are different, but this is by far his favorite.</li>
            <li> Not too effective though if you perspire heavily.</li>
            <li> I only ran into issues when it was super hot</li>
            <li> So I was very surprised that the first Primal Pit deodorant I tried was everything I&#x27;d been looking for all this time - no aluminum,</li>
            <li> I normally make my own but with two little ones I wanted to save time and buy this to try.</li>
            <li> It cost more that other deodorants</li>
            <li> Better than any other I&#x27;ve used and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth it, but I can&#x27;t seem to help bit feel that those of us who care about our health are being taken for a ride by some of these companies with their ridiculously high prices for natural and organic products.</li>
            <li> was looking for a sensitive skin compatible deodorant, this one works pretty well</li>
            <li> Its so much like normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that he was willing to try it.</li>
            <li> but it some how keeps your pits dry without aluminum filled antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical by the time I decided to try primal pit paste, but given the good reviews I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> The primal pit paste has worked for me better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I did not experience any major detox symptoms since I live a pretty clean life in spite of my red meat proclivities.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Some other natural deodorants make me stink more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I live in a very hot climate and that&#x27;s not really possible (to not wear deodorant).  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make sure to update my post in a few months.</li>
            <li> Eventually I decided it was time to give a more natural approach a try (previous attempts with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, the crystal stick, etc., did nothing for me, either sweat or odor-wise.).</li>
            <li> and you can get dressed right away with no white antiperspirant residue to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix</li>
            <li> it showed on my shirt since I live in FL and wear tanks all year</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to wash your hands after applying, but really, is that really that big a deal?</li>
            <li> It took my body about a week to adjust to it, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues with body odor or anything (and I live in a super hot, humid climate where I&#x27;m pretty much constantly sweating a little bit).</li>
            <li> Overall I would say it is a good product just a little different for those not used to this type of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural to get away from other deodorants that are filled with chemicals and aluminum.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised!  </li>
            <li> Overall this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have searched for years for something that works that is natural and this is it!  </li>
            <li> I developed a rash after using this product for a couple of days but during those couple of days I didn&#x27;t smell at all!  </li>
            <li> All natural!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I could actually read and understand the ingredients as I am a big go all natural freak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very stinky person, especially in the winter, but just sitting at my desk on the computer, I stunk after several hours, more than I normally do with nothing on.</li>
            <li> I guess I am too sensitive to the baking soda.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that combats smell and sweat.</li>
            <li> only really regret is getting the unscented deodorant, but this can probably be combined with an oil or perfume of your choice.</li>
            <li> I am a really sweaty person as well as I have nearly constant pain under my arms</li>
            <li> but I developed redness and itching after using it for awhile</li>
            <li> The only gripe is that I have never gotten razor burn before I used this, it may be because it is very oily</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural, non-toxic deodorant since 2010.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the effort of creating natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> All natural and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> My son likes this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I still have not found a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> I really hoped that PPP would be the answer, but my search for a non-aluminum deodorant that actually works continues...</li>
            <li> I think warming it under your arm to apply it isn&#x27;t too big a deal, but they recommend that you don&#x27;t put much on.</li>
            <li> Getting one for my young daughter too.</li>
            <li> Only used it a week, but really works for me.  </li>
            <li> I have shopped around for a good natural deodorants on and off for years- always to sadly return to my unscented chemical-laden antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other non aluminum deodorants, but none lasted very long and had a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> This does both all the while saving me from Alzheimer and other problems resulting from toxic metals being put right by my underarm lymph nodes</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended but it rolls on difficulty and doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> feels pretty unfordable and not much</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit more time to apply than conventional deodorant, and I mean just seconds more.</li>
            <li> After several months of using this product (and dealing with large crumbs of this stuff falling on the bathroom floor during every application), I finally happened to notice that there were instructions on the bottle for applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I’m not overly fastidious about using organic stuff, but for certain products that I use every single day, I do try to lean away from majorly toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But the deodorant is so firm, that the Pit Paste folks suggest you hold the product under your arm for a few seconds to warm it up and allow it to soften.  </li>
            <li> I understand that some have not found this effective and/or irritating, so obviously bodies differ.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the effectiveness of this deodorant at actually preventing odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very active person and it keeps me smelling fresh all day without irritation, darkening or my underarms, etc.</li>
            <li> This has held up to my pregnant hormone temperature swings, running after my toddler all day, even grocery shopping on a busy Saturday in a heavy wool winter coat (something that always makes me sweat!)</li>
            <li> To be clear to those who don&#x27;t know, this is a deodorant only.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural alternative to regular deodorant which could cause breast cancer and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li> I had to quit using another natural deodorant because it stopped working after several months, so I wonder if I&#x27;ll just have to alternate from one product to another, but so far it&#x27;s still working</li>
            <li> I have looked for 9 years to find a natural product that actually works.  </li>
            <li> Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the only deodorant I use</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s natural &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; deodorant and it simply did not work.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This deodorant, and another natural one I used with baking soda, burned my underarms and they turned red after using it for about 5 to 7 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants in my effort to avoid aluminum.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to apply at first, but once it warms up it goes on fine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because I like to use natural products if I can, especially if it is in my price range; however, after using this consistently over a few weeks I noticed that my arm pits got dry and red and itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have too much trouble with B.O., so I thought it would be no big deal to use this instead of the Dove Sensitive Skin that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so that might make a difference to some in their experience.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little sticky being talc-free (another known carcinogen), and it&#x27;s odor protection may not be as long-lasting as the poisonous stuff, but I personally feel reapplying late in the day is better than risking cancer!</li>
            <li> As someone who had always used regular aluminum deodorant with great results, I didn&#x27;t even know I could smell bad until I tried Kiss my Face and Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , it seems to work well as far as odor with maybe not as much &#x27;dampness&#x27; control as a heavy duty RightGuard.</li>
            <li> I have tried only four brands, so I am not a huge expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth, this is my favourite.</li>
            <li> I broke out after the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I still sweat (which I consider a natural part of being HUMAN), but it doesn&#x27;t stink, even after a long day.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions (&amp;#34;Place the open stick on your pit and let your body heat soften it up for a few seconds.&amp;#34;) kept the crumbles away.</li>
            <li> The only time this doesn&#x27;t work is when hormones are crashing - i.e. the first few days of a female&#x27;s cycle.  </li>
            <li> And feels good to know I&#x27;m not adding anymore chemicals and bad stuff into my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the deodorant outside in the southern US, with temperatures often reacting 90F with 90% humidity, and this deodorant works just as well as any drugstore deodorants out there (big improvement for me over other natural deodorants that seem to make you smell funky almost immediately).</li>
            <li> It actually works, unlike other natural products.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this product is amazing, especially if you have tried and wasted money on other &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; deodorants as I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every other natural deodorant out there</li>
            <li> Sometimes deodorant can effect the skin near your chest and you can develop acne or other bumps.</li>
            <li> My husband says I&#x27;m never stinky like I could be with other natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t have antiperspirant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t stain my clothes since I wear quite a bit of black.</li>
            <li> the extra money!it lasts about twice as long (you need only the thinnest layer of it)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Zion Health&#x27;s clay-based natural deodorant, and for half the price, it works about the same as Primal Pit Paste.</li>
            <li> Primal Pit Paste works for me, as long as it isn&#x27;t 85 degrees outside.</li>
            <li> But it lasts about twice as long (you need only the thinnest layer of it)!</li>
            <li> I spent this much money for it to go to waste.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this one in particular and he does not have any issues with excessive perspiration and he never has any body odor smells.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to roll on and therefore does not seem to help much.</li>
            <li> so I just grabbed one of the cheap deodorants we give to patients or else my coworkers and patients would have been really sorry.</li>
            <li> Also, one stick lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Primal Pit Paste has sales often and this product lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Not cost effective to send back :[</li>
            <li> Its 2 oz which is only a little less than a normal deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> For a test, I skipped my shower one day when I had not been all that active outside, then was active all day outside the next day, in the Southeast Texas heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> The bonus for me is that this doesn&#x27;t stain his clothes blue like his other deodorant did.</li>
            <li> We avoid aluminum and other chemicals as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and prevents you from being stinky, which I couldn&#x27;t believe until I tried it.</li>
            <li> Some made me feel like I smelled worse than if I&#x27;d gone without deodorant at all, and others gave me a huge rash and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it even kept me fairly dry.</li>
            <li> works well, but ruins anything white!</li>
            <li> Natural deodorants don&#x27;t usually do the job.  </li>
            <li> Switched my teenage boy over to this in our effort to go less toxic.., haven&#x27;t noticed any stink (</li>
            <li> but these come in conveniently sized sticks that I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> Dies the job minus the aluminim</li>
            <li> We had the same problem with Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> but I can pronounce all the ingredients and there are only a few of them.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of applying I could smell myself, a gross b.o. smell.  </li>
            <li> Minus the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard the same from a few friends</li>
            <li> After finding out how unhealthy regular deodorant is, I set out to find a natural one that still did the job.</li>
            <li> Totally works on preventing odour, makes me a little red, but at least it&#x27;s not chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed this didn&#x27;t work as I&#x27;m trying to go healthy now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that said it did nothing to prevent them from getting stinky.</li>
            <li> but does not have a scent other than the Shea sent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other non aluminum &amp;#34;deodorants.&amp;#34; None of them work for me.</li>
            <li> The company I emailed and they said they were going to send some sample of other products to try ...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I kinda have to wait a little for it to dry again after application though.</li>
            <li> It applies very dry and your skin will drag with it a bit if you press too hard, but it also means there is no fanning of your underarms for it to air dry</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little rough going on.</li>
            <li> aluminum deodorants because this stuff is a little rough going on.  </li>
            <li> I tried a lot of interim product solutions but with no success until I came across this one.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a product with such simple ingredients could get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I called and they sent me out a formula with less baking soda and no scent.</li>
            <li> My armpits also seem to perspire much less, a benefit I did not expect from a deodorant.</li>
            <li> There are varieties with extra baking soda (for those with tough BO) and with reduced baking soda (for delicate skin) as well as the standard recipe.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about whether or not it would work</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a little bit</li>
            <li> would like it to be a little softer, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper</li>
            <li> The stick is just a little too sticky for me (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for stink and with in a few hours of applying after my shower</li>
            <li> One thing i was worried about was if it would withstand heavy workouts.</li>
            <li> I’d been researching an organic deodorant for a while and tried a few that didn’t work.  </li>
            <li> I got used to that in a few days, no problem.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy a few sticks to throw in my gym bag, use while traveling, etc.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products in this world that has surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little stiff when you go to put it on</li>
            <li> I had a little skin irritation but that is common due to PH balances.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that this product be tried if you are looking for something other than aluminum based antiperspirants or deodorants that just mingle with the bad body odor that eventually develops during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how it does when the summer rolls around.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I like it or not.</li>

            <li> It hardly helps.  </li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly missed the antiperspirant since switching to this stuff almost a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Feels really hard</li>
            <li> It takes time getting use to the &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feeling, but once you&#x27;re use to it, you hardly notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to manage.</li>
            <li> There is some common ingredient between the two brands that causes this.</li>
            <li> For everyone that is having rash issues go to their website and read thru all of the commonly asked questions section.</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> Not a single whiff of unpleasant odor after 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any weird reactions or breakouts as other people have reported, I was worried about that which is why I got the unscented.</li>
            <li> When natural deodorants don&#x27;t work, the results can be quite tragic.</li>
            <li> I have serious health problems</li>
            <li> It is tough to put on but warms up as you are using it.</li>
            <li> A lot of deodorants are irritating.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to give up my Secret Clinical Strength.  </li>
            <li> Also, zero questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive to purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I found it difficult to rub on.</li>
            <li> Difficult to roll on.</li>
            <li> To expensive and doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> The house, and me, are both so cold</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this stuff, but whatever it is I broke out in an awful rash where applied.</li>
            <li> This deodorant didn&#x27;t work well for me in terms of protection from odor: at the end of the day I could feel unpleasant smell from my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I could wear all day and not smell too bad at the end..</li>
            <li> bad it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, because there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this product, and it&#x27;s expensive and non-refundable.</li>
            <li> Wish I could still use it :(</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Dies the job minus the aluminim</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good! No BO smell at all...even better than some antiperspirants I have tried. Will definitely be my deodorant of choice from now on!</li>
            <li> It works really well for preventing odors BUT the downfall is that for some like, it causes me to break out in a red rash under the arms. We had the same problem with Green Tidings. There is some common ingredient between the two brands that causes this. Too bad!</li>
            <li> This does exact what it says but I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I broke out after the first few days.  I guess I am too sensitive to the baking soda.  DARN!</li>
            <li> this is a good natural deodorant.  have tried others that weren&#x27;t as good, this seems to work really well!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, albeit too pricey for what it is. I&#x27;ve made similar deodorant before myself, and I can say it probably costs about $1 total to make this in bulk. However, it does work. I&#x27;ve gone two days without reapplying, even with periods of moderate sweating and nary a whiff of unpleasantness. Also, zero questionable ingredients. Its definitely worth it, but I can&#x27;t seem to help bit feel that those of us who care about our health are being taken for a ride by some of these companies with their ridiculously high prices for natural and organic products.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing primal pit paste. I&#x27;ve tried almost every other natural deodorant out there and this one works best for me! I live in Phoenix so I was worried about the hot temps, but this works!! I still sweat (which I consider a natural part of being HUMAN), but it doesn&#x27;t stink, even after a long day. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found to combat stinky pits even in 100+ degree temperatures.</li>
            <li> This was just what I wanted.  Works great, but be sure to reapply midday.</li>
            <li> works well, but ruins anything white!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that combats smell and sweat. This does both all the while saving me from Alzheimer and other problems resulting from toxic metals being put right by my underarm lymph nodes so I don&#x27;t smell like a wildebeest. I did not experience any major detox symptoms since I live a pretty clean life in spite of my red meat proclivities. Give it a try. Much better than Tom&#x27;s, much better than underarm crystal.</li>
            <li> I have shopped around for a good natural deodorants on and off for years- always to sadly return to my unscented chemical-laden antiperspirant deodorant. I was skeptical by the time I decided to try primal pit paste, but given the good reviews I thought it was worth a try. The primal pit paste has worked for me better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried! I like the unscented version, the essential oils in the scented one I tried were too strong for my taste.  I use my hair drier to melt the stick a bit before applying, and I have no troubles with the application. I&#x27;ve been wearing the deodorant outside in the southern US, with temperatures often reacting 90F with 90% humidity, and this deodorant works just as well as any drugstore deodorants out there (big improvement for me over other natural deodorants that seem to make you smell funky almost immediately). This is not an antiperspirant, so be warned of that- you will sweat, which takes some getting used to after using an antiperspirant for any extended period of time.  The ingredients are simple enough that you could probably make your own- but these come in conveniently sized sticks that I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other non aluminum deodorants, but none lasted very long and had a strong fragrance. When they wore off there was still b.o.after a reg day.&lt;br /&gt;This not only works and prevents oder, it lasts all day and night. No b.o..no stains. I use the non scent.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Nice unscented stick, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all and you may as well just run Crisco in your pits. Another faulty product referral from Lisa Leake and 100 Days of Real Food!!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff. I was looking for a natural alternative to regular deodorant which could cause breast cancer and stumbled upon this. It keeps you dry and prevents you from being stinky, which I couldn&#x27;t believe until I tried it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well. Sometimes you need more if its hot out.</li>
            <li> So far loving this. Could be my imagination but I think I am feeling better too!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  It works!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t stain my clothes since I wear quite a bit of black. Luckily, this does the trick. It&#x27;s also easy to apply and quite a lot for the price. I would recommend it to people wanting to help their skin as well. Sometimes deodorant can effect the skin near your chest and you can develop acne or other bumps. This certainly helped with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only really regret is getting the unscented deodorant, but this can probably be combined with an oil or perfume of your choice. Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The texture is very sticky. Although it does keep oder away all day. I am always looking for a natural, carcinogen free, deodorant. But I just couldn&#x27;t buy this again. Not cost effective to send back :[</li>
            <li> I was really REALLY wanting this to work. I normally make my own but with two little ones I wanted to save time and buy this to try. I wish I saved the $ and didn&#x27;t. It did nothing for stink and with in a few hours of applying after my shower I smelled like I hadn&#x27;t showered and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot sweaty day. So sad. I wanted to love it but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love Primal Pit Paste unscented in the jar so much that I thought having the stick would be a great quick on the go deoderant.  I was wrong.  It&#x27;s sticky and doesn&#x27;t spread well.  It doesn&#x27;t smell too great.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s unscented but still has a yucky smell.  I have followed the directions by letting it sit against my skin for a minute to warm it... It hardly helps.  I don&#x27;t recommend the stick at all.  If you want to try this brand, I would recommend the tubs that you smear on.  They actually do work and its the only deoderant I could wear all day and not smell too bad at the end.. but the stick doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural non-aluminum deodorants and this is by far the best! It is easy to apply (don&#x27;t apply too much, I got a red rash when I tried more than one light swipe) and in a convenient container. It&#x27;s great stuff! Keeps me free from odor for a solid 24 hours, even through workouts!</li>
            <li> Great product! I was nervous after seeing some of the photo reviews, but I guess those were for the ones that have a fragrance. I ordered the unscented and it works great and no weird staining.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I saw it recommended on Food Babe&#x27;s and Wellness Mama&#x27;s blogs. I&#x27;m disappointed this didn&#x27;t work as I&#x27;m trying to go healthy now. We&#x27;re not terribly sweaty people and just sit at a desk most of the day, but this did not work for either me or my husband. The unscented has a kind of &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell (we didn&#x27;t like it) and both of us were stinky (as in b.o.) by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this deodorant is great! I wanted something natural to get away from other deodorants that are filled with chemicals and aluminum. One thing i was worried about was if it would withstand heavy workouts. Primal did not disappoint! I highly recommend this to anyone looking to make the change from using toxic products!</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, but this deodorant is definitely worth a try if you are looking for an effective natural product. I once forgot to reapply it after it&#x27;d been 24 hours and went to the gym. I was panicked when I got there and realizes i forgot my deodorant. But I was fine! The application the day before lasted through my work out without any embarrassing BO. Love it!</li>
            <li> I’m not overly fastidious about using organic stuff, but for certain products that I use every single day, I do try to lean away from majorly toxic ingredients.  I’d been researching an organic deodorant for a while and tried a few that didn’t work.  I saw a recommendation for this on YouTube and thought I’d give it a try, after all it’s not that much different in price from most of the clinical strength stuff sold off the shelf, and that is what I was using before.  Also I should note that I can be a bit of a sweaty girl; this stuff works for me, that’s it and that’s all.  No smell, 24 hours, no BO.  I’m so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite!  After trying SO many natural, aluminum-free deodorants I had almost given up.  Some made me feel like I smelled worse than if I&#x27;d gone without deodorant at all, and others gave me a huge rash and dried out my skin.  This is the only one that works.  It took my body about a week to adjust to it, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues with body odor or anything (and I live in a super hot, humid climate where I&#x27;m pretty much constantly sweating a little bit).</li>
            <li> I love this! I had to quit using another natural deodorant because it stopped working after several months, so I wonder if I&#x27;ll just have to alternate from one product to another, but so far it&#x27;s still working and I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks. Update: still love it, however some things I&#x27;ve noticed are that my clothes get a dingy stain under the arms now. Since this is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed, I presume the deodorant is causing it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t *always* hold up to the Florida heat. Still a good natural option.</li>
            <li> Makes me itch. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a product with such simple ingredients could get the job done.  But, it has really worked!  No break-through odors at the end of the day.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how it does when the summer rolls around.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I decided that I wanted to switch to just a deodorant instead of a deodorant &amp; antiperspirant.  I saw so many great reviews for this product that I thought I would give it a try.  I was a little nervous about whether or not it would work but it works great!  I did have to get used to perspiring but I don&#x27;t have any odor when I do and I just feel better about using this product than a product that has aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> Allow me to add to the comments about the branding.  &amp;#34;Pit Paste&amp;#34;, really?  If you want to extend your appeal beyond places like Santa Cruz and Berkeley, you need to come up with a better name for the product and better packaging too.  Regarding the product, itself, I do like it.  I bought the unscented version and it actually has a modest but pleasant scent.  But the deodorant is so firm, that the Pit Paste folks suggest you hold the product under your arm for a few seconds to warm it up and allow it to soften.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s like rubbing a large pencil eraser under your arm - feels pretty unfordable and not much product actually gets applied.  I find that it takes about 10 seconds for the product to warm up.  But once you do that, the product does apply and it works well.  It prevents body odor and seems to have no adverse effects.  The product would receive 5 stars if they could improve the formula to be softer and easier to apply and if they improved the &amp;#34;cringe&amp;#34; branding.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and there&#x27;s no noticable residue after one day.  Wore this while working at a Chemical Plant and it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of non-toxic deodorants. The more I learn as a consumer, the more attention I pay to the products we buy. Not every product works for everyone since all of our bodies are different, but this is by far his favorite. He says it helps with both sweat and odor. Also, one stick lasts a long time. This is a great option if you&#x27;re looking for a safe deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am a really sweaty person as well as I have nearly constant pain under my arms and I thought it might be a good idea to not wear deodorant to see if that would take the pain away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I live in a very hot climate and that&#x27;s not really possible (to not wear deodorant).  I tried Primal Pit Paste for a couple days and it wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it worked pretty well.  I was actually really surprised!  And, the pain has been gone since I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am going to be out in public, I do wear regular deodorant, but if I&#x27;m just going to be home, I wear no deodorant, or this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!  I have looked for 9 years to find a natural product that actually works.  Well, this is it!  It&#x27;s the only one I use!! It works!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that this product be tried if you are looking for something other than aluminum based antiperspirants or deodorants that just mingle with the bad body odor that eventually develops during the day. I was very surprised at the effectiveness of this deodorant at actually preventing odor. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that said it did nothing to prevent them from getting stinky. I guess I have the correct body chemistry that works perfectly with this product. No odor at all. Not even 24 hours later before my next shower. It takes a little bit more time to apply than conventional deodorant, and I mean just seconds more. It applies very dry and your skin will drag with it a bit if you press too hard, but it also means there is no fanning of your underarms for it to air dry and you can get dressed right away with no white antiperspirant residue to get on your clothes. I had used Crystal Essence which I really liked but I developed redness and itching after using it for awhile so I&#x27;m so glad I found Primal. Hopefully my skin won&#x27;t be irritated by this.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended but it rolls on difficulty and doesn&#x27;t last all day. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, and I even thought about making my own, but I decided to buy this one. Its 2 oz which is only a little less than a normal deodorant stick. It has an earthy sent like another reviewer said, but I didn&#x27;t mind it. I couldn&#x27;t smell anything after applying it. It is a little hard to apply at first, but once it warms up it goes on fine. I kinda have to wait a little for it to dry again after application though. I haven&#x27;t experienced the rashes or any stains on my clothes. There is a warning on the container about the baking soda in the deodorant causing rashes. If you have sensitive skin I recommend getting a baking soda free deodorant. Overall this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I will give a good rating to products that I buy and feel good about, but I don&#x27;t usually take the extra time needed to do reviews very often.  I&#x27;m making an exception for this product because it is, I think, exceptional.  It is easy to use, uses healthy ingredients, is effective as a deodorant, and does not deteriorate the fabric of my clothing (which, after many years of use, I realized my previously much-loved deodorant does!).  I tried a lot of interim product solutions but with no success until I came across this one.  So all in all, despite its less-than-elegant name, this is a product to try if you are looking for an effective and healthy deodorant!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to put on. It might as well be the kind where you have to use your fingers to apply. So it defeats the purpose of it being in a stick.</li>
            <li> I really like this deoderant.  I live in a very hot climate and perspiring and odor is a problem.  This has really helped plus I feel it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because I like to use natural products if I can, especially if it is in my price range; however, after using this consistently over a few weeks I noticed that my arm pits got dry and red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to apply, but if you hold it to your arm for a minute it will warm it up which allows it to be applied better.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and is chemical free! My husband wears this one in particular and he does not have any issues with excessive perspiration and he never has any body odor smells. Unlike me, he&#x27;s not had a reaction to the baking soda.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to roll on and therefore does not seem to help much.</li>
            <li> I really like this, it seems to work well as far as odor with maybe not as much &#x27;dampness&#x27; control as a heavy duty RightGuard. Even though it&#x27;s &#x27;unscented&#x27; it has a slight nice smell of coconut surf wax! The only gripe is that I have never gotten razor burn before I used this, it may be because it is very oily so it clogs the pores easier. I&#x27;m very happy there is a functional alternative to the harmful chemicals I am now trying to avoid, even though it is costly I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I justify another purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that works and lasts all day. It has the consistency of a baking powder paste and shows white, so I don&#x27;t wear it with sleeveless things. But other than that, very happy and have reordered twice.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin. The ingredients are: Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Non-Aluminum Baking Soda, Beeswax, Arrowroot Powder.&lt;br /&gt;Under tips there is a note that it contains essentials oils- but does not have a scent other than the Shea sent.  I don&#x27;t know why this is noted. I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine but I like Primal Pit Paste much better-I will buy it again. It cost more that other deodorants but I can pronounce all the ingredients and there are only a few of them.</li>
            <li> A lot of deodorants are irritating.  Natural deodorants don&#x27;t usually do the job.  Primal Pit Paste works for me, as long as it isn&#x27;t 85 degrees outside.</li>
            <li> was looking for a sensitive skin compatible deodorant, this one works pretty well, it is not an antiperspirant, but it does keep the stink away.</li>
            <li> I have serious health problems so it was important to find a pit stick that doesn&#x27;t contain any risky ingredients (like fragrance). This stuff is perfect. I have tried only four brands, so I am not a huge expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth, this is my favourite. Of course it prevents BO wonderfully- that&#x27;s essential. It doesn&#x27;t irritate (I think some have too much grit or too strong an alkalinity) or smell funny (like those with neem or tea tree etc). The screw-closed container is AWESOME, because my husband travels a lot and if he leaves this in a warm place, like in a suitcase in his car, and it melts, this likely won&#x27;t leak (I can&#x27;t swear to that as we&#x27;ve not melted it yet though).&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to be able to order it through Amazon because my first time buying it, I ordered directly from the company. That got me on their harassment list and I was swamped in spam from them. Ordering here allows me my anonymity so they can&#x27;t bother me. I guess that tells you a lot about how great the product is, that I didn&#x27;t just stop buying it after the company ticked me off.&lt;br /&gt;If you are extremely sensitive, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that they do sell lip-balm-sized samples of it for just a couple bucks. That&#x27;s great for people who react to most toiletries because who wants to risk buying a whole container when there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll be unable to use it. There are varieties with extra baking soda (for those with tough BO) and with reduced baking soda (for delicate skin) as well as the standard recipe. I started out with a sample size of each to decide which we preferred. Sample sizes are also a nice way to try converting friends, coworkers &amp; relatives to healthier scent-free deodorant, or to offer house guests if you have to keep your home fragrance-free as we do. And they are great for travel, gym bags etc too... tiny but with enough product to last months!&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the price... sure this is 2-3 times the price of the stinky stuff I used to buy at the corner store. But it lasts about twice as long (you need only the thinnest layer of it)! And it&#x27;s so much safer for you, the environment, and those around you, compared to the toxic, reeking mainstream deodorants. It is definitely worth the extra money!it lasts about twice as long (you need only the thinnest layer of it)!

            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a little bit and I&#x27;m not sure if I like it or not. Maybe because I purchased the unscented one, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a little stiff when you go to put it on so you kind of have to hold it under your pit until it warms up a little to glide on. Nobody has said I smell so I suppose it works well and I think again it may just be because I&#x27;m used to having a scent under my arm so I worry it&#x27;s not working. It&#x27;s kind of costly and I&#x27;m almost out of it already, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to buy it again but maybe.</li>
            <li> Smells like bleach cleaning products(especially when you sweat). Too expensive to purchase again. Plus it doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.</li>
            <li> It did its job. I used the unscented version. I like the idea of using a non-aluminum based deodorant.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great price. Great value. Delivered earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works! and it&#x27;s safe for me to use and not worry about if my children touch it.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff- works very well</li>
            <li> I discovered Primal Pit Paste (the unscented version) about two years ago, and I&#x27;m still using it because it works. It keeps me free of odor, even in the middle of summer when I&#x27;m drenched in sweat after working in the yard. The &amp;#34;pit paste&amp;#34; can get kind of crumbly if you try to slather your arm pit with too much of it. After several months of using this product (and dealing with large crumbs of this stuff falling on the bathroom floor during every application), I finally happened to notice that there were instructions on the bottle for applying the deodorant. (Dummy me.) Following the instructions (&amp;#34;Place the open stick on your pit and let your body heat soften it up for a few seconds.&amp;#34;) kept the crumbles away. It really doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff--only a thin coat--to keep odor away.</li>
            <li> It works great and is all natural - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do naturally. I had a little skin irritation but that is common due to PH balances. Overall I would say it is a good product just a little different for those not used to this type of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been converting all of my chemical laden, toxic products to &#x27;cleaner&#x27; ones and the last thing to go was my deodorant.  I was hesitant to give up my Secret Clinical Strength.  I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I liked knowing that I was very well protected.  Well, I finally decided to give PPP a try and boy am I happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line, the ingredients are simple, easy to read and pronounce and, best of all, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural, non-toxic deodorant since 2010. Some work and some don&#x27;t. When natural deodorants don&#x27;t work, the results can be quite tragic. Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m a very active person and it keeps me smelling fresh all day without irritation, darkening or my underarms, etc. Primal Pit Paste has sales often and this product lasts a long time so it&#x27;s quite affordable. Primal Pit Paste Natural Deodorant Stick in Unscented is the only deodorant I use and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.    Ingredients: Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Arrowroot Powder, Organic Beeswax and Aluminum Free-Baking Soda</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Primal Pit Paste.  I&#x27;ve tried other non aluminum &amp;#34;deodorants.&amp;#34; None of them work for me. Within a few hours of applying I could smell myself, a gross b.o. smell.  As someone who had always used regular aluminum deodorant with great results, I didn&#x27;t even know I could smell bad until I tried Kiss my Face and Tom&#x27;s. Yuck. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s truly amazing. I put it on right after showering (and shaving) and I don&#x27;t have to worry about odor all day. Finally! It says a swipe or two is all you need. I really put it on, maybe 5-7 swipes. I also reapply before bed. This has held up to my pregnant hormone temperature swings, running after my toddler all day, even grocery shopping on a busy Saturday in a heavy wool winter coat (something that always makes me sweat!) I haven&#x27;t had any weird reactions or breakouts as other people have reported, I was worried about that which is why I got the unscented. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the different scents next. Seriously, this product is amazing, especially if you have tried and wasted money on other &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; deodorants as I have. Everyone is different though, I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> After finding out how unhealthy regular deodorant is, I set out to find a natural one that still did the job. I tried Tom&#x27;s natural &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; deodorant and it simply did not work. Thank god I found out about primal pit paste, which was recommended by my health-freak friend, (look her up on instagram: organicallydelicious) she told me it keeps her pits fresh even after her intense UFC classes. Not only does this eliminate the smell but it some how keeps your pits dry without aluminum filled antiperspirant. I am so thankful to finally have found something that WORKS. Will continue to order this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly missed the antiperspirant since switching to this stuff almost a year ago.  To be clear to those who don&#x27;t know, this is a deodorant only.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed sweating much more than I used to using the normal chemical-filled, toxic stuff (all antiperspirants contain aluminum, which has been linked to cancer).  It does feel a little sticky being talc-free (another known carcinogen), and it&#x27;s odor protection may not be as long-lasting as the poisonous stuff, but I personally feel reapplying late in the day is better than risking cancer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a natural deodorant that works for me. This does a relatively good job and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little rough going on. would like it to be a little softer, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper</li>
            <li> Feels really hard and I found it difficult to rub on. It needs to be a lot smoother. It still works but until they change the ingredients or ratio of ingredients to make it go on more smoothly, I&#x27;ll stick to their jarred version.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! So happy with product and have recommended to many friends.</li>
            <li> This deodorant didn&#x27;t work well for me in terms of protection from odor: at the end of the day I could feel unpleasant smell from my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Because I felt the smell only at the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t mind using it, until I noticed redness that would not go away. I kept using this deodorant and red patch became bigger in size. Later I read that baking soda could have been an irritant. As soon as I stopped using this deodorant, redness went away.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it didn&#x27;t work for me. I appreciate the effort of creating natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works! Love it!..... might try a scented one next time. Might even be able to get the hubby to try with this one. Its so much like normal deodorant. Minus the chemicals. Glad I got the stick.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! Finally a natural deodorant that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to. All natural and no aluminum. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Why put chemically-laden ingredients found in store-bought brand names when you can safely use this product?! Works very well with a neutral scent. I love it!</li>
            <li> I understand that some have not found this effective and/or irritating, so obviously bodies differ.  I am completely pleased with this product.  For a test, I skipped my shower one day when I had not been all that active outside, then was active all day outside the next day, in the Southeast Texas heat and humidity.  Not a single whiff of unpleasant odor after 48 hours.  I bought the unscented since some thought their scented ones caused irritation.  You might want to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for aluminum-free deodorants off and on for a couple years now.  I thought I was going to have to settle with one I&#x27;d found that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin any more than I could handle and lasted for a solid half-day.  So I was very surprised that the first Primal Pit deodorant I tried was everything I&#x27;d been looking for all this time - no aluminum, no stinging, no funk, no cakiness, and hopefully no more ruined shirts.</li>
            <li> This really works.  Better than any other I&#x27;ve used and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> Switched my teenage boy over to this in our effort to go less toxic.., haven&#x27;t noticed any stink (which *has*...been noticed at points in the past) since the switch, a couple months ago. Yay.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the pit paste stick. I was actually surprised that he was willing to try it. Now he says that it works better than the brand he used to buy. The bonus for me is that this doesn&#x27;t stain his clothes blue like his other deodorant did. I wish I liked the stick version of the pit paste because it is definitely more convenient. But I personally prefer the jar. The stick is just a little too sticky for me (no pun intended). Even though the jar is more of a hassle to apply, it is much smoother and soaks in with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It works great. I never smell and it never stains or clumps up on my clothes like &amp;#34;Toms&amp;#34; does.</li>
            <li> I apply this on top of an application (mist) of aloe vera juice which helps it to go on smoothly and absorb better in my opinion. It works really well.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant out there. You don&#x27;t need to apply it every day and when you do, hold it on your skin to warm it up so it can spread without leaving a red rash. It took me about 3 weeks to a month to see the benefits so stick with it until it starts working!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and this by far is the best one I have used.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked the lemongrass and thyme. Not such a fan of the unscented. It is tough to put on but warms up as you are using it.</li>
            <li> Totally works on preventing odour, makes me a little red, but at least it&#x27;s not chemicals</li>
            <li> It actually works, unlike other natural products.</li>
            <li> My son likes this natural deodorant. He says it is the best natural one he has tried, and we have tried many. We avoid aluminum and other chemicals as much as possible.  However,  I cannot use it. I probably could if there was no baking soda in the deodorant. This deodorant, and another natural one I used with baking soda, burned my underarms and they turned red after using it for about 5 to 7 days. Not too effective though if you perspire heavily. I still have not found a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant stick I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts quite a while. Best of all no unsightly white antiperspirant all over my shirts. Waiting to see how this stuff holds up in the summer heat. I&#x27;ll make sure to update my post in a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants, and despite being a cute, petite girl, I have some stinky pits. Nothing was working until this. Now I smell great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this. It&#x27;s nonscented, works great!  The commercial branded deodorants do not mix well with me. This product left me scent free.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few weeks now and love it!  My husband says I&#x27;m never stinky like I could be with other natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t have antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very stinky person, especially in the winter, but just sitting at my desk on the computer, I stunk after several hours, more than I normally do with nothing on. (Does this stuff interact in a way to actually cause B.O.?). It definitely didn&#x27;t hold up after a moderate workout on a Stairmaster at the gym for 30 minutes...I was even more stinky after that, even though I didn&#x27;t sweat much. I&#x27;m very disappointed, because there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this product, and it&#x27;s expensive and non-refundable. Maybe their sensitive Happy Pits one will work better, because it has clay in it? I&#x27;ve tried Zion Health&#x27;s clay-based natural deodorant, and for half the price, it works about the same as Primal Pit Paste. It&#x27;s also returnable from wherever you purchased it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. (I returned it and ordered PPP, which I&#x27;m now regretting.) I really hoped that PPP would be the answer, but my search for a non-aluminum deodorant that actually works continues...</li>
            <li> I have searched for years for something that works that is natural and this is it!  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It works wonderful!!!! For everyone that is having rash issues go to their website and read thru all of the commonly asked questions section. My husband had the same problem. I called and they sent me out a formula with less baking soda and no scent. Sometimes until your body gets used to the product it will give you a rash and /or baking soda sensitivity. You could also be going thru pit detox. Their customer service was outstanding and made sure that I was satisfied. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I could actually read and understand the ingredients as I am a big go all natural freak(: but I started breaking out under my armpit and so did my husband It sucks I spent this much money for it to go to waste. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants in my effort to avoid aluminum. The others were partially effective, but Primal Pit Paste stops all odor all day. My armpits also seem to perspire much less, a benefit I did not expect from a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was dying to try PPP, it worked well but I didn&#x27;t like that it showed on my shirt since I live in FL and wear tanks all year so I went back to the spray</li>
            <li> Works good but after about 6-8 hours feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have too much trouble with B.O., so I thought it would be no big deal to use this instead of the Dove Sensitive Skin that I normally use. The first couple days were great, but then I had an extremely busy day at work and I noticed about 4 hours in that I stank. Thankfully I work as a nurse so I just grabbed one of the cheap deodorants we give to patients or else my coworkers and patients would have been really sorry. I think warming it under your arm to apply it isn&#x27;t too big a deal, but they recommend that you don&#x27;t put much on. I think maybe I will give it another shot but just layer it on more than the two swipes recommended. I want to eliminate aluminum from my deodorant so I really want this to work, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work and didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation for me (I have multiple allergies, sensitive/fair skin and prone to breakouts if anything has a funky ingredient).  Of note, it is a bit of a shock to use the first time if you&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; aluminum deodorants because this stuff is a little rough going on.  I got used to that in a few days, no problem.  The only time this doesn&#x27;t work is when hormones are crashing - i.e. the first few days of a female&#x27;s cycle.  I&#x27;ve heard the same from a few friends so perhaps the only thing that stands up to hormones crashing is an aluminum-based product?  Anyway, this works and works for DAYS just fine (except for those two days a month) without any issues in between showers or even after working out in the yard.  I live in a dry climate so that might make a difference to some in their experience.  You can roll the dice for a couple of days a month, ladies, or use the old aluminum stuff as a back-up if needed for an important day.  I still give it five stars because I love having a safe option to use for most of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many types of Natural Deodorants and this one works great.  I just had an awful reaction I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am a sweaty betty, and have even used prescription antiperspirant in the past. Eventually I decided it was time to give a more natural approach a try (previous attempts with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, the crystal stick, etc., did nothing for me, either sweat or odor-wise.). I tried the strong unscented paste in the jar and although it took about a week for the redness to subside, it worked *great*.  No odor and it even kept me fairly dry. I decided to buy a few sticks to throw in my gym bag, use while traveling, etc. Uh uh, no. Stinky by the end of the day.  If you&#x27;ve only tried the stick and were unimpressed, give the paste a shot! Yes, you have to wash your hands after applying, but really, is that really that big a deal?</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well for eliminating smell, but in the cooler climates it is not very easy to apply.  The deodorant somewhat crumbles on.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever! I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li> no chemicals smeared right where important glands are &#x3D; best stuff.  AND it works!  No odor &#x3D; Perfect!!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product that really works...I don&#x27;t sweat or smell!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products in this world that has surpassed my expectations.  Works better than the chemically-based deodorants and anti-perperants out there!  And it lasts a hell of a lot longer, too!!</li>
            <li> I developed a rash after using this product for a couple of days but during those couple of days I didn&#x27;t smell at all!  I suppose for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this stuff, but whatever it is I broke out in an awful rash where applied. Otherwise liked the product. Wish I could still use it :(</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re impressed with this product so far.  It takes time getting use to the &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feeling, but once you&#x27;re use to it, you hardly notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Cause a rash and itching. The company I emailed and they said they were going to send some sample of other products to try ...I never heard back from them.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a close friend. This is amazing!! It holds up pretty good. I only ran into issues when it was super hot and I was outside all day - then I had to reapply. Most days, it&#x27;s does the trick. And feels good to know I&#x27;m not adding anymore chemicals and bad stuff into my body. All natural! Getting one for my young daughter too.</li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything I have tried in the mainstream stores.  I have not been able to find anything to combat odor and this works most of the time.</li>
            <li> A safe deodorant that really works.  Really.  I have been using it for quite a while and buy extra to share with friends.</li>
            <li> Difficult to roll on. Havent made up my mind yet.</li>
            <li> To expensive and doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Works the best of any natural deodorants that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This does nothing. Total waste of money! I love the idea of a more natural deodorant, but if you actally sweat (and I do!), this isn&#x27;t helpful. You would be just as well off without amy deodorant. That said, if you have a kid that wants deodorant like mom/dad, this would be a great product to give them the experience without the junk in traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> Some other natural deodorants make me stink more.  I don&#x27;t smell at all with this one.  Ordering a bunch more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!  Only used it a week, but really works for me.  I suggest using your blow dryer to soften it up for about 10 seconds for best results.</li>
            <li> The house, and me, are both so cold it&#x27;s hard to manage. It is supposed to warm up soon, so maybe I&#x27;ll be able to handle it better. As far as providing me with stench control (I&#x27;m going through chemo treatments right now), it WORKS!!</li>
