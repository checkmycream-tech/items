            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling this nasty Ringworm. It was all over my arms, back of my neck. I had been using, prescription creams, coconut oil, antifungal spray and none of them work like this Miracle 2 Neutralizer Gel. As soon as I applied it the itching stop!!! I don&#x27;t wake up at night itching anymore and I see result in just 1 application. It&#x27;s been 2 days now and its clearing up!!! Bumps dries out and disappears, it even works on pimples!!! I&#x27;m so happy and blessed to stumbled upon this product. Thank you God for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and a grandmother of 7. People are shocked when I&#x27;m referred to as mom or grandma. They tell me I look like I&#x27;m my daughter&#x27;s sister, who is 28 and 31. Truth be told, its not in the genes. My 50 year old sister is unaware that she has been mistaken for my mother. I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Love miracle2 products. The gel can be used for itching areas, anything irritable on the skin. Can be taken internnaly, my dog loves it after I put it on an irritated spot.</li>
            <li> I love this gel and have used it for years to deal with with my seasonal skin irritations. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and good price, but the seller takes their sweet time about shipping the product.  So, I deducted a star for slow service.</li>
            <li> I reccommend this product for healing and lubricating purposes anywhere you have skin.  This stuff really works.  I just wish it were cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray</li>
            <li> I put it on before my makeup.  It also has a tendency to heal some skin problems and sun burns.</li>
            <li> I totally believe in this product</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. This is the most amazing skin care item I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Very good on burns and any itchy conditions also. Good as a lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Good product for irritated skin from weather and other elements that damage skin such as black heads the packaging and delivery has expected good.</li>
            <li> Love this product; a friend recommended it to me and now I like to keep it on hand.  It&#x27;s great on insect bites and more!</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this product,will never run out of it.Prevents your skin from pilling,if sunburn happens,just apply as soon as you can,better take it with you to the beach.And if you use it morning and night every day,instead of your face care routine,you wont need a face lift.Been using it only 3 month,with fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Has been reducing size of tumor.&lt;br /&gt;Have reordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Miracle soap  with the Olay rotating cleanser brush and this neutralizer. My skin is the best it&#x27;s looked for a long time. Pores are almost invisible and feels smoothed. Not wild about the moisturizer that goes with this trio.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Miracle 2 products since 2010 and wouldn&#x27;t be without them. I use the gel all over my body after my bath in the Miracle 2 soap. The gel helps to alkaline my whole body. I also use it when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun. It keeps me from burning and helps give me a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> Very healing for burns, skin fungus.  It&#x27;s great for many many things. That&#x27;s why they call it Miracle,&lt;br /&gt;Every home should have some.  Combination of the Miracle 2 Soap and this has curred cancer on my nose.</li>
            <li> I use it on my gums every day.  And they are healthy and strong without any sensitivities!!!!</li>
            <li> Like all the Miracle II products great for your skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and would not be without it. It has worked for me on a number of things.</li>
            <li> Have been using miracle 2 for years and love it!</li>
            <li> This product is a joke.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to locate this product! It works well as a moisturizer and is wonder in a container for sunburns and insect bites.</li>
            <li> Used this to help keep my PH alkaline.  I think it works but I&#x27;m not 100% sure yet.  It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is GOOD.it helps the skin!  Totally natural products and they do what they say.  My skin is 82 years old- and I love this product! I use it along with coconut oil.... EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> It seems to help with pain when applied and itching.</li>
            <li> this is a miracle, both my husband and i use almost daily instead of body lotion or oil, on face, its great after the pool, its great for all bug bites.  its amazing.  great for sun before after and during.  ANY skin stuff …. do it.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 25 years---love it!</li>
            <li> Great value, great service!</li>
            <li> We use it in the garden and even brush our teeth with it.  Apparently it is supposed to be alkalizing.  More information of how people use it can probably be found online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add a comment regarding an experience I had with the neutralizer gel just recently.  A scorpion got into bed with me and stung me three times before we dealt with it.  The time before when I got stung the area swelled up and it was very painful.  I ran into the bathroom and applied the neutralizer gel without diluting it and the stinging sensation went away and I was able to go back to sleep.  Apparently it alkalized the venom (at least in my situation).</li>
            <li> The Miracle 2 gel has started to do the job for me. My skin has had a lot of sun and dirt in my life, and it is rough. I purchased the product to smooth out the rough spots and this is starting to happen, I like the results.</li>
            <li> I use the Neutralizer every day in one way or another. Either to feed the skin, for eye irritation,to neutralizer stinging nettle, or neutralize a but bite.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Heals things almost overnight that neosporin won&#x27;t touch! Helps with facial acne and cuts really well. Unlike the soap, I have had a really great experience with this product. I would buy it by the gallon if I could. Helps with itching too!</li>
            <li> Use it on any itchy rash or small cut.  Great for skin allergies.  I even use it on mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> Great versatile natural product.</li>
            <li> great product at a good price with great service</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, it has kept my breakouts away.  I barely had a zit since using it.  However it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as I thought I read it did.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin, body and face.  I know it&#x27;s pure, and it moistens and soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction.  Batch # 041315G220046 copyright on label 2010  I used this product before and had healing results.  copyright on older bottle had 2011.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works great for sunburn and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle, I use it for burns and it really works to take out the pain as well as no blistering!!! it&#x27;s really amazing stuff people!</li>
            <li> I  have used this product for years and it truley is a Mircle.  Burns, sunburns, mouth sores, blemished, cuts, I could go on and on.  Wonderful product.  Don&#x27;t be skeptical, I used to be, not anymore!</li>
            <li> All this seems to be is coagulated water but it does go on your face smoothly and helps to tighten the wrinkles. It is also clean feeling and non toxic to your skin. I also use the regular miracle soap and have done so for over 20 years instead of regular soap and it also is an extremely good wound cleanser and well as household cleaner. I use the neutralizer gel every morning and evening and have never had any kind of skin irritation or breakouts because of it. Obviously, it is not a pore clogger. Recommend for anyone with normal or abnomal skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and am pleased.  It works, rebuilding skill and muscle. It is a topical application</li>
            <li> I use these products all the time and when I received this one the ph was nothing it should always be 8.o that&#x27;s what the word neutralizer means..would love to hear from supplier but was not allowed to. the other miracle ll products I received all tested high, don&#x27;t know what happened to this one.</li>
            <li> I use it a few year back. It remove dark spot on legs and feet. Them spot have return so I will be using Miracle II once more.</li>
            <li> This product is so great for breakout, rash, bruises and just soothing the skin. All of my family use it and love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Norma</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever for mosquito bites!  Just a drop, and I forget that I have a bug bite.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> THE NEUTRALIZING GEL HAS SO MANY USES!  I LOVE ALL THE MIRACLE 11 PRODUCTS. THANK YOU!!</li>
