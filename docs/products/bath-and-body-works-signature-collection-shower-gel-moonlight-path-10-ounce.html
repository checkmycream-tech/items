            <li>this is the most fabulous ordor in bath and body shop</li>
            <li>I love Moonlight Path ever since a gift basket was given to me filled with their products.  </li>
            <li>The main feature I look for is a good lather.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived frozen but after thawing out was just fine.</li>
            <li>It smells mighty fine.</li>

            <li>It is such a hassle to have to return things, so I would rather just not order this online at all if they can’t get it right.</li>
            <li>Its the exact same product</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t live near a store and its a seasonal scent so when I do get to a store they don&#x27;t always have it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this body gel for a few years now and I would not want to use some other brand if I can&#x27;t find this available.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  </li>

            <li> Moonlight Path is my favorite B&amp;BW fragrance.  I actually use the gels as liquid handsoaps in my home.  Amazon had these packaged and arrived promptly in 2 days as promised.  Love the product AND Amazon for delivering and being able to avoid the driving, the mall, and the crowds to go to the store for my few select favorites.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister in law and she loved it! I don&#x27;t think this is intended for men? so I didn&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> I love bath and body works but this one smells like something my grandmother would use.</li>
            <li> I have used this body gel for a few years now and I would not want to use some other brand if I can&#x27;t find this available.  I&#x27;m buying two, one for a friend and the other for me...it is really a good product.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT AS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent. I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon has Bath and Body Works available.  This bottle will last a long time.  I&#x27;ll probably get some of the body spray too.</li>
            <li> sob. My order got lost in the mail so I never got to even try this stuff out, but since I LOVE the moonlight path collection I bet it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> Goes well with the lotion and mist/splash........Great fragrance, not overpowering........The fragrance stays with you for quite a while.........:0)  Recommend it ...............</li>
            <li> thank you! this is the most fabulous ordor in bath and body shop I think :)&lt;br /&gt;shipping was really fast and I love your additional gift away hand gel ..:)&lt;br /&gt;thank you!!</li>

            <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
            <li> I love the way this bath gel smells.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much gel and it lathers up great.  I love the fact your skin smells wonderful after bathing with it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I wear it every day. I love the way it smells on me and the way it smells on others. For me, Moonlight Path is a must have. I use the shower gel and the body spray.</li>
            <li> I love Bath &amp; Bodyworks moonlight path products but I don&#x27;t live near a store and its a seasonal scent so when I do get to a store they don&#x27;t always have it.  Loved finding it on Amazon during its &amp;#34;off season&amp;#34;.  Its the exact same product and now I can enjoy it year around!</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong sent in the mail. I actually love the Moonlight Path scent- it is kind of baby powder like and soft. However, the scent I got smelled tart and fruity and terrible. It is such a hassle to have to return things, so I would rather just not order this online at all if they can’t get it right.</li>
            <li> It smells okay I guess. I really didn&#x27;t think this particular fragrance stood out very well. It just sort of has a generic perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I love the shower gel.</li>
            <li> I love Moonlight Path ever since a gift basket was given to me filled with their products.  I often get compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Moonlight Path is definitely a B&amp;B MVP.  The aroma is the best.  Buying it on Amazon is really too pricey.  The prime delivery is what you pay extra for (one way to look at it...).</li>
            <li> This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  The main feature I look for is a good lather.  This one lathers great.  It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  I&#x27;m not going to review the scent because that is such a matter of personal taste.  I like the quality of this shower gel and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff for my wife when I&#x27;m looking to get some brownie points. It smells mighty fine. It smells pretty close to its name. Clean &amp; fresh smell.  From what I&#x27;m told you can never go wrong with the Bath &amp; Body Works products.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loved it. Great product and the shipment was on time.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Living outside the city limits and the nearest place for me to get this stuff is an hour drive I am glad that I found it online. I have always like this fragrance. Soft subtle and floral.</li>
            <li> Love it, I have used it for years</li>
            <li> Smells just like what you would get in the store and I LOVE it.  Very happy with this purchase.  Would buy again.</li>
