            <li>I love this soft gentle perfume.</li>
            <li>very strong and lasts long too.</li>
            <li>Thanks BLV !</li>
            <li>be aware about where you purchase this product from even if its sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely One of my Favorites!  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this perfume during some travels in 1999, before it was released in the US in 2000.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that you can wear it daily, but it is something that can be worn out for a nice evening/event.</li>
            <li>it was a much better price than in the stores and it is just the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Classic!</li>
            <li>I first found out about this perfume from a Youtuber who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the item was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>so I normally only wear light body sprays.  </li>
            <li>Best Parfum ever, sooo sorry they have stopped making it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought nice perfume before because I never liked one enough to warrant a whole bottle, but this one was well worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a classic.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh scent that leaves a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>I lke the scent very much, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>The product I received was definitely the real thing!</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it and bought several bottles to last me for awhile.</li>
            <li>I like very few perfumes, but this one has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find this perfume any more.  </li>
            <li>Love this hard to find fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Hard to beat this lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>My husband is sensitive to perfumes</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Bvlgari fragrances for some time now, however,  Bvlgari Blv, by far is my favorite; not to mention, my other half has stated rather emphatically, that I will be wearing this particular scent &#x27;forever&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe because it is a clear, natural floral, airy musk,  creamy cool, light green ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts all day and you smell powder fresh all day and still light enough that you wont get tired of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I tend to go back to it even after all the new fragrances that come out.</li>
            <li>I found this several years ago and now cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance... so delicate!</li>

            <li> Best Parfum ever, sooo sorry they have stopped making it!</li>
            <li> Why did they discontinue this?! :( my favorite for years.....</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend, and she loved it and I loved the price. I could not find this fragrance on the shelf of any discount vendors and the price could not be beat.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good perfum, but is more sweet than i was thinking, is elegant, and original, if u like fragances sweet this is for you.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing my favorite perfume in a great price.  Your service was excellent and the product arrived quickly and safely.  Am enjoying the fact that my drawer is full of perfume!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Xmas present.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> I have loved Bulgari Blu since I first smelled it. It has a clean fresh scent that leaves a long lasting smell. I&#x27;ve never worn it without getting a compliment. It&#x27;s truly a classic.</li>
            <li> Bulgari Blu for women is not easy to find&lt;br /&gt;I tried at the Duty Free shops in the airport, during a travel, but everything was solo expensive.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best price ever</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume after my sister gave me the last of her bottle to try.  I had asked her what she was wearing, because she smelled so nice and fresh.  I absolutely love it!  My husband is sensitive to perfumes so I normally only wear light body sprays.  However, this perfume is ALL I wear now, it has a beautiful clean, fresh scent that I love.  I haven&#x27;t bought nice perfume before because I never liked one enough to warrant a whole bottle, but this one was well worth it!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this perfume during some travels in 1999, before it was released in the US in 2000. I instantly fell in love with it and bought several bottles to last me for awhile. Now, it&#x27;s easy to find the new variations of the fragrance (Notte, Blv II), but the original is still my favorite. It&#x27;s a great blend of &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; undertones. I&#x27;m a junkie for the original.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Bvlgari fragrances for some time now, however,  Bvlgari Blv, by far is my favorite; not to mention, my other half has stated rather emphatically, that I will be wearing this particular scent &#x27;forever&#x27; and I should stock up.</li>
            <li> I love this soft gentle perfume.</li>
            <li> great price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> I found this several years ago and now cannot live without it. I have yet to wear it and not get a compliment on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume since I first purchased it in 2003. It&#x27;s light enough that you can wear it daily, but it is something that can be worn out for a nice evening/event.</li>
            <li> Desde siempre este ha sido mi perfume preferido, es totalmente recomendado; en el envió no tuve ningún problema me llego en el tiempo esperado.</li>
            <li> it was okay nothing like blv notte eau de</li>
            <li> it was a much better price than in the stores and it is just the same. there are a lot of BLV fragrances, so it was hard to find the right one.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend and she really liked it.  Made a great Christmas gift. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have gifted this perfume to my loved ones after reading great reviews. It is a very sophisticated anytime fragrance that can go from day to night seamlessly. Long lasting, too</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume, and is authentic.</li>
            <li> I lke the scent very much, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  I spray it on and then it disappears such that my husband can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto original responsables se recomienda excelente muy buen producto original responsables se recomienda excelente muy buen producto original responsables se recomienda excelente</li>
