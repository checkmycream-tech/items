    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>I&#x27;m fairly hirsute, so nothing is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product, battery life is great..</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great for trimming beards but isn&#x27;t so great at shaving body hair.</li>
            <li>It is great for trimming beards, shaving the head, or shaving body hair.</li>
            <li>trimmer works great in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li>and it works great as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great looking and sleek.</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product, shaves close and waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this, great kit.</li>
            <li>ability to use this in the shower is a great plus.</li>
            <li>and I would have bought it happily...</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Work great and holds a charge.</li>
            <li>This tool is great as a groomer.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of maintaining a beard length and trimming the edges to make things stay looking neat.</li>
            <li>So it was great while it lasted, but died after just 22 months...</li>
            <li>Great item.  </li>
            <li>Great for the area I use it for</li>
            <li>This product has sturdy construction and a non-slip grip on the plastic almost feeling like rubber (which is great</li>
            <li>All in all, this trimmer is a great upgrade from the dinky foldout trimmers you&#x27;ll find on electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>think it has a sporty look and a good feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Works on this steel wool fair.</li>
            <li>Good for trimming and grooming.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>You could have offered good customer service and kept me as a customer too...</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>if I should believe that it was good quality or not</li>
            <li>in all I think ( as does hubby) that this is a good razor for the money.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer with a great price tag.  </li>
            <li>Rubberized surface texture for good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of this is good; all of it is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how quickly it charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, reasonably priced and would make an excellent gift</li>
            <li>Another great Remington product, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Hair on his body is not a problem, but being able to have a trim of his hair is great.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with everything.</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand and gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The head of this product is nicely shaped, and does a really good job of letting you get in and make nice, well-defined lines along your jaw and lip...</li>
            <li>The best feature, of course, is that it is cordless and works in the shower where your beard is softened by the hot water.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It is very strong, effective and has a good grip</li>
            <li>This trimmer certainly trims perfectly well, but it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as closely as I&#x27;d have hoped.</li>
            <li>Being wet/dry is nice since I can use soap to make it run smoother over my skin.</li>
            <li>the rechargeable, water proof aspect is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>This razor is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li>He says it cuts good and is so much better than he could have imagined a waterproof shaver being.</li>
            <li>Nice size and plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with some kind of stand for both the appliance and the attachments.</li>
            <li>the nice way that it is packaged.</li>
            <li>Nice unit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice beard and body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The &#x27;smooth&#x27; attachment, which both cuts the hair and shaves it smooth to the skin, for areas you wish to be hairless, works excellent.  </li>
            <li>but it is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>, handy works</li>
            <li>Battery time is excellent, and as an added bonus the trimmer really is water resistant.</li>
            <li>The included attachments are a nice bonus for those trying to maintain a beard.</li>
            <li>And the swappable heads are very easy to remove and switch.</li>
            <li>No fantsy bells or whistles, justca nice clean cut, good battery life and a sleek look.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco had it&#x27;s flaws, but the &amp;#34;dial to height&amp;#34; gizmo was awesome, and I miss it already.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement to my old shaver.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with these clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this unit so far</li>
            <li>It covers the spread of what you&#x27;d expect from this sort of product quite well and unlike most others, does most of what it sets out to do rather effectively.</li>
            <li>and I have used it 3 times for about 15 min per usage.&lt;br /&gt;It feels sturdy (unlike the norelco clippers which feel very light and cheap)&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>The body of the trimmer is very comfortable &amp;#34;in hand&amp;#34;, and the non slip surface would undoubtedly be a plus in the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily as a beard trimmer, and so far it does an excellent job, very quick and efficient with a nice even trim.</li>
            <li>but I wish they have done a better job with the accessories.</li>
            <li>I still recommend this for those who care more about delivery.</li>
            <li>I was always pleased and satisfied with it, but I must say this one is an improvement.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this in the shower.</li>
            <li>Still works okay on his beard, but not so well on his head.</li>
            <li>I love this I would have given 5 if it came with a stand or something to put all the parts in.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use one of the combs which leaves more stubble</li>
            <li>many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely have to charge as the charge lasts a good while.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>charging hookup could be better, as it interferes with the hanging hole.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry Remington, you could have offered a better-madeproduct for $10 more</li>
            <li>However, this Remington Product a Wettech Head, Beard, and Body Grooming Kit is all that and more.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased with</li>
            <li>I like being able to use it in the shower</li>
            <li>I am definitely pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>For the price this was I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>There are 4 combs: 3, 6, 9 and 12 mm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a philips/norelco handheld which is better.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than a $20 trimmer.</li>
            <li>He mostly uses the number four.</li>
            <li>trimming unit performs substantially better if the hair is already somewhat tamed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the shower and it works better</li>
            <li>I was able to get it on sale through amazon and decided to give it a shot -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a perfect tool for maintaining a beard or mustache, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to do a closer shave, consider an actual shaver.</li>
            <li>Amazing works perfectly high quality and feels good in the hand</li>
            <li>Pretty good razor.</li>
            <li>The charging cradle is great for use if you&#x27;re hanging it (much like barber would), but even if you&#x27;re not - it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used it to keep the hair on the back of my neck tidy and have been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave this might not be the best unit, but for touch up, longer facial hair, and body shaving</li>
            <li>Very good results, terrific price point.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for the kids too... not much tickling and no pulling.</li>
            <li>He also needed to trim carefully around the edges, this Remington is perfect.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It was able to remove the hair smoothly and without any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good rechargeable trimmer with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use and most importantly comfortable trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is great to use this with my beard wet or even in the shower, and just run it under the faucet to clean it -- very easy!</li>
            <li>No &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; burns, and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>the blade guild taps break easily.</li>
            <li>The trimmer portion works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>body groomer and trimmer head are easily exchanged by pressing on buttons on either side of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use which is always a plus</li>
            <li>For me the sole purpose of this razor is to trim my beard, and it works so beautifully.</li>
            <li>First of all, I won&#x27;t be reviewing the body shaver attachment for this product because I&#x27;m not into that kind of grooming.</li>
            <li>so far it has worked great as a trimmer, keeping things clean and in order.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, it charges quickly and works safely around water.  </li>
            <li>This groomer works fine and</li>
            <li>the attachments are great and solid.</li>
            <li>A great personal groomer!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t shave off stubble and make the skin completely smooth like a razor would, but it does trim hair.</li>
            <li>Battery life is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>There is no pinching or nicks, and the result is smooth and whisker free.  </li>
            <li>It does have a light that stays on all the time that lets you know it is charging though.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, has good battery life, and is ok for short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, that unit’s rechargeable battery finally gave out a year or so ago, so I was happy to be offered this product to review under the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Replaced a 4 year old Philips norelco trimmer that I loved but wasn&#x27;t holding charge anymore</li>
            <li>Works very well and has multiple clip on attachments which are excellent quality plastics.</li>
            <li>The groomer comes with a variety of trim edgers which fit nicely over the main clipper part.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be getting baby skin smooth trims out of this trimmer, so don&#x27;t expect to be doing a clean shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great as a trimmer, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s fairly small.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>This is my review from December, when I originally gave this five stars:&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and lightweight and perfect for taking along when he&#x27;s traveling.</li>
            <li>Take a shower before you groom &amp; it will stay clean forever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a breeze to clean, charge, and use.</li>
            <li>this was a present for my husband he loved it</li>
            <li>It is a nice weight and fits well into an adult hand.  </li>
            <li>You need a bit of force to get the combs back off, but that is probably a good thing so that they arent falling off during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s water proof (seems to go against common sense) but it works great!  </li>
            <li>It trims quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Not bad gets the job done</li>
            <li>Met every expectation....was easy to use even for a first time user.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up, very easy to clean, and it charges with a standard micro-usb port.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great; I&#x27;ve charged it once when I got it and haven&#x27;t charged it since - roughly 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>other great feature is the battery life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was very happy with this item, especially for the comparatively low price.</li>
            <li>Super get the job done</li>
            <li>While it works well for trimming his beard it isn&#x27;t as good for moustash trimming because it&#x27;s too wide to do a precise job.</li>
            <li>and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The Conair took two AA Batteries and lost power quickly.  </li>
            <li>attachment provide a good cut in and out of the shower but for the best results, I found using it dry works better as the hair are flattened down by the constant water flow.</li>
            <li>The important thing is to know exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li>then I ever expected, and nice easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>No one wants hair clogging the shower, but for trims and touch-ups it works fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, although it really is \\&quot;minimum acceptable\\&quot; customer service.</li>
            <li>the default shaver head works fine for body grooming, and works very well as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great little trimmer for the price</li>
            <li>This Remington razor  replaces my old Remington that I&#x27;ve had and used for many years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not cutting well.</li>
            <li>But the product is no longer useful.</li>
            <li>The battery in my Braun (at 4 years old) has finally stopped holding any kind of charge, although I did love its trimming ability.</li>
            <li>Someone who intends to make full use of the unit for shaving body hair, and/or wishing to do it in the shower, may well justify a higher rating.</li>
            <li>Someone who intends to make full use of the unit for shaving body hair, and/or wishing to do it in the shower, may well justify a higher rating.</li>
            <li>power button is on the top, but is a bit lower than where your thumb would naturally rest, maybe so that you dont press the button by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is that the trimmer makes noise, but is not unbearably loud like most trimmers.  </li>
            <li>It would have also been nice if they had included a cloth or fiber bag for the trimmer and the parts, but that was undoubtedly left out to keep costs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this grooming kit is well worth buying, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>the price, this is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful, well running</li>
            <li>A few drops of clipper oil on the trimmer blades from time  to time is a good idea to keep this clean and functioning well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By comparison, I had problems with a Braun Cruzer, and they shipped me a replacement right away, all they asked was for me to email them a copy of my receipt and my address.</li>
            <li>If you have body hair that has some length, but is not too long it can trim it nice and close.</li>
            <li>this for my husband who shaves his head and most of his beard (he has a goatee), and so far he is really liking this clipper.</li>
            <li>very compact but for body trimming the cordless and wet/dry features make this much better than my old run of the mill trimmer.</li>
            <li>There are more full-featured trimmers out there from Remington and other manufacturers that have more features, but for the price this does most of what he wants it to do and he uses it daily.</li>
            <li>The full size trimming head (for facial trimming) easily removes and the Body Hair Shaver attachment slides</li>
            <li>The heads are easily removable and quickly swap back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charger is very light and compact -- no bulky table top stand or heavy power brick -- and it runs on either 110 and 220 volts, so it&#x27;s ready to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the shaver works pretty well but not as wall as the trimmer</li>
            <li>This body grooming kit does exactly that.</li>
            <li>A smaller shaving head gives you more control, but takes longer to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>but I need to pay more attention when shopping because I didn&#x27;t notice its water technology which seems to give a different feel when trimming.</li>
            <li>I love Remington&#x27;s simple design.</li>
            <li>I have tried several grooming products in the past, and this is the best I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I guess you&#x27;ve got more lackluster products to make with lackluster customer service to back them</li>
            <li>instructions indicate the trimmer should be charged for four hours before the first use.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it every day since I first charged it</li>
            <li>trimmer head without a comb is really useful for precision trimming like keeping sideburns straight.  </li>
            <li>he said to give it as many stars as possible</li>
            <li>You can never have 2 many shavers especially if you use them often.</li>
            <li>both agree that this is a light groomer that fits our hands nicely and doesn’t vibrate excessively, as some barber-like trimmers do.</li>
            <li>I guess if you have multiple people in your house that would use it, you may need to recharge, but for 1 person, 60 minutes is more than ample&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what you want in an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li>I used it about 2 times a week to keep my beard the exact length I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This one makes me glad I went back to Remington, great little trimmer so far!</li>
            <li>Compared to the Gillette Body Razor, this electric razor feels less smooth, but can handle much more hair at a given time.  </li>
            <li>use the beard trimmer to clean up my sideburns, and I get some help keeping the back of my hairline even and my neck clean.</li>
            <li>Thrilled is not the only word as his liking, but the added bonus of being able to shave the other hair in comfort is the wonder of it all.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service and their product failure didn&#x27;t cost me shipping expenses and hassles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I gave it only 3 stars because it&#x27;s kind of flimsy, and the blades are stamped rather than ground (i.e., like a cheap knife) -- and this means that it pulls and tugs when I shave, instead of a quick sharp</li>
            <li>Completely water proof and will run for a few weeks with great variation in attachments.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to replace your razor but it will easy trim things down to a fine stubble.</li>
            <li>a positive is</li>
            <li>The fact that its waterproof is pretty much the selling point.</li>
            <li>, I really like the rubberized grip on the trimmer and find that the firmer grip this provides makes it easer  for me to get exactly the trim I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blade has stayed just as sharp as new so far but even if it needs to be replaced in 6 months to a year, I still think it&#x27;s a great deal for how much it&#x27;s going to be used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, this is an excellent product, especially when compared to other trimmers in the same price range.</li>
            <li>Dry hairs cut better.</li>
            <li>This groomer is solidly made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It cuts really well, is pretty quiet, and the way the head is positioned makes it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It feels like nothing is happening while you&#x27;re trimming which is fine but different.</li>
            <li>Granted, you can get a more consistent trim with the 5 snap-on combs, but I like the flexibility of the other style.</li>
            <li>It works fine, especially when you shower.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little shaver.</li>
            <li>It comes with a few great attachments for trimming hair to different lengths.</li>
            <li>Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well</li>
            <li>It still works but is showing signs of wearing out after much use.</li>
            <li>This could be much improved with a tote bag or tray to contain the parts and pieces, or create a self storing type of thingie.</li>
            <li>And is much easier when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Works well and very convenient.</li>
            <li>It trims very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like to shave my face or head with a razor, much rather use a trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Remington cuts much closer than the norelco did.</li>
            <li>The blades do seem to get warmer much faster than I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li>He would not have thought to by a product like this for himself but now that he has it, he has found it to be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>She has volunteered to trim the back of his head so that his hair will always be neat and fit.  </li>
            <li>A very close shave everywhere.</li>
            <li>Haha).  </li>
            <li>This is really nice when trimming sideburns or hair around your ears so that you dont worry as much about such a loud noise source so near your ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also used it on him to trim his neck between haircuts and it was very efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, this thing does everything and is 100% waterproof!</li>
            <li>It came with a &amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34; attachment, but I don&#x27;t really understand why.  </li>
            <li>dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a lot of power and a solid but comfortable weight to it.</li>
            <li>really liked the product for its different blade option and their effectiveness earlier.</li>
            <li>and this is definitely my go to trimmer for keeping my facial hair tidy.  </li>
            <li>Works good but have to go slow</li>
            <li>While it is clipped into the charger, it is still easy to use (as long as your not in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It vibrates more than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used – Not a problem for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to charge efficiently and so far we just return it to the charger after use and haven&#x27;t had it run down at all during use.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that would of been nice</li>
            <li>Using the accessories is not very friendly and adjusting the level by having to change the accessories each time can be challenging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***UPDATE: After less than 2 years of very light use, the battery died and would not re-charge.</li>
            <li>, I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because its utility for my intended purpose, is not equal to the full capabilities of the unit.</li>
            <li>, I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because its utility for my intended purpose, is not equal to the full capabilities of the unit.</li>
            <li>A bit smaller in size than a normal trimmer (as seen at your nearest barber shop), but that doesn&#x27;t really hold you back and, in fact, helps you negotiate nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li>Certainly it makes you presentable, but you might follow with Old Dependable, your razor, for special occasions when you want as close a shave as possible.</li>
            <li>Much better than my previous norelco</li>
            <li>He particularly likes the way the attachments clip on and off.</li>
            <li>The main reason I went for this one is the Lithium ion battery, which holds a charge longer.</li>
            <li>Used it everywhere with the multiple attachments and use light soap or cream when shaving face or sensitive areas ..</li>
            <li>The different heads were nothing to write home about, but were adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>The heads can be a little tricky to snap on at first, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to switch between the two main heads -- one for trimming your beard, and the other for closer shaves.  </li>
            <li>The body shaver attachment is handy for shaving areas above the beard and on his neck or for any other stray hairs.</li>
            <li>I had expected much of this unit at first because many that I have looked at in stores seemed to be inferior in quality (flimsy plastic, short battery life), but this unit surprised me.</li>
            <li>The grooming attachment is effective both wet and dry, and being able to simply rinse and go is a big plus.</li>
            <li>So far, none really...</li>
            <li>This razor works OK, but not great, for basic \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; - the pros are that it is light, the battery lasts pretty well, and it does a serviceable job on shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>I have used it to trim my beard in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have a mirror there, so normally use it at the sink.</li>
            <li>wish it had a removable/adjustable head instead of the multiple attachments, but it works so well, that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>There are 5 different snap-on attachments for different lengths which are easy to use.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and remains charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Also, because being in the shower doesn&#x27;t hurt it any, it&#x27;s easy to lay down anywhere without worry about getting it too damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, the razor&#x27;s sturdy and comfortable design makes it a winner.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to trim down spots on my face I can&#x27;t comfortably reach with a razor.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seems to take forever for the shavers to charge up; sometimes the battery life is so short that I&#x27;m lucky to get two trims out of them; and at other times the power drains so quickly between usage that I have to postpone a trim until I can recharge the battery.  </li>
            <li>He is seriously into grooming aids of all kinds, but had never owned one of these, and so this was a new kind of product category for him.  </li>
            <li>It works particularly well on flatter surfaces, like my upper back, but I needed more touch-up with the Gillette Body Razor on curvier surfaces, like my shoulders and upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, this little clipper is super strong, fast, and sharp.</li>
            <li>I am only using the trimmer head, although I did try the combo body trimmer/shaver attachment which is really designed more for the specific function of removing long chest, arm, or leg hair.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s not crazy about the color, but even with those minor gripes he said he&#x27;d give this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the buzzer it was fine until it just stoped working after less then 2 months..</li>
            <li>unit is pretty lightweight, but feels substantial at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found many of these sorts of products that fail to either effectively trim beards or body, focusing instead on other areas of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hubby said it is very easy to hold onto and not too heavy or awkwardly shaped to be good at angles and turns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only place I had any trouble was beard hair, everywhere else I tried it cut quick and easy, only my very course beard hair required multiple passes to get trimmed</li>
            <li>The cutter is a little cheap and stamp-cut, but it works and what do you expect for thirty bucks?&lt;br</li>
            <li>The multiple attachments make it very versatile.</li>
            <li>So if you really don&#x27;t need water technology, check out a different Remington product.</li>
            <li>I have only used it on the beard since I really don&#x27;t shave on the body.</li>
            <li>6/20/17 This trimmer unexpectedly died.</li>
            <li>Don&amp;#34;t use the body head for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The Remington PG6250 was a unit I was purchasing to replace an old norelco razor I had used for almost 15 years.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent, long-lasting battery power, does not slow down and run weak after a while like every other rechargeable I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this trimmer can be used in the shower, I don&#x27;t see much benefit, since the first thing that comes to mind is all of that hair going down the drain, to clog it up.</li>
            <li>And when the charger is snapped onto the back of the trimmer, it obstructs the hanging loop at the back of the trimmer, so you will not be able to hang it on a peg when charging (must lay loosely on a surface).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the trimming action, it is certainly adequate enough in blade speed and power to trim facial hair, using the various depth attachments.</li>
            <li>The trimmer comes with several attachments that are recommended for various functions, but I&#x27;ve stuck pretty closely to the default set-up</li>
            <li>With the right length attachment, you can trim your eyebrows back, too, especially if they&#x27;re starting to look like Mark Twain&#x27;s or Albert Einstein&#x27;s, flying every which way but southeast.</li>
            <li>He said he thought it was a very slick design and worked really well, charged quickly,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seeing that Remington wants me to ship the product back with a receipt, I think I&#x27;ll go one step further and include the 60-day money-back form and request a refund...</li>
            <li>The blade easily cuts through my thick stubble and my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One major disadvantage(for</li>
            <li>because my wife likes me the way I am, I did try the shaver head on my morning shave of bare skin and found it lacking for that purpose.</li>

            <li>So you might find yourself resorting to your normal shaver, after removing the long hair with the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you might find yourself resorting to your normal shaver, after removing the long hair with the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, duds happen, but after 35 days using it 3 times a week and the switch is already broken?</li>
            <li>It charges up in about 3.5 hours and stores a much longer charge than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does an excellent job cutting through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>so I will relate his experience with using it.&lt;br /&gt;Developed to be used in the shower it apparently works not only well in the shower, but out of it also.</li>
            <li>(unfortunately, the Cruzer 6 Face doesn&#x27;t really cut clean lines with the trimmer, and the beard height settings are all rather short for my tastes, so I gave up on it and tried this)&lt;br</li>

            <li> All in all, this trimmer is a great upgrade from the dinky foldout trimmers you&#x27;ll find on electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> think it has a sporty look and a good feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Works on this steel wool fair.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming and grooming.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> You could have offered good customer service and kept me as a customer too...</li>
            <li> Works good</li>
            <li> if I should believe that it was good quality or not</li>
            <li> in all I think ( as does hubby) that this is a good razor for the money.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer with a great price tag.  </li>
            <li> Rubberized surface texture for good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of this is good; all of it is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how quickly it charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonably priced and would make an excellent gift</li>

            <li> Hair on his body is not a problem, but being able to have a trim of his hair is great.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand and gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The head of this product is nicely shaped, and does a really good job of letting you get in and make nice, well-defined lines along your jaw and lip...</li>
            <li> The best feature, of course, is that it is cordless and works in the shower where your beard is softened by the hot water.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> It is very strong, effective and has a good grip</li>
            <li> This trimmer certainly trims perfectly well, but it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as closely as I&#x27;d have hoped.</li>
            <li> Being wet/dry is nice since I can use soap to make it run smoother over my skin.</li>
            <li> the rechargeable, water proof aspect is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This razor is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> He says it cuts good and is so much better than he could have imagined a waterproof shaver being.</li>
            <li> Nice size and plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with some kind of stand for both the appliance and the attachments.</li>
            <li> the nice way that it is packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice unit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard and body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The &#x27;smooth&#x27; attachment, which both cuts the hair and shaves it smooth to the skin, for areas you wish to be hairless, works excellent.  </li>
            <li> but it is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> , handy works</li>
            <li> Battery time is excellent, and as an added bonus the trimmer really is water resistant.</li>
            <li> The included attachments are a nice bonus for those trying to maintain a beard.</li>
            <li> And the swappable heads are very easy to remove and switch.</li>
            <li> No fantsy bells or whistles, justca nice clean cut, good battery life and a sleek look.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco had it&#x27;s flaws, but the &amp;#34;dial to height&amp;#34; gizmo was awesome, and I miss it already.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement to my old shaver.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this unit so far</li>
            <li> It covers the spread of what you&#x27;d expect from this sort of product quite well and unlike most others, does most of what it sets out to do rather effectively.</li>
            <li> and I have used it 3 times for about 15 min per usage.&lt;br /&gt;It feels sturdy (unlike the norelco clippers which feel very light and cheap)&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is very comfortable &amp;#34;in hand&amp;#34;, and the non slip surface would undoubtedly be a plus in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily as a beard trimmer, and so far it does an excellent job, very quick and efficient with a nice even trim.</li>
            <li> but I wish they have done a better job with the accessories.</li>
            <li> I still recommend this for those who care more about delivery.</li>
            <li> I was always pleased and satisfied with it, but I must say this one is an improvement.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this in the shower.</li>
            <li> Still works okay on his beard, but not so well on his head.</li>
            <li> I love this I would have given 5 if it came with a stand or something to put all the parts in.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use one of the combs which leaves more stubble</li>
            <li> many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely have to charge as the charge lasts a good while.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> charging hookup could be better, as it interferes with the hanging hole.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry Remington, you could have offered a better-madeproduct for $10 more</li>
            <li> However, this Remington Product a Wettech Head, Beard, and Body Grooming Kit is all that and more.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleased with</li>
            <li> I like being able to use it in the shower</li>
            <li> I am definitely pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> For the price this was I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> There are 4 combs: 3, 6, 9 and 12 mm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a philips/norelco handheld which is better.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than a $20 trimmer.</li>
            <li> He mostly uses the number four.</li>
            <li> trimming unit performs substantially better if the hair is already somewhat tamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the shower and it works better</li>
            <li> I was able to get it on sale through amazon and decided to give it a shot -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a perfect tool for maintaining a beard or mustache, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to do a closer shave, consider an actual shaver.</li>
            <li> Amazing works perfectly high quality and feels good in the hand</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor.</li>
            <li> The charging cradle is great for use if you&#x27;re hanging it (much like barber would), but even if you&#x27;re not - it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have used it to keep the hair on the back of my neck tidy and have been happy with it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave this might not be the best unit, but for touch up, longer facial hair, and body shaving</li>
            <li> Very good results, terrific price point.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for the kids too... not much tickling and no pulling.</li>
            <li> He also needed to trim carefully around the edges, this Remington is perfect.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was able to remove the hair smoothly and without any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good rechargeable trimmer with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and most importantly comfortable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is great to use this with my beard wet or even in the shower, and just run it under the faucet to clean it -- very easy!</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; burns, and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> the blade guild taps break easily.</li>
            <li> The trimmer portion works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> body groomer and trimmer head are easily exchanged by pressing on buttons on either side of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use which is always a plus</li>
            <li> For me the sole purpose of this razor is to trim my beard, and it works so beautifully.</li>
            <li> First of all, I won&#x27;t be reviewing the body shaver attachment for this product because I&#x27;m not into that kind of grooming.</li>
            <li> so far it has worked great as a trimmer, keeping things clean and in order.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, it charges quickly and works safely around water.  </li>
            <li> This groomer works fine and</li>
            <li> the attachments are great and solid.</li>
            <li> A great personal groomer!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t shave off stubble and make the skin completely smooth like a razor would, but it does trim hair.</li>
            <li> Battery life is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> There is no pinching or nicks, and the result is smooth and whisker free.  </li>
            <li> It does have a light that stays on all the time that lets you know it is charging though.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, has good battery life, and is ok for short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, that unit’s rechargeable battery finally gave out a year or so ago, so I was happy to be offered this product to review under the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> Light</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Replaced a 4 year old Philips norelco trimmer that I loved but wasn&#x27;t holding charge anymore</li>
            <li> Works very well and has multiple clip on attachments which are excellent quality plastics.</li>
            <li> The groomer comes with a variety of trim edgers which fit nicely over the main clipper part.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be getting baby skin smooth trims out of this trimmer, so don&#x27;t expect to be doing a clean shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great as a trimmer, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s fairly small.</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> This is my review from December, when I originally gave this five stars:&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and lightweight and perfect for taking along when he&#x27;s traveling.</li>
            <li> Take a shower before you groom &amp; it will stay clean forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a breeze to clean, charge, and use.</li>
            <li> this was a present for my husband he loved it</li>
            <li> It is a nice weight and fits well into an adult hand.  </li>
            <li> You need a bit of force to get the combs back off, but that is probably a good thing so that they arent falling off during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s water proof (seems to go against common sense) but it works great!  </li>
            <li> It trims quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Not bad gets the job done</li>
            <li> Met every expectation....was easy to use even for a first time user.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, very easy to clean, and it charges with a standard micro-usb port.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great; I&#x27;ve charged it once when I got it and haven&#x27;t charged it since - roughly 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> other great feature is the battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was very happy with this item, especially for the comparatively low price.</li>
            <li> Super get the job done</li>
            <li> While it works well for trimming his beard it isn&#x27;t as good for moustash trimming because it&#x27;s too wide to do a precise job.</li>
            <li> and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The Conair took two AA Batteries and lost power quickly.  </li>
            <li> attachment provide a good cut in and out of the shower but for the best results, I found using it dry works better as the hair are flattened down by the constant water flow.</li>
            <li> The important thing is to know exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li> then I ever expected, and nice easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> No one wants hair clogging the shower, but for trims and touch-ups it works fine.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, although it really is \\&quot;minimum acceptable\\&quot; customer service.</li>
            <li> the default shaver head works fine for body grooming, and works very well as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price</li>
            <li> This Remington razor  replaces my old Remington that I&#x27;ve had and used for many years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cutting well.</li>
            <li> But the product is no longer useful.</li>
            <li> The battery in my Braun (at 4 years old) has finally stopped holding any kind of charge, although I did love its trimming ability.</li>
            <li> Someone who intends to make full use of the unit for shaving body hair, and/or wishing to do it in the shower, may well justify a higher rating.</li>
            <li> Someone who intends to make full use of the unit for shaving body hair, and/or wishing to do it in the shower, may well justify a higher rating.</li>
            <li> power button is on the top, but is a bit lower than where your thumb would naturally rest, maybe so that you dont press the button by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that the trimmer makes noise, but is not unbearably loud like most trimmers.  </li>
            <li> It would have also been nice if they had included a cloth or fiber bag for the trimmer and the parts, but that was undoubtedly left out to keep costs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this grooming kit is well worth buying, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> the price, this is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful, well running</li>
            <li> A few drops of clipper oil on the trimmer blades from time  to time is a good idea to keep this clean and functioning well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By comparison, I had problems with a Braun Cruzer, and they shipped me a replacement right away, all they asked was for me to email them a copy of my receipt and my address.</li>
            <li> If you have body hair that has some length, but is not too long it can trim it nice and close.</li>
            <li> this for my husband who shaves his head and most of his beard (he has a goatee), and so far he is really liking this clipper.</li>
            <li> very compact but for body trimming the cordless and wet/dry features make this much better than my old run of the mill trimmer.</li>
            <li> There are more full-featured trimmers out there from Remington and other manufacturers that have more features, but for the price this does most of what he wants it to do and he uses it daily.</li>
            <li> The full size trimming head (for facial trimming) easily removes and the Body Hair Shaver attachment slides</li>
            <li> The heads are easily removable and quickly swap back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger is very light and compact -- no bulky table top stand or heavy power brick -- and it runs on either 110 and 220 volts, so it&#x27;s ready to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shaver works pretty well but not as wall as the trimmer</li>
            <li> This body grooming kit does exactly that.</li>
            <li> A smaller shaving head gives you more control, but takes longer to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> but I need to pay more attention when shopping because I didn&#x27;t notice its water technology which seems to give a different feel when trimming.</li>
            <li> I love Remington&#x27;s simple design.</li>
            <li> I have tried several grooming products in the past, and this is the best I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I guess you&#x27;ve got more lackluster products to make with lackluster customer service to back them</li>
            <li> instructions indicate the trimmer should be charged for four hours before the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every day since I first charged it</li>
            <li> trimmer head without a comb is really useful for precision trimming like keeping sideburns straight.  </li>
            <li> he said to give it as many stars as possible</li>
            <li> You can never have 2 many shavers especially if you use them often.</li>
            <li> both agree that this is a light groomer that fits our hands nicely and doesn’t vibrate excessively, as some barber-like trimmers do.</li>
            <li> I guess if you have multiple people in your house that would use it, you may need to recharge, but for 1 person, 60 minutes is more than ample&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what you want in an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used it about 2 times a week to keep my beard the exact length I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one makes me glad I went back to Remington, great little trimmer so far!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Gillette Body Razor, this electric razor feels less smooth, but can handle much more hair at a given time.  </li>
            <li> use the beard trimmer to clean up my sideburns, and I get some help keeping the back of my hairline even and my neck clean.</li>
            <li> Thrilled is not the only word as his liking, but the added bonus of being able to shave the other hair in comfort is the wonder of it all.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service and their product failure didn&#x27;t cost me shipping expenses and hassles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I gave it only 3 stars because it&#x27;s kind of flimsy, and the blades are stamped rather than ground (i.e., like a cheap knife) -- and this means that it pulls and tugs when I shave, instead of a quick sharp</li>
            <li> Completely water proof and will run for a few weeks with great variation in attachments.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to replace your razor but it will easy trim things down to a fine stubble.</li>
            <li> a positive is</li>
            <li> The fact that its waterproof is pretty much the selling point.</li>
            <li> , I really like the rubberized grip on the trimmer and find that the firmer grip this provides makes it easer  for me to get exactly the trim I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade has stayed just as sharp as new so far but even if it needs to be replaced in 6 months to a year, I still think it&#x27;s a great deal for how much it&#x27;s going to be used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, this is an excellent product, especially when compared to other trimmers in the same price range.</li>
            <li> Dry hairs cut better.</li>
            <li> This groomer is solidly made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It cuts really well, is pretty quiet, and the way the head is positioned makes it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It feels like nothing is happening while you&#x27;re trimming which is fine but different.</li>
            <li> Granted, you can get a more consistent trim with the 5 snap-on combs, but I like the flexibility of the other style.</li>
            <li> It works fine, especially when you shower.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaver.</li>
            <li> It comes with a few great attachments for trimming hair to different lengths.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well</li>
            <li> It still works but is showing signs of wearing out after much use.</li>
            <li> This could be much improved with a tote bag or tray to contain the parts and pieces, or create a self storing type of thingie.</li>
            <li> And is much easier when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Works well and very convenient.</li>
            <li> It trims very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to shave my face or head with a razor, much rather use a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Remington cuts much closer than the norelco did.</li>
            <li> The blades do seem to get warmer much faster than I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> He would not have thought to by a product like this for himself but now that he has it, he has found it to be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> She has volunteered to trim the back of his head so that his hair will always be neat and fit.  </li>
            <li> A very close shave everywhere.</li>
            <li> Haha).  </li>
            <li> This is really nice when trimming sideburns or hair around your ears so that you dont worry as much about such a loud noise source so near your ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also used it on him to trim his neck between haircuts and it was very efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, this thing does everything and is 100% waterproof!</li>
            <li> It came with a &amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34; attachment, but I don&#x27;t really understand why.  </li>
            <li> dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a lot of power and a solid but comfortable weight to it.</li>
            <li> really liked the product for its different blade option and their effectiveness earlier.</li>
            <li> and this is definitely my go to trimmer for keeping my facial hair tidy.  </li>
            <li> Works good but have to go slow</li>
            <li> While it is clipped into the charger, it is still easy to use (as long as your not in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It vibrates more than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used – Not a problem for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to charge efficiently and so far we just return it to the charger after use and haven&#x27;t had it run down at all during use.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that would of been nice</li>
            <li> Using the accessories is not very friendly and adjusting the level by having to change the accessories each time can be challenging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***UPDATE: After less than 2 years of very light use, the battery died and would not re-charge.</li>
            <li> , I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because its utility for my intended purpose, is not equal to the full capabilities of the unit.</li>
            <li> , I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because its utility for my intended purpose, is not equal to the full capabilities of the unit.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller in size than a normal trimmer (as seen at your nearest barber shop), but that doesn&#x27;t really hold you back and, in fact, helps you negotiate nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li> Certainly it makes you presentable, but you might follow with Old Dependable, your razor, for special occasions when you want as close a shave as possible.</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous norelco</li>
            <li> He particularly likes the way the attachments clip on and off.</li>
            <li> The main reason I went for this one is the Lithium ion battery, which holds a charge longer.</li>
            <li> Used it everywhere with the multiple attachments and use light soap or cream when shaving face or sensitive areas ..</li>
            <li> The different heads were nothing to write home about, but were adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> The heads can be a little tricky to snap on at first, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to switch between the two main heads -- one for trimming your beard, and the other for closer shaves.  </li>
            <li> The body shaver attachment is handy for shaving areas above the beard and on his neck or for any other stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I had expected much of this unit at first because many that I have looked at in stores seemed to be inferior in quality (flimsy plastic, short battery life), but this unit surprised me.</li>
            <li> The grooming attachment is effective both wet and dry, and being able to simply rinse and go is a big plus.</li>
            <li> So far, none really...</li>
            <li> This razor works OK, but not great, for basic \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; - the pros are that it is light, the battery lasts pretty well, and it does a serviceable job on shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used it to trim my beard in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have a mirror there, so normally use it at the sink.</li>
            <li> wish it had a removable/adjustable head instead of the multiple attachments, but it works so well, that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> There are 5 different snap-on attachments for different lengths which are easy to use.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and remains charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, because being in the shower doesn&#x27;t hurt it any, it&#x27;s easy to lay down anywhere without worry about getting it too damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, the razor&#x27;s sturdy and comfortable design makes it a winner.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to trim down spots on my face I can&#x27;t comfortably reach with a razor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it seems to take forever for the shavers to charge up; sometimes the battery life is so short that I&#x27;m lucky to get two trims out of them; and at other times the power drains so quickly between usage that I have to postpone a trim until I can recharge the battery.  </li>
            <li> He is seriously into grooming aids of all kinds, but had never owned one of these, and so this was a new kind of product category for him.  </li>
            <li> It works particularly well on flatter surfaces, like my upper back, but I needed more touch-up with the Gillette Body Razor on curvier surfaces, like my shoulders and upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, this little clipper is super strong, fast, and sharp.</li>
            <li> I am only using the trimmer head, although I did try the combo body trimmer/shaver attachment which is really designed more for the specific function of removing long chest, arm, or leg hair.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s not crazy about the color, but even with those minor gripes he said he&#x27;d give this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the buzzer it was fine until it just stoped working after less then 2 months..</li>
            <li> unit is pretty lightweight, but feels substantial at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found many of these sorts of products that fail to either effectively trim beards or body, focusing instead on other areas of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hubby said it is very easy to hold onto and not too heavy or awkwardly shaped to be good at angles and turns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only place I had any trouble was beard hair, everywhere else I tried it cut quick and easy, only my very course beard hair required multiple passes to get trimmed</li>
            <li> The cutter is a little cheap and stamp-cut, but it works and what do you expect for thirty bucks?&lt;br</li>
            <li> The multiple attachments make it very versatile.</li>
            <li> So if you really don&#x27;t need water technology, check out a different Remington product.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on the beard since I really don&#x27;t shave on the body.</li>
            <li> 6/20/17 This trimmer unexpectedly died.</li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t use the body head for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The Remington PG6250 was a unit I was purchasing to replace an old norelco razor I had used for almost 15 years.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent, long-lasting battery power, does not slow down and run weak after a while like every other rechargeable I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this trimmer can be used in the shower, I don&#x27;t see much benefit, since the first thing that comes to mind is all of that hair going down the drain, to clog it up.</li>
            <li> And when the charger is snapped onto the back of the trimmer, it obstructs the hanging loop at the back of the trimmer, so you will not be able to hang it on a peg when charging (must lay loosely on a surface).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the trimming action, it is certainly adequate enough in blade speed and power to trim facial hair, using the various depth attachments.</li>
            <li> The trimmer comes with several attachments that are recommended for various functions, but I&#x27;ve stuck pretty closely to the default set-up</li>
            <li> With the right length attachment, you can trim your eyebrows back, too, especially if they&#x27;re starting to look like Mark Twain&#x27;s or Albert Einstein&#x27;s, flying every which way but southeast.</li>
            <li> He said he thought it was a very slick design and worked really well, charged quickly,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seeing that Remington wants me to ship the product back with a receipt, I think I&#x27;ll go one step further and include the 60-day money-back form and request a refund...</li>
            <li> The blade easily cuts through my thick stubble and my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One major disadvantage(for</li>
            <li> because my wife likes me the way I am, I did try the shaver head on my morning shave of bare skin and found it lacking for that purpose.</li>

            <li> So you might find yourself resorting to your normal shaver, after removing the long hair with the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Ok, duds happen, but after 35 days using it 3 times a week and the switch is already broken?</li>
            <li> It charges up in about 3.5 hours and stores a much longer charge than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does an excellent job cutting through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> so I will relate his experience with using it.&lt;br /&gt;Developed to be used in the shower it apparently works not only well in the shower, but out of it also.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately, the Cruzer 6 Face doesn&#x27;t really cut clean lines with the trimmer, and the beard height settings are all rather short for my tastes, so I gave up on it and tried this)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really has a long life and doesn&#x27;t give out in the middle of the job like my previous trimmer did.</li>
            <li> The foldout trimmer on my old electric razor was a pain in the butt to use because of its small size and odd placement on the unit, but that trimmer could trim right up against the skin if I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer who did use it in the shower, commented that, since your hair lays flat against the body when water is flowing, it is a bit more difficult to lift the hair off, to cut.</li>
            <li> First of all the head is rather small, and provides minimal surface contact, versus a traditional foil or rotary shaver, and second, which I did not care much for, the cutting heads, flanking the shaver portion, did not glide as smoothly across the face as the foil, although the angle at which the unit is held, in relation to your face, would make a difference.</li>

            <li> I have been using this daily and waiting to write my review until I see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It simply snaps onto the tail end of the trimmer, so it will simply lay loosely on whatever surface you have at hand.</li>
            <li> if cutting hair off short but if trimming, like my flat top, would like it sharper.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say on that one, still a little scared to go near my nads with that.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time before reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> The cord itself is about 6.5 feet long.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> you need to be extremely careful and keep the machine exactly parallel to the skin.</li>
            <li> held the charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how long the attachments will flex and hold to the clipper,</li>
            <li> Remington trimmer is about 6 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  </li>
            <li> and/or goatee every few years, and had an old Remington beard trimmer to keep things neat.</li>
            <li> It charges within 1-2 hours and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I have used at least half-a-dozen beard trimmers and I always end up with pretty much the same complaint: limited battery life.  </li>
            <li> I use  it on my beard and whereas other trimmers sometimes cause nicks/scratches, this one (especially when using the body shaver when you have stubble)</li>
            <li> well keeps a very long charge.  </li>
            <li> The change time is Very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not marketed as a trimmer/clipper, but still got way too many painful pulls even on pre-trimmed areas, as well as stubble that it didn&#x27;t seem to cut even after multiple passes.     </li>
            <li> It did not live up to the hype</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Comes with limited shorter length attachments</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as evenly as i hoped, but it&#x27;s not a high end finishing razor either.</li>
            <li> Some items do not live up to their hype!  </li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is hard plastic, but 3/4 of the body has been covered by a soft rubber so that you can keep a grip on the trimmer while using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Only thing it was missing was a little brush to sweep the hairs out between the blades, but I still had the one the cane with the norelco, so want a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> The four combs that come with the trimmer dont offer a wide range of trimming lengths, but they have been working well otherwise.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works exactly as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> The hair gets pushed closer to the skin by the water, making it harder for the unit to get under the hair</li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> considering I use this to shave my beard in the shower and the unit does get wet).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not really inspired to give them a second shot and risk having to spend a few bucks in shipping every month or two to get my razor replaced until the warranty</li>
            <li> Using it on hard bone such as the clavicle was hard and left redness because of the constant rubbing of the tool going over the bone</li>
            <li> Just be careful about your sack!</li>
            <li> and the blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp, of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After charging the first time, the unit failed to recharge.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> #34;too loud&amp;#34; as some of the other reviewers say.  </li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few months now and im amazed at how long the charge lasts.</li>
            <li> other places.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars due to the separate guide combs.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re really tired of clippers not lasting and were hoping this one would be different, but</li>
            <li> This means you have 5 separate pieces with no container to put them in - A definite negative as small attachments such as these are often misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> guess it is time to try a different Braun model (Cruzer 6 beard and head), at least it offers long enough cutting lengths and a company that backs their products up...</li>
            <li> me at least and when comparing to other brands,especially Philips&#x27;s beard and vacuum trimmers) is that you have to replace the foil shaver and the trimming head between 6 months and a year(depending on usage).</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cause the typical irritation I experience with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I would be hesitant to use it in the shower, but I have gotten it wet a few times without problems.</li>
            <li> is if the charger had shut down or had an indicator to let you know the level of charge or that it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and the blades are sharp, hasn&#x27;t bogged down one time on me.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair or cause any discomfort while trimming.</li>
            <li> If its slightly tilted the edges will cut you</li>
            <li> It says three and a half hours</li>
            <li> The charge takes less than 4 hours and will keep the charge for over two weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a self-lubricating attachment, so you won&#x27;t have to mess around with oiling the grooming attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it so little</li>
            <li> Neat little trimmer.</li>
            <li> It has a tough time with longer, thicker beard hair though, which is the only downside.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been muddling through with a few others.</li>
            <li> had this about three months, and it&#x27;s already giving my husband trouble.</li>
            <li> And the depth attachments snap firmly onto the head so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off in use or storage.</li>
            <li> However, the razor did a poor job on areas of thicker hair or extensive stubble.</li>
            <li> Given that it failed early and the company isn&#x27;t going out of their way to correct the problem</li>
            <li> -- I trim my beard every few days and it has held it&#x27;s charge for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The dual cutter heads are designed to allow you to either push or pull the cutting action along your body (cutting on opposite sides and in opposite directions of the shaver foil in the center).</li>
            <li> And, of course, I knew this when I picked the unit for a goatee &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; trimmer, for which I would give it 4-5 stars.r push or pull the cutting action along your body (cutting on opposite sides and in opposite directions of the shaver foil in the center).</li>
            <li> The downside to the hard plastic is that small pieces of hair tend to stick to the plastic when you use the trimmer dry.  </li>
            <li> And, at least up to this point, the charge does not seem to trickle down to nothing between trims.  </li>
            <li> charging unit doesn&#x27;t plug into the shaver, rather it uses two small metal contacts to charge up the battery.</li>
            <li> It was not in any way uncomfortable, necessarily.</li>
            <li> It was not in any way uncomfortable, necessarily.</li>
            <li> The head is small which has pros and cons.</li>
            <li> it seems like.. :/</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I have used this now for the past 11 months</li>
            <li> The charging stand is small and folds up when not in use.</li>
            <li> attachment change is a bit clumsy and relies on plastic spring tension to stay clipped.</li>
            <li> Cuts through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> i have thick hair and get razor bumps if shaved improperly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is waterproof and can be used in the shower, with the warning that the charger is NOT waterproof so it can&#x27;t be used in the shower while plugged in (duh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all with this unit.  </li>
            <li> problem is that after 35 days, the switch has broken..</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco beard trimmer before and it always felt very weak, and would grab my thicker stubble.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting myself a number of times.</li>
            <li> no... :(</li>
            <li> (Remington counts this as a comb in the product description which is why the description indicates there are five combs)&lt;br /&gt;- changing base and cable&lt;</li>
            <li> Now its very irritating!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, battery life is great..</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well overall.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge well. I have not charged it yet and I have used it 3 times for about 15 min per usage.&lt;br /&gt;It feels sturdy (unlike the norelco clippers which feel very light and cheap)&lt;br /&gt;Does not scratch. Cuts through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Comes with limited shorter length attachments</li>
            <li> I waited a long time before reviewing this product. It is very strong, effective and has a good grip but I wish they have done a better job with the accessories. Using the accessories is not very friendly and adjusting the level by having to change the accessories each time can be challenging. I still recommend this for those who care more about delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all with this unit.  It did not live up to the hype</li>
            <li> This Remington razor  replaces my old Remington that I&#x27;ve had and used for many years. It still works but is showing signs of wearing out after much use. I was always pleased and satisfied with it, but I must say this one is an improvement. The battery life, the way it handles, the appearance, etc. all are perfect for me. I don&#x27;t use it to shave body or head. For me the sole purpose of this razor is to trim my beard, and it works so beautifully. Another great Remington product, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great for trimming beards but isn&#x27;t so great at shaving body hair. It comes with a few great attachments for trimming hair to different lengths. It&#x27;s charging station allows you to use the trimmer while charging (or charge and go cordless). The cordless option is especially helpful for those who trim in the shower instead of over the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> My last one died a couple of years ago and I&#x27;ve been muddling through with a few others. I love that I can use this in the shower. Body trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great body trimmer! the attachments are great and solid. When fully charged it automatically shuts the charger off.  Works perfect for the kids too... not much tickling and no pulling.</li>
            <li> Met every expectation....was easy to use even for a first time user.</li>
            <li> The Remington body shaver/trimmer is an excellent choice for getting it close, reliable trim.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very impressed with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is waterproof/water resistant, which means that you can use it in the shower without worrying about it breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging unit doesn&#x27;t plug into the shaver, rather it uses two small metal contacts to charge up the battery. I was very impressed with how quickly it charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box is a wall charger, a foil shave attachment, and an adjustable guard to control how close the shade is.</li>
            <li> This is my review from December, when I originally gave this five stars:&lt;br /&gt;Got this for my husband who shaves his head and most of his beard (he has a goatee), and so far he is really liking this clipper. It cuts really well, is pretty quiet, and the way the head is positioned makes it comfortable to hold. He particularly likes the way the attachments clip on and off. His only complaints are that he&#x27;d like the head to be a bit wider and he&#x27;s not crazy about the color, but even with those minor gripes he said he&#x27;d give this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is my review NOW:&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had this about three months, and it&#x27;s already giving my husband trouble. The guards pop off now while he is using this and it&#x27;s not cutting well. Still works okay on his beard, but not so well on his head. We&#x27;re really tired of clippers not lasting and were hoping this one would be different, but no... :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he is very happy with it! The multiple attachments make it very versatile. It is great for trimming beards, shaving the head, or shaving body hair. The battery life is very good, and it fits well in the hand. A great personal groomer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly hirsute, so nothing is perfect for me.  Compared to the Gillette Body Razor, this electric razor feels less smooth, but can handle much more hair at a given time.  It works particularly well on flatter surfaces, like my upper back, but I needed more touch-up with the Gillette Body Razor on curvier surfaces, like my shoulders and upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has a sporty look and a good feel to it.  Being wet/dry is nice since I can use soap to make it run smoother over my skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works on this steel wool fair.</li>
            <li> This could be much improved with a tote bag or tray to contain the parts and pieces, or create a self storing type of thingie. My old Norelco had it&#x27;s flaws, but the &amp;#34;dial to height&amp;#34; gizmo was awesome, and I miss it already. That being said, this little clipper is super strong, fast, and sharp. No &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; burns, and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> The power button has stopped working after couple of uses. Now its very irritating!!! once removed from charging there is no way I can switch off.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the product for its different blade option and their effectiveness earlier. But the product is no longer useful.</li>
            <li> trimmer works great in and out of the shower. the shaver works pretty well but not as wall as the trimmer</li>
            <li> I have a Braun trimmer about this size, which I have used only to &amp;#34;closely trim&amp;#34; my goatee, which this is replacing. The main reason I went for this one is the Lithium ion battery, which holds a charge longer. The battery in my Braun (at 4 years old) has finally stopped holding any kind of charge, although I did love its trimming ability. Although this trimmer can be used in the shower, I don&#x27;t see much benefit, since the first thing that comes to mind is all of that hair going down the drain, to clog it up. Another reviewer who did use it in the shower, commented that, since your hair lays flat against the body when water is flowing, it is a bit more difficult to lift the hair off, to cut. And is much easier when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger for this unit is not a stand. It simply snaps onto the tail end of the trimmer, so it will simply lay loosely on whatever surface you have at hand. The cord itself is about 6.5 feet long. And when the charger is snapped onto the back of the trimmer, it obstructs the hanging loop at the back of the trimmer, so you will not be able to hang it on a peg when charging (must lay loosely on a surface).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the trimming action, it is certainly adequate enough in blade speed and power to trim facial hair, using the various depth attachments. No complaints at all, there. And the depth attachments snap firmly onto the head so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off in use or storage. And the swappable heads are very easy to remove and switch. The body of the trimmer is very comfortable &amp;#34;in hand&amp;#34;, and the non slip surface would undoubtedly be a plus in the shower. I am only using the trimmer head, although I did try the combo body trimmer/shaver attachment which is really designed more for the specific function of removing long chest, arm, or leg hair. Although it does have the convenience of the foil shaver, sandwiched between two cutters. The dual cutter heads are designed to allow you to either push or pull the cutting action along your body (cutting on opposite sides and in opposite directions of the shaver foil in the center). So when you are finished taking the long hair off, you can then use the middle foil for the &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; shave. And although I will not be shaving body hair, because my wife likes me the way I am, I did try the shaver head on my morning shave of bare skin and found it lacking for that purpose. First of all the head is rather small, and provides minimal surface contact, versus a traditional foil or rotary shaver, and second, which I did not care much for, the cutting heads, flanking the shaver portion, did not glide as smoothly across the face as the foil, although the angle at which the unit is held, in relation to your face, would make a difference. It was not in any way uncomfortable, necessarily. It basically indicates that this does not rival a traditional electric shaver. So you might find yourself resorting to your normal shaver, after removing the long hair with the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because its utility for my intended purpose, is not equal to the full capabilities of the unit. Someone who intends to make full use of the unit for shaving body hair, and/or wishing to do it in the shower, may well justify a higher rating. And, of course, I knew this when I picked the unit for a goatee &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; trimmer, for which I would give it 4-5 stars.r push or pull the cutting action along your body (cutting on opposite sides and in opposite directions of the shaver foil in the center).

            <li> This body grooming kit does exactly that. It won&#x27;t shave off stubble and make the skin completely smooth like a razor would, but it does trim hair. If you have body hair that has some length, but is not too long it can trim it nice and close. It&#x27;s also rechargeable and waterproof. It can be used in the shower to trim body hair. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this in the shower if you have never groomed before. No one wants hair clogging the shower, but for trims and touch-ups it works fine. The head is small which has pros and cons. A smaller shaving head gives you more control, but takes longer to get the job done. There are five attachments that snap on and off. This groomer works fine and the rechargeable, water proof aspect is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This razor works OK, but not great, for basic \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; - the pros are that it is light, the battery lasts pretty well, and it does a serviceable job on shorter hairs. However, the razor did a poor job on areas of thicker hair or extensive stubble. It&#x27;s not marketed as a trimmer/clipper, but still got way too many painful pulls even on pre-trimmed areas, as well as stubble that it didn&#x27;t seem to cut even after multiple passes.     I don&#x27;t see the advantage of trimming in the shower.  Dry hairs cut better.</li>
            <li> I love this I would have given 5 if it came with a stand or something to put all the parts in.</li>
            <li> this was a present for my husband he loved it and it works great as well</li>
            <li> using it for a year now and still works excellent. Battery lasts long time on a charge. Works well on facial hair.</li>
            <li> This razor is a nice quality product. It&#x27;s great looking and sleek. It feels good in the hand and gives a nice close shave. However, I wish the trimmer portion of the razor was detachable. Other than that, the razor&#x27;s sturdy and comfortable design makes it a winner.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Just be careful about your sack!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but I need to pay more attention when shopping because I didn&#x27;t notice its water technology which seems to give a different feel when trimming. It feels like nothing is happening while you&#x27;re trimming which is fine but different. So if you really don&#x27;t need water technology, check out a different Remington product.</li>
            <li> Works well and very convenient. If you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave this might not be the best unit, but for touch up, longer facial hair, and body shaving it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> This product was way below expectation and a hazard. I ended up cutting myself a number of times. you need to be extremely careful and keep the machine exactly parallel to the skin. If its slightly tilted the edges will cut you</li>
            <li> I got the buzzer it was fine until it just stoped working after less then 2 months.. Return or exchange policy ends in 30 days it seems like.. :/</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my beard.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor. I keep one of the guards on when stowing it, scared the teeth might chip if i drop it. Doesn&#x27;t cut as evenly as i hoped, but it&#x27;s not a high end finishing razor either. The fact that its waterproof is pretty much the selling point. Good for trimming and grooming.</li>
            <li> Works well and great design.</li>
            <li> Amazing works perfectly high quality and feels good in the hand</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use one of the combs which leaves more stubble if you do you end up nicking yourself. I&#x27;ve nicked myself four times already. That never happened with the Wahl I was using. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works great! I like the changeable blade guides.</li>
            <li> Works good but have to go slow or you&#x27;ll cut your self also the blade guild taps break easily.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington years ago, and loved it.  I bought a Philips / Norelco trimmer and it was junk.  This one makes me glad I went back to Remington, great little trimmer so far!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He says it cuts good and is so much better than he could have imagined a waterproof shaver being.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, charges as stated in 3.5 hours. It trims very well. It has the perfect size. I love Remington&#x27;s simple design. One major disadvantage(for me at least and when comparing to other brands,especially Philips&#x27;s beard and vacuum trimmers) is that you have to replace the foil shaver and the trimming head between 6 months and a year(depending on usage). If they produce a trimming blade that is self sharpening then they can truly compete with Phillips.</li>
            <li> Works great. Fast shipping. My guy is happy!</li>
            <li> I really like this Remington trimmer. Replaced a 4 year old Philips norelco trimmer that I loved but wasn&#x27;t holding charge anymore and the blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp, of course.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to shave my face or head with a razor, much rather use a trimmer. The Remington cuts much closer than the norelco did. Only thing it was missing was a little brush to sweep the hairs out between the blades, but I still had the one the cane with the norelco, so want a big deal for me. The blades do seem to get warmer much faster than I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> Works very well and has multiple clip on attachments which are excellent quality plastics. Blades are very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair or cause any discomfort while trimming. Excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, shaves close and waterproof.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Nice size and plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever lol. This will not replace clippers or a trimmer, but comes close to it..i have thick hair and get razor bumps if shaved improperly. Used it everywhere with the multiple attachments and use light soap or cream when shaving face or sensitive areas ..why because you can wash it with water. Take a shower before you groom &amp; it will stay clean forever.</li>
            <li> Great wee piece from Remington! The trimmer and it&#x27;s attachment provide a good cut in and out of the shower but for the best results, I found using it dry works better as the hair are flattened down by the constant water flow. The bodygroom head works well. Again, best used out of the shower but beware - it is not 100% guaranteed you would nick something at some point. Using it on hard bone such as the clavicle was hard and left redness because of the constant rubbing of the tool going over the bone many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, great kit. Not perfect but does what it&#x27;s meant to do. The battery life is great; I&#x27;ve charged it once when I got it and haven&#x27;t charged it since - roughly 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son (age 30).  He is seriously into grooming aids of all kinds, but had never owned one of these, and so this was a new kind of product category for him.  He said he thought it was a very slick design and worked really well, charged quickly, held the charge for a long time.  He would not have thought to by a product like this for himself but now that he has it, he has found it to be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After charging the first time, the unit failed to recharge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer and groomer is simply awesome! I have tried several grooming products in the past, and this is the best I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to use this in the shower is a great plus. The grooming attachment is effective both wet and dry, and being able to simply rinse and go is a big plus. It is a self-lubricating attachment, so you won&#x27;t have to mess around with oiling the grooming attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the beard trimmer to clean up my sideburns, and I get some help keeping the back of my hairline even and my neck clean. A few drops of clipper oil on the trimmer blades from time  to time is a good idea to keep this clean and functioning well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of this product is the incredible charge life. I have been using this daily and waiting to write my review until I see how long it lasts. I have charged it once, and I have yet to charge it again. It has gone over a week on one charge. This is a groomer I can charge, throw in my shave kit, and take on an extended trip without having to pack extra cables to keep the unit charged.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t trim every day, the clippers have performed flawlessly. I rarely have to charge as the charge lasts a good while.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment change is a bit clumsy and relies on plastic spring tension to stay clipped. I wonder how long the attachments will flex and hold to the clipper, a positive is I have never had one come off during use.&lt;br /&gt;Blades seem very good and never tug or pull hairs. charging hookup could be better, as it interferes with the hanging hole.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my shower about 3 times a week to trim my beard and maintain the edges...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of this product is nicely shaped, and does a really good job of letting you get in and make nice, well-defined lines along your jaw and lip... The cutter is a little cheap and stamp-cut, but it works and what do you expect for thirty bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that after 35 days, the switch has broken.. Some days it won&#x27;t turn on without fidgeting with it for 2-3 minutes, others it won&#x27;t turn off without fidgeting. Ok, duds happen, but after 35 days using it 3 times a week and the switch is already broken? I used it so little I&#x27;d only had to charge it twice, maybe 12-13 shaves... Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Remington, and they want me to ship the product back, at my expense, with a copy of my receipt, and they&#x27;ll replace it after they get it. That&#x27;s fine, although it really is \\&quot;minimum acceptable\\&quot; customer service. They&#x27;re honoring their warranty, but not doing anything to make my life any easier. By comparison, I had problems with a Braun Cruzer, and they shipped me a replacement right away, all they asked was for me to email them a copy of my receipt and my address. Great customer service and their product failure didn&#x27;t cost me shipping expenses and hassles. (unfortunately, the Cruzer 6 Face doesn&#x27;t really cut clean lines with the trimmer, and the beard height settings are all rather short for my tastes, so I gave up on it and tried this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that Remington wants me to ship the product back with a receipt, I think I&#x27;ll go one step further and include the 60-day money-back form and request a refund... Given that it failed early and the company isn&#x27;t going out of their way to correct the problem, I&#x27;m not really inspired to give them a second shot and risk having to spend a few bucks in shipping every month or two to get my razor replaced until the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Remington, you could have offered a better-madeproduct for $10 more and I would have bought it happily... You could have offered good customer service and kept me as a customer too... but I guess you&#x27;ve got more lackluster products to make with lackluster customer service to back them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is time to try a different Braun model (Cruzer 6 beard and head), at least it offers long enough cutting lengths and a company that backs their products up...</li>
            <li> First of all, I won&#x27;t be reviewing the body shaver attachment for this product because I&#x27;m not into that kind of grooming. I bought it primarily as a beard trimmer, and so far it does an excellent job, very quick and efficient with a nice even trim. I do wish it came with some kind of stand for both the appliance and the attachments. Also, I would have preferred an adjustable grooming comb attachment to the five different length combs provided (sizes 0 to 4), which might have a tendency to get lost.  Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Some items do not live up to their hype!  However, this Remington Product a Wettech Head, Beard, and Body Grooming Kit is all that and more.  My son who lives with us decided recently to grow a beard.  He not only wanted to have one, but a fancy one at that.  He also needed to trim carefully around the edges, this Remington is perfect.  Thrilled is not the only word as his liking, but the added bonus of being able to shave the other hair in comfort is the wonder of it all.  Hair on his body is not a problem, but being able to have a trim of his hair is great.  The groomer comes with a variety of trim edgers which fit nicely over the main clipper part.  My wife, the retired cosmetologist gives this a thumbs up!  She has volunteered to trim the back of his head so that his hair will always be neat and fit.  Great product, reasonably priced and would make an excellent gift the nice way that it is packaged.</li>
            <li> Ease of use and it does not nick the skin.  A very close shave everywhere. Great product.</li>
            <li> Battery life is fantastic.  Very pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> Nice unit. Cuts well. Works good if cutting hair off short but if trimming, like my flat top, would like it sharper. It tends to push the hair rather than cut it</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard and body hair trimmer.  It charges quickly and remains charged for a long time.  The heads are easily removable and quickly swap back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;smooth&#x27; attachment, which both cuts the hair and shaves it smooth to the skin, for areas you wish to be hairless, works excellent.  There is no pinching or nicks, and the result is smooth and whisker free.  The trimmer portion works well and is easy to use.  There are several guards for your desired length.  The only place I had any trouble was beard hair, everywhere else I tried it cut quick and easy, only my very course beard hair required multiple passes to get trimmed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is waterproof and can be used in the shower, with the warning that the charger is NOT waterproof so it can&#x27;t be used in the shower while plugged in (duh! Think about it.  Haha).  While it is clipped into the charger, it is still easy to use (as long as your not in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very happy with this item, especially for the comparatively low price.</li>
            <li> Whats in the box?&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- four combs for the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- body groomer head (Remington counts this as a comb in the product description which is why the description indicates there are five combs)&lt;br /&gt;- changing base and cable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The Remington trimmer is about 6 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  It is a nice weight and fits well into an adult hand.  The body of the trimmer is hard plastic, but 3/4 of the body has been covered by a soft rubber so that you can keep a grip on the trimmer while using it in the shower.  The downside to the hard plastic is that small pieces of hair tend to stick to the plastic when you use the trimmer dry.  However, you can always rinse the trimmer to get rid of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is on the top, but is a bit lower than where your thumb would naturally rest, maybe so that you dont press the button by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer and trimmer head are easily exchanged by pressing on buttons on either side of the trimmer.  The combs attach by snapping them in place over the trimmer head.  You need a bit of force to get the combs back off, but that is probably a good thing so that they arent falling off during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was really pleased with is that the trimmer makes noise, but is not unbearably loud like most trimmers.  This is really nice when trimming sideburns or hair around your ears so that you dont worry as much about such a loud noise source so near your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate the trimmer should be charged for four hours before the first use.  After that, it is supposed to keep its charge for sixty minutes.  I have been using it every day since I first charged it and the charge is still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head without a comb is really useful for precision trimming like keeping sideburns straight.  The four combs that come with the trimmer dont offer a wide range of trimming lengths, but they have been working well otherwise.  The body groom attachment basically turns the trimmer into a foil shaver.  I have used it to keep the hair on the back of my neck tidy and have been happy with it.  It gives a descent shave but for my face, I will stick with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with using the trimmer on my face and neck.  I like being able to use it in the shower and this is definitely my go to trimmer for keeping my facial hair tidy.  I am definitely pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> For the price this was I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should believe that it was good quality or not but because I trust the Remington Products brand I decided to get it for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;After almost a month of use he said to give it as many stars as possible so I will relate his experience with using it.&lt;br /&gt;Developed to be used in the shower it apparently works not only well in the shower, but out of it also. Hubby said it is very easy to hold onto and not too heavy or awkwardly shaped to be good at angles and turns.&lt;br /&gt; Also, because being in the shower doesn&#x27;t hurt it any, it&#x27;s easy to lay down anywhere without worry about getting it too damp.&lt;br /&gt;He has used it on his beard, his mustache and sideburns, as a trimmer, and various body parts that he didn&#x27;t want to tell me about. lol&lt;br /&gt;It was able to remove the hair smoothly and without any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on him to trim his neck between haircuts and it was very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The blade has stayed just as sharp as new so far but even if it needs to be replaced in 6 months to a year, I still think it&#x27;s a great deal for how much it&#x27;s going to be used.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to charge efficiently and so far we just return it to the charger after use and haven&#x27;t had it run down at all during use.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that would of been nice is if the charger had shut down or had an indicator to let you know the level of charge or that it was fully charged. It does have a light that stays on all the time that lets you know it is charging though.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think ( as does hubby) that this is a good razor for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaver. It&#x27;s light, has good battery life, and is ok for short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it only 3 stars because it&#x27;s kind of flimsy, and the blades are stamped rather than ground (i.e., like a cheap knife) -- and this means that it pulls and tugs when I shave, instead of a quick sharp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard blade is 1 1/4 in, and the body grooming foil part is ~2 inches. There are 4 combs: 3, 6, 9 and 12 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a philips/norelco handheld which is better.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement to my old shaver. Work great and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> You can never have 2 many shavers especially if you use them often. I have one that I use all the time but when I had the option of getting this as well I decided to go ahead and get it. so far it has worked great as a trimmer, keeping things clean and in order. I have only used it on the beard since I really don&#x27;t shave on the body. It is lightweight and easy to use which is always a plus and you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer with a great price tag.  I don&#x27;t think it is &amp;#34;too loud&amp;#34; as some of the other reviewers say.  This also comes with an attachment like the phillips norelco body groom has, which isn&#x27;t shown in the picture but it is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. Much better quality than a $20 trimmer. No fantsy bells or whistles, justca nice clean cut, good battery life and a sleek look.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with these clippers. I will update my review in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Works well. Much better than my previous norelco</li>
            <li> Super get the job done</li>
            <li> This trimmer works exactly as I expected it to.  It is easy to use, it charges quickly and works safely around water.  Don&#x27;t expect this to replace your razor but it will easy trim things down to a fine stubble. It came with a host of grooming attachments, that I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> This groomer is solidly made and easy to use.  It&#x27;s easy to switch between the two main heads -- one for trimming your beard, and the other for closer shaves.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver of any sort that&#x27;s water proof (seems to go against common sense) but it works great!  I have used it to trim my beard in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have a mirror there, so normally use it at the sink. The rechargeable battery holds it&#x27;s charge quite well -- I trim my beard every few days and it has held it&#x27;s charge for 3 weeks.  The charger is very light and compact -- no bulky table top stand or heavy power brick -- and it runs on either 110 and 220 volts, so it&#x27;s ready to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have used this now for the past 11 months and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; trimming!  It is great to use this with my beard wet or even in the shower, and just run it under the faucet to clean it -- very easy!</li>
            <li> I occasionally like to grow a mustache and/or goatee every few years, and had an old Remington beard trimmer to keep things neat. However, that unit’s rechargeable battery finally gave out a year or so ago, so I was happy to be offered this product to review under the Amazon Vine program. Below are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product description says, this groomer works both in the shower and out, and has a body hair attachment as well as 5 snap-on guide combs. The rechargeable battery lasts about an hour, which matches the descriptions claim. Since I don’t have a mustache or beard at the moment, I use it to trim my sideburns. My wife also gives my family haircuts, and she uses this to trim the body hair off of my neck, and to “edge” hair line on the back of my boys’ heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agree that this is a light groomer that fits our hands nicely and doesn’t vibrate excessively, as some barber-like trimmers do. It’s also comparatively quiet. It trims quickly and cleanly. As part of this test, I also removed a patch of the body hair from my chest, and it was painless and neatly done. The only thing that I don’t like, and this is just a personal preference, is the snap-on guide combs for trimming beards and mustaches. I prefer the “wheel” type of comb, with basically can be adjusted infinitely. Granted, you can get a more consistent trim with the 5 snap-on combs, but I like the flexibility of the other style. It would have also been nice if they had included a cloth or fiber bag for the trimmer and the parts, but that was undoubtedly left out to keep costs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this grooming kit is well worth buying, and I recommend it. Four stars.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a lot going for it. It covers the spread of what you&#x27;d expect from this sort of product quite well and unlike most others, does most of what it sets out to do rather effectively. I&#x27;ve found many of these sorts of products that fail to either effectively trim beards or body, focusing instead on other areas of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great feature is the battery life. This isn&#x27;t the sort of product you&#x27;re going to need to have constantly in your bathroom wall socket. It says three and a half hours and it means it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is well worth the investment. It works and it works well.</li>
            <li> The thing my husband likes best about the trimmer/body shaver is it&#x27;s portability. It&#x27;s small and lightweight and perfect for taking along when he&#x27;s traveling. He has a beard which he keeps trimmed rather short and this trimmer helps him to keep it looking neat, the way he likes it. The body shaver attachment is handy for shaving areas above the beard and on his neck or for any other stray hairs. There are 5 different snap-on attachments for different lengths which are easy to use. He mostly uses the number four. While it works well for trimming his beard it isn&#x27;t as good for moustash trimming because it&#x27;s too wide to do a precise job. There are more full-featured trimmers out there from Remington and other manufacturers that have more features, but for the price this does most of what he wants it to do and he uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Neat little trimmer. The best feature, of course, is that it is cordless and works in the shower where your beard is softened by the hot water. Certainly it makes you presentable, but you might follow with Old Dependable, your razor, for special occasions when you want as close a shave as possible. Comes with four attachments for such truck as trimming beards, mustaches, the nape of the neck, even head hair. With the right length attachment, you can trim your eyebrows back, too, especially if they&#x27;re starting to look like Mark Twain&#x27;s or Albert Einstein&#x27;s, flying every which way but southeast. A bit smaller in size than a normal trimmer (as seen at your nearest barber shop), but that doesn&#x27;t really hold you back and, in fact, helps you negotiate nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li> Really impressed after going through about 5 brands.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few months now and im amazed at how long the charge lasts. I use it daily in the shower and leave it there for 2 weeks without charging and it works like a champ every time.</li>
            <li> My husband has a goatee/mustache and has been using a Norelco shaver for years. I gave this to him, and he says he is never going to use anything but a Remington, ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What worked -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is pretty lightweight, but feels substantial at the same time. Basically, you know you have it in your hand, but you don&#x27;t get arm fatigue trying to hold it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of combs to choose from - from size 0-4, which parses out to 1.5mm, 3mm, 6mm, 9mm and 12mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard blade is about 1 1/4&amp;#34; and the shaver attachment is about 1 3/4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run time is stated at 60 minutes. I guess if you have multiple people in your house that would use it, you may need to recharge, but for 1 person, 60 minutes is more than ample&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What didn&#x27;t work as well -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming unit performs substantially better if the hair is already somewhat tamed. For upkeep purposes, the unit is perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the unit in the shower isn&#x27;t as functional. The hair gets pushed closer to the skin by the water, making it harder for the unit to get under the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - Highly recommend. Very good results, terrific price point. This Remington Wettech is a win!</li>
            <li> Works great as a beard trimmer! Easy to set up, very easy to clean, and it charges with a standard micro-usb port. The heads can be a little tricky to snap on at first, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it. It works great as a trimmer, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s fairly small. It has a tough time with longer, thicker beard hair though, which is the only downside. Otherwise, great trimmer!</li>
            <li> The important thing is to know exactly what you are getting. This tool is great as a groomer. It does a great job of maintaining a beard length and trimming the edges to make things stay looking neat. It is not, however, a substitute for my razor. It does not cut close enough to the skin for me to use in that capacity. As a grooming tool, though, it is great—especially at this price. Remington has a pedigree for excellence and this product is no exception. The greatest thing for me about this product is the quality of the battery. It really has a long life and doesn&#x27;t give out in the middle of the job like my previous trimmer did. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and most importantly comfortable trimmer.  I use  it on my beard and whereas other trimmers sometimes cause nicks/scratches, this one (especially when using the body shaver when you have stubble) doesn&#x27;t cause the typical irritation I experience with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Not bad gets the job done</li>
            <li> Exactly what you want in an electric trimmer. Completely water proof and will run for a few weeks with great variation in attachments. It&#x27;s also a breeze to clean, charge, and use.</li>
            <li> Great product so far. Plenty of power and the blades are sharp, hasn&#x27;t bogged down one time on me. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower and it works better then I ever expected, and nice easy cleanup. Haven&#x27;t used the body shaver attachment yet so I can&#x27;t say on that one, still a little scared to go near my nads with that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, this thing does everything and is 100% waterproof! You can take it into the shower no problem!</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price, I just wish it came with longer attachments.</li>
            <li> It came with a &amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34; attachment, but I don&#x27;t really understand why.  the default shaver head works fine for body grooming, and works very well as a beard trimmer.  I had a Norelco beard trimmer before and it always felt very weak, and would grab my thicker stubble.  This is a powerful, well running device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a removable/adjustable head instead of the multiple attachments, but it works so well, that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected. No complaints. Would buy again.   Update: 6/20/17 This trimmer unexpectedly died. It quite literally just stopped working. I used it about 2 times a week to keep my beard the exact length I wanted it. I didn&#x27;t use it every day, and I never submerged it. I don&#x27;t know why it died. It won&#x27;t charge or power on.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace an aging body groomer. I&#x27;m very happy with this unit so far and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> it broke within a month</li>
            <li> POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. Excellent, long-lasting battery power, does not slow down and run weak after a while like every other rechargeable I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br /&gt;2. Great price (from Amazon) for a very good quality trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;3. Includes plenty of different sized trim guards,&lt;br /&gt;4. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;5. Fully re-charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;6. Rubberized surface texture for good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. So far, none really... clipper blade could be a bit wider but it&#x27;s sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: After less than 2 years of very light use, the battery died and would not re-charge. So it was great while it lasted, but died after just 22 months... bummer!</li>
            <li> Great item.  Light, handy works well keeps a very long charge.  Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> very compact but for body trimming the cordless and wet/dry features make this much better than my old run of the mill trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Don&amp;#34;t use the body head for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Great for the area I use it for</li>
            <li> The Remington PG6250 was a unit I was purchasing to replace an old norelco razor I had used for almost 15 years. I had expected much of this unit at first because many that I have looked at in stores seemed to be inferior in quality (flimsy plastic, short battery life), but this unit surprised me. I was able to get it on sale through amazon and decided to give it a shot - and I&#x27;m glad I did. This product has sturdy construction and a non-slip grip on the plastic almost feeling like rubber (which is great considering I use this to shave my beard in the shower and the unit does get wet). The different heads were nothing to write home about, but were adequate for my needs. The charging cradle is great for use if you&#x27;re hanging it (much like barber would), but even if you&#x27;re not - it works just fine. Overall I am very happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve had for about 6 months at this point and I think I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This razor is AMAZING!! I love it! I bought it to shave my head and... other places. It works great! it never cuts me. Clean up is easy and quick. It charges within 1-2 hours and holds a charge for a long time. My husband has started using mine so I&#x27;m going to have to purchase another one soon for him. I love this!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does an excellent job cutting through my thick hair. I mainly use it to trim down spots on my face I can&#x27;t comfortably reach with a razor. Battery time is excellent, and as an added bonus the trimmer really is water resistant. I would be hesitant to use it in the shower, but I have gotten it wet a few times without problems. The included attachments are a nice bonus for those trying to maintain a beard. All in all, this trimmer is a great upgrade from the dinky foldout trimmers you&#x27;ll find on electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that should be emphasized, though. This trimmer certainly trims perfectly well, but it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as closely as I&#x27;d have hoped. The foldout trimmer on my old electric razor was a pain in the butt to use because of its small size and odd placement on the unit, but that trimmer could trim right up against the skin if I wanted it to. Not so with this Remington. You won&#x27;t be getting baby skin smooth trims out of this trimmer, so don&#x27;t expect to be doing a clean shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect tool for maintaining a beard or mustache, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to do a closer shave, consider an actual shaver.</li>
            <li> Woa. What a great machine! The change time is Very long. Great product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a replacement for a Conair beard trimmer. The Conair took two AA Batteries and lost power quickly.  There are a lot of advantages of the Remington PG6250 over my prior shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid rechargeable trimmer. The charge takes less than 4 hours and will keep the charge for over two weeks. The charging stand is small and folds up when not in use. It looks rather fragile so you’ll want to ensure that it is not dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a lot of power and a solid but comfortable weight to it. It vibrates more than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used – Not a problem for me but I could see others not liking the feeling. The blade easily cuts through my thick stubble and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide combs come in different lengths and are not adjustable. This means you have 5 separate pieces with no container to put them in - A definite negative as small attachments such as these are often misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Hair Shaver attachment is different from the 5 guide combs and it is specifically for body grooming (hair on your body - not on your face). It works fine, especially when you shower. The full size trimming head (for facial trimming) easily removes and the Body Hair Shaver attachment slides on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good rechargeable trimmer with a reasonable price. I give it 4 stars due to the separate guide combs.  This would have been a 5-star product had the guide comb been adjustable rather than separate pieces.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I have used at least half-a-dozen beard trimmers and I always end up with pretty much the same complaint: limited battery life.  Sometimes it seems to take forever for the shavers to charge up; sometimes the battery life is so short that I&#x27;m lucky to get two trims out of them; and at other times the power drains so quickly between usage that I have to postpone a trim until I can recharge the battery.  None of this is good; all of it is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the battery is one of the best things about this Remington Wettech trimmer.  It charges up in about 3.5 hours and stores a much longer charge than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  And, at least up to this point, the charge does not seem to trickle down to nothing between trims.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too, I really like the rubberized grip on the trimmer and find that the firmer grip this provides makes it easer  for me to get exactly the trim I&#x27;m going for.  The trimmer comes with several attachments that are recommended for various functions, but I&#x27;ve stuck pretty closely to the default set-up and I probably will continue that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an excellent product, especially when compared to other trimmers in the same price range.</li>
