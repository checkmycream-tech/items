            <li>i trust and love bliss products!!</li>
            <li>The scrubby beads and the nobbly bits on the soap do a good job of exfoliating.</li>

            <li>Mammoth Minty Scrub is my favorite soap!  </li>
            <li>All of the fragrances and textures are amazing.</li>
            <li>Incredible fresh minty scent   </li>
            <li>The mint scent is noticeable, but not overpowering, and it gives a nice cooling feeling on the skin when used.</li>
            <li>nice and cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will leave you with a nice scent however, do not use it during winter.</li>
            <li>I love that it lathers so beautifully, and leaves me feeling quite clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The mint scent is very strong but not to the point where I find it over-whelming.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect \\&quot;wake-up\\&quot; treatment when you are barely dragging yourself out of bed.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THAT even more than the soap.</li>
            <li>but I love the nubbys on the one size.</li>
            <li>This soap is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap....  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it exfoliates my skin.  :)</li>
            <li>Okay,,, soap.</li>
            <li>This one will be my summer-time soap instead, and I&#x27;ll use one that moisturizes better in the winter time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this will last quite some time because of the size, but it&#x27;s so wonderful</li>
            <li>just nice, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The men in my life love this (and their skin gets so smooth).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is huge and it would probably be best if you break it in half.</li>
            <li>, THIS IS A HUGE BAR AND LASTS FOREVER.  </li>
            <li>Bar is HUGE so don&#x27;t have to replace often.</li>
            <li>I GOT TWO FREE GIFTS WITH THE PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot so having a non liquid option for showering is important.</li>
            <li>Scrubs you nice, lathers very well and rinses off completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the biggest bar of soap I have ever seen, and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>Bliss products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The bar didn&#x27;t fit on my shelves in the shower.</li>
            <li>The soap itself kind of feels cool on the skin, which in combination with hot water feels so spa-ish.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S ALSO VERY ECONOMICAL</li>
            <li>*Leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed   </li>
            <li>Using it in a shower is almost like treating yourself to a minty cool scrabby massage.</li>
            <li>Smells super minty.</li>
            <li>A extremely large bar of soap, it&#x27;s good enough for about three months use when taking a shower once a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and uplifting.</li>
            <li>you exfoliated, but not dry, and a little bit tingly, and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice minty smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I was using &amp;#34;Pre de Provence, Mint Leaf&amp;#34; and I liked the way it felt after a shower, so I thought, let&#x27;s try some other mint soaps.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean yet soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t appreciate how big this bar of soap is until you hold it in your hand, or in my case &#x27;hands&#x27; because that is how huge it is.  </li>
            <li>As a fan of the Bliss brand I had tried this soap in a sample size and really did like the soap.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling clean, no leftover residue...</li>
            <li>Now I know why he was recommending it so highly.</li>
            <li>This soap was in a high end hotel in Manhattan and we have been ordering it since.</li>
            <li>This bar of soap supplied the finishing touch to my new frameless shower renovation.</li>
            <li>I think I need a new robe, this soap is so fancy.</li>
            <li>Live it</li>
            <li>Especially gratifying on hot days.</li>
            <li>those with sensitive skin may want to skip this one.  </li>
            <li>Once you are in the shower and lather up this luxury on your skin and breathe in the fresh mint, you would be wide awake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin (eczema, etc.) and have been known to break out in hives if I use the wrong soap, but this does a good job of cleansing without causing me irritation.</li>
            <li>i will not stray from this soap again, especially since it is slightly discounted here on amazon - and the huge size lasts my husband &amp; i about 2 months.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase although expensive.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I cut it in half and that was better for me.</li>
            <li>They just where off too quickly and watch your feet if you drop the bar, it&#x27;s heavy!</li>
            <li>There are tiny bits of blue mixed throughout the soap (hard to see in the picture) that act as the exfoliating element when you use this, but they are so tiny that you really don&#x27;t feel them much even though they do work.  </li>

            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t soften when left in the soap dish, it lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> I tried three other soaps, and this one blew the pack away.  </li>
            <li> Once I discovered Bliss Mammoth Minty Scrub, all the other bars of soap &amp; even the 5 or so bottles of my wife&#x27;s shower gels became obsolete.</li>
            <li> Maybe every other day since I also have the lemon + sage bar.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars is strictly due to the size.</li>
            <li> Hard to find and expensive, but sooooo worth it!  </li>
            <li> One side of the soap is as pictured here, the other side is a bunch of rounded little nubs to help massage and exfoliate as you use it.  </li>
            <li> The bar is hard for my small female hands to hold</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin at all, and in the winter I need all the extra moisture I can get.  </li>
            <li> It tends to leave you with a very minty, cold feeling.</li>
            <li> *Exfoliating grains remove dead skin cells   </li>
            <li> Have used it for a while, and when I placed my usual order from Bliss, I got a cryptic email saying they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> Usually buy the wash/ scrub but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even use bar soap.</li>
            <li> HARD MILLED SOAP.</li>
            <li> i have tried other, less expensive, mint soaps &amp; nothing has come close, even hand made etsy products!</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting it in half.</li>
            <li> At the time I thought he was crazy for spending $18 on a bar of soap.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  EVERYONE I GIVE IT TO LOVES IT. THIS SOAP IS SO REFRESHING.  IT&#x27;S ALSO VERY ECONOMICAL, THIS IS A HUGE BAR AND LASTS FOREVER.  HARD MILLED SOAP.</li>
            <li> A friend informed me about this product. At the time I thought he was crazy for spending $18 on a bar of soap. Now I know why he was recommending it so highly. It&#x27;s worth the money. The product is as advertised.    *Incredible fresh minty scent   *Leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed   *Exfoliating grains remove dead skin cells   *French milled to not soften in the soapdish     This bar of soap supplied the finishing touch to my new frameless shower renovation. Who knew that a bar of soap could make cleaning up so infigorating. I wish I would have discovered this product sooner. I guarentee if you buy one you will be hooked also.</li>
            <li> if you like mint, THIS IS YOUR SOAP! i have tried other, less expensive, mint soaps &amp; nothing has come close, even hand made etsy products! this soap just smells so refreshing &amp; leaves you exfoliated, but not dry, and a little bit tingly, and smelling delicious! i will not stray from this soap again, especially since it is slightly discounted here on amazon - and the huge size lasts my husband &amp; i about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have gifted it to many people as well.  It&#x27;s delightful!  The graininess of the soap feels wonderful on my skin and the smell is an olfactory explosion of delight.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The bar is oversized, last quite a while, smells minty and leaves you feeling invigorated.  Skin feels clean yet soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this soap. It&#x27;s massive and just never ends. The scent is so refreshing. It&#x27;s a perfect \\&quot;wake-up\\&quot; treatment when you are barely dragging yourself out of bed. Once you are in the shower and lather up this luxury on your skin and breathe in the fresh mint, you would be wide awake. The soap itself kind of feels cool on the skin, which in combination with hot water feels so spa-ish. OK, it&#x27;s just a soap, but it&#x27;s really great one.</li>
            <li> makes you feel good and fresh. i trust and love bliss products!! i will try more products apart of the scrub.</li>
            <li> the best minty scrubby soap ever!</li>
            <li> Mammoth Minty Scrub is my favorite soap!  Bliss was out- I&#x27;m happy to know Amazon carries it as well.</li>
            <li> All I can say is....GET SOME !TOTALLY AWESOME AND! I GOT TWO FREE GIFTS WITH THE PURCHASE. I WILL BE ORDERING. 3 MORE :)</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bar. I love it. It smells so fresh and uplifting. Using it in a shower is almost like treating yourself to a minty cool scrabby massage. It lathers well and creamy. Nothing critical to say. Love it.</li>
            <li> The men in my life love this (and their skin gets so smooth). Bar is HUGE so don&#x27;t have to replace often. Smells super minty. Have used it for a while, and when I placed my usual order from Bliss, I got a cryptic email saying they were out of stock. No info on whether order was cancelled, delayed, discontinued etc. So I checked for same item on Amazon, found it. ordered it, and had the soap in 3 days. LOVE THAT even more than the soap.</li>
            <li> I just looooove this soap! The mint scent is noticeable, but not overpowering, and it gives a nice cooling feeling on the skin when used. The scrubby beads and the nobbly bits on the soap do a good job of exfoliating. I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin (eczema, etc.) and have been known to break out in hives if I use the wrong soap, but this does a good job of cleansing without causing me irritation. Since it doesn&#x27;t soften when left in the soap dish, it lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> A extremely large bar of soap, it&#x27;s good enough for about three months use when taking a shower once a day. It&#x27;s got a nice minty smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. Overall a good purchase although expensive. I travel a lot so having a non liquid option for showering is important.</li>
            <li> I was using &amp;#34;Pre de Provence, Mint Leaf&amp;#34; and I liked the way it felt after a shower, so I thought, let&#x27;s try some other mint soaps. I tried three other soaps, and this one blew the pack away.  What a blast!  Especially gratifying on hot days. Use it with a bath brush... I dare you.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this bar of soap. It was a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Usually buy the wash/ scrub but decided to give this a try. It smells and works great and my boyfriend and I both use it. I prefer it to Dr Bronners peppermint soap which I used for a while. The bar is hard for my small female hands to hold but I love the nubbys on the one size. They just where off too quickly and watch your feet if you drop the bar, it&#x27;s heavy! After a few uses I cut it in half and that was better for me.</li>
            <li> This soap is my favorite. My wife found it in a hotel some time ago, and we go through a lot of different hotels. This soap was in a high end hotel in Manhattan and we have been ordering it since. All of the fragrances and textures are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap....  I think it is too expensive and they should lower&lt;br /&gt;the price, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find another soap that i like as much&lt;br /&gt;as this one. I love the smell and how it exfoliates my skin.  :)</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and thought... Okay,,, soap. But!! I just used it and it&#x27;s amazinnnngggg. I usually don&#x27;t even use bar soap. I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to hide this giant bar from everyone else, so I don&#x27;t have to share it. It&#x27;s that wonderful. Felt great going on and feels great after. It actually got me in and out of the shower in a couple of minutes. I think I need a new robe, this soap is so fancy.</li>
            <li> nice and cool!&lt;br /&gt;It will give you a chill in a very good way. Scrubs you nice, lathers very well and rinses off completely.&lt;br /&gt;It is huge and it would probably be best if you break it in half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and it&#x27;s minty - I&#x27;ve never seen or used anything else like it.  You really can&#x27;t appreciate how big this bar of soap is until you hold it in your hand, or in my case &#x27;hands&#x27; because that is how huge it is.  One side of the soap is as pictured here, the other side is a bunch of rounded little nubs to help massage and exfoliate as you use it.  There are tiny bits of blue mixed throughout the soap (hard to see in the picture) that act as the exfoliating element when you use this, but they are so tiny that you really don&#x27;t feel them much even though they do work.  The mint scent is very strong but not to the point where I find it over-whelming.  It definitely leaves you tingling all over - those with sensitive skin may want to skip this one.  I love that it lathers so beautifully, and leaves me feeling quite clean and refreshed.  My only disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin at all, and in the winter I need all the extra moisture I can get.  This one will be my summer-time soap instead, and I&#x27;ll use one that moisturizes better in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered Bliss Mammoth Minty Scrub, all the other bars of soap &amp; even the 5 or so bottles of my wife&#x27;s shower gels became obsolete. This product is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This will leave you with a nice scent however, do not use it during winter. This is a soap to be used during the summer months. It tends to leave you with a very minty, cold feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest bar of soap I have ever seen, and it&#x27;s fabulous. It massages, scrubs, foams, and cleans, leaving you refreshed and invigorated. I&#x27;m assuming this will last quite some time because of the size, but it&#x27;s so wonderful I plan on using it every day. Maybe every other day since I also have the lemon + sage bar. Bliss products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Live it</li>
            <li> Great soap for cooling your skin and for a scrub. Just don&#x27;t use it if you have a sunburn....yeow!</li>
            <li> Got one of these as a re-gift, almost cried when it was gone!  Hard to find and expensive, but sooooo worth it!  This bar stayed minty until the end!  I am so happy to have another!</li>
            <li> As a fan of the Bliss brand I had tried this soap in a sample size and really did like the soap. Left my skin feeling clean, no leftover residue...just nice, clean and refreshed. The reason for the 4 stars is strictly due to the size. The bar didn&#x27;t fit on my shelves in the shower. I ended up cutting it in half.</li>
