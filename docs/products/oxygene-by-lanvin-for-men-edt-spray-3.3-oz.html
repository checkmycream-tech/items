            <li>Wondeeful product and great service!</li>
            <li>Good buy!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SMELL</li>
            <li>definetely great perfume</li>
            <li>, This Eau de Toilette has very suitable  name &amp;#34;Oxygene&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>good price and product, bought this as my school perfume and it turned into my going out scent.</li>
            <li>This men&#x27;s  cologne is very smooth, attractive smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the perfume, I always use ETERNITY untill a friend give me a gift las year 2013 was great to use Oxygene Eau.</li>
            <li>A great aroma for a nigh out with friends, but not so strong it would stink you out of the cab.  </li>
            <li>To be honest I do prefer Avant Garde by Lanvin, because it&#x27;s really special, very unique, but it&#x27;s also great + considering the price and ounces!!!</li>
            <li>Lanvin is a great summer fragrance - light and airy smelling.  </li>
            <li>, so good choice :)</li>
            <li>I gave it to my brother in love as a gift</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give this more than 1 star.</li>
            <li>For me, this was just okay.</li>
            <li>area as needed, very quick &amp; easy!</li>
            <li>3 HOURS IF LUCKY!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance  </li>
            <li>I sincerely think it is worth the $15-$20..</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells great and stays on you for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Very fresh scent, with uplifting smells of morning fabric and lime</li>
            <li>A nice change of pace from the watered down citrus junk/ gourmand style scents, good quality perfume as well.</li>
            <li>Not everyone will recognize it so it will be uniquely yours unless you tell people what you are wearing.</li>
            <li>For a little more money, I would greatly recommend[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Price was good, and I would recommend it to someone younger who wanted something light and aquatic.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was that great, but I found myself continually coming back to it.</li>
            <li>My mom bought me the roll on of this and it was so good that I wanted a bigger bottle of it!</li>
            <li>I like fresh scents, and this is not one.</li>
            <li>I wore that previously and found it greatly superior.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp, light, but with a lasting bottom note.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A GREAT AROMA AND LONG LASTING........</li>
            <li>Well, well well, we keep on buying Lanvin online :) and not only online.</li>
            <li>Yes it did, thanks very much</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean however the scent does not last on me.  </li>
            <li>However, shipping fee is quite high!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This smells absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a strong bitter scent in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I normally give colognes that I don&#x27;t like to my son, but I won&#x27;t be giving him this one.</li>
            <li>This is unfortunately not the same fragrance i was buying and using.</li>
            <li>I was  surprised at how well balanced it all is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not light, smells strong enough- very masculine scent...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not trying to be mean, but Oxygene simply does not smell good.</li>
            <li>I currently have DG Light Blue, Polo Black, Eternity and Bvlgari Aqua, and Acqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li>From first spray to the dry down, this really holds together well</li>
            <li>This product was not available in the local mall but saving time &amp; money thru amazon was absolutely worth it.  </li>

            <li> I regret this purchase, and should have taken a chance on getting a fake cool water.</li>
            <li> Oxygene almost reminds me of Bvlgari&#x27;s Aqua Marine, but not as sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp mellow scents with no musky aromas.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for casual wear.</li>
            <li> It was of extremly poor quality.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it. However, shipping fee is quite high!</li>
            <li> Great product.  A must buy.</li>
            <li> This is the sexiest scent on my husband.  He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> GREAT SMELL BUT DOESN&#x27;T HOLD, MABE 3 HOURS IF LUCKY!  IF U WANT TO IMPRESS, SPRAY BEFORE GOING TO MET!</li>
            <li> My mom bought me the roll on of this and it was so good that I wanted a bigger bottle of it! Good buy!</li>
            <li> It was of extremly poor quality. I was much disappointed.</li>
            <li> definetely great perfume</li>
            <li> Oxygene almost reminds me of Bvlgari&#x27;s Aqua Marine, but not as sharp.  A great aroma for a nigh out with friends, but not so strong it would stink you out of the cab.  Sharp mellow scents with no musky aromas.</li>
            <li> Fantastic fragrance  I bought three</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s  cologne is very smooth, attractive smell.  This men&#x27;s cologne originates in Paris and has that smell of elegance about it. I recommend this product especially during a night on the town.</li>
            <li> USED LANVIN OXYGEN FOR YEARS IT HAS A GREAT AROMA AND LONG LASTING........</li>
            <li> This product was not available in the local mall but saving time &amp; money thru amazon was absolutely worth it.  And if it&#x27;s a gift, you can just fill out the &amp;#34;ship to&amp;#34; area as needed, very quick &amp; easy!</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately not the same fragrance i was buying and using. I Don;t know why, but they changed it?</li>
            <li> Yes it did, thanks very much</li>
            <li> Very fresh scent, with uplifting smells of morning fabric and lime, This Eau de Toilette has very suitable  name &amp;#34;Oxygene&amp;#34; which is what it contributes to the wearer.</li>
            <li> A nice change of pace from the watered down citrus junk/ gourmand style scents, good quality perfume as well.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my brother in love as a gift and he likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry guys, but I have to be honest. This smells absolutely horrid. It reminds me of a beer joint from the 80&#x27;s that my dad would take me to. I currently have DG Light Blue, Polo Black, Eternity and Bvlgari Aqua, and Acqua Di Gio. This doesn&#x27;t smell like any of them. I&#x27;m really not trying to be mean, but Oxygene simply does not smell good. I regret this purchase, and should have taken a chance on getting a fake cool water. I like fresh scents, and this is not one. Please, please don&#x27;t buy this. I wish I could send it back. I normally give colognes that I don&#x27;t like to my son, but I won&#x27;t be giving him this one. Again, I&#x27;m very sorry for sounding harsh, but I like to smell good. I can&#x27;t give this more than 1 star. This was a blind buy. Beware.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume, I always use ETERNITY untill a friend give me a gift las year 2013 was great to use Oxygene Eau.</li>
            <li> I know cologne smells different on different people. For me, this was just okay. It reminded me a bit of Nautica. Price was good, and I would recommend it to someone younger who wanted something light and aquatic. For a little more money, I would greatly recommend[[ASIN:B005MQPFP2 Lanvin Avant Garde Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.3 Ounce]] . I wore that previously and found it greatly superior.</li>
            <li> Lanvin is a great summer fragrance - light and airy smelling.  I highly recommend it for casual wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been holding off to write a review on Oxygene.. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was that great, but I found myself continually coming back to it. I was  surprised at how well balanced it all is. From first spray to the dry down, this really holds together well, it just took me 3-4 months to realize it.. I sincerely think it is worth the $15-$20.. This is one of those rare finds of an inexpensive cologne that is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a strong bitter scent in the beginning.  It feels fresh and clean however the scent does not last on me.  It last about 30 mins to an hour only during the winter time.  It should last longer during the summer.</li>
            <li> Bought it as gift to a friend. he loves and I do too</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp, light, but with a lasting bottom note. Not everyone will recognize it so it will be uniquely yours unless you tell people what you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Well, well well, we keep on buying Lanvin online :) and not only online. To be honest I do prefer Avant Garde by Lanvin, because it&#x27;s really special, very unique, but it&#x27;s also great + considering the price and ounces!!! my husband likes it, so good choice :) It&#x27;s not light, smells strong enough- very masculine scent...</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells great and stays on you for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Second bottle.  This is the go to stuff and nobody has a clue what it is.</li>
            <li> Wondeeful product and great service!</li>
