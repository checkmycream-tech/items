            <li>We used these to help cover and protect some post-surgical suture areas and they worked splendidly.  </li>
            <li>Dynarex is a great brand.</li>
            <li>Great affordable insurance for the medicine cabinate and with an almost indefinite shelf life.</li>
            <li>was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the quality of material as well as packaging.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Now I do and that make me feel good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Good absorbancy.  </li>
            <li>Best thing for large wounds or for wounds that are leaking.</li>
            <li>I figured they would be nice to have in an emergency.  </li>
            <li>More affordable than the name-brand alternatives; good quality and coverage area; and they are quite versatile for largish wounds.  </li>
            <li>Great online buying experience Amazon, thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Delighted to find them at such a good price, and delivered  to my front door a great convenience.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and packaging was good.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it were a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>The product was okay, 3 stars.</li>
            <li>lots of these.. more than you think you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I love these dressings.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>more words required one two</li>
            <li>Nice and well packaged, these should be great for whenever they&#x27;re actually needed -</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, fair price, solid pad for great absorption, good wrapping, easy open, all around good choice.</li>
            <li>They feel really cheap basically.</li>
            <li>I resealed these pads in vacuum storage bags and that works great.</li>
            <li>very low price, yet very nice quality.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, have not had to use them, but I found their wrappers to be in good shape, no water damage or anything else that would suggest they weren&#x27;t fresh, new and unstored.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, easy to open, and good quality.</li>
            <li>However keeping them in my first aid kit I may have to reconsider now and buy something a bit more hefty.</li>
            <li>Came fast, came in perfect condition and went right into my bugout-bags and medical</li>
            <li>Also, perhaps more importantly, another brand I have used provides more padding for overall protection, and comfort.  </li>
            <li>These are good pads for someone with medical problems.</li>
            <li>For a home first aid, these pads would be fine as they are and would be recommended for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I ordered two boxes of these Abd pads, when they arrived which was really quick</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this product and I hope I never need to use them, but if I do they could easily save a life.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price for the peace of mind.  </li>
            <li>Resulting in much more frequent dressing changes, and the need for a soothing skin cream, like Balmex.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li>Much thinner than expected but still good buy for price.</li>
            <li>I purchased these pads for a Trauma First Aid Kit.</li>
            <li>and they come so fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>A much better product is Medline Extra Absorbent ABD Pads (#NON21450H).</li>
            <li>I bought these for a first aid kit I keep in one of my saddlebags.  </li>
            <li>I use these in my first responder aid kit.  </li>
            <li>I will probably continue to find use for these, just be aware of what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Have used many of these over the years owning them and I will stick to this brand in future restocking.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use them on a dry wound, they may be ok, but if you use them on a wound that is not dry, you better use a back-up pad as well.  </li>
            <li>As far as the pads, they work well for intended purpose and are economical.</li>
            <li>Reasonable and must to have on hand in emergancy supplies.</li>
            <li>But they are much thinner than the those from Medline or Kendall.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Simple, basic pads suitable for use in a jump bag.</li>
            <li>but I took them out and put them in a ziplock bag, pushed all the air out and now they take up half as much space in my BOB first aid kit!!!</li>
            <li>if you buy this from BP Medical you will get a cheap Chinese off brand, NOT Dynarex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>Not highly absorbent, not very durable, but they are ok, I guess, for 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>So far, they aren&#x27;t up to the job.</li>
            <li>The inside is made of what feels like something a little better than toilet paper/cotton.</li>
            <li>I kept them because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of sending them back since they were not expensive, but I would definitely NOT reorder these.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and absorbs a lot more fluid for not much more cost.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants the need to use something this large on a wound, but there has been times in the past when this was needed</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these pads are thin, cheaply made and do not do a good job.</li>
            <li>I tested the absorption, and they do an ok job but not great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better and worse pads</li>
            <li>They are really not much thicker than a normal gauze 4x4.</li>

            <li> They are really not much thicker than a normal gauze 4x4.</li>
            <li> Too large for wound, not able to cut to smaller size.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the paper packaging is not durable for a First Aid Kit that can be subjected to use.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that they are not thick at all, and are very thin for an absorbent pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather have 10 good pads for $5.50 than 20 poorly made</li>
            <li> This pad is large enough to fold over your toes which is difficult to do with a 4x4 gauze psd.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re about half the thickness of a regular surgical pad, which makes them less absorbent.</li>
            <li> They do not absorb as well as other brands, and are they&#x27;re quite thin, I experienced even small amounts of drainage remaining on the surface of the pad, which caused me to feel very uncomfortable and sore.</li>
            <li> Some other off (CARING) brand pads.</li>
            <li> &amp; is maybe 1/8 to 1/4 thick folded in apparent 3rds.</li>
            <li> Came 20 in a box, box was a little crushed</li>
            <li> tHE PADS WERE THINNER THAN THEY WERE WHEN I BOUGH PREVIOUSLY.  </li>
            <li> Other ABD pads I&#x27;ve bought were somewhat thick, whereas, even when folded in half, these are thinner.  </li>
            <li> I opened one and the pads are really thin, not much to them.</li>
            <li> Too thin.</li>
            <li> Thin and will not do what I need them too.  </li>
            <li> Relatively thin.</li>
            <li> that gives you an idea how thin they are when unfolded.</li>
            <li> These bandages are ungodly expensive at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> these are very very THIN, thinest ABD pad i have ever seen...</li>

            <li> Dynarex is a great brand. if you buy this from BP Medical you will get a cheap Chinese off brand, NOT Dynarex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from them</li>
            <li> My wife used these after abdominal surgery. She said they weren&#x27;t quite as \\&quot;cushy\\&quot; as the ones from the hospital, but they got the job done and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pads for a Trauma First Aid Kit. As far as the pads, they work well for intended purpose and are economical. My only complaint is the paper packaging is not durable for a First Aid Kit that can be subjected to use. I resealed these pads in vacuum storage bags and that works great. For a home first aid, these pads would be fine as they are and would be recommended for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Best thing for large wounds or for wounds that are leaking. Works very good and they come so fast! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Obviously haven&#x27;t had the occasion to use these yet, but they came in just as advertised.  Nice and well packaged, these should be great for whenever they&#x27;re actually needed - no worries ordering these.</li>
            <li> Too thin. It would be better if it were a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> tHE PADS WERE THINNER THAN THEY WERE WHEN I BOUGH PREVIOUSLY.  THEY DID NOT SUIT MY PURPOSE WELL.  I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, fair price, solid pad for great absorption, good wrapping, easy open, all around good choice. In my Kit now.Thanks!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and packaging was good. Unfortunately, these pads are thin, cheaply made and do not do a good job. When I unfold the pad, the stuffing inside tears and separates, so it lets fluid leak though. I use a lot of ABD pads, so I know how to handle them, but there is no way to keep these from ripping apart inside. I kept them because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of sending them back since they were not expensive, but I would definitely NOT reorder these.  If you are going to use them on a dry wound, they may be ok, but if you use them on a wound that is not dry, you better use a back-up pad as well.  A much better product is Medline Extra Absorbent ABD Pads (#NON21450H). It is thicker and absorbs a lot more fluid for not much more cost. I ordered them through Amazon from ToysNGamesEtc.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a first aid kit I keep in one of my saddlebags.  I figured they would be nice to have in an emergency.  They seem like they will do the trick.  Hopefully I will never have to come back here with a post-use review.</li>
            <li> I hope to never need these, but if I do - I have them at my disposal. Nobody wants the need to use something this large on a wound, but there has been times in the past when this was needed and I didn&#x27;t have them. Now I do and that make me feel good. Great affordable insurance for the medicine cabinate and with an almost indefinite shelf life.</li>
            <li> I use these in my first responder aid kit.  Well packaged, easy to open, and good quality.</li>
            <li> More affordable than the name-brand alternatives; good quality and coverage area; and they are quite versatile for largish wounds.  We used these to help cover and protect some post-surgical suture areas and they worked splendidly.  Quite absorbent, and you get 20 in a box.</li>
            <li> Used to cover stapled incision.  These bandages are ungodly expensive at the pharmacy.  Delighted to find them at such a good price, and delivered  to my front door a great convenience.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this product and I hope I never need to use them, but if I do they could easily save a life.  Put them in my medic&#x27;s bag.  Well worth the price for the peace of mind.  Goes well with suture kits and steri strips.</li>
            <li> The product was okay, 3 stars. They do not absorb as well as other brands, and are they&#x27;re quite thin, I experienced even small amounts of drainage remaining on the surface of the pad, which caused me to feel very uncomfortable and sore. Resulting in much more frequent dressing changes, and the need for a soothing skin cream, like Balmex.  Also, perhaps more importantly, another brand I have used provides more padding for overall protection, and comfort.  I will probably continue to find use for these, just be aware of what you&#x27;re getting. Lastly, made in China, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> Much thinner than expected but still good buy for price. Reasonable and must to have on hand in emergancy supplies.</li>
            <li> Thin and will not do what I need them too.  Other ABD pads I&#x27;ve bought were somewhat thick, whereas, even when folded in half, these are thinner.  They are really not much thicker than a normal gauze 4x4.</li>
            <li> Some other off (CARING) brand pads. Relatively thin. Received 20 in a box that listed a quantity of 25. Wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d save some money by buying these pads. But they are much thinner than the those from Medline or Kendall. The thing is that I had bought these before, but they&#x27;ve reduced the amount of material in the pads. So now I have to use two pads when one would have been enough before. I cannot recommend these.</li>
            <li> Came fast, came in perfect condition and went right into my bugout-bags and medical preps.&lt;br /&gt;But lots of these.. more than you think you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints what-so-ever, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered two boxes of these Abd pads, when they arrived which was really quick I opened one and the pads are really thin, not much to them.</li>
            <li> I like to keep this in my bicycle pack and my shooting range bag to use for falls and scrapes.  Fortunately, have not had to use them, but I found their wrappers to be in good shape, no water damage or anything else that would suggest they weren&#x27;t fresh, new and unstored.</li>
            <li> These are good pads for someone with medical problems.</li>
            <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;good value for the money. was happy with the product. only concern the pads showed up in a padded envelope</li>
            <li> They feel really cheap basically. The inside is made of what feels like something a little better than toilet paper/cotton. I tested the absorption, and they do an ok job but not great. The biggest issue is that they are not thick at all, and are very thin for an absorbent pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather have 10 good pads for $5.50 than 20 poorly made ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for. Not highly absorbent, not very durable, but they are ok, I guess, for 5 bucks. However keeping them in my first aid kit I may have to reconsider now and buy something a bit more hefty.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re represented as 5x9 abdominal pads, but the pkg. does not note that. these are very very THIN, thinest ABD pad i have ever seen... the pad measures 5X3 in the pkg. &amp; is maybe 1/8 to 1/4 thick folded in apparent 3rds. that gives you an idea how thin they are when unfolded. do not like them for what they are represented as.</li>
            <li> Was just what I needed in a timely fashion. I am very happy with this product and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent if you havr a wound on your toes.  This pad is large enough to fold over your toes which is difficult to do with a 4x4 gauze psd.</li>
            <li> These are not equivalent to name brand pads. They&#x27;re about half the thickness of a regular surgical pad, which makes them less absorbent. I need them to absorb drainage from a healing incision. So far, they aren&#x27;t up to the job.</li>
            <li> Recieved 4 days from order date! Came 20 in a box, box was a little crushed but I took them out and put them in a ziplock bag, pushed all the air out and now they take up half as much space in my BOB first aid kit!!! Each individually packed in sterile tear packages! Great online buying experience Amazon, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Too large for wound, not able to cut to smaller size. No adhesive.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Good absorbancy.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love these dressings. very low price, yet very nice quality. these absorb quite a bit of fluid and I use them in my ems/first responder bags for heavier fluid control. Have used many of these over the years owning them and I will stick to this brand in future restocking.</li>
            <li> found these for 25 cents per pad, and it&#x27;s the same grade as the ones used in the hospital where I work...thanks.</li>
            <li> Simple, basic pads suitable for use in a jump bag. I&#x27;ve seen better and worse pads but I have no complaints</li>
            <li> I have them stocked in my emergency go-back in my car. I&#x27;m happy with the quality of material as well as packaging.</li>
            <li> Dynarex Abdominal Pad 5 X 9 Sterile, 20 Count Excellent product. I love it&lt;br /&gt;6 more words required one two</li>
