            <li>Worth every penny and more!!!!</li>
            <li>Quality-wise don&#x27;t expect anything amazing.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to grip and has a nice balance to it.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for my dogs ears but it wont cut his very fine hair .It</li>
            <li>Easy to use and most of all keeps my dog&#x27;s face beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>I have being using Wahl trimmers for ear hair, nose hair, and eyebrows for years and find they are better than the others.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one to replace one I had for several years, It works wonderfully for what I use it for .  </li>
            <li>I can go out and pay more for something that doesn&#x27;t do any better job than this does.</li>
            <li>For what they are you  will be ok...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited when I found this item.  </li>
            <li>This makes trimming my dogs eye area very easy, quick and safe.</li>
            <li>A professional brand clipper at a great price.</li>
            <li>Even better than the original model which worked well and lasted for years.</li>
            <li>This detailer makes it easy to trim with pin point accuracy.</li>
            <li>I own a tiny Morkie dog and this is perfect for trimming between the toes, sanitary area and the facial area...</li>
            <li>I use it on my eyebrows to clean them up and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>You do need to use very small strokes to allow the blades to do the work but very happy with this purchase to use between trims.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll want to be quick if using it around your ear.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is the only one that allows such a customization and works superbly as a result.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Great little tool.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for trimming small amounts of neckline hair missed after a hair cut and trimming men&#x27;s sideburns.</li>
            <li>When I saw this small battery trimmer that wasn&#x27;t a rechargeable, I took a chance and ordered it from Amazon, and when it came, I loaded a couple of batteries in it and tried it out, and I have to say I was delighted and excited at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great but the only problem is the width of the blade&#x27;s guard&#x27;s outside combs.</li>
            <li>Have used it twice and find effective, quiet, very maneuverable.</li>
            <li>Small, cheap, and effective.  </li>
            <li>It was just about the same price as this model from Amazon but is much more functional.</li>
            <li>It is small enough and light enough to get into the smallest corners of your moustache, and yet has a very powerful and speedy motor to do a very good job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for making beard lines, so im not sure how good it is for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>The clippers that I had were just too large &amp; it took quite a bit of time to create a design.</li>
            <li>Our dogs have fine, almost human hair like fur.  </li>
            <li>It works fast and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li>Very operational, does what it is meant to do, clip nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Once I used a metal sander to alter the outside edges to a fine triangular point just like the inside combs, the trimmer was able to easily be maneuvered to line up your forehead or behind the ears better than any other trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Most other trimmers have a plastic casing.</li>
            <li>And, like I say, a heck of a lot better than all the other so-called trimmers out on the market.</li>
            <li>Works great on my toy poodle&#x27;s paw&#x27;s, and cheap enough that when the blades get dull I simply replace it.</li>
            <li>This is a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Cut cleaner than my regular clippers and obviously was so much easier to use for fine details.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and it cuts the closest of all other brand trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>You can do a real professional job with these two items.</li>
            <li>We thought this would fit the bill and be quiet enough not to scare the dogs.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The battery cover is loose, so on occasion it can pop off, for the price I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>You can create very detailed designs with the control that this small blade gives you!</li>
            <li>my old one</li>
            <li>one was it was considerably louder than than my old one, and there is a brush built in to the handle and it would get snagged on my hand and fall out.</li>
            <li>I have had Mini Schnauzers and have groomed them myself for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really loud</li>
            <li>This thing is exceptional because of how thin the blades are which is essential for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little blade with minimal noise that dogs seem to tolerate when you need to shave foot pads and close inner eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great and easy to use product for precision trimming, especially cutting my children&#x27;s hair where a normal-sized trimmer is too bulky and unwieldy.</li>
            <li>other than those two things it feels exactly like my old one</li>
            <li>Even after many years of trimming facial hair, I always had trouble with my mustache hair line above my lip.</li>
            <li>It does seem to help get out the occasional mat if used with enormous patience and a certain technique.</li>
            <li>Only seem to last about 2 years depending on how much you use it, so expect to replace it.</li>
            <li>it doesnt matter which way you put in the battery, it turns on, the on-off switch doesnt turn it off, sent back to wahl, new one does the same thing</li>
            <li>But other than that this trimmer works very well for a variety of tasks.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s minor)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little trimmer, and tell you that you will not be disappointed, but learn to love it.  </li>
            <li> So loud for such a small item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old, and have had a mustache since 1964, and have used mostly small siccors to keep it trimmed over the years.  </li>
            <li> The cover for the battery was loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite loud making it  hard for me to get close to them without some training.  </li>
            <li> However a week after beginning to use this product I found a 3 in 1 Wahl trimmer at our local Drug Emporium store that has an interchangable round head for nose and ear, reciprocating head, and an eyebrow attachment for the reciprocating head for trimming eyebrows evenly.  </li>
            <li> My designs are taking less than half the time it took me with my larger clippers &amp; the work</li>
            <li> and other tasks it was designed for...</li>
            <li> I suppose other trimmers can have their plastic guards removed but it wouldn&#x27;t look untouched.</li>
            <li> I have other wahl products</li>
            <li> I went to my local supply house &amp; they did not carry the Wahl trimmer with the very narrow blade.</li>
            <li> Much, much better than the other crap that&#x27;s out there claiming to be a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This product does NOT work very well on their hair - not the thick fluffy one or the thin wiry one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my little dogs&#x27; faces, specifically between their eyes.  </li>
            <li> but there are a few things i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> is that it takes a few strokes to shave the area \\&quot;clean\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Bought this to trim hair on my two small poodle mix dogs.  </li>
            <li> It did less than a poor job.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small trimmer at a store on a whim, and it was a rechargeable one, that never did work because it failed to recharge after a month or so.  </li>
            <li> The blade also dulled terribly after first use,  without abuse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get it to cut our dogs&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> i had gotten this trimmer to replace the con-air one because it had gotten to the point where the switch had broken</li>
            <li> It does poorly for my husband&#x27;s ear hair.</li>
            <li> For a small trimmer it makes a lot of noise, my dog isn&#x27;t afraid of the noise.  </li>
            <li> but, the ones I got are very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I was very frustrated with it and threw it away, and looked for something else online.</li>
            <li> I used mine for small line details on the shaved sides of my head and it worked like a dream!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I have been using this model since 1999 and finally stopped working recently so I just bought another one on Amazon. I use it on my eyebrows to clean them up and nose hairs. This thing is exceptional because of how thin the blades are which is essential for eyebrows. Cuts the hair flush with the skin, jus as good as plucking w\o the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old, and have had a mustache since 1964, and have used mostly small siccors to keep it trimmed over the years.

It is very easy to grip and has a nice balance to it. I highly recommend this little trimmer, and tell you that you will not be disappointed, but learn to love it.  Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Small, cheap, and effective.  I use it to trim nose and ear hair.  It is great for those purposes!</li>
            <li> Quality-wise don&#x27;t expect anything amazing. In fact the battery compartment for mine wouldn&#x27;t even close properly...so I had to put tape on it. But other than that this trimmer works very well for a variety of tasks.  Besides head graffiti ...lol...and other tasks it was designed for...it also trims nose and ear hair admirably. It works fast and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist &amp; cut hair for a living. I needed a tool to draw designs in a mens buzz cut style. The clippers that I had were just too large &amp; it took quite a bit of time to create a design. I went to my local supply house &amp; they did not carry the Wahl trimmer with the very narrow blade. I went on line to Amazon &amp; there it was. A professional brand clipper at a great price. My designs are taking less than half the time it took me with my larger clippers &amp; the work is amazing! You can create very detailed designs with the control that this small blade gives you!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00006IVEI WAHL Detailing, Battery Trimmer]]    I received the incorrect product on Aug 25th.  I sent an e-mail thru Amazon that same day.  I received a reply From Leo&#x27;s Discount asking me to send them a picture and they would put the correct item in the mail.  I sent them two pictures but never heard back from them, nor did I receive the replacement.  I sent them another e-mail on Sept 2nd requesting they contact me or I was going to cancel the charge to American Express.  On Sept 7th I did cancel.  I still have the incorrect item which I will throw out unless I hear from them.  This is why I will never order anything from Amazon unless I can&#x27;t locate it somewhere else.  You did nothing to help me with this problem.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product to trim around eyes, toe pads and bottoms on our tiny toy dogs.  We thought this would fit the bill and be quiet enough not to scare the dogs.  It is fairly quiet but it just doesn&#x27;t trim well.  It&#x27;s very hard to get it to cut our dogs&#x27; hair.  Our dogs have fine, almost human hair like fur.  It just doesn&#x27;t cut well.  We usually try using this first and then end up grabbing the scissors.  It does seem to help get out the occasional mat if used with enormous patience and a certain technique.</li>
            <li> i had gotten this trimmer to replace the con-air one because it had gotten to the point where the switch had broken so you had to hold the battery to get it to work. this trimmer works as well as my old one but there are a few things i didn&#x27;t like. one was it was considerably louder than than my old one, and there is a brush built in to the handle and it would get snagged on my hand and fall out. other than those two things it feels exactly like my old one</li>
            <li> I own a tiny Morkie dog and this is perfect for trimming between the toes, sanitary area and the facial area... tiny enough to get the eye area without the worry of injury.  You do need to use very small strokes to allow the blades to do the work but very happy with this purchase to use between trims.</li>
            <li> This is a great and easy to use product for precision trimming, especially cutting my children&#x27;s hair where a normal-sized trimmer is too bulky and unwieldy.</li>
            <li> A good product, does what it meant to do, styling around the eyes, trimming hairs from ears etc. I bought this trimmer to use on my Bichon Frise.</li>
            <li> I have had Mini Schnauzers and have groomed them myself for nearly 15 years. This is a nice little blade with minimal noise that dogs seem to tolerate when you need to shave foot pads and close inner eyebrow hair. Only seem to last about 2 years depending on how much you use it, so expect to replace it.</li>
            <li> I brought this product thinking it would work and it didnt so I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  This makes trimming my dogs eye area very easy, quick and safe.</li>
            <li> it doesnt matter which way you put in the battery, it turns on, the on-off switch doesnt turn it off, sent back to wahl, new one does the same thing</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer. Even after many years of trimming facial hair, I always had trouble with my mustache hair line above my lip. Frequently hacking it up with scissors or a wide clipper blade. This detailer makes it easy to trim with pin point accuracy. I don&#x27;t use it for making beard lines, so im not sure how good it is for that purpose.  It comes with a blade guard, a brush that slides into the handle and takes one AAA battery. Yes it is a little loud so you&#x27;ll want to be quick if using it around your ear. Not that big a deal to me.  Thanks</li>
            <li> this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer. You can do a real professional job with these two items. &lt;br /&gt;               Robert paul Jones</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but the only problem is the width of the blade&#x27;s guard&#x27;s outside combs.Once I used a metal sander to alter the outside edges to a fine triangular point just like the inside combs, the trimmer was able to easily be maneuvered to line up your forehead or behind the ears better than any other trimmer I have ever used.Most other trimmers have a plastic casing.This trimmer is the only one that allows such a customization and works superbly as a result.I suppose other trimmers can have their plastic guards removed but it wouldn&#x27;t look untouched.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice and find effective, quiet, very maneuverable. Price is excellent @ $11.49. Definintely recommend it.</li>
            <li> For a small trimmer it makes a lot of noise, my dog isn&#x27;t afraid of the noise.  The battery cover is loose, so on occasion it can pop off, for the price I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I like them but, the ones I got are very poorly made. The cover for the battery was loose so I kept losing my battery.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these since 2004 and it&#x27;s still in operation. I bought a second one to use for trimming the hair that grows around the foot pads of my Bichon Frise. It&#x27;s also great for trimming small amounts of neckline hair missed after a hair cut and trimming men&#x27;s sideburns.</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer.  Much, much better than the other crap that&#x27;s out there claiming to be a trimmer.  The motor is strong and it cuts the closest of all other brand trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for several weeks and still haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries.  I use it for touch ups like trimming around the ears and such.  Definitely worth the money.  My only gripe (and it&#x27;s minor) is that it takes a few strokes to shave the area \\&quot;clean\\&quot; but it does do the trick.  And, like I say, a heck of a lot better than all the other so-called trimmers out on the market.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim the inside of ears on my show cats. It&#x27;s not too loud so it really doesn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li> Bought this to trim hair on my two small poodle mix dogs.  Great for trimming eyes and between the pads of their feet.</li>
            <li> Works great on my toy poodle&#x27;s paw&#x27;s, and cheap enough that when the blades get dull I simply replace it.</li>
            <li> I have being using Wahl trimmers for ear hair, nose hair, and eyebrows for years and find they are better than the others. However a week after beginning to use this product I found a 3 in 1 Wahl trimmer at our local Drug Emporium store that has an interchangable round head for nose and ear, reciprocating head, and an eyebrow attachment for the reciprocating head for trimming eyebrows evenly.  It was just about the same price as this model from Amazon but is much more functional.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of c_ _ p!!!!!  It does poorly for my husband&#x27;s ear hair. Then I tried it on my yorkie&#x27;s face then feet. It did less than a poor job. Wish I had not purchased this product.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BETTER ONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS  DID NOT LAST very long I used it for about 2 momths on dog ear hair and it no longer recognizes the batteries.  I use trimmers a lot on the inside of dogs ears because it feels safer on nervous dogs.  If anyone knows of a trimmer like this that uses regular power instead of batteries please let me know</li>
            <li> Amazing! I used mine for small line details on the shaved sides of my head and it worked like a dream!!!!!! Cut cleaner than my regular clippers and obviously was so much easier to use for fine details. Powerful motor for such an inexpensive little thing!!! Worth every penny and more!!!!</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job.  Easy to use and most of all keeps my dog&#x27;s face beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one to replace one I had for several years, It works wonderfully for what I use it for .  Trimming my Miniature  Schnauzer. On and in his ears and on his nose, between his eyes.</li>
            <li> Wow! So loud for such a small item! The blade also dulled terribly after first use,  without abuse. Feel likee I wasted my money. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> works great! shaves the areas needed!</li>
            <li> like them a lot. should make some the same size but chargable rather than battery operated</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Don&#x27;t know what else to write. They&#x27;re really loud but whatever. I just wear earplugs when I&#x27;m using them.</li>
            <li> AWSOME.......GO FOR IT.....NO REGRETS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWERFULL, WELL DESINGED, GREAT FOR DETAILIND YOUR BEARD OR TRIMMING NOSE HAIRS... DO IT, MONEY WELL SPEND, DELIVERED ON TIME AND INTACT</li>
            <li> I have other wahl products so I was very excited when I found this item.  These clippers don&#x27;t even cut!</li>
            <li> Great little tool.  I can go out and pay more for something that doesn&#x27;t do any better job than this does.</li>
            <li> Even better than the original model which worked well and lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my little dogs&#x27; faces, specifically between their eyes.  This product does NOT work very well on their hair - not the thick fluffy one or the thin wiry one.  It&#x27;s also quite loud making it  hard for me to get close to them without some training.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone purchasing for this purpose; it simply does not cut through their hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted it for my dogs ears but it wont cut his very fine hair .It does work on my mustache so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> They work !!! Feel like toy trimmer !!! For what they are you  will be ok... I rather use my detailer they have a better feel to them !!</li>
            <li> Battery operated, can take it anywhere. Very operational, does what it is meant to do, clip nose and ear hair. Super product. I love it.</li>
