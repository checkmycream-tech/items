    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great!  </li>
            <li>Its best you try it if you are losing lots of hair and be the judge.  </li>
            <li>The invati system is a wonderful botanical system to keep the hair that you already have, and making it stronger.</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>but this is excellent for that problem.</li>
            <li>Shampoo gives an excellent lather every time.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is wonderful; it never makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair was rebounding from a health situation, and I was told that this would help create a perfect environment for my hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I fricken love this system!!!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>My thinning hair became fuller and just beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great feel</li>
            <li>I used it and was happy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Invati system for 6 months and have experienced no difference.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo smells great</li>
            <li>I also experienced a lot of breakage before using this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have Kim Kardashian hair, nor will I ever, but I am thrilled with he results!  </li>
            <li>It was good for color treated hair and helped to keep my color longer since I wasn&#x27;t washing it every day.</li>
            <li>Others seem to have good things to say so it might work for you.</li>
            <li>It smells good and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>and I think the combination has created good results.</li>
            <li>A good conditioner will help keep you from loosing hair.  </li>
            <li>The tonic will help give you a bit of lift at the roots, but so will any good mousse or root lifter.  </li>
            <li>After massaging in the the revitalizer I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there (in a good way).</li>
            <li>and this makes it full with a beautiful shine!  </li>
            <li>Pros:  Smells nice, does a good job cleaning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li>Nice if it works for some, but not for me.</li>
            <li>From what the reviews say, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but I am delighted with the results and have recommended it to 3 friends who are also quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have very fine gray hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;About two months after I finished using it, however, a huge bald spot (perhaps 2\\&quot; in diameter!)</li>
            <li>Love Aveda products</li>
            <li>but I do love all Aveda products</li>
            <li>I know it is working for me because I a thicker pony tail and more hair to put up.</li>
            <li>and I felt that product was more helpful to my hair than Invati.  </li>
            <li>Still a stubborn part of me thought that the Invati products might help make my hair look fuller on top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months, and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>After giving it ample time to &#x27;work&#x27; I had to accept the fact that my hair was in better shape before use.</li>
            <li>I have found that the more conditioner/product I use, the more I need to shampoo, and consequently, the faster my color</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Much better condition</li>
            <li>The packaging never claims it will &amp;#34;grow more hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I noticed more and more hair in the drain catcher each day and no improvement in the look or feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love... ?</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this system.</li>
            <li>but with it they improved even more...</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I received my purchase yesterday and I am none too pleased about the size of the bottles.</li>
            <li>Love this hair preservation system.</li>
            <li>love the way it smells and feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I just use Aveda products and morroccan oil...which I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do love the spicy scent</li>
            <li>At $45, they are charging $20 more than they charge in the salons.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it</li>
            <li>Used it once--had more hair loss after shampooing then I&#x27;ve had in years---</li>
            <li>This shampoo has cleared the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; I seemed to have and tried so many products to combat</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair feels and acts after washing with this shampoo....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess you do have to use other products to get the perfect look</li>
            <li>Literally two full handfulls per shower!</li>
            <li>In spite of my skepticism I purchased the 3-product system after having it strongly recommended by the Aveda salesperson - claiming that it was a &#x27;&#x27;growth stimulating&#x27; system.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair buy have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice, and it did not perform as well for volume on my fine, colored hair as Aveda Color Conserve.</li>
            <li>It says that it will reduce hair loss by 33%, insert asterisk here, and the fine print below says &amp;#34;due to breakage&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, color treated.</li>
            <li>and when I saw that my hair, curly but fine to begin with, was beginning to become even thinner, I panicked and bought the Invati system.  </li>
            <li>If you look at the bottle, in fine print, it states that it helps reduce hair loss from breakage.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I started using Pure shampoo and conditioner and really liked the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge expense.</li>
            <li>Nice fast shipment.</li>
            <li>but I can use the Aveda light elements serum for that.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t and makes my hair look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone has different results, but I am 100% happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like it works for everyone -</li>
            <li>My hairline is filling in and that is exactly what I was hoping for!!</li>
            <li>I searched for this product and when I found it I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine blond hair, wants to see some results in terms of filling in on the temples .</li>
            <li>My hair always feels silky and clean.</li>
            <li>This product along with the conditioner has improved the way my hair feels, it really feels clean, full bodied and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the strong herbal fragrance of the product but it leaves my hair clean and soft and it has dramatically reduced the hair loss I was experiencing</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try the Invati line because I felt my hair was thinning on top</li>
            <li>I found it very drying to the point of more breakage.</li>
            <li>The shampoo came early which thrilled me</li>
            <li>So, in comparison at least, Invati is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The price is up there which almost had me giving up after just one months use, but I decided to give it 12 full weeks just to see if I saw results.</li>
            <li>With all these great reviews it must be a good product however for me it was a waste, I have thinning gray hair and after using this shampoo and the conditioner I find some hair in in my brush and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it will burn like no other shampoo I ever used.</li>
            <li>Be prepared that this product will dry out your scalp and use a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;d really like to know is why amazon has a 6.7 oz bottle of the shampoo for $41 when Aveda&#x27;s own website sells the same size bottle for $28 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it to try to see if it&#x27;s for you?</li>
            <li>If it does work, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having paid so much, I used the whole bottle even though I didn&#x27;t love the shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and I am not losing as much hair which is great because that is scary.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t blowdry, hot iron, or anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>That was when the first Invati ads came on TV.</li>
            <li>This really truly stopped me from losing my hair!</li>
            <li>I use it very frugally because of the cost, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>My scalp tingles throughout the day and I love it because I can actually feel it working.</li>
            <li>After searching for years and spending a lot of money for many products, this is the one that finally works for me.  </li>
            <li>It took a few weeks to see a noticeable difference, and about 6 months of continued use to get optimum</li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical at first, I have had excellent results, which I really noticed after about 8-10 weeks.</li>
            <li>Every two or three weeks I use a different (mild) shampoo and rich conditioning treatment, which helps.</li>
            <li>But overall I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I want to reduce breakage, a nice conditioner from Aveda will do the trick and costs less.</li>
            <li>I was using the Pure shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment from AVEDA</li>
            <li>they suggested the Pure line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s, with naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The texture of my fine, wavy (color treated) hair is about the same, but it is much thicker--especially around the hair line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any improvement in hair loss either.</li>
            <li>product very runny and slimey.</li>
            <li>After talking to the store associate, I decided to try the whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li>So so far it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really like AVEDA products and was hoping that this product along with the conditioner and revitalizer would do what the reviewers said it would.  </li>
            <li>The whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>How ironic.</li>
            <li>Online or at the Aveda stores you can get the whole system for $110.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses just the shampoo and conditioner, and has noticed that there is not as much hair in the drain after a shower.</li>
            <li>One thing however is that you can get this product for much cheaper on the Aveda website than purchasing it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>and i must say that it really did make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li>I also have combination skin and it has really helped with breakouts n</li>
            <li>I do not lose as much hair while washing or brushing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely dislike it -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn clip in hair extensions before, trying to add volume and while it does just that, I&#x27;ve realized my issue with my hair really lies with my thinning hair line.</li>
            <li>After 12 weeks I really am seeing results.</li>
            <li>I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my hair at all, except that it just gets greasy immediately a few hours after applying the product.</li>
            <li>I went from wearing a wig due to such thinning hair problems, to loving my full head of naturally curly hair now!</li>
            <li>However, test results have shown that it absolutely can grow new hair!</li>
            <li>Aveda cannot legally print that it will grow new hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 and the older I get, the thinner my hair line gets.</li>
            <li>My main reason for writing is the price.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I too, had high hopes for this product as I have used Aveda products for decades.</li>
            <li>It did help me with hair loss, but too high a price to pay</li>
            <li>There is constant new hair growth over my entire scalp which adds a lot more body and fullness.</li>
            <li>My review does not mean that Invati doesn&#x27;t work, my review is to say that Invati does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a modest investment, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re not out much money, and you never have to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I noticed on the packaging they show a woman of eastern (Indian?) descent, and they all seem to have amazing thick hair.</li>
            <li>As some reviews say, there is a strong medicinal smell to the spray for a few minutes after applying it to the scalp (and it seems very drying to my hair</li>
            <li>I have noticed my hair looking fuller and has felt significantly more healthy in the past few months.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this new product, thinking that it would help thicken my hair; I have never had a problem with hair loss.  </li>
            <li>and I am growing new hair.</li>
            <li>Without going through the FDA as a pharmaceutical, a product cannot claim to grow new hair.</li>
            <li>I can see new growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Invati system for 5 weeks now, and after just the first few days noticed a huge difference in my super thin, extremely fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week and since day one I noticed a difference, a little thinker, more manageable, I do have to combine it with a little drop of my Enjoy condionomg mask but</li>
            <li>and I it smells very natural -</li>
            <li>My hair just does not behave the same way it did with the first batch I bought/used.  </li>
            <li>You want to make sure that you&#x27;re spraying and massaging into the scalp TWICE a day, bc the ingredients are only active for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I have thick, but very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I got the smaller bottles, not the full price, still, I am astounded at the tiny amount of product you receive.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair and always had a ton fall out in the shower and my wide tooth comb was full after washing it as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product, super expensive though.</li>
            <li>but the lady at the store told me that the Invati was for women who were losing lots of hair on a daily basis and since I wasn&#x27;t losing hair she suggested the Pure line.  </li>
            <li>I will finish using the product and go back to Pure as it seemed to work</li>
            <li>I am a swimmer and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>on the side of my head developed that was not there before I started using the product.</li>
            <li>so far I do like it, hairs is not as shiny tho</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews here are negative bc</li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li>and i also like that it&#x27;s mostly naturally derived, but i have to say the price of the system is quite off-putting.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>They say that the product has natural ingredients but why is my scalp reacting this way.</li>
            <li>product, but you should probably buy it locally or directly from Aveda...</li>
            <li>So I bought this directly from the store of avanti got convinced by the girl at the store.</li>
            <li>Another scam based on this natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I decided to try aveda&#x27;s line because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would have to go as far as to say it reduced hair breakage by 90%+ within 5 days.</li>
            <li>When I finally got a new batch and started using it, my hair just has not behaved the same way as it did with the first supply.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look bad, in fact it&#x27;s long and healthy, the problem is I have an increasingly large bald spot on top of my head.</li>
            <li>but it is still higher than buying directly from Aveda and paying their shipping for a single bottle.</li>
            <li>colleague and I both started using this system at the same time, so we could monitor each other, and we BOTH see huge differences in the thickness and texture of our hair.</li>
            <li>Having spent WAY more money on wigs, weaves and other product that had less than stellar results, I&#x27;m sticking with AVEDA Invati now and forever!</li>
            <li>My hair dresser instructed me to use only enough to cover the first 1-2\\&quot; from the scalp.</li>
            <li>Totally not worth the price and not worth the risk of potentially having your hair shed more!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat, straight and thin hair.</li>
            <li>Since I have switched to the Invanti shampoo I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower and very little comes out when I comb it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product system for the past month and have noticed a huge difference in my thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li>Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon.  </li>
            <li>The previous review by Giovanna is so right on...</li>
            <li>I do not lose a considerable amount of hair in the shower with regular shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I am barely losing any hair in the shower anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have always had thin hair, as did my parents, but after radiation therapy and chemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor the problem became much more severe.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair and am willing to give just about anything a try.</li>
            <li>I totally agree with the review of the other user who said if it doesn&#x27;t work for you first.</li>
            <li>which other shampoos for thinning hair have done)Leaves it very manageable</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 8 weeks and do notice new hair growth but also notice that my hair is extremely dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>Actually I am very surprised to see the wide array of reviews here, but perhaps this product just doesn&#x27;t work for some people.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it is very drying to my 3b curls.</li>
            <li>My hair would also feel very greasy after a day which made it impossible to go more than one day between shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>When I went to the AVEDA store in the mall and told them what type of hair I have (thin, fine hair)</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to make that investment, especially since I&#x27;m concerned about my color in addition to my hair being fine and thin.</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of Aveda products, but I have to say that this particular line is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed both in my own gullibility and the salon&#x27;s willingness to misrepresent this particular product line.</li>
            <li>My hair has gone from thick and curly to thin and straight as I have aged and now it is returning to its thicker and more natural curl.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> but this is excellent for that problem.</li>

            <li> I fricken love this system!!!</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> My thinning hair became fuller and just beautiful.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great feel</li>
            <li> I used it and was happy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Invati system for 6 months and have experienced no difference.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo smells great</li>
            <li> I also experienced a lot of breakage before using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have Kim Kardashian hair, nor will I ever, but I am thrilled with he results!  </li>
            <li> It was good for color treated hair and helped to keep my color longer since I wasn&#x27;t washing it every day.</li>
            <li> Others seem to have good things to say so it might work for you.</li>
            <li> It smells good and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> and I think the combination has created good results.</li>
            <li> A good conditioner will help keep you from loosing hair.  </li>
            <li> The tonic will help give you a bit of lift at the roots, but so will any good mousse or root lifter.  </li>
            <li> After massaging in the the revitalizer I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there (in a good way).</li>
            <li> and this makes it full with a beautiful shine!  </li>
            <li> Pros:  Smells nice, does a good job cleaning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Nice if it works for some, but not for me.</li>
            <li> From what the reviews say, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but I am delighted with the results and have recommended it to 3 friends who are also quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have very fine gray hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;About two months after I finished using it, however, a huge bald spot (perhaps 2\\&quot; in diameter!)</li>
            <li> Love Aveda products</li>
            <li> but I do love all Aveda products</li>
            <li> I know it is working for me because I a thicker pony tail and more hair to put up.</li>
            <li> and I felt that product was more helpful to my hair than Invati.  </li>
            <li> Still a stubborn part of me thought that the Invati products might help make my hair look fuller on top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months, and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> After giving it ample time to &#x27;work&#x27; I had to accept the fact that my hair was in better shape before use.</li>
            <li> I have found that the more conditioner/product I use, the more I need to shampoo, and consequently, the faster my color</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Much better condition</li>
            <li> The packaging never claims it will &amp;#34;grow more hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I noticed more and more hair in the drain catcher each day and no improvement in the look or feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love... ?</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this system.</li>
            <li> but with it they improved even more...</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I received my purchase yesterday and I am none too pleased about the size of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this hair preservation system.</li>
            <li> love the way it smells and feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I just use Aveda products and morroccan oil...which I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do love the spicy scent</li>
            <li> At $45, they are charging $20 more than they charge in the salons.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it</li>
            <li> Used it once--had more hair loss after shampooing then I&#x27;ve had in years---</li>
            <li> This shampoo has cleared the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; I seemed to have and tried so many products to combat</li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair feels and acts after washing with this shampoo....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess you do have to use other products to get the perfect look</li>
            <li> Literally two full handfulls per shower!</li>
            <li> In spite of my skepticism I purchased the 3-product system after having it strongly recommended by the Aveda salesperson - claiming that it was a &#x27;&#x27;growth stimulating&#x27; system.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair buy have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, and it did not perform as well for volume on my fine, colored hair as Aveda Color Conserve.</li>
            <li> It says that it will reduce hair loss by 33%, insert asterisk here, and the fine print below says &amp;#34;due to breakage&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, color treated.</li>
            <li> and when I saw that my hair, curly but fine to begin with, was beginning to become even thinner, I panicked and bought the Invati system.  </li>
            <li> If you look at the bottle, in fine print, it states that it helps reduce hair loss from breakage.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I started using Pure shampoo and conditioner and really liked the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge expense.</li>
            <li> Nice fast shipment.</li>
            <li> but I can use the Aveda light elements serum for that.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t and makes my hair look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone has different results, but I am 100% happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound like it works for everyone -</li>
            <li> My hairline is filling in and that is exactly what I was hoping for!!</li>
            <li> I searched for this product and when I found it I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine blond hair, wants to see some results in terms of filling in on the temples .</li>
            <li> My hair always feels silky and clean.</li>
            <li> This product along with the conditioner has improved the way my hair feels, it really feels clean, full bodied and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the strong herbal fragrance of the product but it leaves my hair clean and soft and it has dramatically reduced the hair loss I was experiencing</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try the Invati line because I felt my hair was thinning on top</li>
            <li> I found it very drying to the point of more breakage.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came early which thrilled me</li>
            <li> So, in comparison at least, Invati is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The price is up there which almost had me giving up after just one months use, but I decided to give it 12 full weeks just to see if I saw results.</li>
            <li> With all these great reviews it must be a good product however for me it was a waste, I have thinning gray hair and after using this shampoo and the conditioner I find some hair in in my brush and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it will burn like no other shampoo I ever used.</li>
            <li> Be prepared that this product will dry out your scalp and use a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;d really like to know is why amazon has a 6.7 oz bottle of the shampoo for $41 when Aveda&#x27;s own website sells the same size bottle for $28 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it to try to see if it&#x27;s for you?</li>
            <li> If it does work, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having paid so much, I used the whole bottle even though I didn&#x27;t love the shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and I am not losing as much hair which is great because that is scary.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t blowdry, hot iron, or anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> That was when the first Invati ads came on TV.</li>
            <li> This really truly stopped me from losing my hair!</li>
            <li> I use it very frugally because of the cost, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My scalp tingles throughout the day and I love it because I can actually feel it working.</li>
            <li> After searching for years and spending a lot of money for many products, this is the one that finally works for me.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to see a noticeable difference, and about 6 months of continued use to get optimum</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical at first, I have had excellent results, which I really noticed after about 8-10 weeks.</li>
            <li> Every two or three weeks I use a different (mild) shampoo and rich conditioning treatment, which helps.</li>
            <li> But overall I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I want to reduce breakage, a nice conditioner from Aveda will do the trick and costs less.</li>
            <li> I was using the Pure shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment from AVEDA</li>
            <li> they suggested the Pure line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s, with naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The texture of my fine, wavy (color treated) hair is about the same, but it is much thicker--especially around the hair line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any improvement in hair loss either.</li>
            <li> product very runny and slimey.</li>
            <li> After talking to the store associate, I decided to try the whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li> So so far it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like AVEDA products and was hoping that this product along with the conditioner and revitalizer would do what the reviewers said it would.  </li>
            <li> The whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> How ironic.</li>
            <li> Online or at the Aveda stores you can get the whole system for $110.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses just the shampoo and conditioner, and has noticed that there is not as much hair in the drain after a shower.</li>
            <li> One thing however is that you can get this product for much cheaper on the Aveda website than purchasing it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> and i must say that it really did make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin and it has really helped with breakouts n</li>
            <li> I do not lose as much hair while washing or brushing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely dislike it -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn clip in hair extensions before, trying to add volume and while it does just that, I&#x27;ve realized my issue with my hair really lies with my thinning hair line.</li>
            <li> After 12 weeks I really am seeing results.</li>
            <li> I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my hair at all, except that it just gets greasy immediately a few hours after applying the product.</li>
            <li> I went from wearing a wig due to such thinning hair problems, to loving my full head of naturally curly hair now!</li>
            <li> However, test results have shown that it absolutely can grow new hair!</li>
            <li> Aveda cannot legally print that it will grow new hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and the older I get, the thinner my hair line gets.</li>
            <li> My main reason for writing is the price.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I too, had high hopes for this product as I have used Aveda products for decades.</li>
            <li> It did help me with hair loss, but too high a price to pay</li>
            <li> There is constant new hair growth over my entire scalp which adds a lot more body and fullness.</li>
            <li> My review does not mean that Invati doesn&#x27;t work, my review is to say that Invati does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a modest investment, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re not out much money, and you never have to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I noticed on the packaging they show a woman of eastern (Indian?) descent, and they all seem to have amazing thick hair.</li>
            <li> As some reviews say, there is a strong medicinal smell to the spray for a few minutes after applying it to the scalp (and it seems very drying to my hair</li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair looking fuller and has felt significantly more healthy in the past few months.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new product, thinking that it would help thicken my hair; I have never had a problem with hair loss.  </li>
            <li> and I am growing new hair.</li>
            <li> Without going through the FDA as a pharmaceutical, a product cannot claim to grow new hair.</li>
            <li> I can see new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Invati system for 5 weeks now, and after just the first few days noticed a huge difference in my super thin, extremely fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week and since day one I noticed a difference, a little thinker, more manageable, I do have to combine it with a little drop of my Enjoy condionomg mask but</li>
            <li> and I it smells very natural -</li>
            <li> My hair just does not behave the same way it did with the first batch I bought/used.  </li>
            <li> You want to make sure that you&#x27;re spraying and massaging into the scalp TWICE a day, bc the ingredients are only active for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I have thick, but very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got the smaller bottles, not the full price, still, I am astounded at the tiny amount of product you receive.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and always had a ton fall out in the shower and my wide tooth comb was full after washing it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, super expensive though.</li>
            <li> but the lady at the store told me that the Invati was for women who were losing lots of hair on a daily basis and since I wasn&#x27;t losing hair she suggested the Pure line.  </li>
            <li> I will finish using the product and go back to Pure as it seemed to work</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> on the side of my head developed that was not there before I started using the product.</li>
            <li> so far I do like it, hairs is not as shiny tho</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews here are negative bc</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li> and i also like that it&#x27;s mostly naturally derived, but i have to say the price of the system is quite off-putting.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> They say that the product has natural ingredients but why is my scalp reacting this way.</li>
            <li> product, but you should probably buy it locally or directly from Aveda...</li>
            <li> So I bought this directly from the store of avanti got convinced by the girl at the store.</li>
            <li> Another scam based on this natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I decided to try aveda&#x27;s line because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would have to go as far as to say it reduced hair breakage by 90%+ within 5 days.</li>
            <li> When I finally got a new batch and started using it, my hair just has not behaved the same way as it did with the first supply.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look bad, in fact it&#x27;s long and healthy, the problem is I have an increasingly large bald spot on top of my head.</li>
            <li> but it is still higher than buying directly from Aveda and paying their shipping for a single bottle.</li>
            <li> colleague and I both started using this system at the same time, so we could monitor each other, and we BOTH see huge differences in the thickness and texture of our hair.</li>
            <li> Having spent WAY more money on wigs, weaves and other product that had less than stellar results, I&#x27;m sticking with AVEDA Invati now and forever!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser instructed me to use only enough to cover the first 1-2\\&quot; from the scalp.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the price and not worth the risk of potentially having your hair shed more!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat, straight and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Since I have switched to the Invanti shampoo I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower and very little comes out when I comb it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product system for the past month and have noticed a huge difference in my thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon.  </li>
            <li> The previous review by Giovanna is so right on...</li>
            <li> I do not lose a considerable amount of hair in the shower with regular shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I am barely losing any hair in the shower anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair, as did my parents, but after radiation therapy and chemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor the problem became much more severe.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair and am willing to give just about anything a try.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the review of the other user who said if it doesn&#x27;t work for you first.</li>
            <li> which other shampoos for thinning hair have done)Leaves it very manageable</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 weeks and do notice new hair growth but also notice that my hair is extremely dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Actually I am very surprised to see the wide array of reviews here, but perhaps this product just doesn&#x27;t work for some people.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is very drying to my 3b curls.</li>
            <li> My hair would also feel very greasy after a day which made it impossible to go more than one day between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> When I went to the AVEDA store in the mall and told them what type of hair I have (thin, fine hair)</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to make that investment, especially since I&#x27;m concerned about my color in addition to my hair being fine and thin.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Aveda products, but I have to say that this particular line is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed both in my own gullibility and the salon&#x27;s willingness to misrepresent this particular product line.</li>
            <li> My hair has gone from thick and curly to thin and straight as I have aged and now it is returning to its thicker and more natural curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired many other brands that worked temporarily if at all.</li>
            <li> Made my hair slightly thicker and very soft and shiny, even the ends.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past month, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much change</li>
            <li> but no matter how long I rinse it out, it still feels like their is shampoo left in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had oily hair since I was a teenager and always had to wash my hair every day or it would be a flat and listless.</li>
            <li> bought the system in it&#x27;s entirety, used it daily to the last drop, per their individual directions, and saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> My hair had become so thinned out that it lay flat</li>
            <li> A total waste of nearly $50.</li>
            <li> The nay-sayers can nay-say all day long, but this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would warn against this product, but if you are hellbent on trying it, know that if you experience an increase in hair shed... it won&#x27;t subside as long as you continue to use Invati.</li>
            <li> This product is less expensive if bought at an Aveda Salon and is guaranteed to be the authentic product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition and stronger and I am losing less hair, but it is expensive for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in the spray massage is ALCOHOL not good for dry scalp</li>
            <li> Also, I have been noticing a lot of new hair growing in and my hair feeling thicker then usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old white male and have had thin hair since middle school.</li>
            <li> (I used the shampoo only, as I do not normally use/need conditioner or other</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brush my hair to the side without it looking like a big chunk of hair is missing from the left side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was THICK, vibrant and lots of it.</li>
            <li> It worked immediately, growing new thick hair.</li>
            <li> so I try hard to put it directly on my scalp and then massage it in).</li>
            <li> it looks like its still wet</li>
            <li> It is an expensive product, but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair making it rough and wiry.</li>
            <li> My hair has really started to thin over the years and when I saw the Invati line, I was hopeful that by using it my hair would look and feel fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> It got to the point that my hair was coming out in alarming amounts.</li>
            <li> My ponytail is nowhere near as thick as it was when I was \\&quot;young.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> At week 5 I have noticed a drier scalp, not sure if it&#x27;s the time of year (January) or the product, as I&#x27;ve always had oily hair, not dry.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth the hefty price tag and does not live up to its&#x27; or Aveda&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that even a drugstore shampoo works so much better than this.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair had stopped thinning, and was visibly fuller after using this product, and the other two parts of the system, for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I may be updating due to results.&lt;br /&gt;Update: In my estimation, this product did nothing but flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a very long way.</li>
            <li> So even though I have new hair growth at the scalp the rest of my strands are broken and frizzy from the dryness.  </li>
            <li> It was so dry that it actually dried before i blew it</li>
            <li> The benefit of Invati (which means Invigorate and infuse strength in Sanskrit) is that it is all botanical and plant based, and you won&#x27;t get the negative side effects such as impotence as you would with rogane.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and tends to fall out with every shower, but  last year it got much worse -</li>
            <li> It has calmed my scalp and I would hands down recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that after the first wash, my hair felt and looked the same, and in addition, felt weighted down with styling product (although I don&#x27;t use any).</li>
            <li> I rated this product slightly lower because of the price.  </li>
            <li> I do find less hair in my comb.  </li>
            <li> My hair loss is a lot less.</li>
            <li> word of a lie, my hair fell out much less within the weekBy two weeks</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker and I am losing less.</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous -160&#x27;$ for 3 tiny bottles !</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but I when I went and got my hair cut by the same stylist who has been cutting my hair for ten years</li>
            <li> My hair was unmanageable afterwards, dry, and dull.</li>
            <li> As I said about the conditioner, it may be a little pricey but</li>
            <li> I rarely pay attention to ads, but my hair loss was so bad (and I have used aveda products before), that I decided what the heck, I&#x27;ll try the Invati</li>
            <li> Opulent of times don&#x27;t use it, it will only get worse</li>
            <li> I have used Aveda products for a few years on and off.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like it has broken off everywhere in the middle of my head.  </li>
            <li> We will see in a few weeks if I can give it the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When people you see everyday are commenting on how fuller you thicker your hair looks...</li>
            <li> The Scalp Revitalizer doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy, oily, greasy..</li>
            <li> You can now actually see my scalp--that&#x27;s how thin my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> however, i wasted the sample because i had to shampoo my hair twice; it doesn&#x27;t lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue using it for a few months and see what the difference is in that time</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to shed less, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> Girls I know using it who it worked for wash and ahampoo their hair at least every other day.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s more proof - I just ran out a week and a half ago, and my hair is already falling out again - horribly.</li>
            <li> Be very wary purchasing any profession salon product from anyone other than a salon professional.</li>
            <li> Why not show someone with thin European hair, before and after to make it at least a challenge?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I could use without leaving my thin hair heavy or greasy other than Invati.</li>
            <li> have used Aveda shampoos and conditioners in the past, but I will not buy them anymore.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this product - this is the 2nd bottle I have purchased - it is alittle expensive -</li>
            <li> I had gotten the trial versions for a small price.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it works or not because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li> I was noticing some thinning in the past couple years, from what my hair used to be.</li>
            <li> It is the worst shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find a shampoo/conditioner that does not aggravate it.  </li>
            <li> Hope this review helps you save your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Invati system--shampoo, conditioner and scalp spray as directed for a year now (with intermittent  breaks when I travel because it is hard to pack everything).  </li>
            <li> Such a disappointment for the amount of money this was.</li>
            <li> My hair (shaft) is thick, but I was losing a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> While a very expensive product, this shampoo puts body in your hair that lasts for several days.  </li>
            <li> Very slick marketing and advertising that duped this consumer.  </li>
            <li> I first tried Revivogen Shampoo and Conditioner and HATED it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire system (which is very expensive) for a month now &amp; don&#x27;t seem to notice a difference in my strand thickness.</li>
            <li> As the years piled on my hair became weak dull and sparse.</li>
            <li> Rogaine grew thin hairs hard to notice.</li>
            <li> but for a small bottle this is way too expensive for 6.7oz.</li>
            <li> I have used nyaxin in the past and was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I am an exclusively Aveda user and have been for many years, and this stuff is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money or time I had to wait for it...super disappointing.</li>
            <li> but thinning hair is a reality and a tough one</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost two months since I discovered the bald patch, and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse, the bald patch hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product because I do not want to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> However, after using this shampoo for approximately 1 week, I was finding my hair all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Boy did I get a rude awakening when I started noticing increased hair loss!!</li>
            <li> Now that is weird because that was NEVER a problem before.  </li>
            <li> The invati system (shampoo, conditioner, exfoliating spray) is ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Used both the shampoo and conditioner twice and had horrible pain radiating from both sides of my temples to the back of my scalp.</li>
            <li> , sorry to read the reviews where it did not help.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the seller ad is wrong: meaning shampoo and conditioner for $45</li>
            <li> hair felt dirty after using shampoo and conditioner did not help.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but after using this line of product for a couple of months even my hairdresser who does not sell this product noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> dont know or care if hair is fuller or thicker because it smells so bad</li>
            <li> - it was so thin, it was horrifying!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the Invati product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> bad product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a year, my scalp broke out in an insane itch.</li>
            <li> My hair was in the worst condition it has ever been and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is less expensive if bought at an Aveda Salon and is guaranteed to be the authentic product.  If an Aveda product is not purchased from an Aveda Salon, it cannot be guaranteed to be authentic and could be counterfeit, expired, or a fake product in the Aveda bottle.  Be very wary purchasing any profession salon product from anyone other than a salon professional.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for hours and it&#x27;s a great feel</li>
            <li> Nice fast shipment. Good product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this shampoo but no matter how long I rinse it out, it still feels like their is shampoo left in my hair. It dries so greasy it looks like its still wet or like I didn&#x27;t rinse it all out. Same goes for the conditioner. Anyone else experience this? I don&#x27;t really see any improvement in hair loss either.</li>
            <li> Love Aveda products but for a small bottle this is way too expensive for 6.7oz. of shampoo for almost 30.00 dollars. but I do love all Aveda products</li>
            <li> Actually I am very surprised to see the wide array of reviews here, but perhaps this product just doesn&#x27;t work for some people. After all, everyone&#x27;s skin and hair quality are different. For me, this product changed my life. I went from wearing a wig due to such thinning hair problems, to loving my full head of naturally curly hair now! It took a few weeks to see a noticeable difference, and about 6 months of continued use to get optimum results.&lt;br /&gt;A colleague and I both started using this system at the same time, so we could monitor each other, and we BOTH see huge differences in the thickness and texture of our hair. Is it worth it to try to see if it&#x27;s for you? I think so. It&#x27;s a modest investment, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re not out much money, and you never have to purchase it again. If it does work, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Having spent WAY more money on wigs, weaves and other product that had less than stellar results, I&#x27;m sticking with AVEDA Invati now and forever!</li>
            <li> bad product!!!!!!! rip off!!!!!!!  product very runny and slimey.</li>
            <li> After talking to the store associate, I decided to try the whole Invati system.  At the register, I gulped at the total price for the three bottles, but went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having paid so much, I used the whole bottle even though I didn&#x27;t love the shampoo or conditioner.  I saw no evidence of improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I have male pattern baldness and a hair dresser told me to use invati. It worked immediately, growing new thick hair. Rogaine grew thin hairs hard to notice. There is no hair in the shower drain after three weeks. I am a swimmer and it leaves my hair soft. I use the shampoo and conditioner on Monday and Fridays.</li>
            <li> I kept using invati shampoo and conditioner even after 2 weeks hoping my hair will get adjusted to it&lt;br /&gt;I lost hair like I&#x27;ve never seen before .After spending 50 dollars I am so disappointed that even a drugstore shampoo works so much better than this.I totally agree with the review of the other user who said if it doesn&#x27;t work for you first. Opulent of times don&#x27;t use it, it will only get worse</li>
            <li> I have used Aveda products for a few years on and off. I have had oily hair since I was a teenager and always had to wash my hair every day or it would be a flat and listless. I started using Pure shampoo and conditioner and really liked the way my hair felt. It was good for color treated hair and helped to keep my color longer since I wasn&#x27;t washing it every day. I decided to try the Invanti shampoo because of an ad I saw about it. I have fine hair buy have a lot of it. I have pretty long hair and always had a ton fall out in the shower and my wide tooth comb was full after washing it as well. Since I have switched to the Invanti shampoo I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower and very little comes out when I comb it. I know it is working for me because I a thicker pony tail and more hair to put up. It is an expensive product, but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new product, thinking that it would help thicken my hair; I have never had a problem with hair loss.  I started using the system in January, 2013.  After using the system for 5 months, I noticed no change in the thickness of my hair, so I didn&#x27;t purchase anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two months after I finished using it, however, a huge bald spot (perhaps 2\\&quot; in diameter!) on the side of my head developed that was not there before I started using the product. Nothing else in my life changed to precipitate this sudden loss of hair (i.e. stress, illness, medication, etc.). It&#x27;s been almost two months since I discovered the bald patch, and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse, the bald patch hasn&#x27;t gone away. I made an appointment to see my doctor, who has now referred me to a dermatologist to see if this damage can be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this product zero stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Aveda shampoos and conditioners in the past, but I will not buy them anymore.  And I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> While a very expensive product, this shampoo puts body in your hair that lasts for several days.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the Invati product.  I have thin/fine hair and was told that this will help with hair growth.  I have been using this product for 8 weeks and do notice new hair growth but also notice that my hair is extremely dry and unmanageable.  My hair looks like it has broken off everywhere in the middle of my head.  So even though I have new hair growth at the scalp the rest of my strands are broken and frizzy from the dryness.  I stopped using the product because I do not want to make it worse.  Such a disappointment for the amount of money this was.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product O stars I would.  It is the worst shampoo for fine hair.  I have fine, thin hair.  I do not lose a considerable amount of hair in the shower with regular shampooing.  However, after using this shampoo for approximately 1 week, I was finding my hair all over the bathroom.  Used with the conditioner, I could not even get a comb through my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while.  I have thinning hair and it&#x27;s been great!  My hair looks fuller now!!</li>
            <li> The previous review by Giovanna is so right on...I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week and since day one I noticed a difference, a little thinker, more manageable, I do have to combine it with a little drop of my Enjoy condionomg mask but so far I do like it, hairs is not as shiny tho but I can use the Aveda light elements serum for that. I guess you do have to use other products to get the perfect look but I love the smell and I am not losing as much hair which is great because that is scary. So so far it&#x27;s worth every penny. We will see in a few weeks if I can give it the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like AVEDA products and was hoping that this product along with the conditioner and revitalizer would do what the reviewers said it would.  Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference and I have been using all three products.  I was using the Pure shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment from AVEDA and I felt that product was more helpful to my hair than Invati.  When I went to the AVEDA store in the mall and told them what type of hair I have (thin, fine hair) they suggested the Pure line.  I really wanted to try the Invati line because I felt my hair was thinning on top but the lady at the store told me that the Invati was for women who were losing lots of hair on a daily basis and since I wasn&#x27;t losing hair she suggested the Pure line.  I used it and was happy.  Still a stubborn part of me thought that the Invati products might help make my hair look fuller on top so I purchased Invati on Amazon against the suggestion from the AVEDA people.  I have used it religiously and have not noticed any difference in my hair except to say that I see hair on the sink now as if my hair is falling off.  Now that is weird because that was NEVER a problem before.  I will finish using the product and go back to Pure as it seemed to work and Invati does not.  My review does not mean that Invati doesn&#x27;t work, my review is to say that Invati does not work for me.  Its best you try it if you are losing lots of hair and be the judge.  Others seem to have good things to say so it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair had stopped thinning, and was visibly fuller after using this product, and the other two parts of the system, for a couple of months.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months, and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product, super expensive though.</li>
            <li> I too, had high hopes for this product as I have used Aveda products for decades. In spite of my skepticism I purchased the 3-product system after having it strongly recommended by the Aveda salesperson - claiming that it was a &#x27;&#x27;growth stimulating&#x27; system. I had second thoughts about such lofty claims and attempted to return the products the following day, where I was assured, again, by yet another salesperson that the Invati line was, indeed, a &#x27;regrowth&#x27; product. I am disappointed both in my own gullibility and the salon&#x27;s willingness to misrepresent this particular product line. After giving it ample time to &#x27;work&#x27; I had to accept the fact that my hair was in better shape before use. I would recommend this product only if you have the budget to experiment.</li>
            <li> The invati system (shampoo, conditioner, exfoliating spray) is ridiculously expensive but I found it actually worked. I have always had thin hair, as did my parents, but after radiation therapy and chemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor the problem became much more severe. I don&#x27;t love the strong herbal fragrance of the product but it leaves my hair clean and soft and it has dramatically reduced the hair loss I was experiencing and I am growing new hair. I will continue to use it while therapy continues. I have used nyaxin in the past and was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic about this shampoo. I tried it twice, and it did not perform as well for volume on my fine, colored hair as Aveda Color Conserve. It could be that I needed to use it longer AND/OR use the 3-product &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; to get results. (I used the shampoo only, as I do not normally use/need conditioner or other products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go for the short term and keep using a shampoo that works TODAY. Also, I was concerned about the amount of product required by the &amp;#34;system,&amp;#34; as my hair is oily. I have found that the more conditioner/product I use, the more I need to shampoo, and consequently, the faster my color fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that if I were to use the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for some extended amount if time, I may get results. I just don&#x27;t want to make that investment, especially since I&#x27;m concerned about my color in addition to my hair being fine and thin.</li>
            <li> With all these great reviews it must be a good product however for me it was a waste, I have thinning gray hair and after using this shampoo and the conditioner I find some hair in in my brush and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it will burn like no other shampoo I ever used.</li>
            <li> makes my hair thicker</li>
            <li> I started using this just 3 weeks ago in the hopes that it would thicken my hair. Boy did I get a rude awakening when I started noticing increased hair loss!! Discontinued use immediately and went back to my organic shampoo and conditioner. Totally not worth the price and not worth the risk of potentially having your hair shed more! Avoid this product line!!</li>
            <li> I like and use this product regularly.  My hair does seem to shed less, but I&#x27;m not sure.  What I&#x27;d really like to know is why amazon has a 6.7 oz bottle of the shampoo for $41 when Aveda&#x27;s own website sells the same size bottle for $28 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The whole Invati system.  It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning and now it&#x27;s getting thicker.  Much better condition</li>
            <li> Up front: I used the entire system. I was very disappointed as I am an exclusively Aveda user and have been for many years, and this stuff is very expensive. I found it very drying to the point of more breakage. How ironic.The packaging never claims it will &amp;#34;grow more hair&amp;#34;. It says that it will reduce hair loss by 33%, insert asterisk here, and the fine print below says &amp;#34;due to breakage&amp;#34;. It is not a hair growth system, so anyone who compares it to Rogaine did not read the label. My hair was unmanageable afterwards, dry, and dull. I have fine hair, color treated. I noticed on the packaging they show a woman of eastern (Indian?) descent, and they all seem to have amazing thick hair. Why not show someone with thin European hair, before and after to make it at least a challenge? Not impressed at all. When I want to reduce breakage, a nice conditioner from Aveda will do the trick and costs less. Meh.</li>
            <li> Aveda cannot legally print that it will grow new hair. They can say that it will reduce breakage. Without going through the FDA as a pharmaceutical, a product cannot claim to grow new hair. However, test results have shown that it absolutely can grow new hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair making it rough and wiry. Not a big fan of the smell either.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner after using Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva line for almost a year, even though the price was blow to my wallet. My hair has really started to thin over the years and when I saw the Invati line, I was hopeful that by using it my hair would look and feel fuller and thicker. I was disappointed that after the first wash, my hair felt and looked the same, and in addition, felt weighted down with styling product (although I don&#x27;t use any). I kept an open mind, thinking that it would take some time for the product to work. I noticed more and more hair in the drain catcher each day and no improvement in the look or feel of my hair. My hair would also feel very greasy after a day which made it impossible to go more than one day between shampoos. This is not worth the hefty price tag and does not live up to its&#x27; or Aveda&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> dont know or care if hair is fuller or thicker because it smells so bad --ii know it is spices, but smells like hospital antiseptic</li>
            <li> After using this product for a year, my scalp broke out in an insane itch. Went to dermatologist and had ecema of the scalp caused by these producs.  It did help me with hair loss, but too high a price to pay</li>
            <li> As I said about the conditioner, it may be a little pricey but well worth it.  I have psoriasis on my scalp and it is hard to find a shampoo/conditioner that does not aggravate it.  This doesn&#x27;t and makes my hair look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> The invati system is a wonderful botanical system to keep the hair that you already have, and making it stronger. Many of the reviews here are negative bc it&#x27;s not being used properly. The system consists of the shampoo, conditioner, and the scalp revitalizer. Each does something specific to target the issue. The exfoliating shampoo deep cleanses the scalp to remove debris and buildup in the follicle. The conditioner has clay in it, which expands in the hair and helps to improve the elasticity. Finally, the Revitalizer uses turmeric and ginseng to promote blood circulation in the scalp, so the hair can grow. You want to make sure that you&#x27;re spraying and massaging into the scalp TWICE a day, bc the ingredients are only active for 12 hours. If you only use one product, you won&#x27;t see the desired results because when it was clinically tried, it was as a SYSTEM. Online or at the Aveda stores you can get the whole system for $110. The shampoo &amp; Conditioner are $25 each and the scalp spay is $60. The ingredients are purchased from an organic farm in India. Also, one can see results between the 6th and 8th week, with optimal results at the 12th week. By then, the scalp will be balanced. The benefit of Invati (which means Invigorate and infuse strength in Sanskrit) is that it is all botanical and plant based, and you won&#x27;t get the negative side effects such as impotence as you would with rogane.</li>
            <li> When people you see everyday are commenting on how fuller you thicker your hair looks... What&#x27;s not to love... ? I absolutely LOVE this system. I&#x27;m 28 before age 21 my hair was THICK, vibrant and lots of it. As the years piled on my hair became weak dull and sparse. I&#x27;ve tired many other brands that worked temporarily if at all. Invati has made my hair thicker, my color has retuned (which always received compliments and had never been dyed) and its been growing back. It&#x27;s even cured my oily scalp. I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I could use without leaving my thin hair heavy or greasy other than Invati. The Scalp Revitalizer doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy, oily, greasy..what have you... I fricken love this system!!! I guess it&#x27;s different for everyone. And while it&#x27;s targeted at females... Im a male. Girls I know using it who it worked for wash and ahampoo their hair at least every other day. And you gotta use the Revitalizer... I saw results without it but with it they improved even more... Love it...</li>
            <li> I rated this product slightly lower because of the price.  I do find less hair in my comb.  Be prepared that this product will dry out your scalp and use a good conditioner.  My hair is in better condition and stronger and I am losing less hair, but it is expensive for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this product - this is the 2nd bottle I have purchased - it is alittle expensive - but I like the way it works on my hair - it does not alter the texture of my hair (which other shampoos for thinning hair have done)Leaves it very manageable and I it smells very natural - which I like- I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> Here is my story:  During January of 2012, I purchased the Invati Shampoo and conditioner, and I used it 2-3 times per week.  My thinning hair became fuller and just beautiful.  I thought this was the miracle solution I had been waiting for!  When I ran out of it, it was sold out everywhere and could not buy it for almost 3 months.  When I finally got a new batch and started using it, my hair just has not behaved the same way as it did with the first supply.  My hair became thinner from the roots to the ends.  It&#x27;s almost if they changed the contents of the product when they re-stocked it in stores and on line.  My hair just does not behave the same way it did with the first batch I bought/used.  You can now actually see my scalp--that&#x27;s how thin my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Aveda. I had gotten the trial versions for a small price. I received my purchase yesterday and I am none too pleased about the size of the bottles. I got the smaller bottles, not the full price, still, I am astounded at the tiny amount of product you receive. Time will tell if this product makes a difference to my thinning hair. The 3 stars is for the value to money regarding size. I may be updating due to results.&lt;br /&gt;Update: In my estimation, this product did nothing but flatten my hair. It did not help with thinning. It smells good and that&#x27;s about it. Nice if it works for some, but not for me. A total waste of nearly $50. I did not bother to return it as the shipping would be on me. 5/20/15</li>
            <li> I searched for this product and when I found it I was so excited.  I wanted it in hand and not order from a website, so I could use immediately.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it my hair was like straw.  It was so dry that it actually dried before i blew it out.&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use it because the web reviews said give it time.  My hair was in the worst condition it has ever been and it still recovering.&lt;br /&gt;TOTAL WAIST OF $$$</li>
            <li> ...and when I saw that my hair, curly but fine to begin with, was beginning to become even thinner, I panicked and bought the Invati system.  The nay-sayers can nay-say all day long, but this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> This product recovered my hair!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair preservation system. I use all three products daily, and I have definitely noticed a difference in the thickness and fullness of my hair. At first I was skeptical, but I when I went and got my hair cut by the same stylist who has been cutting my hair for ten years she asked what shampoo I was using cause she could see a definite difference in my hair. After that I was convinced that the changes I was seeing were real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells and feels on my scalp. A little seems to go a very long way. My girlfriend uses just the shampoo and conditioner, and has noticed that there is not as much hair in the drain after a shower. I guess everyone has different results, but I am 100% happy with this product. One thing however is that you can get this product for much cheaper on the Aveda website than purchasing it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old white male and have had thin hair since middle school. It doesn&#x27;t look bad, in fact it&#x27;s long and healthy, the problem is I have an increasingly large bald spot on top of my head. I believe this bald spot got bigger because I wore a Kevlar helmet (Army) for a number of years and hats as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the system in it&#x27;s entirety, used it daily to the last drop, per their individual directions, and saw absolutely no improvement. In fact, I think my hair is thinner than ever. I can&#x27;t brush my hair to the side without it looking like a big chunk of hair is missing from the left side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blowdry, hot iron, or anything to my hair. I just use Aveda products and morroccan oil...which I love. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I will continue to by the mens pomade, but my next shampoo purchase will not be the invati system. What a waste.</li>
            <li> i received a sample from a local salon. i used it with the conditioner and i must say that it really did make my hair thicker. however, i wasted the sample because i had to shampoo my hair twice; it doesn&#x27;t lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do love the spicy scent and i also like that it&#x27;s mostly naturally derived, but i have to say the price of the system is quite off-putting. it&#x27;s a huge expense. however i probably will try the system one time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  My hair (shaft) is thick, but I was losing a lot of hair.  My ponytail is nowhere near as thick as it was when I was \\&quot;young.\\&quot;  I am barely losing any hair in the shower anymore.  I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner, only the shampoo and spray.  I might not buy the spray again once this bottle runs out.  I have always heard that you shampoo for your scalp and condition for your hair.  So, I need this shampoo to prevent hair loss and I use anti-frizz conditioner from Biolage.  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Invati system for 5 weeks now, and after just the first few days noticed a huge difference in my super thin, extremely fine hair.  It was noticably thicker and fuller.  At week 5 I have noticed a drier scalp, not sure if it&#x27;s the time of year (January) or the product, as I&#x27;ve always had oily hair, not dry.  Will continue to use, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Smells nice, does a good job cleaning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s not a hair growth system as the salesperson implied.  If you look at the bottle, in fine print, it states that it helps reduce hair loss from breakage.  Invati does nothing to stimulate hair growth, nothing for you to keep follicles, it only helps prevent hair loss from breakage.  Very slick marketing and advertising that duped this consumer.  Hope this review helps you save your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a month ago. I gave it some time before I left a review to see some results. It works. My hair loss is a lot less. It would come out in clumps in the shower, and now it comes out in strands. I can see new growth. The only down side is that it is very drying to my 3b curls. I use briogeo as the conditioner instead of the recommended one. It has calmed my scalp and I would hands down recommend this product.  I noticed it also removes product build up.</li>
            <li> Used both the shampoo and conditioner twice and had horrible pain radiating from both sides of my temples to the back of my scalp. They say that the product has natural ingredients but why is my scalp reacting this way.</li>
            <li> The person who cuts my hair asked me to try this shampoo and conditioner. She explained that as you age the hair follicle reduces its diameter and the result is thinner hair. This shampoo exfoliates your scalp and cleans out the pores and helps promote healthier hair. My hair has gone from thick and curly to thin and straight as I have aged and now it is returning to its thicker and more natural curl. Using the shampoo my hair feels fuller and thicker. I use it with the conditioner and I think the combination has created good results. I will continue using it for a few months and see what the difference is in that time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here includes shipping but it is still higher than buying directly from Aveda and paying their shipping for a single bottle. I like the product but I will also look at prices from various suppliers. I recommend the product to you.</li>
            <li> At $45, they are charging $20 more than they charge in the salons. My local salon and the Aveda website have it for $24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but you should probably buy it locally or directly from Aveda...it will save you a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This product along with the conditioner has improved the way my hair feels, it really feels clean, full bodied and looks healthy. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I started sing the Invati shampoo and conditioner at the suggestion of my stylist!  I have very fine gray hair and this makes it full with a beautiful shine!  I also have combination skin and it has really helped with breakouts n my scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s, with naturally curly, fine hair. My hair is long and tends to fall out with every shower, but  last year it got much worse - It got to the point that my hair was coming out in alarming amounts. Literally two full handfulls per shower! My hair had become so thinned out that it lay flat - it was so thin, it was horrifying! That was when the first Invati ads came on TV. I rarely pay attention to ads, but my hair loss was so bad (and I have used aveda products before), that I decided what the heck, I&#x27;ll try the Invati products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No word of a lie, my hair fell out much less within the weekBy two weeks I was losing almost no hair at all. Next thing you know I had short fuzzy hairs all over my head - it was all growing back! I used the Invati shampoo, conditioner, and Aveda&#x27;s damage remedy through two sets of bottles and it worked all along. Here&#x27;s more proof - I just ran out a week and a half ago, and my hair is already falling out again - horribly. I came on here to buy it again asap and decided to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think. It&#x27;s worth trying. It doesn&#x27;t sound like it works for everyone - maybe some people just want thicker hair, and are not losing hair. This really truly stopped me from losing my hair! I am so glad I tried it and so grateful that it exists!</li>
            <li> It worked well for me.  Made my hair slightly thicker and very soft and shiny, even the ends.  For me  it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but after using this line of product for a couple of months even my hairdresser who does not sell this product noticed the difference. My hair is thicker and I am losing less. I absolutely love the results! I use it very frugally because of the cost, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> yes, helping my hair loss!</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it works or not because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I had to wash my hair again because I couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> Used it once--had more hair loss after shampooing then I&#x27;ve had in years---do not buy this product! I will not use this shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product system for the past month and have noticed a huge difference in my thin/fine hair. I do not lose as much hair while washing or brushing. Also, I have been noticing a lot of new hair growing in and my hair feeling thicker then usual. I also have color treated hair and dont notice any change in my color.  I recommend this to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works.  My hair is thinning and is currently in repair.  I used the shampoo and after 2 months noticed 1.5 inches of hair growing back.</li>
            <li> Grainy feel to hair, medicinal smell...hair felt dirty after using shampoo and conditioner did not help. Had to wash again in morning with different shampo and will stick to it in future (Nioxin).</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in the spray massage is ALCOHOL not good for dry scalp</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past month, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much change</li>
            <li> I have been using the Invati system--shampoo, conditioner and scalp spray as directed for a year now (with intermittent  breaks when I travel because it is hard to pack everything).  Although I was skeptical at first, I have had excellent results, which I really noticed after about 8-10 weeks. The texture of my fine, wavy (color treated) hair is about the same, but it is much thicker--especially around the hair line. There is constant new hair growth over my entire scalp which adds a lot more body and fullness. As some reviews say, there is a strong medicinal smell to the spray for a few minutes after applying it to the scalp (and it seems very drying to my hair so I try hard to put it directly on my scalp and then massage it in). Every two or three weeks I use a different (mild) shampoo and rich conditioning treatment, which helps. From what the reviews say, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but I am delighted with the results and have recommended it to 3 friends who are also quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Invati system for 6 months and have experienced no difference.  A good conditioner will help keep you from loosing hair.  I also did notice that my highlights were turned orange.  The tonic will help give you a bit of lift at the roots, but so will any good mousse or root lifter.  I am a regular user of Aveda products, but I have to say that this particular line is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Did nothing !!! I have very fine blond hair, wants to see some results in terms of filling in on the temples . So I bought this directly from the store of avanti got convinced by the girl at the store. Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my hair at all, except that it just gets greasy immediately a few hours after applying the product. I absolutely dislike it - doesn&#x27;t work The price is ridiculous -160&#x27;$ for 3 tiny bottles ! Another scam based on this natural ingredients bs.. Will not be repurchasing</li>
            <li> This shampoo has cleared the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; I seemed to have and tried so many products to combat but this is excellent for that problem. The shampoo came early which thrilled me so I could get to the results quicker.</li>
            <li> I guess it is me...the shampoo smells great and I love the way my hair feels and acts after washing with this shampoo....but thinning hair is a reality and a tough one</li>
            <li> Have been using this product (plus conditioner and revitalizer) for almost 3 months now. I have thick, but very fine hair. I was noticing some thinning in the past couple years, from what my hair used to be. My hair dresser instructed me to use only enough to cover the first 1-2\\&quot; from the scalp. Shampoo gives an excellent lather every time. Conditioner is wonderful; it never makes my hair greasy. After massaging in the the revitalizer I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there (in a good way). My hair always feels silky and clean. I have noticed my hair looking fuller and has felt significantly more healthy in the past few months. I first tried Revivogen Shampoo and Conditioner and HATED it. The shampoo made my hair feel stripped, then (even w/ the smallest amount) the conditioner made my hair feel as though I dumped oil on it. So, in comparison at least, Invati is wonderful! I&#x27;m going to buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire system (which is very expensive) for a month now &amp; don&#x27;t seem to notice a difference in my strand thickness. After using the entire system for 2 weeks, my highlights have turned orange/copper. Use caution if you have highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair and am willing to give just about anything a try. I&#x27;ve worn clip in hair extensions before, trying to add volume and while it does just that, I&#x27;ve realized my issue with my hair really lies with my thinning hair line. I&#x27;m 33 and the older I get, the thinner my hair line gets. I decided to try aveda&#x27;s line because of its natural ingredients. The price is up there which almost had me giving up after just one months use, but I decided to give it 12 full weeks just to see if I saw results. After about 8 weeks I started noticing fuller baby hairs around my hairline but thought this was just me wanting to see results. After 12 weeks I really am seeing results. My scalp tingles throughout the day and I love it because I can actually feel it working. I don&#x27;t have Kim Kardashian hair, nor will I ever, but I am thrilled with he results!  My hairline is filling in and that is exactly what I was hoping for!!</li>
            <li> After searching for years and spending a lot of money for many products, this is the one that finally works for me.  I recommend it, sorry to read the reviews where it did not help.  My main reason for writing is the price.  On the Aveda web, the shampoo and conditioner are $25 each, same size .  Also, check local hair salons, one might sell Aveda..  Maybe the seller ad is wrong: meaning shampoo and conditioner for $45</li>
            <li> Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon.  My hair was rebounding from a health situation, and I was told that this would help create a perfect environment for my hair regrowth.  I stuck with it for about 6 weeks (following directions to the letter) regardless of the fact that my hair shed increased.  I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system.  After a very obvious thinning spot occurred, I stop using the product.  Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would warn against this product, but if you are hellbent on trying it, know that if you experience an increase in hair shed... it won&#x27;t subside as long as you continue to use Invati.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat, straight and thin hair. I also experienced a lot of breakage before using this product. I would have to go as far as to say it reduced hair breakage by 90%+ within 5 days. My hair feels a lot fuller and haealthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints would be price and that my hair actually gets frizzy with humidity! But overall I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair...no difference. Definitely not worth the money or time I had to wait for it...super disappointing.</li>
