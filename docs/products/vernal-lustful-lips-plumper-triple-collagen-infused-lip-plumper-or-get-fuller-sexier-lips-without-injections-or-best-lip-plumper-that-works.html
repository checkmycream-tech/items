            <li>This is the best thing ever!</li>

            <li>I love the way it made my lips feel!</li>
            <li>As a gloss, this is nice.  </li>
            <li>Makes your lips look nice and plump.</li>
            <li>I honestly make sure that I bring this lip gloss/plumper with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>Have always wanted to have that nice &amp;#34;pillow lips&amp;#34;, and this product helps me achieve that iconic look.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I like the results I’ve seen and bought two more to keep handy.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t cost prohibitive I would have simply given it to my many twenty to thirty something nieces because they have always raided my cosmetics for the best things.</li>
            <li>I do notice a minimum fullness in my top lip.</li>
            <li>I love that I can top any lip liner without smudging it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did because as soon as I opened my package I had to try it out.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it does what it says in terms of filling out your lips more than they already are.</li>

            <li>Love putting this over my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on many products, I chose this one because of the number of reviews.</li>
            <li>If you use this every day for a week, you won&#x27;t notice the effects becoming stronger or working better...</li>
            <li>i also noticed that my lips were nice and full...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on Vernal&#x27;s site looking for more products that fit my taste.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for something to make them look more full.</li>
            <li>With continuous wear, my lips look more full and smooth.</li>
            <li>The liquid went on smoothly and gave my lips a discreet shine.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to a friend or anyone who loves lip products!!!</li>
            <li>Def worth the investment!</li>
            <li>It is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; hue to it.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a sample with my other order and I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li>I have ordered a few more just to make sure I have one in all of my handbags.</li>
            <li>product tingles and the first time you use it</li>
            <li>This product not only gives me a more plump look, it keeps my lips feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of their products like Repair Care Eye Gel, which I love as well.  </li>
            <li>However, I would have been just as better off buying a generic drug store plumper because this has no noticeable results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, as you would apply any lip gloss, you would do the same procedure with this lip plumper product.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely cumulative effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li>These is one product that really does what it say.  </li>
            <li>Very thankful to have discovered these products.  </li>
            <li>Seems the older we get, the less lip we have, unless it is a verbal zinger aimed at a deserving fool.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive lips, and many plumpers tend to dry and chap my lips.</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating which is a huge plus for me because I have extremely sensitive skin especially around my lips!</li>
            <li>This product not only plumps but also makes the lips more red and glossy!</li>
            <li>It is just a very clear, very shiny product.</li>
            <li>It is just a very clear, very shiny product.</li>
            <li>The plumping is very noticeable for the first two hours, after the third hour it starts to fade!</li>
            <li>This feels cool to my lips and helps protect my lips from getting to dry.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my back pocket.</li>
            <li>I have found that if you keep your lips very moisturized for about two weeks prior to using the Plumper that it helps with the stinging and even gives them a little more pinkish hue.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear it over lipstick, lip stains, etc - there used to be a tiny stinging sensation when I first applied it, but I no longer feel that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>is my experience so far.</li>
            <li>price was much more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on anything lip related, but in all honesty, I&#x27;ve only ever purchased lipsticks and things like Carmex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and Natural Ice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap lip plumper in the past and wanted to step it up.</li>
            <li>and I agree with other people&#x27;s posts about applying to dry and clean lips.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much plumping, and the gloss doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that within a few weeks of applying this and rubbing it (a little bit above the natural lip line and on the lips) at night before bedtime, does give me a plumper more moisturized lips in the AM.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I try to decide whether I&#x27;ll ever do that again, I want to keep the new look for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m using this only on bare, naked lips.</li>
            <li>I have relatively thin lips, so any plumping effect would be easy to see.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think I just had a particularly bad experience because my skin is very sensitive due to having to take chemo-therapy. I doubt, from prior experience, that it would have happened otherwise. If it weren&#x27;t cost prohibitive I would have simply given it to my many twenty to thirty something nieces because they have always raided my cosmetics for the best things.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product for the price. It did not plump my lips. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This plumper is not going to give you the results injections would but you should not expect that. What this does do is plump my lips to a noticeable fullness, lasts maybe a couple hours. I have noticed that within a few weeks of applying this and rubbing it (a little bit above the natural lip line and on the lips) at night before bedtime, does give me a plumper more moisturized lips in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience so far. It may not work the same for you, everybody&#x27;s different!</li>
            <li> As a gloss, this is nice.  I don&#x27;t see much plumping, and the gloss doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  It is too expensive for what it does, so I will probably not get it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hope that a lip plumper would help with my disappearing upper lip. Seems the older we get, the less lip we have, unless it is a verbal zinger aimed at a deserving fool. The liquid went on smoothly and gave my lips a discreet shine. I could feel a tingling on my skin, but waited to give it time to work. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. I was still feeling the tingle as I rushed to the mirror for the reveal. Nothing. No plumping, no increase to my shriveled upper lip. Phooey! I give this a 2 star because it works as a lip gloss and it stays on long enough to keep my lips moist. But as a plumper - I am beginning to wonder if there is such a thing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks. While there is a definite sensation after applying, the plumping quality is less than expected. I do notice a minimum fullness in my top lip. Not a lot a change in the bottom lip. I will keep using it until the bottle is gone to see if multiple daily applications improve the fullness of my lips.</li>
            <li> I honestly make sure that I bring this lip gloss/plumper with me everywhere. I&#x27;ve been looking for a gloss to make my lips pop and not look greasy. This is the best thing ever! I love that it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my back pocket. I love that I can top any lip liner without smudging it. I&#x27;ve been on Vernal&#x27;s site looking for more products that fit my taste. The picture doesn&#x27;t do its justice and neither does my review. You&#x27;ll just have to buy it to see</li>
            <li> I have very thin lips and wanted to try something available that could possibly make my lips fuller. I was offered to test this product out during a promotional period for testing and review purposes. I am glad I did because as soon as I opened my package I had to try it out. In my opinion, it does what it says in terms of filling out your lips more than they already are. It&#x27;s easy to apply, as you would apply any lip gloss, you would do the same procedure with this lip plumper product. As soon as I applied it, I instantly felt a tingling sensation. I assume that the ingredients that cause the tingle feel, also assist in causing the skin on the lips to react and plump up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures are a before application, immediately after application, and the fuller looking one, is aprox. 5 minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note*** My body&#x27;s reaction to said product may differ from another person while trying this product.</li>
            <li> Have always wanted to have that nice &amp;#34;pillow lips&amp;#34;, and this product helps me achieve that iconic look.&lt;br /&gt;This product tingles and the first time you use it it will be really unpleasant, but after repeated use, the stinging isn&#x27;t as intense. This product not only plumps but also makes the lips more red and glossy! The plumping is very noticeable for the first two hours, after the third hour it starts to fade! I got this product as a sample with my other order and I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li> This feels cool to my lips and helps protect my lips from getting to dry.  I have use it three times a day for it to work well.  It does not irritate my lips at all.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes your lips feel! I wasn&#x27;t sure about this because of the price but I am so happy I bought it! Makes your lips look nice and plump. I have small lips so I&#x27;m always looking for something to make them look more full. And this indeed helped a lot! I tried many products for my lips to make them look healthier and this is the only product, which made me happy with the result!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting from this, but I like it. After having Restylane and Dysport fillers injected into my face at 41, I&#x27;ve been searching for products that will help me keep up the results. The lips are one of the areas I&#x27;m definitely looking to preserve...have you had those injections all along your lip lines? OOUUCCHH!!! I&#x27;m in NO hurry to repeat those. While I try to decide whether I&#x27;ll ever do that again, I want to keep the new look for as long as possible. Which is why I purchased Vernal Lustful Lips Plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was much more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on anything lip related, but in all honesty, I&#x27;ve only ever purchased lipsticks and things like Carmex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and Natural Ice. I&#x27;ve never bought any fixer or plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this feels. It is thick and a little slippery. It&#x27;s clear. I like to wear it over lipstick, lip stains, etc - there used to be a tiny stinging sensation when I first applied it, but I no longer feel that. I don&#x27;t like how my lip colors are staining the applicator, and I&#x27;m afraid the color will transfer to the clear lip product. I&#x27;ve stopped using it over lip colors for that reason - I ordered some throw-away applicators so I can apply this over my lip color again, but I&#x27;m still waiting for those to arrive. In the meantime, I&#x27;m using this only on bare, naked lips. (Which I still like, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I just also like wearing lip color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effects. When I&#x27;ve asked my friends to look, they say there isn&#x27;t any difference. I have relatively thin lips, so any plumping effect would be easy to see. Again, I like how it feels and how it looks, so I continue to use it for those reasons. There is absolutely cumulative effect whatsoever. If you use this every day for a week, you won&#x27;t notice the effects becoming stronger or working better...your lips will still look the same as they did on day one. At least that has been my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Everyone will (potentially) react different tot his product, but I didn&#x27;t react at all. No extra plumping going on over here. Even though I can&#x27;t say this product lives up to the claims, I do like it. I don&#x27;t want shimmery or glittery - this is neither. It is just a very clear, very shiny product. I like it on naked lips as well as over color. It renders the lips a little slippery, not sticky. (Thankfully!) There is no yucky smell. I&#x27;ve found the applicator doesn&#x27;t put enough on with just one swipe - it takes me a couple of dips in the tube to get enough to cover my lips. All in all I like this product - I just don&#x27;t see my lips getting any bigger. At all. Would I order this again? Surprisingly, yes. I like it as a lip gloss - it&#x27;s just expensive for it not to produce any plumping results, even if those results are very temporary and disappear when the lip gloss goes away.ttom Line: Everyone will (potentially) react different tot his product, but I didn&#x27;t react at all.

            <li> These is one product that really does what it say.  I found my lips to be improved greatly.  They seem to be thicker without the lines and creases and my lips have not chapped since using this.  I use throughout the day as needed and put it on just before going to bed.  Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> I refuse to go anywhere without this lip plumper! I have ordered a few more just to make sure I have one in all of my handbags. This product not only gives me a more plump look, it keeps my lips feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all I just got this product today and tried it out it stings for a little bit but no difference I don&#x27;t recommend you buy this such a let down</li>
            <li> I love Vernal Lustful Lips Plumper!!  Injections are $500....and last only about 5 months.  My lips are very uneven and I agree with other people&#x27;s posts about applying to dry and clean lips.  I have found that if you keep your lips very moisturized for about two weeks prior to using the Plumper that it helps with the stinging and even gives them a little more pinkish hue.  I have tried several of their products like Repair Care Eye Gel, which I love as well.  Very thankful to have discovered these products.

            <li> This product is kinda pricey but it works! Def worth the investment! Slight tingle that is all. Love putting this over my lipsticks. I love the way it made my lips feel! i also noticed that my lips were nice and full...I would really recommend this to a friend or anyone who loves lip products!!!</li>
            <li> This lip plumper delivers results. It keeps my lips hydrated while adding an extra boost to my pout. It is non-irritating which is a huge plus for me because I have extremely sensitive skin especially around my lips! I always keep a tube of this on me and apply it randomly throughout the day. I like the results I’ve seen and bought two more to keep handy.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is rich and moisturizing. This color looks great with everything. I have sensitive lips, and many plumpers tend to dry and chap my lips. Not this. My lips looked a bit fuller. It goes on and stays on the lips. I feel sexier. It has a nice natural &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; hue to it. It&#x27;s pricey, but it enhances the collagen on the lips, so it&#x27;s not like it plumps only when it&#x27;s on. With continuous wear, my lips look more full and smooth. This is surely a pleasant surprise to have received a sample with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap lip plumper in the past and wanted to step it up. After reading reviews on many products, I chose this one because of the number of reviews. However, I would have been just as better off buying a generic drug store plumper because this has no noticeable results. Save your hard earned $$.</li>
