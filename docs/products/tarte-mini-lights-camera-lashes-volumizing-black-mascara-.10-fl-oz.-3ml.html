            <li>No fibers, no glitter, just a lovely product that goes on evenly (I got disposable brushes to use with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This makes me think that it is a safe product as stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times, but I have to say that I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love that and love that is</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have all the gunk that most mascaras do.</li>
            <li>I figured $4 for a Tarte mini was pretty good</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it does not bother my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and it is easily removed with soap and water.</li>
            <li>it glides on easily and it removes easily.</li>
            <li>It lasts and doesn&#x27;t seem to flake off or rub off easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Tarte Mini Lights to try it and see if I would like the product and that was a nice change from ordering a large item to start.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I ordered a travel size as a trial.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this mascara because I love it!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This mascara is exactly as described in the name Lights, Camera, Lashes!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a 50/50 shot if you get a fresh tube.</li>
            <li>Served to work pretty well but ran out quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about this particular tube I received may be the brush.  </li>
            <li>The price was right also.</li>
            <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t have bought this mascara mini because I can&#x27;t afford the full size at the moment.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a less toxic mascara and this had received good reviews.</li>
            <li>The store I got it at first never seems to have it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>My eyes didn&#x27;t burn, which is amazing, because every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li>The tarte mascara is very high quality</li>
            <li>and the mascara tube looks absolutely spanking shiny</li>
            <li>Thank you so much-</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like that factor.</li>
            <li>Seeing how it goes right near my eyes</li>
            <li>It gives my lashes more volume and length than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of clean up of flakes from my face after having to apply SEVERAL coats.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t die when I showered or cried (mainly from yawning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks normal size in the pic</li>
            <li>new-</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>I was surprised considering the brand name.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and skin, but I have no irritation when using this.  </li>
            <li>Product looked a bit old to start.</li>
            <li>but i got busy and forgot about it.</li>
            <li>I think my eyelashes even look thicker naturally now from repeated use.</li>
            <li>i have been disappointed with so many natural cruelty-free mascaras, so needless to say i am very happy now.</li>
            <li>Later i ended up buying a regular sized one at sephora and actually do really like it.</li>
            <li>This mascara dried up quickly and didn&#x27;t work well for me at all.  </li>
            <li>The only con I saw about it was that the applicator was a little more brittle than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I will definately order the Tarte Volumizing Black Mascara in the large version!</li>
            <li>seller(little shop of hoarders) graciously included a sample of another mascara, bare minerals.</li>
            <li>The tube is super small and it clumps up a lot.  </li>
            <li>This little size is perfect as the stuff goes bad</li>
            <li>I read a beauty tip somewhere that recommended buying mini mascaras instead of full size for several reasons: they don&#x27;t get a chance to dry out, they fit in any bag, and you don&#x27;t get bored.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried every major and minor brand.</li>

            <li> Very dry.</li>
            <li> It looked like it was used, had no seal, and when i open it, it was all dried out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was very dry and flaked the first time I applied.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara arrived all dried up.  It was either used or had been left open somehow. I could not use it. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The store I got it at first never seems to have it anymore.  I like it best for my lashes.  The price was right also.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this particular tube I received may be the brush.  There was no mascara to be used!  Was it dried up or just empty - don&#x27;t know.  Terrible purchase.</li>
            <li> The product that I received was completely dried up. I seriously think it had been previously used. Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was very dry and flaked the first time I applied. I gave a second star because the customer service was helpful. I think it&#x27;s a 50/50 shot if you get a fresh tube.</li>
            <li> I use Revlon eye liner and ELF eye primer along with this product. I also have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t die when I showered or cried (mainly from yawning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, since I don&#x27;t always remember to take it off, it&#x27;s gone but WITHOUT all the raccoon eyes madness...Which IS CRAZY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my sample from Ipsy, but I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying another one.</li>
            <li> Was nothing like the regular size Tarte mascara won&#x27;t be buying the mini anymore.</li>
            <li> Runs and smears down the face. Not a great product, will not buy this product again. I was surprised considering the brand name.</li>
            <li> This mascara is exactly as described in the name Lights, Camera, Lashes! It makes my lashes fuller and they seem healthier. I ordered the Tarte Mini Lights to try it and see if I would like the product and that was a nice change from ordering a large item to start. I will definately order the Tarte Volumizing Black Mascara in the large version!</li>
            <li> The size was too small should have just paid the 19 dollars. Still the bests scars for me. Will carry it in my purse</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Very dry. I had to coat my eyelashes with another mascara after this one. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t have bought this mascara mini because I can&#x27;t afford the full size at the moment. I figured $4 for a Tarte mini was pretty good so I went a head and bought it. I&#x27;M OFFICIALLY HOOKED!! I have already ordered my next tube because I knew at this price they wouldn&#x27;t be around for long. The only con I saw about it was that the applicator was a little more brittle than I had expected. But the mascara is brilliant. NO CLUMPS! The product didn&#x27;t make my lashes spidery or anything! Overall the product is a bargain!! Definitely worth the money! I love it! Wonderful customer service and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> No fibers, no glitter, just a lovely product that goes on evenly (I got disposable brushes to use with it.  I use the included brush to apply mascara to the disposable brush), and comes off when you want it off.  Web says it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic ingredients you are supposed to watch out for, but you should probably check this out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Tarte makes the best mascara ever, and this small size is great to carry in your purse or for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is easy to apply and it does not bother my eyes.  I wear it everyday and my eyes do not water.  This makes me think that it is a safe product as stated.</li>
            <li> This mascara is incredible!  It gives my lashes more volume and length than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  I have sensitive eyes and skin, but I have no irritation when using this.  I prefer to buy my mascara in travel size so it&#x27;s always fresh and working its best, so it&#x27;s great to find my favorite one yet at a good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Product looked a bit old to start. Served to work pretty well but ran out quickly. Used it less than a month.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the ingredient list. Also the good reviews. I may have gotten an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; batch though because it&#x27;s dry and flaky and doesn&#x27;t adhere to my lashes well. I have a lot of clean up of flakes from my face after having to apply SEVERAL coats.</li>
            <li> This mascara looks and feels great! Haven&#x27;t found one this great since I splurged and bought a Mac one for 5x more. This little size is perfect as the stuff goes bad and you have to toss it anyway. Will definitely buy more. The brush and the thickness and texture of the mascara itself is absolutely amazing. Thickens and lengthens just like is says. Doesnt flake off or smudge like drug store crappy brands.</li>
            <li> very tiny mascara. looks normal size in the pic</li>
            <li> The tube is super small and it clumps up a lot.  I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty disappointed when i got this in the mail. It looked like it was used, had no seal, and when i open it, it was all dried out. I should have asked for my money back but i got busy and forgot about it. Later i ended up buying a regular sized one at sephora and actually do really like it. Just bummed i wasted 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This mascara dried up quickly and didn&#x27;t work well for me at all.  I recommend the mascara by NYR Organic.</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t review the mascara quality yet- as this is a Christmas stocking stuffer for my sister-&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that I am super impressed with the seller!&lt;br /&gt;The package was shipped and arrived quickly and the mascara tube looks absolutely spanking shiny new- no mars or scratches!&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus? The seller included a sample of the Tarte primer with my purchase! How awesome is that?!?!!! Thank you so much- I could seriously hug you!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see the look on my sis&#x27;s face when she opens the mascara sampler menagerie I have put together for her! (Whoo- love me some exclamation points!!! haha I am just so happy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S~ I will update this review later to include my sisters discovery of Tarte&#x27;s quality/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The tarte mascara is very high quality and it is easily removed with soap and water. A very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I read a beauty tip somewhere that recommended buying mini mascaras instead of full size for several reasons: they don&#x27;t get a chance to dry out, they fit in any bag, and you don&#x27;t get bored.  This is my second purchase of this mascara because I love it!! I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and I have tried every major and minor brand. Dior, benefit, loreal, cover girl, Clinique, smash box, sephora, etc.. This mascara separates, thickens, and lengthens without clumping or flaking..it glides on easily and it removes easily. I think my eyelashes even look thicker naturally now from repeated use.</li>
            <li> My eyes didn&#x27;t burn, which is amazing, because every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> Just received this the other day. I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times, but I have to say that I am very happy with it. It lasts and doesn&#x27;t seem to flake off or rub off easily. AND it&#x27;s natural! I love that and love that is doesn&#x27;t have all the gunk that most mascaras do. Seeing how it goes right near my eyes I really like that factor. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I was searching for a less toxic mascara and this had received good reviews. Fortunately, I ordered a travel size as a trial. I found the mascara crumbly. Perhaps it was just a defective tube.</li>
            <li> received this item in only 3 days...way before expected date. seller(little shop of hoarders) graciously included a sample of another mascara, bare minerals. i am in love with both mascaras! i have been disappointed with so many natural cruelty-free mascaras, so needless to say i am very happy now. will definitely buy tarte and BM again!</li>
