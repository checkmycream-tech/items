            <li>i was glad that i had a nail file drill&amp;#34; but everything was in the packeg and looks good</li>
            <li>Everything had its own package.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try out the world of doing your own nails, I think this is a good cheap way to go.</li>
            <li>other than that great and awesome value.</li>
            <li>I Love the Acrylic powder liquid glitter strip kit there so awesome to use I Recevied my order very early</li>
            <li>But i use recommend very lightly.....</li>
            <li>Everything else is ok.</li>
            <li>They dryed fast and the colors worked great.</li>
            <li>OK so I ordered this from FightingLady and please everyone take my advice and do not order from this person.</li>
            <li>The rest of the acrylic powders are ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this starter kit is OK if you dont mind cleaning glitter off of your floor</li>
            <li>LOVE IT ....... .... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li>It arrived a day early, GREAT</li>
            <li>They were very quick in responding, and requested photos which I provided.</li>
            <li>first time I think it look good and worthy for this price.</li>
            <li>I recieved it days in advanced however</li>
            <li>The important thing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was delivered within 2 days for free.</li>
            <li>It comes with very useful materials to use on any design you want for your nails.</li>
            <li>Plus, im pretty sure some of the powder spilt everywhere in the box.</li>
            <li>Things were good but not everything shipped so fast  although the file waisted so fast and the brush did not work at all</li>
            <li>I love it very good deal for the price i got it and came with everything you need except one important piece that is very much soo needed called the nails :/</li>
            <li>this is a great starter kit if your first starting with nails.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price and</li>
            <li>Other than that everything is great.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t write a review on a product I didn&#x27;t really receive, and while the company was very nice, I still would not recommend purchasing products through them.</li>
            <li>They are very quick and courteous in discussing the matter, but would not accept a return for a new product, would not ship only what I lost, and offered a very inadequate refund to compensate for the loss.</li>
            <li>Alittle more expensive but the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>This this the first time for me to purchased this item.</li>
            <li>First of all the kit is shipped from China, which I did not know.  </li>
            <li>but buy a drill file if youre a begginer.the package was very neat!</li>
            <li>They stay on very well!</li>
            <li>but, when I got the package the first box it came in had glitter on it</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok because i&#x27;m just gonna get some white tips</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t wear cotton ;)</li>
            <li>I just did my nails yesterday and today they are coming off its really sticky and dont let me do my nails the right way</li>
            <li>The files are pretty good, the big black one is great for the acrylics, the buffers are ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I would still recommend based on how much you get for the price.</li>
            <li>a  even much longer wait &amp; never receiving it.</li>
            <li>I Do Thank You so much</li>
            <li>It drys up too fast.</li>
            <li>I very exited.</li>
            <li>I waited a whole month before finding out that my order was never shipped.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t show as much</li>
            <li>(I had to use a practice finger because I couldn&#x27;t do anything with my real nails since I didnt have dehydrator.)</li>
            <li>but i wanted a replacement which was no issue but a waste of time &amp; money because custom is very concerned about the liquid &amp; Powder being a hazardous?</li>
            <li>so it does yellow pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but not a good seller</li>
            <li>A great starter kit but was sad when I opened box to acrylic powder on EVERYTHING, it came early so was exciting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to work with the white acrylic powder because as soon as I started working with it, it dried so quickly!!!</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the first shipment, it is not packaged well and some of the acrylics were empty and they forgot to include a couple of smaller jars, but I emailed the seller and was sent an entirely new box right away.  </li>
            <li>she didn&#x27;t even ask for me to send it back to her, she just shipped me a whole New one.</li>
            <li>I received 1 clear acrylic powder, and two whites.</li>
            <li>but the clear wasn&#x27;t really as clear as I thought it would be when I started on the practice finger.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a professional, you would probably be underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>I got it 15 days early.</li>
            <li>3rd, if you cant get my order right the 1st time, Im not gonna wait a month to figure out if you can do it the 2nd.</li>
            <li>but by the second to third day the nails pop right off..:/</li>
            <li>They wanted to send me half the items and let me choose something else worth $5 from their shop.</li>
            <li>the set is i think ok for the price but for beginner is it very hard to work with cos the powder dries very fast een if you work very wet!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get a pink.</li>

            <li> I was really hoping to get a pink.</li>
            <li> It just came in a yellow envelope and as I opened the envelope I could already smell the acrylic, then I noticed the acrylic busted and it looked like it was in the sun to long, like things melted?</li>
            <li> just the tweesers are a lil thing and are not going to last long!</li>
            <li> Ive been waiting so long for this</li>
            <li> 2ndly, I have already waited a month to find out I cant get my order, Im not interested in waiting another month for something I don&#x27;t even want.</li>
            <li> Upon getting into where the package was, I learned that the powders were shipped with loose lids and shipped in the flimsiest box I have seen.</li>
            <li> I guess the wheel was not closed correctly because one slot was completely empty and some of the other slots after that were half empty as well.</li>
            <li> The mouth of the bottle is way too wide</li>
            <li> So if you use the nail glue be very careful it doesn&#x27;t fall, you&#x27;ll see if you buy it, the mouth of the bottle is wide open, no stopper in it or small mouth like in the name brand nail glues</li>
            <li> and when I got the second package, I was still missing 9 items!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark colour carpet</li>
            <li> Was NOT worth the wait or price.</li>
            <li> Took almost 2 months to get here with no tracking information untill it was delivered... could not deliver to my house so i had to go down to the post office....</li>
            <li> I got an email stating that the post office there would not mail half my items because they contained liquids.</li>
            <li> but they claimed each order is checked by two workers in order to go through to be shipped which was clearly not true.</li>
            <li> And the stones it came with here HALF EMPTY!!!</li>
            <li> I am also missing the dusting brush.</li>
            <li> So if that be the case why sale the item &amp; waste a month waiting on it &amp; never receiving it?</li>
            <li> you letter in broken english.  </li>
            <li> Items were missing out of the box and the nails do not stick to the glue whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was even asked to not write a negative review when I was offered the partial refund with phrasing that made it seem like</li>
            <li> The silver glitter was almost empty and 3 GLITTER CONTAINERS WERE MISSING!!!</li>
            <li> A replacement makez it no better waiting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was working with the acrylic correctly</li>
            <li> then, I noticed that something missing!!</li>
            <li> Everything is really weak</li>
            <li> They were the 3 glitter powders, 3 random acrylic powders, and the 3 glitter strip containers.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cheesy thank</li>
            <li> it game in was covered in glitter!!</li>
            <li> (so bad X[ )</li>
            <li> I guess one of the glitter containers from the kit opened and spilled everywhere. :(</li>
            <li> the mini package was already opened :(</li>
            <li> The nail glue is dangerous!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an idiot</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this with the hopes of doing my own acrylic nails.  The products were received as described.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great bundle! Good value for the money. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at the speed at which it arrived. I recieved it days in advanced however when I opened the package there was glitter everywhere the glitter had spilled all over the place. I am also missing the dusting brush.</li>
            <li> When I first got the package, 13 items were missing! I contacted them and they offered $4 to make up for it. -_- I asked them if they can send me them but they claimed each order is checked by two workers in order to go through to be shipped which was clearly not true. I finally had them send me the items and when I got the second package, I was still missing 9 items! They were the 3 glitter powders, 3 random acrylic powders, and the 3 glitter strip containers. I contacted them yet again and they said they sent them. I got the package and when I opened it, it was only this 12 pack of glitter powder but no strips or colored acrylic powder. I contacted them for a third time and they asked if they could just send me the items with the next order I purchase from them (which, for the record, will never happen again) and I refused that offer. I currently have what I hope is the remaining items still in the mail. Bottom line, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product!! It comes with very useful materials to use on any design you want for your nails.</li>
            <li> Got everything and it worked great..This product came with everything it says..love the glitter and pearls! I also liked the container the cuticle oil came in</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try out the world of doing your own nails, I think this is a good cheap way to go. If you&#x27;re a professional, you would probably be underwhelmed. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I would still recommend based on how much you get for the price.</li>
            <li> I never received this package i was hope&#x27;n for to received. The seller wanted to refund it but i wanted a replacement which was no issue but a waste of time &amp; money because custom is very concerned about the liquid &amp; Powder being a hazardous? So if that be the case why sale the item &amp; waste a month waiting on it &amp; never receiving it? A replacement makez it no better waiting a  even much longer wait &amp; never receiving it.</li>
            <li> I received 1 clear acrylic powder, and two whites. I was really hoping to get a pink. Other than that everything is great. Love it all!</li>
            <li> I Love the Acrylic powder liquid glitter strip kit there so awesome to use I Recevied my order very early I Do Thank You so much</li>
            <li> Things were good but not everything shipped so fast  although the file waisted so fast and the brush did not work at all it fell out i had to buy brushes over all its good</li>
            <li> the set is i think ok for the price but for beginner is it very hard to work with cos the powder dries very fast een if you work very wet! i was glad that i had a nail file drill&amp;#34; but everything was in the packeg and looks good just the tweesers are a lil thing and are not going to last long! next time i will try another powder brand but that is just me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the acrylic at all &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have a lot.! It drys up too fast. Everything else is ok.</li>
            <li> Received 2/3 weeks and I did not receive the glitter strips ? I have 3 glitter, 3 hexagon glitters, and 3 acrylic powders.</li>
            <li> This this the first time for me to purchased this item. I very exited. When it arrived, I open and look inside. first time I think it look good and worthy for this price. It made me immediately try some of it.&lt;br /&gt;But then, I noticed that something missing!! They forgot to send me the acrylic liquid! The important thing!&lt;br /&gt;I already unpack, and used some of it, so I can&#x27;t return my stuff (so bad X[ )</li>
            <li> this came with everything that i need. so perfect. doesnt include tips or acetone. other than that great and awesome value.</li>
            <li> I love it very good deal for the price i got it and came with everything you need except one important piece that is very much soo needed called the nails :/</li>
            <li> when I got my package It just came in a yellow envelope and as I opened the envelope I could already smell the acrylic, then I noticed the acrylic busted and it looked like it was in the sun to long, like things melted? so I emailed the shipper she was a very nice lady. she didn&#x27;t even ask for me to send it back to her, she just shipped me a whole New one. I was so happy with it. it looks nice and everything was perfect. this is a great starter kit if your first starting with nails. I think it would make a great gift for any girl :)</li>
            <li> First of all the kit is shipped from China, which I did not know.  Comes with a cheesy thank you letter in broken english.  It also does not come with any sort of instructions.  I have not used it yet so cannot rate the quality, but already know I will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Everything is really weak The Acrylics dont stay I just did my nails yesterday and today they are coming off its really sticky and dont let me do my nails the right way, I dont like it at all The glue dont glue at all, the glitters dont work good I am totally not satified at all..</li>
            <li> They dryed fast and the colors worked great. I will continue to buy this when I run out. but buy a drill file if youre a begginer.the package was very neat! Everything had its own package. Nothing was damaged and I did my nails today. I got it 15 days early. My nails are sparkley and beautiful. They stay on very well!</li>
            <li> Items were missing out of the box and the nails do not stick to the glue whatsoever. The pictures are not what you recieve.</li>
            <li> OK so I ordered this from FightingLady and please everyone take my advice and do not order from this person. I waited a whole month before finding out that my order was never shipped. I got an email stating that the post office there would not mail half my items because they contained liquids. Why would this person sale a product that cannot be delivered. They wanted to send me half the items and let me choose something else worth $5 from their shop. 1st of all, that&#x27;s not what I  ordered or what I wanted. 2ndly, I have already waited a month to find out I cant get my order, Im not interested in waiting another month for something I don&#x27;t even want. 3rd, if you cant get my order right the 1st time, Im not gonna wait a month to figure out if you can do it the 2nd. I ordered another set just like this one around the same price from Ebay and it was delivered within 2 days for free. It is a good product but not a good seller</li>
            <li> I do like it. I was impressed on how quickly it arrived. It arrived a day early, GREAT but, when I got the package the first box it came in had glitter on it, I opened it and the second box it game in was covered in glitter!! When i opened box the item came in THE INSIDE OF THE BOX WAS COVERED IN GLITTER!!! I guess one of the glitter containers from the kit opened and spilled everywhere. :( The silver glitter was almost empty and 3 GLITTER CONTAINERS WERE MISSING!!! So i didn&#x27;t get all the colours it was suppose to come with. NOW THERE IS GLITTER ALL OVER MY CARPET!:( But thats no problem. It&#x27;s a dark colour carpet so it doesn&#x27;t show as much lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to work with the white acrylic powder because as soon as I started working with it, it dried so quickly!!!! I&#x27;m not sure if I was working with the acrylic correctly but it became gummy (I had to use a practice finger because I couldn&#x27;t do anything with my real nails since I didnt have dehydrator.) The rest of the acrylic powders are ok. but the clear wasn&#x27;t really as clear as I thought it would be when I started on the practice finger. But that&#x27;s ok because i&#x27;m just gonna get some white tips so i won&#x27;t have to worry about working with the white acrylic to make french tips. I WISH THE PACKAGE CAME WITH NAIL PRIMER AND NAIL DEHYDRATOR! I bought primer from the beauty supply up the street, but NO STORE HAD DEHYDRATOR :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the beauty supply, not wallgreen&#x27;s not CVS, I&#x27;ll just have to order some from here. OOOH!! And the stones it came with here HALF EMPTY!!! I guess the wheel was not closed correctly because one slot was completely empty and some of the other slots after that were half empty as well. It also said that there was suppose to be 25 x Nail guide sticker forms...I ONLY GOT 8!!!!!! the mini package was already opened :( (But i&#x27;m not gonna use them anyway, but still...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this starter kit is OK if you dont mind cleaning glitter off of your floor lol. I would recommend this product...But i use recommend very lightly.....</li>
            <li> A great starter kit but was sad when I opened box to acrylic powder on EVERYTHING, it came early so was exciting. Great deal for all the variety that comes with the kit, but the acrylic is a cheaper brand so it does yellow pretty quick. Knowing what the heck the acrylic powder is and does would have been nice but research always helps, I Recommend for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay just the nail glue isnt of the best quality it seems like it works fine but by the second to third day the nails pop right off..:/</li>
            <li> I have not got my gift yet. Just woundering when it will come for?  And what day it will be here for?</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ....... .... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li> This is garbage.....go to sally beauty supply! Alittle more expensive but the quality is amazing! You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Good price for a good variety.  The acrylic is good.  I had a problem with the first shipment, it is not packaged well and some of the acrylics were empty and they forgot to include a couple of smaller jars, but I emailed the seller and was sent an entirely new box right away.  Everything else is standard, the brush, the cup thing, there&#x27;s nail form guides included, and toe separators.  The files are pretty good, the big black one is great for the acrylics, the buffers are ok, not great.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price and luckyStore has great customer service. The nail glue is dangerous!  The mouth of the bottle is way too wide and I&#x27;m an idiot and it spilled onto my leg, reacted with the cotton and caused a massive chemical burn on my thigh.  So if you use the nail glue be very careful it doesn&#x27;t fall, you&#x27;ll see if you buy it, the mouth of the bottle is wide open, no stopper in it or small mouth like in the name brand nail glues so it just all spills out.  And don&#x27;t wear cotton ;)</li>
            <li> When I received this package, the post office had re-wrapped it twice during shipment and when I opened the outer packaging, acrylic powder flew everywhere. Upon getting into where the package was, I learned that the powders were shipped with loose lids and shipped in the flimsiest box I have seen. I then contacted the company via email regarding this. They were very quick in responding, and requested photos which I provided. They are very quick and courteous in discussing the matter, but would not accept a return for a new product, would not ship only what I lost, and offered a very inadequate refund to compensate for the loss. Overall, I can&#x27;t write a review on a product I didn&#x27;t really receive, and while the company was very nice, I still would not recommend purchasing products through them. I was even asked to not write a negative review when I was offered the partial refund with phrasing that made it seem like those were the terms of the refund...</li>
            <li> Took almost 2 months to get here with no tracking information untill it was delivered... could not deliver to my house so i had to go down to the post office.... FORGOT TO SEND ME THE PRIMER!!!!!  Ive been waiting so long for this and now I have to wait even longer so I can order some primer from a DIFFERENT company. Was NOT worth the wait or price. Plus, im pretty sure some of the powder spilt everywhere in the box.</li>
