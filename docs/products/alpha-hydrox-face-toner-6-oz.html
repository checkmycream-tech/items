    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Their website explains the system best.</li>
            <li>It is not drying and is the perfect toner before applying face cream before make-up.</li>
            <li>Very good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to purchase this wherever I can find the best price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toner at a great price.</li>
            <li>My face feels great after using this with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would work great on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people that suffer with acne or have skin discolorations.</li>
            <li>PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Good for after &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this a year ago and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>The pads are really good as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have always liked the way this toner feels whenever I apply it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use jan marini&#x27;s glycolic line but the alpha hydrox line is equally good and more affordable.</li>
            <li>He made sure we always had a good supply on hand.  </li>
            <li>Much better and more affordable than Seen On TV products.</li>
            <li>Refreshing to skin.</li>
            <li>I use Alpha hydroxy Face Wash and love it...</li>
            <li>: There are many products and combinations based on your skin type.  </li>
            <li>Will know better once I am asked again for my ID.</li>
            <li>It has been many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Alpha Hydrox Face Toner for many years.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li>For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really notice any skin shedding which is great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it to remove residue of makeup remover, and I enjoy using a product that has served me well for so many years.</li>
            <li>Very great product, love the way my skin looks,clear and firm</li>
            <li>This really made my skin look really good, bright, and clear after one application so I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and v safely packaged.just started using it</li>
            <li>I use  to buy The toner from Logistics by Anthony, but it is no linger available.  </li>
            <li>Neoteric&#x27;s website I&#x27;ve signed up for monthly special alerts.</li>
            <li>Bought this toner more than twice and really like how it works and feels on my face.</li>
            <li>but they run out quick with me</li>
            <li>My skin is not particularly sensitive - a good thing, since this product does include alcohol (hence 4 stars instead of five.)  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s love at first use!</li>
            <li>If you have any doubts, go to the Neoteric website, and read the actual blog for why Alpha Hydrox products are so amazing.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and renewed each time.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li>My skin looked great a day right after using the product, unbelievably</li>
            <li>Will probably buy more later when i need some.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and renewed, even as I&#x27;m exiting middle age and approaching something much more dire.  </li>
            <li>I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li>I started buying it when it was available in local drug stores, and my then-teenaged kids both used it.  </li>
            <li>I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was 10, I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>It helped clear up my skin really fast.</li>
            <li>The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.</li>
            <li>My daughter, who rarely had a breakout, used it only once a day, and we credit it with keeping her skin clear, even with lots of sweaty, grimy hours on a soccer field.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve retired my benzoyl peroxide gel completely since switching to this product.  </li>
            <li>but so far it does.</li>
            <li>My son suffered from a mild-to-occasionally-moderate acne problem throughout his high school years, but cleaning his face with this product a few times a day really helped clear up his skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a better way to go than ProActive, which will usually tend to over dry the skin with salicylic acids and benzoyl peroxides.</li>
            <li>For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>Works well, keeps skin clear but is too strong to use in combination with other Alpha Hydrox products for me... cocktail of AHA and Alcohol from multiple products turns otherwise not sensitive skin a bit red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>cant really anything positive or negative.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have had acne since I was a teenager; I have tried everything with only moderate success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is no label on front of bottle. How do you know it if it&#x27;s real face toner or is it fake and poured in a bottle</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular basis. It&#x27;s a great toner at a great price.</li>
            <li> cant really anything positive or negative. I have oily acne prone skin. this seemed to make my face oiler after use, yet it didnt cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Bought this toner more than twice and really like how it works and feels on my face. Will probably buy more later when i need some.</li>
            <li> Works well, keeps skin clear but is too strong to use in combination with other Alpha Hydrox products for me... cocktail of AHA and Alcohol from multiple products turns otherwise not sensitive skin a bit red and blotchy. Oily patches even out over 2 week period with every other day use, then once a week keeps it even. Note that I use oil-free Alpha Hydrox in tube once a week (on different day) for a solid result. Will continue to use it since astringents at chain pharmacies have increased in price and quality is not always determined by price. Much better and more affordable than Seen On TV products.</li>
            <li> My face feels great after using this with a cotton pad. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My face feels cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing to skin. Delivery was quick and v safely packaged.just started using it but so far it&#x27;s love at first use!</li>
            <li> I have always liked the way this toner feels whenever I apply it.  Skin feels fresh and renewed each time.</li>
            <li> I use  to buy The toner from Logistics by Anthony, but it is no linger available.  I use Alpha hydroxy Face Wash and love it...so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. I&#x27;m 50 years old and have average skin conditions so I thought it would work great on me.</li>
            <li> Very good.  I use it regularly. I used to use jan marini&#x27;s glycolic line but the alpha hydrox line is equally good and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have had acne since I was a teenager; I have tried everything with only moderate success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended this system, since she uses it and has seen a difference in her skin. For the first time since I was 10, I have clear skin. I added a scrub, Suki Skincare - Face Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser, which completes my face care system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: There are many products and combinations based on your skin type.  Their website explains the system best.</li>
            <li> Just started using this.  Will know better once I am asked again for my ID. (I am 50)  It has been many years.  Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha Hydrox Face Toner for many years. It is not drying and is the perfect toner before applying face cream before make-up. Good for after &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; also.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and tried almost everything to help. This toner is the only thing that has made a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I called the Alpha Hydrox company out of curiosity before ordering! I ordered their entire line. I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper. Three years ago someone asked me if I was 29. I was so flattered. As a teenager, i never had blemishes. For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne. My Mom is a licensed hairdresser &amp; cosmetologist. A dear friend of mine is a licensed esthetician. I called my friend, she suggested I try the Alpha Hydrox line. I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin. As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner. I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner. The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night. My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month. My skin GLOWED after a week of use. All of their products I purchased are 10% glycolic acid. I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream. PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!! I would not trade these products for anything in the universe. For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s. I used Mary Kay from 1991 to 2003, I&#x27;ve sold Mary Kay 3 different times. I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil and nothing but this product line has cleared up my skin. Eight years ago when my child was born, I became allergic to MK Timewise. I am done with all other skin care lines but Alpha Hydrox! :) The Alpha Hydrox Toner is something I purchase TWO of at a time. It has no fragrance. A serious plus when I consider that I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances. For those of you leary of a slight chemical peel, I do have sensitive skin. This has not bothered me. Everything is pH balanced. 10% glycolic acid in the toner. If you have any doubts, go to the Neoteric website, and read the actual blog for why Alpha Hydrox products are so amazing. Ulta has sales from time to time for about $5.99 a bottle. Neoteric&#x27;s website I&#x27;ve signed up for monthly special alerts. I&#x27;m happy to purchase this wherever I can find the best price. This is a better way to go than ProActive, which will usually tend to over dry the skin with salicylic acids and benzoyl peroxides. I&#x27;ve retired my benzoyl peroxide gel completely since switching to this product.  I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts.  My pores are GONE. I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a year ago and it&#x27;s really good. It helped clear up my skin really fast. My skin looked great a day right after using the product, unbelievably so it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. The pads are really good as well but they run out quick with me so keeping a bottle of the astringent with some cotton pads/balls and using a little will make it last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> ...and I still prefer it to anything I&#x27;ve used.  My skin is not particularly sensitive - a good thing, since this product does include alcohol (hence 4 stars instead of five.)  It leaves my face feeling clean and renewed, even as I&#x27;m exiting middle age and approaching something much more dire.  I started buying it when it was available in local drug stores, and my then-teenaged kids both used it.  My son suffered from a mild-to-occasionally-moderate acne problem throughout his high school years, but cleaning his face with this product a few times a day really helped clear up his skin.  He made sure we always had a good supply on hand.  My daughter, who rarely had a breakout, used it only once a day, and we credit it with keeping her skin clear, even with lots of sweaty, grimy hours on a soccer field.  I&#x27;m still using it to remove residue of makeup remover, and I enjoy using a product that has served me well for so many years.</li>
            <li> This really made my skin look really good, bright, and clear after one application so I will continue to buy. It&#x27;s great for people that suffer with acne or have skin discolorations. You won&#x27;t really notice any skin shedding which is great but I wanted to see my skin shedding so that I could determine if whether or not it&#x27;s working for me but so far it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s basically just witch hazel and alcohol. If you have the money to pend it&#x27;s worth it, but I&#x27;m on a budget, so I will look for something comparable at target or something.</li>
            <li> Very great product, love the way my skin looks,clear and firm</li>
