            <li>I switched to using organic products for all my body care needs about a year ago, and since then, I&#x27;d been using Intelligent Nutrients Harmonic Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing).  </li>
            <li>All-natural, paraben and cruelty free, the formulation is a great eco-friendly choice.  </li>
            <li>Everyone else says &amp;#34;a nice almond scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is top notch for a good price.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Smells INCREDIBLE (like fresh lemongrass and</li>
            <li>I know I can rely on the product and the lemongrass smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>Smells nice and fresh, and very effective in conditioning your hair.  </li>
            <li>Best natural conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Cheap for a good, healthy product for your hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice product on first use.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner - I bought both the shampoo and conditioner - and am very happy - my long hair feels silky and it&#x27;s very easy to brush now.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of this conditioner though.</li>
            <li>I love the lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love using it with the conditioner too</li>
            <li>I plan to try a more cleansing shampoo and follow that with this conditioner to see if I have any better results.</li>
            <li>glad I found this</li>
            <li>On top of that, nobody with this hair type had reviewed this product.</li>
            <li>It still smelled like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the shower, and my hair was perfect, soft, smooth, and not oily at all, despite having slept on it all night.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I went for it and bought the pair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this conditioner is organic, vegan, and cruelty free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very efficient and works as a great de-tangler for my hair.</li>
            <li>honeybees love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I love Acure.</li>
            <li>Even if I was confident in its ingredients, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner!</li>
            <li>The smell makes it---it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>There has to be magic in this tube.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It really is a refreshing product that I plan to use for years to come.</li>
            <li>As many others rave, this is a standout conditioner - both in ingredients and results.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, I believe most of the organic products take time to get use to.</li>
            <li>I love it as well as the rest of the Acure Organics Shampoo/Conditioner line.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it along with the ingredients it contains.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan, gluten free, sulfate free, paraben free, phthalate free, cruelty free, no synthetic fragrance, 100% biodegradable AND color safe which is especially important for my bright red-dyed hair.</li>
            <li>Great natural product!!</li>
            <li>Great natural conditioner!</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a day at the spa - it&#x27;s fresh and calming and leaves my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair smells great and is soft.</li>
            <li>this conditioner and the shampoo, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering.</li>
            <li>It smells unbelievably good, leaves my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Loved this line so much, I bought the shampoo too.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair but it is very fine and limp and this is not the best brand for my hair.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely Lemongrass/Tea smell that is natural and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Could not get a grip easily.  </li>
            <li>but it also dries out easily...</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and smooth afterwards and looks great with a natural sheen.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few organic conditioners that smells great, I love the way my hair feels!</li>
            <li>The ingredients couldn&#x27;t be any more natural or better for you!</li>
            <li>Was looking for something paraban free</li>
            <li>She loves it and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s constantly saying how great her hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li>found Acure Organics thanks to nomoredirtylooks.com, and they reviewed a different product, but I know the authors of this blog don&#x27;t bother with items that aren&#x27;t good for your body and good for the Earth- both of which are important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is light, yet still gets all the tangles out.</li>
            <li>Feel free to pair this with any shampoo of your choice out of the line, or even another brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy at first because I have very fine, oily hair and some shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li>I can talk all day about how good I think it looks, but the true test is what others (who are much more objective than I) think.</li>
            <li>and I am super happy that it is free of potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>It looks OK when I blow it dry, but not as good as it does when I use either Unite shampoo and conditioner or Biolage.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff I got long curley hair and this product helps from blowing out and going wild.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The smell is not overwhelming, but it is very very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I just switched products recently, so this was a good alternative.</li>
            <li>..so nice to have natural ingredients in a product...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and has it looking silky, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and soft, too.</li>
            <li>It seems to have no effect at all, except to leave me smelling of lemongrass (initially found charming, now grating).</li>
            <li>Their products are safe and really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>after using this conditioner my formerly dry fly away hair elicited comments from friends as they noticed my hair was calm and moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more, and I&#x27;m excited to try more things from Acure after this.</li>
            <li>I love this product line because my hair feels clean, light, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Other than that, as I said, great product.  </li>
            <li>Super annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fine and it makes my hair easy to comb after washing and conditioning it, but my hair stays dry on the top and gets oily underneath.</li>
            <li>Happy to report no more break outs, and this conditioner leaves your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty rare!</li>
            <li>The smell might be a little off-putting for some people, it kind of reminds me of Noxema in smell, but I absolutely love that smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it makes my hair SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li>It also smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural bath products and having the hardest time with shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>And my husband and I like the fresh, earthy smell.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing something right.</li>
            <li>Only wish it were more economical.</li>
            <li>but it is not my absolute favorite natural brand.</li>
            <li>It seems to really penetrate my hair leaving it soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair is not soft, so I loved it.  </li>
            <li>No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried didn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy, but it did nothing to moisturize my hair either.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, it has brought back the health, vibrance and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>In my book they do no wrong.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li>The smell is also really heavenly!</li>
            <li>But after I wash it out my hair is exactly like it was before using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used this with the Lemongrass Shampoo which used together gave me an itchy scalp and a perfumey smell, plus buildup.  </li>
            <li>So then I tried using the conditioner with a different brand shampoo which made this conditioner smell better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural clean and hydrating.</li>
            <li>After my son was born, my scalp and hair have become very oily and itchy, with LOTS of dandruff, so I switched to organics.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would work for me.</li>
            <li>It also works really well</li>
            <li>The unicorns, fairies and gnomes really know their scents.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair much noticeably softer without the greasiness.</li>
            <li>The product tames, softens, and untangles my very fine and delicate hair leaving it (amazingly) full.  </li>
            <li>However, this brand is by far rolling with the right price.</li>
            <li>I just bought this conditioner for no reason other than it&#x27;s one of the top conditioners on here.</li>
            <li>This one left my hair &#x27;sparkling clean&#x27;, with no moisture whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I just add some OGX coconut milk anti-breakage serum and either Lush R&amp;B hair moisturizer or Macadamia leave-in cream (on more humid days) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful everyday conditioner that will leave your hair hydrated, baby soft, moisturized without feeling heavy, and nourished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new fav!</li>
            <li>My recent efforts to transition to more healthful products with organic ingredients (rather than chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce) is what initially led me to this product.</li>
            <li>have short curly hair and this product leaves it feeling truly conditioned and so soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I need to use only natural non toxic products and up until new there was never a conditioner without chemicals available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every other time, and it&#x27;s nice for a switch, but ultimately I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li>I can only use it on the ends of my hair, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal because I&#x27;ve never been able to use any conditioner near my scalp.</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair, you probably cannot miss more than one day of cleaning and I predict that this conditioner may be too heavy during the summer months.</li>
            <li>I love that this conditioner does not coat my hair or leave it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a long time I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Treat conditioner, which is a somewhat just-above-mediocre conditioner, but it *does* work, it does actually condition and leave your hair much better off after using.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 20 yr old grandson who is very health conscious.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Once the hair dries a bit, I tilt my head down and break it up with my fingers with light circular motions at my scalp.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is average - it has good natural ingredients but it made my hair limp and frizzy</li>
            <li>I wish this smell last little longer on my hair because I love this smell.</li>
            <li>So far Moroccan is the one to beat for conditioning and fragrance...and no one can come close....</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the bees knees as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I could nearly eat this stuff</li>
            <li>I have used it 4 times so far.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair really oily.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt smoother and my frizzies have completely gone away.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sensitive to everything, like I am, try Acure products.</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>It contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>By the last day, I did feel gross, but not nearly as bad as it would have been with my regular s &amp; c!</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the all natural route as I was reading that some of the major ingredients in store bought brands, damage your hair.</li>
            <li>if you have long hair it will run out fast though</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling normal.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to really tell all of the attributes, but my hair was softer, like the feel of a baby&#x27;s soft hair.  </li>
            <li>Though a little pricey but still worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft now and it shines so hard that I can see all the highlights and undertones that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.</li>
            <li>Which is even more disappointing because of the high price and the eco-friendliness.</li>
            <li>I usually keep conditioners on my hair for at least 5 minute before rinsing off, and mostly all of them make my hair soft and help with detangling.</li>
            <li>With the different shampoo the conditioner did a fair job of conditioning, no itch or buildup and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>

            <li> All-natural, paraben and cruelty free, the formulation is a great eco-friendly choice.  </li>
            <li> Everyone else says &amp;#34;a nice almond scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is top notch for a good price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Smells INCREDIBLE (like fresh lemongrass and</li>
            <li> I know I can rely on the product and the lemongrass smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh, and very effective in conditioning your hair.  </li>
            <li> Best natural conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Cheap for a good, healthy product for your hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice product on first use.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner - I bought both the shampoo and conditioner - and am very happy - my long hair feels silky and it&#x27;s very easy to brush now.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of this conditioner though.</li>
            <li> I love the lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love using it with the conditioner too</li>
            <li> I plan to try a more cleansing shampoo and follow that with this conditioner to see if I have any better results.</li>
            <li> glad I found this</li>
            <li> On top of that, nobody with this hair type had reviewed this product.</li>
            <li> It still smelled like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the shower, and my hair was perfect, soft, smooth, and not oily at all, despite having slept on it all night.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I went for it and bought the pair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this conditioner is organic, vegan, and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very efficient and works as a great de-tangler for my hair.</li>
            <li> honeybees love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I love Acure.</li>
            <li> Even if I was confident in its ingredients, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner!</li>
            <li> The smell makes it---it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> There has to be magic in this tube.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It really is a refreshing product that I plan to use for years to come.</li>
            <li> As many others rave, this is a standout conditioner - both in ingredients and results.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> , I believe most of the organic products take time to get use to.</li>
            <li> I love it as well as the rest of the Acure Organics Shampoo/Conditioner line.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it along with the ingredients it contains.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vegan, gluten free, sulfate free, paraben free, phthalate free, cruelty free, no synthetic fragrance, 100% biodegradable AND color safe which is especially important for my bright red-dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Great natural product!!</li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner!</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a day at the spa - it&#x27;s fresh and calming and leaves my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair smells great and is soft.</li>
            <li> this conditioner and the shampoo, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering.</li>
            <li> It smells unbelievably good, leaves my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> Loved this line so much, I bought the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair but it is very fine and limp and this is not the best brand for my hair.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely Lemongrass/Tea smell that is natural and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Could not get a grip easily.  </li>
            <li> but it also dries out easily...</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and smooth afterwards and looks great with a natural sheen.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few organic conditioners that smells great, I love the way my hair feels!</li>
            <li> The ingredients couldn&#x27;t be any more natural or better for you!</li>
            <li> Was looking for something paraban free</li>
            <li> She loves it and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s constantly saying how great her hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li> found Acure Organics thanks to nomoredirtylooks.com, and they reviewed a different product, but I know the authors of this blog don&#x27;t bother with items that aren&#x27;t good for your body and good for the Earth- both of which are important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light, yet still gets all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Feel free to pair this with any shampoo of your choice out of the line, or even another brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy at first because I have very fine, oily hair and some shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> I can talk all day about how good I think it looks, but the true test is what others (who are much more objective than I) think.</li>
            <li> and I am super happy that it is free of potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It looks OK when I blow it dry, but not as good as it does when I use either Unite shampoo and conditioner or Biolage.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff I got long curley hair and this product helps from blowing out and going wild.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming, but it is very very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I just switched products recently, so this was a good alternative.</li>
            <li> ..so nice to have natural ingredients in a product...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and has it looking silky, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft, too.</li>
            <li> It seems to have no effect at all, except to leave me smelling of lemongrass (initially found charming, now grating).</li>
            <li> Their products are safe and really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after using this conditioner my formerly dry fly away hair elicited comments from friends as they noticed my hair was calm and moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more, and I&#x27;m excited to try more things from Acure after this.</li>
            <li> I love this product line because my hair feels clean, light, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Other than that, as I said, great product.  </li>
            <li> Super annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells fine and it makes my hair easy to comb after washing and conditioning it, but my hair stays dry on the top and gets oily underneath.</li>
            <li> Happy to report no more break outs, and this conditioner leaves your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty rare!</li>
            <li> The smell might be a little off-putting for some people, it kind of reminds me of Noxema in smell, but I absolutely love that smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it makes my hair SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li> It also smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural bath products and having the hardest time with shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> And my husband and I like the fresh, earthy smell.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing something right.</li>
            <li> Only wish it were more economical.</li>
            <li> but it is not my absolute favorite natural brand.</li>
            <li> It seems to really penetrate my hair leaving it soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair is not soft, so I loved it.  </li>
            <li> No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried didn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy, but it did nothing to moisturize my hair either.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it has brought back the health, vibrance and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> In my book they do no wrong.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is also really heavenly!</li>
            <li> But after I wash it out my hair is exactly like it was before using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used this with the Lemongrass Shampoo which used together gave me an itchy scalp and a perfumey smell, plus buildup.  </li>
            <li> So then I tried using the conditioner with a different brand shampoo which made this conditioner smell better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural clean and hydrating.</li>
            <li> After my son was born, my scalp and hair have become very oily and itchy, with LOTS of dandruff, so I switched to organics.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would work for me.</li>
            <li> It also works really well</li>
            <li> The unicorns, fairies and gnomes really know their scents.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair much noticeably softer without the greasiness.</li>
            <li> The product tames, softens, and untangles my very fine and delicate hair leaving it (amazingly) full.  </li>
            <li> However, this brand is by far rolling with the right price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this conditioner for no reason other than it&#x27;s one of the top conditioners on here.</li>
            <li> This one left my hair &#x27;sparkling clean&#x27;, with no moisture whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I just add some OGX coconut milk anti-breakage serum and either Lush R&amp;B hair moisturizer or Macadamia leave-in cream (on more humid days) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful everyday conditioner that will leave your hair hydrated, baby soft, moisturized without feeling heavy, and nourished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new fav!</li>
            <li> My recent efforts to transition to more healthful products with organic ingredients (rather than chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce) is what initially led me to this product.</li>
            <li> have short curly hair and this product leaves it feeling truly conditioned and so soft and tangle free</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I need to use only natural non toxic products and up until new there was never a conditioner without chemicals available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other time, and it&#x27;s nice for a switch, but ultimately I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I can only use it on the ends of my hair, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal because I&#x27;ve never been able to use any conditioner near my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair, you probably cannot miss more than one day of cleaning and I predict that this conditioner may be too heavy during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I love that this conditioner does not coat my hair or leave it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a long time I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Treat conditioner, which is a somewhat just-above-mediocre conditioner, but it *does* work, it does actually condition and leave your hair much better off after using.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 20 yr old grandson who is very health conscious.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Once the hair dries a bit, I tilt my head down and break it up with my fingers with light circular motions at my scalp.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is average - it has good natural ingredients but it made my hair limp and frizzy</li>
            <li> I wish this smell last little longer on my hair because I love this smell.</li>
            <li> So far Moroccan is the one to beat for conditioning and fragrance...and no one can come close....</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the bees knees as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I could nearly eat this stuff</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times so far.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair really oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt smoother and my frizzies have completely gone away.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sensitive to everything, like I am, try Acure products.</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> It contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> By the last day, I did feel gross, but not nearly as bad as it would have been with my regular s &amp; c!</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the all natural route as I was reading that some of the major ingredients in store bought brands, damage your hair.</li>
            <li> if you have long hair it will run out fast though</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling normal.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to really tell all of the attributes, but my hair was softer, like the feel of a baby&#x27;s soft hair.  </li>
            <li> Though a little pricey but still worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft now and it shines so hard that I can see all the highlights and undertones that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.</li>
            <li> Which is even more disappointing because of the high price and the eco-friendliness.</li>
            <li> I usually keep conditioners on my hair for at least 5 minute before rinsing off, and mostly all of them make my hair soft and help with detangling.</li>
            <li> With the different shampoo the conditioner did a fair job of conditioning, no itch or buildup and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I quickly discovered that I did not need to use as much as other store bought conditioners...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Im not sure where all the positive feedback came from, but the product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Every one I have tried has left my hair dry at the roots and gross and greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li> My hair was on the dry coarse side.</li>
            <li> I really tried hard to like this conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair feels a little greasier than normal, but that could be due to the accompanying shampoo?</li>
            <li> It lays very flat and has absolutely no body at all.</li>
            <li> You can use very little, massage it in at the roots, and when you rinse it will coat the rest of your hair and leave it soft.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight Asian hair that tends to be oily at the roots, dry at the ends, and fall out too much in the shower with bad hair products.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with making my hair less dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair a little longer than suggested, but I feel as though it helped.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, so you think it really means business.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but also keeps my hair moisturized enough, which is no easy task - I have fine (thin strands), but thick (a LOT of them) hair, so it tends to get weighted down and fall flat...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money with no results.</li>
            <li> Dr. Christopher&#x27;s is harder to work with, but my hair feels cleaner (and looks cleaner) after each use.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse Asian hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily that those products were bad - it&#x27;s just that this one is the full package.</li>
            <li> Since I found this conditioner, I haven&#x27;t bought any other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products in the past and they typically leave my hair feeling stringy and limp, but that&#x27;s far from the case with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many weak and mediocre conditioners in my time, but this is the most worthless I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and my only complaint is that my scalp feels oily by the end of the unwashed day.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down your hair, nor does it cause build up.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is shiny, much less frizzy but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much less frizzy than it did, without loosing the body.</li>
            <li> it would become a ratted mess.</li>
            <li> I still have a few strands that fall out during washes but much less than before.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a natural hair products that can meet my hair needs.</li>
            <li> trying it for a few weeks now and undecided.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is weighed down by conditioners.</li>
            <li> I had awful, oily and static hair after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I used it on my kids so at least I would not be wasting it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, with fairly thick hair, about medium length.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> No more frizz!</li>
            <li> Did not like trying to tear the VERY small aluminum safety cover off the opening under the cover.  </li>
            <li> bit on the thin side, but conditions hair well with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite thing and will never stop using</li>
            <li> At first, I tried the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap &amp; Shikakai hair rinse, which my hair absolutely hated.</li>
            <li> I have been trying out organic conditioners and hated when it came down to conditioning my long hair</li>
            <li> My kids stink even worse than before they got in the bath.</li>
            <li> make it A LOT worse.</li>
            <li> Not to mention horrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;Really wanted it to work, as im trying to switch to natural products</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was wary about conditioning my roots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about cutting my hair, but since using these products, I have changed my mind.</li>
            <li> I am thinking I got a bad batch.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this conditioner - I bought both the shampoo and conditioner - and am very happy - my long hair feels silky and it&#x27;s very easy to brush now. I was thinking about cutting my hair, but since using these products, I have changed my mind. The organic ingredients are impressive - and the scent is fresh and pleasant. Well-priced for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few organic conditioners that smells great, I love the way my hair feels! Would recommend to eveyone!!</li>
            <li> Im not sure where all the positive feedback came from, but the product doesn&#x27;t work at all.

            <li> I really liked this conditioner, it smells very good and leaves my hair smooth. Though a little pricey but still worth it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is average - it has good natural ingredients but it made my hair limp and frizzy</li>
            <li> This smells great! You can use very little, massage it in at the roots, and when you rinse it will coat the rest of your hair and leave it soft. I will be buying this again. I want a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH THE SMELL!!!  I bought this because of all the awesome reviews.  The shampoo that goes with it is great.  The conditioner is so STANKY!! STANK STINK STUNK!!!  It smells like herbs, moss, medicine, nursing home, and I don&#x27;t even know what else. The smell lingers in my hair and I can smell it for days, even after I have used another shampoo and conditioner. I am thinking I got a bad batch. Everyone else says &amp;#34;a nice almond scent&amp;#34;. I love almond!  THIS IS NOT ALMOND.  I used it on my kids so at least I would not be wasting it.  MY HANDS STINK afterward.  My kids stink even worse than before they got in the bath. Yuck.  Sorry. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> That about says it all.  I haVe found that with shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s all about your individual hair and how it responds to differing products, this one was so/so for me and SO I won&#x27;t be going back to it. So far Moroccan is the one to beat for conditioning and fragrance...and no one can come close....</li>
            <li> Was looking for something paraban free this is a great product</li>
            <li> This is the second organic conditioner I have tried in two months. After my son was born, my scalp and hair have become very oily and itchy, with LOTS of dandruff, so I switched to organics. The first one I tried didn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy, but it did nothing to moisturize my hair either. This one made my hair greasy afterward after rinsing and my scalp became itchy after about a day .... I was really hoping it would work for me. I do love the smell of this conditioner though. I love the lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li> Love this! I love the smell and it makes my hair SOOOO soft. It has definitely helped with making my hair less dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She loves it and it smells fantastic. She&#x27;s constantly saying how great her hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Cheap for a good, healthy product for your hair. I just switched products recently, so this was a good alternative.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING.  It also works really well and I am super happy that it is free of potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I just bought this conditioner for no reason other than it&#x27;s one of the top conditioners on here. So glad I did. My hair is super soft now and it shines so hard that I can see all the highlights and undertones that I didn&#x27;t even know I had. I was wary about conditioning my roots (I have wavy-straight hair of medium thickness) because I didn&#x27;t want my hair to fall limp with too much moisture, but I condition, root to tip and have had no grease problems. Love it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care non chemical filled products that I have ever tried.  The smell reminds me of a day at the spa - it&#x27;s fresh and calming and leaves my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner - works great!</li>
            <li> Very nice product on first use. Did not like trying to tear the VERY small aluminum safety cover off the opening under the cover.  Could not get a grip easily.  Other than that, as I said, great product.  Thank you, Diane O. Gibson</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever! The ingredients couldn&#x27;t be any more natural or better for you! I love using it with the conditioner too</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner with the Moroccan argan stem cell +argan oil shampoo. I was left with what felt and acted like cotton candy. I plan to try a more cleansing shampoo and follow that with this conditioner to see if I have any better results.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful, partly organic product. It smells unbelievably good, leaves my hair very manageable. I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice conditioner...smells wonderful and leaves your hair and scalp felling nice..glad I found this..so nice to have natural ingredients in a product...</li>
            <li> Good conditioner! My hair feels a little greasier than normal, but that could be due to the accompanying shampoo?</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh, and very effective in conditioning your hair.  I quickly discovered that I did not need to use as much as other store bought conditioners...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wish this smell last little longer on my hair because I love this smell. It makes my hair shines too. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Only wish it were more economical.</li>
            <li> I switched to using organic products for all my body care needs about a year ago, and since then, I&#x27;d been using Intelligent Nutrients Harmonic Shampoo and Conditioner. Both are great products, but I like to switch things up after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I found Acure Organics thanks to nomoredirtylooks.com, and they reviewed a different product, but I know the authors of this blog don&#x27;t bother with items that aren&#x27;t good for your body and good for the Earth- both of which are important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy at first because I have very fine, oily hair and some shampoos and conditioners make it A LOT worse. On top of that, nobody with this hair type had reviewed this product. I bit the bullet and bought it. I used both the shampoo and conditioner yesterday at around 3 PM, and woke up this morning at around 10 AM with perfect hair. It still smelled like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the shower, and my hair was perfect, soft, smooth, and not oily at all, despite having slept on it all night. I felt like I&#x27;d just walked out of a salon!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I went for it and bought the pair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more, and I&#x27;m excited to try more things from Acure after this.</li>
            <li> My hair looks much less frizzy than it did, without loosing the body. I think it&#x27;s making my hair healthier, even though it&#x27;s damaged from highlights.</li>
            <li> I love that this conditioner is organic, vegan, and cruelty free! It&#x27;s also very efficient and works as a great de-tangler for my hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and has it looking silky, which is nice. It also smells fresh. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this conditioner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. Best natural conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;m a guy, with fairly thick hair, about medium length. My hair feels clean and smooth afterwards and looks great with a natural sheen.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff I got long curley hair and this product helps from blowing out and going wild.&lt;br /&gt;My honeybees love the smell too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural bath products and having the hardest time with shampoo and conditioner (I also bought the shampoo and it&#x27;s amazing).  I&#x27;ve been using herbal essences long-term relationship conditioner for a while and I get very similar results with this one just without all of the chemicals.  I can only use it on the ends of my hair, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal because I&#x27;ve never been able to use any conditioner near my scalp.</li>
            <li> Good products. I use the shampoo and conditioner together</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it has brought back the health, vibrance and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Acure. In my book they do no wrong. This conditioner is the bees knees as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It smells wonderful and is delightfully creamy.</li>
            <li> I had awful, oily and static hair after using this conditioner. Total waste of money with no results. Will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, Love the smell of this conditioner. It makes my hair very soft. I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is top notch for a good price. The smell is not overwhelming, but it is very very pleasant. I will definitely be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Product really is awesome! I cannot believe the difference this conditioner makes. My hair is healthy !!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I read all the conflicting reviews, and ordered this and Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Shampoo at the same time to compare.  Here&#x27;s what I decided:  1) this shampoo is good, but not great.  Even if I was confident in its ingredients, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Dr. Christopher&#x27;s is harder to work with, but my hair feels cleaner (and looks cleaner) after each use.  My advice: just skip it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner! I have never, ever experienced a conditioner like this. Usually my hair is weighed down by conditioners. Not with this. I have body, volume, and movement. And, I don&#x27;t have to rotate conditioners, either. It just keeps working great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very very nice. I think it&#x27;s the best I have ever used. I like to leave it in for a while and it makes my hair feel great. The smell makes it---it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair without making it greasy. I like this conditioner but it is not my absolute favorite natural brand. However, this brand is by far rolling with the right price. I keep coming back to it because of that. I know I can rely on the product and the lemongrass smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Holy good lord.  The unicorns, fairies and gnomes really know their scents.  There has to be magic in this tube.  Unbelievable!  WOW!  I could nearly eat this stuff it&#x27;s so good.....</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It seems to really penetrate my hair leaving it soft and healthy.  And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight Asian hair that tends to be oily at the roots, dry at the ends, and fall out too much in the shower with bad hair products. It is difficult to find a natural hair products that can meet my hair needs. I use this conditioner with the matching shampoo. I love this product line because my hair feels clean, light, soft, and shiny. I still have a few strands that fall out during washes but much less than before. And my husband and I like the fresh, earthy smell. I wash my hair every other day and my only complaint is that my scalp feels oily by the end of the unwashed day. If you have oily hair, you probably cannot miss more than one day of cleaning and I predict that this conditioner may be too heavy during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have stumbled across this conditioner. I wanted to try the all natural route as I was reading that some of the major ingredients in store bought brands, damage your hair. This conditioner is light, yet still gets all the tangles out. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. It does not weigh down your hair, nor does it cause build up. It really is a refreshing product that I plan to use for years to come.</li>
            <li> As many others rave, this is a standout conditioner - both in ingredients and results.  All-natural, paraben and cruelty free, the formulation is a great eco-friendly choice.  The product tames, softens, and untangles my very fine and delicate hair leaving it (amazingly) full.  Loved this line so much, I bought the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It smells great and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Overpowering smell too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it makes my hair oily, I believe most of the organic products take time to get use to. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;l b buying this again though. It&#x27;s too expensive for me. Still looking that perfect organic shampoo....</li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner! I love that this conditioner does not coat my hair or leave it feeling heavy. I have thick, coarse Asian hair and this conditioner gives it a perfect amount of moisture without making it feel greasy. The smell is also really heavenly!</li>
            <li> Love love love! My hair was on the dry coarse side. I have used it 4 times so far. Made my hair much noticeably softer without the greasiness. It&#x27;s very natural clean and hydrating.</li>
            <li> Yet another great product from Acure Organics! This is a wonderful everyday conditioner that will leave your hair hydrated, baby soft, moisturized without feeling heavy, and nourished. I love it as well as the rest of the Acure Organics Shampoo/Conditioner line. Has a lovely Lemongrass/Tea smell that is natural and pleasant. Highly recommend. Feel free to pair this with any shampoo of your choice out of the line, or even another brand.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll up my rating later... trying it for a few weeks now and undecided. No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either. Hoping it is working! Does not seem to be drying my hair out, so that&#x27;s good! Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good. I like that this seems to have good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair in perfect condition.  I have thinner hair, but a lot of it, so it works well in giving it some weight and volume.  That&#x27;s pretty rare!</li>
            <li> My hair smells great and is soft. I also use the conditioner for shaving my legs. It leaves my skin nice and soft, too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair looking and feeling like I&#x27;ve not used a conditioner at all. It seems to have no effect at all, except to leave me smelling of lemongrass (initially found charming, now grating). It is very thick and creamy, so you think it really means business. But after I wash it out my hair is exactly like it was before using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Treat conditioner, which is a somewhat just-above-mediocre conditioner, but it *does* work, it does actually condition and leave your hair much better off after using. This cannot be said for this Lemongrass stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many weak and mediocre conditioners in my time, but this is the most worthless I&#x27;ve ever used. Which is even more disappointing because of the high price and the eco-friendliness.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 20 yr old grandson who is very health conscious. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I was convinced my shampoo was causing my neck to break out in a rash. Happy to report no more break outs, and this conditioner leaves your hair silky and smooth. The smell might be a little off-putting for some people, it kind of reminds me of Noxema in smell, but I absolutely love that smell.</li>
            <li> This might be a great conditioner for some people, but it does not work well in my hair. It smells fine and it makes my hair easy to comb after washing and conditioning it, but my hair stays dry on the top and gets oily underneath. It lays very flat and has absolutely no body at all. It looks OK when I blow it dry, but not as good as it does when I use either Unite shampoo and conditioner or Biolage. I&#x27;ve gone back to my 2 favorites and will deal with the dryness another way. I&#x27;m thinking about using intermittent treatments on my hair instead of trying to put moisture in it with each shampooing. I have a ton of hair but it is very fine and limp and this is not the best brand for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great natural product!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it along with the ingredients it contains.  I left it on my hair a little longer than suggested, but I feel as though it helped. I have not used it long enough to really tell all of the attributes, but my hair was softer, like the feel of a baby&#x27;s soft hair.  Normally my hair is not soft, so I loved it.  Just hoping that the Argon Oil that it contains helps to promote growth.  Will update!!</li>
            <li> I first used this with the Lemongrass Shampoo which used together gave me an itchy scalp and a perfumey smell, plus buildup.  So then I tried using the conditioner with a different brand shampoo which made this conditioner smell better.  With the different shampoo the conditioner did a fair job of conditioning, no itch or buildup and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  Left my hair feeling normal.</li>
            <li> My hair is happy and this stuff smells AMAZING!  I find myself wanting to wash my hair more often just for how great it smells.  Also, my hair is shiny, much less frizzy but not weighed down.  It&#x27;s my new fav!</li>
            <li> I really tried hard to like this conditioner but it left my hair really oily. I used it on my daughter as well and her hair was so greasy that she had to take a 2nd shower. It smells great, but I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this smells wonderful and makes my hair and scalp feel good. if you have long hair it will run out fast though, i wish they had a larger size</li>
            <li> I have been trying out organic conditioners and hated when it came down to conditioning my long hair it would become a ratted mess. My hair has never felt smoother and my frizzies have completely gone away. This conditioner does what it says! I am also impressed that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, but rather a smooth and glass-like shine, and just perfect! A must have in your shower or bath.</li>
            <li> I need to use only natural non toxic products and up until new there was never a conditioner without chemicals available. This company saved me! Their products are safe and really good.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to everything, like I am, try Acure products.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a natural shampoo and conditioner. Every one I have tried has left my hair dry at the roots and gross and greasy at the roots. Not this stuff! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but if I can help anyone find this gem it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner - love it</li>
            <li> Smells INCREDIBLE (like fresh lemongrass and cardamom)&lt;br /&gt;All natural&lt;br /&gt;A bit on the thin side, but conditions hair well with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite thing and will never stop using</li>
            <li> Since I found this conditioner, I haven&#x27;t bought any other. In my search for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve tried numerous products. It&#x27;s not necessarily that those products were bad - it&#x27;s just that this one is the full package. My recent efforts to transition to more healthful products with organic ingredients (rather than chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce) is what initially led me to this product. It smells great. It contains natural ingredients. It&#x27;s vegan, gluten free, sulfate free, paraben free, phthalate free, cruelty free, no synthetic fragrance, 100% biodegradable AND color safe which is especially important for my bright red-dyed hair. I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products in the past and they typically leave my hair feeling stringy and limp, but that&#x27;s far from the case with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short curly hair and this product leaves it feeling truly conditioned and so soft and tangle free that I literally NEVER comb my hair. I just add some OGX coconut milk anti-breakage serum and either Lush R&amp;B hair moisturizer or Macadamia leave-in cream (on more humid days) and let it air dry. Once the hair dries a bit, I tilt my head down and break it up with my fingers with light circular motions at my scalp. I can talk all day about how good I think it looks, but the true test is what others (who are much more objective than I) think. Random strangers approach me - at restaurants, stores, even doctors&#x27; offices - and tell me they love my hair. It&#x27;s almost embarrassing how often this happens, but I take it as a sign I&#x27;m doing something right.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and the matching shampoo! I had to find something organic for a camping trip. At first, I tried the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap &amp; Shikakai hair rinse, which my hair absolutely hated. On my second try, I found this! It&#x27;s lightweight, but also keeps my hair moisturized enough, which is no easy task - I have fine (thin strands), but thick (a LOT of them) hair, so it tends to get weighted down and fall flat...but it also dries out easily...but it also looks greasy within a day of not washing. Super annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this conditioner and the shampoo, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering. Then when we went camping, we got burglarized of about 75% of our stuff, including this, so I got to test how well the effects lasted for 4 days. By the last day, I did feel gross, but not nearly as bad as it would have been with my regular s &amp; c!</li>
            <li> after using this conditioner my formerly dry fly away hair elicited comments from friends as they noticed my hair was calm and moist. No more frizz! Yea!</li>
            <li> Yummah, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel rejuvenated like biolage does.  I&#x27;ve been using it every other time, and it&#x27;s nice for a switch, but ultimately I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
