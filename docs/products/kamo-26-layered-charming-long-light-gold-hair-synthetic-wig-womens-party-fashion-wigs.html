            <li>This wig is so amazing!  </li>
            <li>Ok, this wig is awesome.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>If you need a wig for a costume and want a balance between cost and construction, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>the highlights are good</li>
            <li>I love this wig, your are paying ship for something that is really good!</li>
            <li>It looks awesome on, it&#x27;s really full and fits snug.</li>
            <li>I love it and need it in every color!</li>
            <li>I cosplayed aurora and looked cute as a button!</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this wig and shop more!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s truely amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing deal.</li>
            <li>the color of this will be a bit lighter than the picture, but it does have a nice all over highlight look.</li>
            <li>Love love love this wig!</li>
            <li>i love love love love this wig!</li>
            <li>That is all, and I strongly stand by &amp;#34;pictures or it didn&#x27;t happen&amp;#34; so here you go, shows how amazing it looks</li>
            <li>I find tucking in the sides of the bangs that are puffy helps it look more realist.</li>
            <li>They look like someone took scissors top them-</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also much more highlighted than the picture led me to believe.  </li>
            <li>UMMMM can I just say that I&#x27;m in love?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s has a lovely thickness to it</li>
            <li>OK, so let me start off my saying that this wig got to my home in record timing.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>Looks ok with a hat on.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d get a couple of wears out of it, but I got way more than that.  </li>
            <li>I invested in a cheap wig brush and some detangler, and it looked just like it did out of the box!  </li>
            <li>The thickness of this wig is what makes it look real and is great for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing fit, full, material!</li>
            <li>at first i loved it</li>
            <li>The wig is a bit more wavy and lighter than I expected from the photo, but I was really impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>Very full volume.</li>
            <li>, it is nice and straight, very easy to comb</li>
            <li>The wig is pretty good, nothing too special but not terrible either.  </li>
            <li>This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a wig.</li>
            <li>The wig can tangle in unideal conditions, but it&#x27;s easy to get the knots out of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bangs are precut and the variation of the blonde is beautifully done.</li>
            <li>The color is great, like a strawberry blonde with platinum/golden highlights.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as cheap as it was.</li>
            <li>They sent me light</li>
            <li>This wig is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>Overall this wig has some great side and some less then great sides.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a really pretty wig for a great price.</li>
            <li>It is really really thick, which is great!</li>
            <li>Love this wig, it is stunning and very flowy and natural.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, wow!</li>
            <li>The bangs were more blunt and short and it had chunky white stripes in the crown, instead of a nice blond.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the best wig I&#x27;v bought so far, the quality is definitely 5 star worthy, and it got here sooner than expected</li>
            <li>Still looks good, but brings the rating down to 4 out of 5!</li>
            <li>Okay quality, but had to send it back.</li>
            <li>also, this wig doesn&#x27;t tangle at the back or bottom from all day wear like most synthetic wigs do.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got a lot more platinum in it than the picture, and not at all strawberry blonde looking like the photo.</li>
            <li>I was issued an immediate refund and sincere apology without even having to ask or send the wig back.  </li>
            <li>It was nice and thick, didn&#x27;t lose a lot of hair, and was easy to cut and style.  </li>
            <li>What can I say about this wig, long, thick, beautiful and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t totally what I was going for with the bangs, but the overall quality is so good for the price, I&#x27;m going to keep it and use it for that reason.</li>
            <li>It fits a large head.</li>
            <li>The actual color is much more natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, could be better but not bad, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>wig is absolutely, G O R G E O U S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The highlights are very platinum.</li>
            <li>but it gets tangled too much.</li>
            <li>The blonde isn&#x27;t totally like the picture, but it&#x27;s nice and has some strawberry blonde(ish)</li>
            <li>I used this for a costume party â€“ it&#x27;s good and thick, you can&#x27;t see the netting at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s silky, it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, it brushes well, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Its thin on top and shows the netting easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty soft as well.</li>
            <li>It sheds a lot and also gets tangled, but since it&#x27;s straight hair its not hard to comb that out.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many wigs for our company for Cinderella..and this one takes the cake hands down.</li>
            <li>Long and thick, very low-frizz, great ashy-blonde color.</li>
            <li>Even though I would rather go with a lace front wig (looks more natural), this one isn&#x27;t bad and looks pretty nice with a hat.</li>
            <li>The length of this wig with the thickness, regrettably, makes this wig less likely to pass off as your own hair.</li>
            <li>The wig was a little darker and had some more highlights than are in the picture, but it looked natural and I didn&#x27;t think it was a problem.</li>
            <li>The color was NOT blonde in fact it was this ashy light brown color with white highlights.</li>
            <li>So, not sure if I am going to be able to use it for the intended Renaissance costume,</li>
            <li>I bought it to do cosplay, as I do work as a cosplayer at a local comic shop chain.  </li>
            <li>This wig looks exactly like the picture although I can&#x27;t style the bangs quite the same.</li>
            <li>Okay well I&#x27;m actually a cross-dresser, and I saw the price tag for this wig thinking &amp;#34;meh, it might be average in quality,</li>
            <li>Color is fantastic, highlights look natural, and it&#x27;s super thick!</li>
            <li>You will not have to worry about being able to see the wig cap or the wig separating in the back to reveal where your hair is hidden.</li>
            <li>streaks in it near the roots as well.</li>
            <li>, you have to do hot water submersion with sponge rollers and let it dry for 24-48</li>
            <li>While this wig doesn&#x27;t look natural at the part, it is much higher quality than your average costume wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s a wig and not natural hair, so if you&#x27;re going for something to pass off as your real hair, this isn&#x27;t the wig for you.</li>
            <li>Super soft and thick, doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the color is not as pictured, which is actually what I was hoping for based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>The highlights that other reviewers mention are pretty obvious, but they&#x27;re not too big; we needed it pulled back into a ponytail, so they were easy to hide, but if you need to wear it long they shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Full and thick.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very long, and upon trying it on the first time it shed a few hairs but considering how thick it is and the price i paid for it, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>but i wish there was more in the lower levels (i bought this to wear half up, half down).</li>

            <li> they are flat across not flowy or layered.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t get it to lay flat, and it took a lot of effort to hide.</li>
            <li> blonde not golden blonde</li>
            <li> Long with volume and layers.</li>
            <li> Long.</li>
            <li> definitely what i expected.</li>
            <li> Still, I kept it since it may be usable for some other costume, and it&#x27;s definitely well made.</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this wig due to the reviews I read, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bangs because they were a little to long and bothered my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking off a star because it&#x27;s not exactly this shade</li>
            <li> Wig is a little heavy, not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest wigs I own, I was completely shocked!</li>
            <li> The hair is very thick and soft.</li>
            <li> Second, this wig is surprisingly thick</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quickly I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser though, so I can fix everything I dislike about this wig, a little length off, some added layers.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a black wig as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a costume and it withstood several days of being twisted, sprayed, and lugged around a convention without sustaining damage.  </li>
            <li> However, it does have these two AWFUL chuncky highlights on the top with</li>

            <li> It is indeed thick, but I won&#x27;t wear it with the short icky bangs and bad attempt at highlights Update:  </li>
            <li> They were short and ugly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style wigs often, maybe this is common!).</li>
            <li> This wig is so thick!</li>
            <li> Yes, the wig was very soft but the color was very ugly.</li>
            <li> because I know the pain of a thin wig.</li>
            <li> Plenty of hair, very thick!</li>

            <li> All I have to say is WOOOOOOWW! I have purchased many wigs for our company for Cinderella..and this one takes the cake hands down. It&#x27;s Soooo incredibly thick. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are precut and the variation of the blonde is beautifully done. It looks like real hair. It fits a large head. So so beautiful. It won&#x27;t curl with a steam iron though, you have to do hot water submersion with sponge rollers and let it dry for 24-48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truely amazing.</li>
            <li> Looked NOTHING like the picture. Okay quality, but had to send it back.</li>
            <li> This wig is so thick! I love it and need it in every color! The part looks fake, but it&#x27;s winter time and I will wear hats with it. This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a wig. It&#x27;s so worth it! I find tucking in the sides of the bangs that are puffy helps it look more realist.</li>
            <li> Great Wig for the price. Super soft and thick, doesn&#x27;t tangle. Not too shiny. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The color is great, like a strawberry blonde with platinum/golden highlights. The length/feel/thickness is great.&lt;br /&gt;However the bangs are not even similar to those on the photos. They look like someone took scissors top them-they are flat across not flowy or layered. So i rated it 3 because the bangs were a big reason i purchased the wig. Going to still wear it with a hat only though.</li>
            <li> Love love love this wig! Color is fantastic, highlights look natural, and it&#x27;s super thick!</li>
            <li> It looks awesome on, it&#x27;s really full and fits snug.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Long with volume and layers. I had to trim the bangs because they were a little to long and bothered my eyes. But overall it&#x27;s a really pretty wig for a great price.</li>
            <li> I did not realize from the pic that the wig has bangs.  So, not sure if I am going to be able to use it for the intended Renaissance costume, and it&#x27;s also much more highlighted than the picture led me to believe.  Still, I kept it since it may be usable for some other costume, and it&#x27;s definitely well made.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this wig, long, thick, beautiful and easy to manage. I wanted to try something really different and I did. I absolutely love it, wow!</li>
            <li> UMMMM can I just say that I&#x27;m in love? That is all, and I strongly stand by &amp;#34;pictures or it didn&#x27;t happen&amp;#34; so here you go, shows how amazing it looks</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty good, nothing too special but not terrible either.  The blonde isn&#x27;t totally like the picture, but it&#x27;s nice and has some strawberry blonde(ish) streaks in it near the roots as well. It sheds a lot and also gets tangled, but since it&#x27;s straight hair its not hard to comb that out. It is really really thick, which is great! It&#x27;s also pretty soft as well. Even though I would rather go with a lace front wig (looks more natural), this one isn&#x27;t bad and looks pretty nice with a hat. Overall, could be better but not bad, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit more wavy and lighter than I expected from the photo, but I was really impressed with the quality. It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as cheap as it was. If you need a wig for a costume and want a balance between cost and construction, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> i love love love love this wig! it&#x27;s very thick, and it doesnt give that annoying artificial shine look in photos. the highlights are good but i wish there was more in the lower levels (i bought this to wear half up, half down). the color of this will be a bit lighter than the picture, but it does have a nice all over highlight look. also, this wig doesn&#x27;t tangle at the back or bottom from all day wear like most synthetic wigs do.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a costume and it withstood several days of being twisted, sprayed, and lugged around a convention without sustaining damage.  It was nice and thick, didn&#x27;t lose a lot of hair, and was easy to cut and style.  The wig was a little darker and had some more highlights than are in the picture, but it looked natural and I didn&#x27;t think it was a problem.</li>
            <li> The style and color were totally different compared to the picture being displayed. I was excited to recieve this wig due to the reviews I read, but boy was I wrong. The wig doesnt look a thing like the picture. The color was NOT blonde in fact it was this ashy light brown color with white highlights. The bangs were not like the picture displayed. They were short and ugly. Yes, the wig was very soft but the color was very ugly. This isn&#x27;t that warm blonde like the picture, this wig is ashy light brown/gold with white nasty highlights.</li>
            <li> I used this for a costume party â€“ it&#x27;s good and thick, you can&#x27;t see the netting at all. Very convincing!  My brother came to the party, and didn&#x27;t even recognize me!</li>
            <li> Ok, this wig is awesome. I present for you photo evidence! I cosplayed aurora and looked cute as a button!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this wig.  It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s silky, it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, it brushes well, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this wig, it is stunning and very flowy and natural. Plenty of hair, very thick!</li>
            <li> It really is a great wig. Thick. Long. Adjustable. Wore it to a party and someone tried to steal it. ðŸ˜‚</li>
            <li> Okay well I&#x27;m actually a cross-dresser, and I saw the price tag for this wig thinking &amp;#34;meh, it might be average in quality, I guess&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SO wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is absolutely, G O R G E O U S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s has a lovely thickness to it, it is nice and straight, very easy to comb/maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best wig I&#x27;v bought so far, the quality is definitely 5 star worthy, and it got here sooner than expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star quality, 5 star sender/delivery</li>
            <li> OK, so let me start off my saying that this wig got to my home in record timing. I was shocked at how quickly I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few things about the actual wig that I&#x27;m not particularly happy nor unhappy with. Firstly, the color is not as pictured, which is actually what I was hoping for based on other reviews. The actual color is much more natural and pretty. However, it does have these two AWFUL chuncky highlights on the top with I can&#x27;t stand to look at so I wear a beanie with it. Second, this wig is surprisingly thick and I absolutely LOVE because I know the pain of a thin wig. You can&#x27;t see the tracks at all. The length of this wig with the thickness, regrettably, makes this wig less likely to pass off as your own hair. Overall this wig has some great side and some less then great sides. I&#x27;m a hairdresser though, so I can fix everything I dislike about this wig, a little length off, some added layers. BAM! Perfect-O. Definitely 5 stars if your looking for a display/costume wig.</li>
            <li> Looks ok with a hat on. Its thin on top and shows the netting easily. Good for halloween and doesnt tangle eaily thats really impressive and has a nice curly wave at the bottom</li>
            <li> I want one in every color! It&#x27;s an amazing fit, full, material!</li>
            <li> I love this wig, your are paying ship for something that is really good!</li>
            <li> definitely what i expected. the wig is a sandy blonde color, and there&#x27;s some neat highlights. it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s a wig and not natural hair, so if you&#x27;re going for something to pass off as your real hair, this isn&#x27;t the wig for you. it&#x27;s very long, and upon trying it on the first time it shed a few hairs but considering how thick it is and the price i paid for it, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> This wig is so amazing!  I bought it to do cosplay, as I do work as a cosplayer at a local comic shop chain.  I figured I&#x27;d get a couple of wears out of it, but I got way more than that.  The wig can tangle in unideal conditions, but it&#x27;s easy to get the knots out of.  I invested in a cheap wig brush and some detangler, and it looked just like it did out of the box!  I cannot recommend this wig and shop more!  I ended up getting a black wig as well!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Dragon Age cosplay, beautiful wig! Long and thick, very low-frizz, great ashy-blonde color. The highlights that other reviewers mention are pretty obvious, but they&#x27;re not too big; we needed it pulled back into a ponytail, so they were easy to hide, but if you need to wear it long they shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious if you want to do anything drastic with the bangs, though-- we tried to part them to make it look like they were part of the ponytail, but underneath there&#x27;s all this short frizzy hair (to give volume, maybe? I don&#x27;t style wigs often, maybe this is common!). We couldn&#x27;t get it to lay flat, and it took a lot of effort to hide. Still looks good, but brings the rating down to 4 out of 5!</li>
            <li> They sent me light blonde not golden blonde please don&#x27;t  buy. Thire color is not the same as usa colors. Thank you</li>
            <li> Amazing deal. Very full volume. The thickness of this wig is what makes it look real and is great for the price. You will not have to worry about being able to see the wig cap or the wig separating in the back to reveal where your hair is hidden. The highlights are very platinum. The bangs are shorter making them manageable and out of your face.  I wish there was different color options so I could buy another!</li>
            <li> This wig looks exactly like the picture although I can&#x27;t style the bangs quite the same. Bought it for a halloween costume (Alice in Wonderland) so haven&#x27;t worn it for any length of time. The hair is very thick and soft. Wig is a little heavy, not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li> This wig is fantastic. It&#x27;s SO thick, tons of hair, you can&#x27;t see the netting at all. The part is well done. I&#x27;m knocking off a star because it&#x27;s not exactly this shade, it&#x27;s got a lot more platinum in it than the picture, and not at all strawberry blonde looking like the photo. The bangs are also shorter. Wasn&#x27;t totally what I was going for with the bangs, but the overall quality is so good for the price, I&#x27;m going to keep it and use it for that reason.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like the photo when it arrived.  The bangs were more blunt and short and it had chunky white stripes in the crown, instead of a nice blond.  It is indeed thick, but I won&#x27;t wear it with the short icky bangs and bad attempt at highlights Update:  I was issued an immediate refund and sincere apology without even having to ask or send the wig back.  Very reputable company!</li>
            <li> Full and thick.  One of the nicest wigs I own, I was completely shocked!</li>
            <li> While this wig doesn&#x27;t look natural at the part, it is much higher quality than your average costume wig. I got tons of compliments when I wore it to a party.</li>
            <li> at first i loved it but it gets tangled too much.</li>
