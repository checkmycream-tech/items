    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It takes a real good eye to zero in on errant hairs and pluck them.</li>
            <li>The points on my pair match up perfectly.</li>
            <li>But I cannot give this a perfect score.</li>
            <li>For some reason, these are not as awesome as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the name file was excellent and the scissors were just about perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a really awesome kit.</li>
            <li>So, all but the case is excellent.</li>
            <li>My husband evaluated this item.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, he did not find it to be very good compared to others that he has had/used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>He loved it !</li>
            <li>Would be a great gift for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman tools that come in this case, like all Tweezerman tools, are great.</li>
            <li>Great tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially important for men that use them to cut their eyebrows.</li>
            <li>If the file part wasn&#x27;t surrounded by plastic, it would be great.</li>
            <li>Great shears, clippers, etc.  </li>
            <li>scissors are great as well.</li>
            <li>The tools themselves are great.</li>
            <li>This is a great grooming set... and a nice, mid-price Father&#x27;s Day gift.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality trimming set.  </li>
            <li>Good quality implements</li>
            <li>Pointed tweezers are good for picking out and removing ingrown hairs on the neck and face from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended for the good quality implements.</li>
            <li>The nail file-cleaner-thing is good.</li>
            <li>Good to have</li>
            <li>Good set for guys.</li>
            <li>nail file is quite good but in the one month of testing, I already feel that the file is has reduced efficiency.</li>
            <li>These scissors are exceptional for those nagging hairs that develop as we men age in places</li>
            <li>Good quality, I liked it</li>
            <li>All tools seem to be made of good quality with the exception of the case, which is not holding the 4 items nicely - it has a baggy feeling to it.</li>
            <li>First off, I have used Tweezerman tweezers and clippers before and find their grooming tools to be excellent in quality and durability.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes the best grooming implements I have found anywhere, and this set is reasonably priced for what&#x27;s included in it.  </li>
            <li>stainless surgical quality tweezers and scissors are especially impressive.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is a nice idea, but I think they may have cheaped out a bit with</li>
            <li>The nailclippers made a nice even cut that didn&#x27;t even need filing.</li>
            <li>and nail clippers are nice and work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice gift for someone who isn&#x27;t too demanding.  </li>
            <li>One end is the pusher, one end is a nail cleaner, and there&#x27;s a handy file on the side to make up for the lack of one on the clippers.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has to do with the pattern: when the nail pieces start accumulating in the grooves, you are effectively “un-sharpening” the file.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say this is a nice starter kit.</li>
            <li>They sure look good in the box.</li>
            <li>The scissors are particularly nice.  </li>
            <li>this was a gft and the recipient was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>There is a small space within the case specifically for the scissors that is perfectly positioned (great idea).&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers come with a covering which is also a great idea since they are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;All of the items within the grooming case</li>
            <li>I would have liked a better case to protect the implements.  </li>
            <li>If a guy needs some grooming items, this is a nice kit that includes most of what he&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>Also, I travel a lot and tend to look for good quality and light (in weight) tools to carry with me on trips.  </li>
            <li>The combination file/nail cleaner/cuticle pusher is, by far, the best of the kit.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about the prospect of having a good case to hold them in when put in with my toiletries, but found this case to be a strap of leather with holes on either side.</li>
            <li>It has a very comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are sharper and more precise than any of the assortment I already own.  </li>
            <li>They will get the most use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fingernail clippers are growing on me.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are okay, though I prefer [[ASIN:B00AAJOZN4</li>
            <li>And the nail file is also just okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think you are better off buying the tools you need separately and skipping this set altogether.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if they&#x27;re rust inhibited over time, but I had no issue using these, and was grateful that they weren&#x27;t curved like so many others.  </li>
            <li>Better off throwing them in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>file is just ok.  </li>
            <li>If anything more is needed then washing with a nail brush is recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t intuitive, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>favorite tool is the cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>scissors are just okay.</li>
            <li>But no matter, you probably won&#x27;t be able to see that pesky hair anyway.  </li>
            <li>tweezers are top notch.  </li>
            <li>An ok set....</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>I just wish the design was a bit better so that I could cut my nails without pain.</li>
            <li>The safety scissors are great for trimming unwanted hairs, and the precision tweezers work very well.</li>
            <li>I figured a couple bucks more for the kit rather than just the scissors was justifiable.</li>
            <li>I love the tools in the case, very nice to travel with since the items are together and ready to go (I did add an emery board.)</li>
            <li>There is one slot where the scissors fit snugly, but everything else rattles around and falls out very easily.  </li>
            <li>It looks good being presented and does have great if limited usefulness.</li>
            <li>nail clippers do a pretty good job, but they do not have a built in nail catcher.  </li>
            <li>Price is not my top concern, I want something that does a good job and lasts a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The machined quality of each tool is top-notch and precise, which is the standard for Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>cut is good, they don&#x27;t leave jagged edges, so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li>However this is still a very decent kit and a good value at this</li>
            <li>Scissors are very good with tiny curled ends.  </li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t care much about the leather pouch, this is a good quality grooming kit.</li>
            <li>great tweezers, effective nail cleaner, cutters are ok but not for nails, the clippers were good also but not great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leather with a snap closure, which would be great except most of the side areas are open.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the tweezers fall out easily.</li>
            <li>In practice, the nail clipper can easily fall out of the opening in travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers and scissors are a strong steel and the cuticle pusher/nail file are steel and well made.  </li>
            <li>No, that&#x27;s not because my mails are that strong.</li>
            <li>The items are great, really good quality; the case, which is one of the main reason you get a travel kit, is very poor at best.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and perfect for all your detail</li>
            <li>These are fine.  </li>
            <li>A fine collection of grooming instruments.</li>
            <li>I love the included tweezers, they are super detailed and grab on to the tiniest hair.  </li>
            <li>They work amazingly accurately on the edges of my mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But what&#x27;s the point of a case if it doesn&#x27;t secure the contents?</li>
            <li>Three of the pieces have a nice satin finish which gives them a richer look than shiny stainless steel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great file, but the way it&#x27;s designed (again, design problem) I can&#x27;t get to the edges of my nails, only the tips.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap</li>
            <li>, it looks cheap, it smells cheap</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, sturdy, sharp and useful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a way to close, and the tools just slide around, and it seems like it would be easy to lose a tool by sliding out the top.  </li>
            <li>Its ok for limited smoothing work, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as the disposable type.</li>
            <li>The small scissors are perfect for trimming eyebrows (because, of course, you don&#x27;t just pluck them).  </li>
            <li>Metal nail file has a pointed nail cleaner on the end that can gently clean under the nails.  </li>
            <li>(However, it is still very effective, so long as you remember to clean the file</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice looking pouch that snaps shut and looks professional, neat.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are more of a matte finish and don&#x27;t really match the rest of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would probably make a good stocking stuffer or something simple to bring along on vacation.</li>
            <li>Many of cuticle tools I’ve seen are too rounded to do the job very well.  </li>
            <li>The implements are all decent but pretty average--nothing all that great but not shoddy either.</li>
            <li>Although this finely crafted set is designed and well suited for the traveler, I have opted to add it to one of my emergency first aid</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most of them will last years.</li>
            <li>Blunt-ended scissors have sharp effective edges and enable safe grooming of nose and ear hairs</li>
            <li>Overall a great, high quality kit.</li>
            <li>All the included stainless steel tools (a small pair of scissors, a nail clipper, a point tweezer and a two-sided nail file with nail cleaning edges) are of excellent quality and perform well.</li>
            <li>On a recent nature hike, I got a splinter on my foot, and I put the tweezers to good use the first time.  </li>
            <li>You can only really use the tweezers for infected hairs or pulling thorns and such out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mulit tool is perfect!  </li>
            <li>facial hair scissors are nice and have rounded tips to prevent jabbing yourself.  </li>
            <li>It came in handy several times.  </li>
            <li>was primarily because the items in the kit did not fit snuggly in the case.&lt;br /&gt;The case was also not made of a good quality</li>
            <li>The nail file is pretty cool, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before.</li>
            <li>You get very high quality tools that are all very useful for lady grooming, as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as any other pair of Inox scissors I have come across.</li>
            <li>These seem just right.  </li>
            <li>I received it right before spending five months abroad</li>
            <li>They have safety bulbs at the end; however, if you really want to poke yourself in the eye, you can easily do that with the tweezers that are very pointy.</li>
            <li>As a present though I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate.</li>
            <li>combination tool gives you a nail file (metal), and has two tips for cuticle tasks, one fairly square with a slightly rounded end</li>
            <li>clipper is typical Tweezerman quality, which is good.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman tweezers are generally pretty good; the clippers less so.</li>
            <li>I use the nail trimmer and toenail trimmer the most, and they are both sharp, accurate and reliable.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the pouch has a special slot for it so that the point can be properly stored.</li>
            <li>Giving them as gifts to nephews who will appreciate them over the next many years in their lives.  </li>
            <li>the items should be safe enough.</li>
            <li>the first go round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>package comes with a leather case, which is OK, although I am not going to knock off any points for that since the carrying case is not an essential element of this gear, it is provided for convenience and that in itself is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything else (and for sure the clippers which state &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;), is likely made in China.</li>
            <li>This set would be much better if it came with a case that actually held the items in it.  </li>
            <li>But I expect this to be an item you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up at a discount type store for last years fashions maybe re-boxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have several pairs of nail clippers, of varying quality, but these seem to make a clean a really clean cut making the filing job easier.  </li>
            <li>It is just way too long to clean nails in a precise way.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  </li>
            <li>This means that all the tools fall right out of it (except for the scissors, which you can secure in an inner slot).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;multitool&amp;#34; is for, but I think it&#x27;s good for dealing with nail issues.</li>
            <li>I expected to really like this set, since I pretty much love all things Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>As with most Tweezerman tools, they cut well and don’t have that loose feel associated with cheaper scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nail clippers are very high quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissors are tight and real sharp - a bit unique and the star of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emory board is good for a small metal one, but normally the disposable ones work better in practice plus this one is super fine.</li>
            <li>Its a handy little tool kit, got it as a travel kit for my husband.</li>
            <li>Recommended highly!</li>
            <li>Expected better quality</li>
            <li>As others have pointed out, the case doesn&#x27;t really hold things in very well (too flimsy).</li>
            <li>Still, I do like Tweezerman tools over some cheapo brand, plus I won&#x27;t really be tossing it around too much, so</li>
            <li>I keep it in my travel case so it is always ready</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the instruments.</li>
            <li>This is a very puzzling grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very roughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no way possible for it to hold all the tools securely.  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a very functional kit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use that one as much.</li>
            <li>However, reviewing the kit itself, it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
            <li>I have several pair of tweezerman tweezers, some are more than 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>But overall the package is solid, and the leather pouch is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The tweezers have sharp ends, like two needles, and would be great for ingrown hairs, but other than that, I can&#x27;t see much use for them.  </li>
            <li>You won’t cut yourself, but they are not rounded like most other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most guys i know don&#x27;t use and probably done even know that these sharp point type tweezers exist.</li>
            <li>It files, has a pointier tip to clean nails and a rounded tip to push cuticles back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this a great kit and the only other areas I see for improvement might be to include a smaller nail cleaning tool with a somewhat narrower tip.</li>
            <li>The arm pivots easily and stays in place, both closed and open.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mainly the fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>If you squeeze with these, the point of the tweezers is more likely to cut the hair off than actually help you extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would be 4 to 5 stars if it had a decent case you could trust to hold everything.</li>
            <li>pouch, as many reviewers have noted, is large enough but have too much opening when closed.</li>
            <li>They are compact, sharp and the jaws are wider than clippers like the MEHAZ 660 Professional - which used to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are sturdy and built to last, and they clamp down on each nail with a highly satisfying CLINK!</li>
            <li>The stainless steel facial hair scissors are made in Italy (it is engraved with &amp;#34;Italy&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the items have been useful, definitely won&#x27;t depend on the nail file or the pouch.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are just standard clippers, nothing too exciting.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out how to put the things in it correctly so that when it tilts left to right, the stuff doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>but normally one will use other tweezers for primary tasks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>leather case is padded a little, but the items don&#x27;t really fit inside very well.</li>
            <li>It seems like the pocket should be slightly deeper or have little elastic loops or something to hold the items more securely.</li>
            <li>I can only guess tweezerman didn&#x27;t want to cannibalize on its existing tweezer sails since they make a fantastic product standard tweezer</li>
            <li>They are great for ingrown hairs but mostly useless for the much more common stray hair plucking.</li>
            <li>other brands don&#x27;t get a close enough grip to actuallu pluck most hairs.</li>
            <li>Nail clipper is sharp and cuts cleanly without creating burrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>little kit, as long as I can keep it together, will go a long way toward saving my life and my teeth when I&#x27;m living the good life.  </li>
            <li>But I was surprised to find that the sharpness of the tools left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I am surprised by just how fab it is.  </li>
            <li>They are still useful, but I prefer a larger size, so I tossed my bigger tweezerman ones in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the case is poorly designed and does not hold the tools effectively.</li>
            <li>The file area felt too narrow, and the cuticle pusher is actually kind of sharp, so I stopped using this tool</li>
            <li>Now, there are some tiny half circle cuts on the pouch area but, without any instructions, it isn&#x27;t clear if that&#x27;s a way to secure the items.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re likely to find, and the clippers and tweezers are precisely machined with near-perfect tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case, however, fails at the primary task for cases: holding stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and pointed, putting on a pair of glasses or a magnifying glass will make these useful for the smallest of tasks.  </li>
            <li>Good quality but a bit expensive and wish that the nail clipper could be bigger.</li>
            <li>A solid little pair of clippers, a nice tweezer, nail scissors, and a weird nail file all fit in a leather pouch that in turn fits into any bathroom bag.  </li>
            <li>and the other with a more pointed tip that has a very slight curvature.  </li>
            <li>The bevel of the clippers are such that I never seem to get a clean cut, so it&#x27;s easier to do small semi arc clips per nail.</li>
            <li>I mean if you are cool with sharp metal objects moving all throughout your other bags, use the cheap case it comes with.</li>
            <li>They are almost as good as my seki clippers but are missing a little bit of the heavy duty feel.</li>
            <li>Though the clippers are nice and sharp, I can barely position them properly in my hand to get enough tension due to the small size.</li>

            <li> So, all but the case is excellent.</li>
            <li> My husband evaluated this item.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, he did not find it to be very good compared to others that he has had/used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> He loved it !</li>
            <li> Would be a great gift for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman tools that come in this case, like all Tweezerman tools, are great.</li>
            <li> Great tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is especially important for men that use them to cut their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If the file part wasn&#x27;t surrounded by plastic, it would be great.</li>
            <li> Great shears, clippers, etc.  </li>
            <li> scissors are great as well.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are great.</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming set... and a nice, mid-price Father&#x27;s Day gift.  </li>
            <li> This is a good quality trimming set.  </li>
            <li> Good quality implements</li>
            <li> Pointed tweezers are good for picking out and removing ingrown hairs on the neck and face from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended for the good quality implements.</li>
            <li> The nail file-cleaner-thing is good.</li>
            <li> Good to have</li>
            <li> Good set for guys.</li>
            <li> nail file is quite good but in the one month of testing, I already feel that the file is has reduced efficiency.</li>
            <li> These scissors are exceptional for those nagging hairs that develop as we men age in places</li>
            <li> Good quality, I liked it</li>
            <li> All tools seem to be made of good quality with the exception of the case, which is not holding the 4 items nicely - it has a baggy feeling to it.</li>
            <li> First off, I have used Tweezerman tweezers and clippers before and find their grooming tools to be excellent in quality and durability.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the best grooming implements I have found anywhere, and this set is reasonably priced for what&#x27;s included in it.  </li>
            <li> stainless surgical quality tweezers and scissors are especially impressive.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is a nice idea, but I think they may have cheaped out a bit with</li>
            <li> The nailclippers made a nice even cut that didn&#x27;t even need filing.</li>
            <li> and nail clippers are nice and work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice gift for someone who isn&#x27;t too demanding.  </li>
            <li> One end is the pusher, one end is a nail cleaner, and there&#x27;s a handy file on the side to make up for the lack of one on the clippers.</li>
            <li> Instead, it has to do with the pattern: when the nail pieces start accumulating in the grooves, you are effectively “un-sharpening” the file.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a nice starter kit.</li>
            <li> They sure look good in the box.</li>
            <li> The scissors are particularly nice.  </li>
            <li> this was a gft and the recipient was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> There is a small space within the case specifically for the scissors that is perfectly positioned (great idea).&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers come with a covering which is also a great idea since they are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;All of the items within the grooming case</li>
            <li> I would have liked a better case to protect the implements.  </li>
            <li> If a guy needs some grooming items, this is a nice kit that includes most of what he&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> Also, I travel a lot and tend to look for good quality and light (in weight) tools to carry with me on trips.  </li>
            <li> The combination file/nail cleaner/cuticle pusher is, by far, the best of the kit.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about the prospect of having a good case to hold them in when put in with my toiletries, but found this case to be a strap of leather with holes on either side.</li>
            <li> It has a very comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sharper and more precise than any of the assortment I already own.  </li>
            <li> They will get the most use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fingernail clippers are growing on me.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are okay, though I prefer [[ASIN:B00AAJOZN4</li>
            <li> And the nail file is also just okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think you are better off buying the tools you need separately and skipping this set altogether.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if they&#x27;re rust inhibited over time, but I had no issue using these, and was grateful that they weren&#x27;t curved like so many others.  </li>
            <li> Better off throwing them in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> file is just ok.  </li>
            <li> If anything more is needed then washing with a nail brush is recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t intuitive, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> favorite tool is the cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> scissors are just okay.</li>
            <li> But no matter, you probably won&#x27;t be able to see that pesky hair anyway.  </li>
            <li> tweezers are top notch.  </li>
            <li> An ok set....</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I just wish the design was a bit better so that I could cut my nails without pain.</li>
            <li> The safety scissors are great for trimming unwanted hairs, and the precision tweezers work very well.</li>
            <li> I figured a couple bucks more for the kit rather than just the scissors was justifiable.</li>
            <li> I love the tools in the case, very nice to travel with since the items are together and ready to go (I did add an emery board.)</li>
            <li> There is one slot where the scissors fit snugly, but everything else rattles around and falls out very easily.  </li>
            <li> It looks good being presented and does have great if limited usefulness.</li>
            <li> nail clippers do a pretty good job, but they do not have a built in nail catcher.  </li>
            <li> Price is not my top concern, I want something that does a good job and lasts a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The machined quality of each tool is top-notch and precise, which is the standard for Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> cut is good, they don&#x27;t leave jagged edges, so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li> However this is still a very decent kit and a good value at this</li>
            <li> Scissors are very good with tiny curled ends.  </li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t care much about the leather pouch, this is a good quality grooming kit.</li>
            <li> great tweezers, effective nail cleaner, cutters are ok but not for nails, the clippers were good also but not great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leather with a snap closure, which would be great except most of the side areas are open.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the tweezers fall out easily.</li>
            <li> In practice, the nail clipper can easily fall out of the opening in travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers and scissors are a strong steel and the cuticle pusher/nail file are steel and well made.  </li>
            <li> No, that&#x27;s not because my mails are that strong.</li>
            <li> The items are great, really good quality; the case, which is one of the main reason you get a travel kit, is very poor at best.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and perfect for all your detail</li>
            <li> These are fine.  </li>
            <li> A fine collection of grooming instruments.</li>
            <li> I love the included tweezers, they are super detailed and grab on to the tiniest hair.  </li>
            <li> They work amazingly accurately on the edges of my mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s the point of a case if it doesn&#x27;t secure the contents?</li>
            <li> Three of the pieces have a nice satin finish which gives them a richer look than shiny stainless steel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great file, but the way it&#x27;s designed (again, design problem) I can&#x27;t get to the edges of my nails, only the tips.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap</li>
            <li> , it looks cheap, it smells cheap</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, sturdy, sharp and useful.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a way to close, and the tools just slide around, and it seems like it would be easy to lose a tool by sliding out the top.  </li>
            <li> Its ok for limited smoothing work, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as the disposable type.</li>
            <li> The small scissors are perfect for trimming eyebrows (because, of course, you don&#x27;t just pluck them).  </li>
            <li> Metal nail file has a pointed nail cleaner on the end that can gently clean under the nails.  </li>
            <li> (However, it is still very effective, so long as you remember to clean the file</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice looking pouch that snaps shut and looks professional, neat.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are more of a matte finish and don&#x27;t really match the rest of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would probably make a good stocking stuffer or something simple to bring along on vacation.</li>
            <li> Many of cuticle tools I’ve seen are too rounded to do the job very well.  </li>
            <li> The implements are all decent but pretty average--nothing all that great but not shoddy either.</li>
            <li> Although this finely crafted set is designed and well suited for the traveler, I have opted to add it to one of my emergency first aid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most of them will last years.</li>
            <li> Blunt-ended scissors have sharp effective edges and enable safe grooming of nose and ear hairs</li>
            <li> Overall a great, high quality kit.</li>
            <li> All the included stainless steel tools (a small pair of scissors, a nail clipper, a point tweezer and a two-sided nail file with nail cleaning edges) are of excellent quality and perform well.</li>
            <li> On a recent nature hike, I got a splinter on my foot, and I put the tweezers to good use the first time.  </li>
            <li> You can only really use the tweezers for infected hairs or pulling thorns and such out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mulit tool is perfect!  </li>
            <li> facial hair scissors are nice and have rounded tips to prevent jabbing yourself.  </li>
            <li> It came in handy several times.  </li>
            <li> was primarily because the items in the kit did not fit snuggly in the case.&lt;br /&gt;The case was also not made of a good quality</li>
            <li> The nail file is pretty cool, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before.</li>
            <li> You get very high quality tools that are all very useful for lady grooming, as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as any other pair of Inox scissors I have come across.</li>
            <li> These seem just right.  </li>
            <li> I received it right before spending five months abroad</li>
            <li> They have safety bulbs at the end; however, if you really want to poke yourself in the eye, you can easily do that with the tweezers that are very pointy.</li>
            <li> As a present though I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate.</li>
            <li> combination tool gives you a nail file (metal), and has two tips for cuticle tasks, one fairly square with a slightly rounded end</li>
            <li> clipper is typical Tweezerman quality, which is good.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman tweezers are generally pretty good; the clippers less so.</li>
            <li> I use the nail trimmer and toenail trimmer the most, and they are both sharp, accurate and reliable.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the pouch has a special slot for it so that the point can be properly stored.</li>
            <li> Giving them as gifts to nephews who will appreciate them over the next many years in their lives.  </li>
            <li> the items should be safe enough.</li>
            <li> the first go round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> package comes with a leather case, which is OK, although I am not going to knock off any points for that since the carrying case is not an essential element of this gear, it is provided for convenience and that in itself is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything else (and for sure the clippers which state &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;), is likely made in China.</li>
            <li> This set would be much better if it came with a case that actually held the items in it.  </li>
            <li> But I expect this to be an item you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up at a discount type store for last years fashions maybe re-boxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have several pairs of nail clippers, of varying quality, but these seem to make a clean a really clean cut making the filing job easier.  </li>
            <li> It is just way too long to clean nails in a precise way.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  </li>
            <li> This means that all the tools fall right out of it (except for the scissors, which you can secure in an inner slot).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;multitool&amp;#34; is for, but I think it&#x27;s good for dealing with nail issues.</li>
            <li> I expected to really like this set, since I pretty much love all things Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> As with most Tweezerman tools, they cut well and don’t have that loose feel associated with cheaper scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are very high quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scissors are tight and real sharp - a bit unique and the star of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emory board is good for a small metal one, but normally the disposable ones work better in practice plus this one is super fine.</li>
            <li> Its a handy little tool kit, got it as a travel kit for my husband.</li>
            <li> Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> Expected better quality</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, the case doesn&#x27;t really hold things in very well (too flimsy).</li>
            <li> Still, I do like Tweezerman tools over some cheapo brand, plus I won&#x27;t really be tossing it around too much, so</li>
            <li> I keep it in my travel case so it is always ready</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the instruments.</li>
            <li> This is a very puzzling grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very roughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no way possible for it to hold all the tools securely.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a very functional kit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that one as much.</li>
            <li> However, reviewing the kit itself, it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have several pair of tweezerman tweezers, some are more than 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> But overall the package is solid, and the leather pouch is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The tweezers have sharp ends, like two needles, and would be great for ingrown hairs, but other than that, I can&#x27;t see much use for them.  </li>
            <li> You won’t cut yourself, but they are not rounded like most other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most guys i know don&#x27;t use and probably done even know that these sharp point type tweezers exist.</li>
            <li> It files, has a pointier tip to clean nails and a rounded tip to push cuticles back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this a great kit and the only other areas I see for improvement might be to include a smaller nail cleaning tool with a somewhat narrower tip.</li>
            <li> The arm pivots easily and stays in place, both closed and open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mainly the fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> If you squeeze with these, the point of the tweezers is more likely to cut the hair off than actually help you extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would be 4 to 5 stars if it had a decent case you could trust to hold everything.</li>
            <li> pouch, as many reviewers have noted, is large enough but have too much opening when closed.</li>
            <li> They are compact, sharp and the jaws are wider than clippers like the MEHAZ 660 Professional - which used to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are sturdy and built to last, and they clamp down on each nail with a highly satisfying CLINK!</li>
            <li> The stainless steel facial hair scissors are made in Italy (it is engraved with &amp;#34;Italy&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, the items have been useful, definitely won&#x27;t depend on the nail file or the pouch.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are just standard clippers, nothing too exciting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to put the things in it correctly so that when it tilts left to right, the stuff doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> but normally one will use other tweezers for primary tasks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> leather case is padded a little, but the items don&#x27;t really fit inside very well.</li>
            <li> It seems like the pocket should be slightly deeper or have little elastic loops or something to hold the items more securely.</li>
            <li> I can only guess tweezerman didn&#x27;t want to cannibalize on its existing tweezer sails since they make a fantastic product standard tweezer</li>
            <li> They are great for ingrown hairs but mostly useless for the much more common stray hair plucking.</li>
            <li> other brands don&#x27;t get a close enough grip to actuallu pluck most hairs.</li>
            <li> Nail clipper is sharp and cuts cleanly without creating burrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little kit, as long as I can keep it together, will go a long way toward saving my life and my teeth when I&#x27;m living the good life.  </li>
            <li> But I was surprised to find that the sharpness of the tools left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by just how fab it is.  </li>
            <li> They are still useful, but I prefer a larger size, so I tossed my bigger tweezerman ones in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the case is poorly designed and does not hold the tools effectively.</li>
            <li> The file area felt too narrow, and the cuticle pusher is actually kind of sharp, so I stopped using this tool</li>
            <li> Now, there are some tiny half circle cuts on the pouch area but, without any instructions, it isn&#x27;t clear if that&#x27;s a way to secure the items.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re likely to find, and the clippers and tweezers are precisely machined with near-perfect tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case, however, fails at the primary task for cases: holding stuff.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and pointed, putting on a pair of glasses or a magnifying glass will make these useful for the smallest of tasks.  </li>
            <li> Good quality but a bit expensive and wish that the nail clipper could be bigger.</li>
            <li> A solid little pair of clippers, a nice tweezer, nail scissors, and a weird nail file all fit in a leather pouch that in turn fits into any bathroom bag.  </li>
            <li> and the other with a more pointed tip that has a very slight curvature.  </li>
            <li> The bevel of the clippers are such that I never seem to get a clean cut, so it&#x27;s easier to do small semi arc clips per nail.</li>
            <li> I mean if you are cool with sharp metal objects moving all throughout your other bags, use the cheap case it comes with.</li>
            <li> They are almost as good as my seki clippers but are missing a little bit of the heavy duty feel.</li>
            <li> Though the clippers are nice and sharp, I can barely position them properly in my hand to get enough tension due to the small size.</li>
            <li> The file looked promising, but it&#x27;s too thick to get under the corner of the nail and the textured metal is too far from the edge of the file.</li>
            <li> Because the cuticle pusher is so long, the flap folds high above the other items and they have a tendency to wiggle around quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I like that the clippers are “just clippers” and do not have a built-in nail file/cleaning tool, which tends to be useless, gets bent easily and cause strain on the clipper itself when used.  </li>
            <li> I understand there are different size nail clippers, but this being a male grooming kit, I was expecting something a little larger.</li>
            <li> overall impression of this kit is that everything is above average, but all can use some improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is wide open along each side except for about 2 inches from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Terrible case that lets nearly everything fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> One end is for pushing back cuticles (what man does that?), the other is for cleaning under the nails.  </li>
            <li> They have sharp tiny ends.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about the design I might note is that the edges of the clippers (on the sides) are milled square and have a sharp corner that some may not like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The multi-use nail tool will see limited use and will stay in my medicine cabinet just in case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Case is just a single slip pocket instead of having sewn-in sections; the implements rub and bump against each</li>
            <li> tweezers are needle sharp so wish they had flat or angled tips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as hard on my natural nails as I&#x27;d thought it would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this kit wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if the case was designed better.  </li>
            <li> The finish on all the tools is rough as opposed to polished.  </li>
            <li> tweezer is the pointed variant, so you should be careful about the point when handling.</li>
            <li> everything  simply did not fit well and fell out when I could get it in.</li>
            <li> The center has a file and then it can also be used as a cuticle pusher and for cleaning nails.</li>
            <li> (the sides of the pocket come up just slightly past the lower edge of the closed flap -- nowhere near half the height of the file, tweezers or scissors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say, though, that the scissors are sharp, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers have razor-thin, sharp points.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers is a specialty type as it tapers to a sharp point.</li>
            <li> clippers are sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> Inside the neat small package is a pouch, a nail file, a nail clipper, a pointed tweezer, and a pair of facial hair scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pattern Tweezerman used happens to make accumulation easier than the other files I have used.</li>
            <li> No complaints on the tweezers and scissors, but they and the other two pieces continually fall out the sides of the holding pouch.</li>
            <li> Still they are sharp and cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to trim certain lines on my face, or along my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got randomly-long and oddly pointy claws on both thumbs and three out of the eight other fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pouch is really bad, can&#x27;t even hold all the item securely sometimes.</li>
            <li> I like the idea and the tools included here, but they are all just average quality.  </li>
            <li> What I like about the design of this tool, beyond the quality which is quitegood, is that the tips are slightly thin (thinner than the metal base) and softly sharpened, but not so much you’ll hurt the sensitive cuticle area of your nails.  </li>
            <li> Small kit with limited selection of tools.  </li>
            <li> The case is odd...</li>
            <li> I put them into another zippered case I had from a previously owned grooming kit, and after that, I have nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> The clippers seem a tad small with harder edges, so when I&#x27;m pressing down to cut my nails, the edges dig into my fingers.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not necessarily true anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It contains a small nail clipper, a pointed tweezer, a blunt-ended pair of sharp grooming scissors, a metal nail file and a leatherette (pleather) case to slip them all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but every piece in here is the finest quality.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers, especially, are actually very dull.</li>
            <li> and then I look down at my hands and BAM!  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use it to cut anything hard.</li>
            <li> My nails seem to grow crazy fast when I&#x27;m on vacation.  </li>
            <li> The implements are heavy in the hand and feel well made.  </li>
            <li> clippers is real tight, unlike any other small clippers.  </li>
            <li> No more to say on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> case, although leather, is lousy as it doesn&#x27;t hold the tools properly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers are *really* small.  </li>
            <li> I ruined a pair before by trying to cut a small fragment of nail away.</li>
            <li> The case that it comes on is just flat out useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much worthless and all of the pieces scrape together inside when they&#x27;re not falling out of the pouch.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no grip in them, so pulling or adjusting hairs is hard.  </li>
            <li> The pouch to hold everything in sucks.</li>
            <li> The nail cleaning tool is clumsy to use.  </li>
            <li> This small case is not just for the men-folk!  </li>
            <li> The case, a failure.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that the tools would be stored in the pouch unless it&#x27;s used for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is not good.</li>
            <li> No more of those annoying wooden sticks!  </li>
            <li> However, my only disappointment is the included leather pouch, its designed it&#x27;s flawed</li>
            <li> It is a poor design.</li>
            <li> Even when I stick it in my pocket I have this problem, alas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say it is a useless case, but it&#x27;s not good either.  </li>
            <li> That said, the blades are coated and whisper quiet, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about annoying the crap out of other people as you clip clip clip</li>
            <li> Life&#x27;s too short to use bad clippers or scissors!  </li>
            <li> Carrying case is poorly designed, practically useless.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are just weird.  </li>
            <li> They utterly failed at that.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s essentially useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say i found the case useless.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Rather than continue to me a masochist, I bought this for the scissors, to replace a decade-old pair I&#x27;ve used until it stopped cutting and instead started plucking out nose hairs.</li>
            <li> the nail file is just silly, awkward to use, the tweezers....sharp!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The case is... horrifyingly bad.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought &amp;#34;how bad can the case be?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Its bad.</li>
            <li> The case the tools come in is basically worthless, since all of the tools just fall out the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rest of the stuff in this kit is frankly crap.</li>
            <li> the case is just crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the best grooming implements I have found anywhere, and this set is reasonably priced for what&#x27;s included in it.  Giving them as gifts to nephews who will appreciate them over the next many years in their lives.  Life&#x27;s too short to use bad clippers or scissors!  These scissors are exceptional for those nagging hairs that develop as we men age in places we&#x27;d never hoped to see hair (i.e. nose/ears).  Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> Good quality, I liked it</li>
            <li> The pouch to hold everything in sucks. I got this kit because I wanted to put it in my travel bag. But I won&#x27;t take this kit with me, the items will fall out.</li>
            <li> Expected better quality</li>
            <li> The implements are all decent but pretty average--nothing all that great but not shoddy either. I&#x27;ve used mainly the fingernail clippers. In my opinion, the decline in American fingernail clippers occurred when Trim moved their manufacturing from this country to Korea. Things were never the same again. The Tweezerman tweezers are generally pretty good; the clippers less so. As others have pointed out, the case doesn&#x27;t really hold things in very well (too flimsy).</li>
            <li> I love the tools in the case, very nice to travel with since the items are together and ready to go (I did add an emery board.) The case is odd...I haven&#x27;t figured out how to put the things in it correctly so that when it tilts left to right, the stuff doesn&#x27;t fall out. It seems like the pocket should be slightly deeper or have little elastic loops or something to hold the items more securely. Still, I do like Tweezerman tools over some cheapo brand, plus I won&#x27;t really be tossing it around too much, so the items should be safe enough. I keep it in my travel case so it is always ready and I don&#x27;t forget anything.</li>
            <li> Although this finely crafted set is designed and well suited for the traveler, I have opted to add it to one of my emergency first aid kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless surgical quality tweezers and scissors are especially impressive.  They are sharper and more precise than any of the assortment I already own.  They will get the most use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fingernail clippers are growing on me.  They are compact, sharp and the jaws are wider than clippers like the MEHAZ 660 Professional - which used to be my favorite.  That&#x27;s not necessarily true anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multi-use nail tool will see limited use and will stay in my medicine cabinet just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I expected to really like this set, since I pretty much love all things Tweezerman. But I was surprised to find that the sharpness of the tools left much to be desired. The nail clippers, especially, are actually very dull. I couldn&#x27;t even trim my fingernails the first go round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, that the scissors are sharp, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them. The tweezers are okay, though I prefer [[ASIN:B00AAJOZN4 Tweezerman LTD Mini Slant Tweezer (Colors May Vary)]]. And the nail file is also just okay. The case the tools come in is basically worthless, since all of the tools just fall out the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think you are better off buying the tools you need separately and skipping this set altogether.</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming set... and a nice, mid-price Father&#x27;s Day gift.  The implements are heavy in the hand and feel well made.  The carrying case is a nice idea, but I think they may have cheaped out a bit with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you&#x27;re getting this for your husband, get two because you&#x27;ll probably be like my wife who stole this from me!  The nailclippers made a nice even cut that didn&#x27;t even need filing.</li>
            <li> All the included stainless steel tools (a small pair of scissors, a nail clipper, a point tweezer and a two-sided nail file with nail cleaning edges) are of excellent quality and perform well. I&#x27;m sure most of them will last years. However, my only disappointment is the included leather pouch, its designed it&#x27;s flawed and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the instruments. I put them into another zippered case I had from a previously owned grooming kit, and after that, I have nothing to complain about. So, if you don&#x27;t care much about the leather pouch, this is a good quality grooming kit.</li>
            <li> As a man who does groom somewhat regularly, I feel qualified to weigh in on the quality of the supplies included in this kit.  I&#x27;ll go over them one at a time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nail Clippers.  The bevel of the clippers are such that I never seem to get a clean cut, so it&#x27;s easier to do small semi arc clips per nail. That said, the blades are coated and whisper quiet, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about annoying the crap out of other people as you clip clip clip away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Tweezers.  These are simply too pointy to do anything but attempt to dig out ingrown hairs.  There&#x27;s no grip in them, so pulling or adjusting hairs is hard.  If you squeeze with these, the point of the tweezers is more likely to cut the hair off than actually help you extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Trimmers.  These are fine.  We&#x27;ll see if they&#x27;re rust inhibited over time, but I had no issue using these, and was grateful that they weren&#x27;t curved like so many others.  Makes it difficult to trim certain lines on my face, or along my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. File &amp; Cuticle Pushers.  The file area felt too narrow, and the cuticle pusher is actually kind of sharp, so I stopped using this tool altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Pouch.  It&#x27;s pretty much worthless and all of the pieces scrape together inside when they&#x27;re not falling out of the pouch.  Better off throwing them in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality trimming set.  I gave it to my husband but we both use it every day.  I love the included tweezers, they are super detailed and grab on to the tiniest hair.  The clippers and scissors are a strong steel and the cuticle pusher/nail file are steel and well made.  Comes in a nice looking pouch that snaps shut and looks professional, neat.  Would be a great gift for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> This is a very puzzling grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll begin with the case.  It&#x27;s leather with a snap closure, which would be great except most of the side areas are open.  This means that all the tools fall right out of it (except for the scissors, which you can secure in an inner slot).  Who designs something like this?  It wasn&#x27;t tested before it went to market?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers have razor-thin, sharp points.  Nothing that you could use to say, tweeze eyebrows, unless you want to risk blindness.  They must be intended to remove ingrown hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scissors and nail clippers are nice and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is just ok.  One end is for pushing back cuticles (what man does that?), the other is for cleaning under the nails.  Along one side is a metal file, that files the nails very roughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this kit wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if the case was designed better.  But what&#x27;s the point of a case if it doesn&#x27;t secure the contents?</li>
            <li> I like the idea and the tools included here, but they are all just average quality.  The case is the biggest joke of all.  There is no way possible for it to hold all the tools securely.  There is one slot where the scissors fit snugly, but everything else rattles around and falls out very easily.  It is wide open along each side except for about 2 inches from the bottom.  There are no instructions either.&lt;br /&gt;The nail clippers do a pretty good job, but they do not have a built in nail catcher.  The tweezers have sharp ends, like two needles, and would be great for ingrown hairs, but other than that, I can&#x27;t see much use for them.  The finish on all the tools is rough as opposed to polished.  Maybe they were shooting for that or it is an indication of the quality.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman tools that come in this case, like all Tweezerman tools, are great. The file is the closest thing to a manly nail file you&#x27;re likely to find, and the clippers and tweezers are precisely machined with near-perfect tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case, however, fails at the primary task for cases: holding stuff.  There&#x27;s no obvious way to organize the various tools into the straps and pouches of the case, but no matter which way I tried to load it up, I couldn&#x27;t work out how to keep all the tools from falling out the side of the case (the sides of the pocket come up just slightly past the lower edge of the closed flap -- nowhere near half the height of the file, tweezers or scissors.</li>
            <li> This is a 5-piece gentleman&#x27;s grooming kit. It contains a small nail clipper, a pointed tweezer, a blunt-ended pair of sharp grooming scissors, a metal nail file and a leatherette (pleather) case to slip them all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Good quality implements&lt;br /&gt;+ Nail clipper is sharp and cuts cleanly without creating burrs.&lt;br /&gt;+ Metal nail file is sturdy and smooths out nail-ends&lt;br /&gt;+ Metal nail file has a pointed nail cleaner on the end that can gently clean under the nails.  If anything more is needed then washing with a nail brush is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;+ Blunt-ended scissors have sharp effective edges and enable safe grooming of nose and ear hairs&lt;br /&gt;+ Pointed tweezers are good for picking out and removing ingrown hairs on the neck and face from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Small kit with limited selection of tools.  Flat-slant tweezer is needed for regular tweezing. Plus, a larger nail clipper is needed for toe nails. An additional nail brush would completed the set.&lt;br /&gt;- Closure is the leatherette case is poor.&lt;br /&gt;- Case is just a single slip pocket instead of having sewn-in sections; the implements rub and bump against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice gift for someone who isn&#x27;t too demanding.  I would have liked a better case to protect the implements.  However this is still a very decent kit and a good value at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for the good quality implements.</li>
            <li> Meh. The nail file-cleaner-thing is good. The rest of the stuff in this kit is frankly crap. The case that it comes on is just flat out useless. I mean if you are cool with sharp metal objects moving all throughout your other bags, use the cheap case it comes with. If not, put them in something because the case doesn&#x27;t hold them at all.</li>
            <li> The case is not good. No more to say on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers is real tight, unlike any other small clippers.  And sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers is a specialty type as it tapers to a sharp point. Good to have but normally one will use other tweezers for primary tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are tight and real sharp - a bit unique and the star of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emory board is good for a small metal one, but normally the disposable ones work better in practice plus this one is super fine.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1)  Scissors are very good with tiny curled ends.  They work amazingly accurately on the edges of my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  The nail clippers work very well.  No slippage occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1)  The nail cleaning tool is clumsy to use.  It is just way too long to clean nails in a precise way.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  The nail cleaning tool also doubles as nail-file.  But the file is too fine.&lt;br /&gt;  3)  The tweezers are just weird.  They have sharp tiny ends.  On a recent nature hike, I got a splinter on my foot, and I put the tweezers to good use the first time.  They utterly failed at that.  (They actually broke the splinter and made it more difficult to remove it.)&lt;br /&gt;  4)  Carrying case is poorly designed, practically useless.</li>
            <li> If a guy needs some grooming items, this is a nice kit that includes most of what he&#x27;d need. Three of the pieces have a nice satin finish which gives them a richer look than shiny stainless steel. The scissors are more of a matte finish and don&#x27;t really match the rest of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case is padded a little, but the items don&#x27;t really fit inside very well. Because the cuticle pusher is so long, the flap folds high above the other items and they have a tendency to wiggle around quite a bit. In fact, the tweezers fall out easily. When the flap is folded, the case is 5.25&amp;#34; long. Of that, 3&amp;#34; is open on the side. I&#x27;ll attach a photo to help visualize it. Now, there are some tiny half circle cuts on the pouch area but, without any instructions, it isn&#x27;t clear if that&#x27;s a way to secure the items. It isn&#x27;t intuitive, that&#x27;s for sure. I seriously doubt that the tools would be stored in the pouch unless it&#x27;s used for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite tool is the cuticle pusher. One end is the pusher, one end is a nail cleaner, and there&#x27;s a handy file on the side to make up for the lack of one on the clippers. It has a very comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are sturdy and sharp. The arm pivots easily and stays in place, both closed and open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are just okay. They have safety bulbs at the end; however, if you really want to poke yourself in the eye, you can easily do that with the tweezers that are very pointy. It takes a real good eye to zero in on errant hairs and pluck them. But no matter, you probably won&#x27;t be able to see that pesky hair anyway.  By the time those hairs start to show up, the eyesight has started its downward descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably make a good stocking stuffer or something simple to bring along on vacation.</li>
            <li> This is a 3-4 star Grooming Kit.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the tools are 5 star tools...the multi-tool file/cleaner, clippers &amp; scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are needle sharp so wish they had flat or angled tips. You can only really use the tweezers for infected hairs or pulling thorns and such out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mulit tool is perfect!  Wish you could buy thsese alone, have to check into that.  It files, has a pointier tip to clean nails and a rounded tip to push cuticles back.  Great tool.&lt;br /&gt;The case, although leather, is lousy as it doesn&#x27;t hold the tools properly.  It is a poor design.</li>
            <li> First off, I have used Tweezerman tweezers and clippers before and find their grooming tools to be excellent in quality and durability.  Also, I travel a lot and tend to look for good quality and light (in weight) tools to carry with me on trips.  It’s the durability factor that means a lot to me.  Price is not my top concern, I want something that does a good job and lasts a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools included are a basic set (nail clippers, facial hair scissors, tweezers, and a combination nail file / cuticle tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several pairs of nail clippers, of varying quality, but these seem to make a clean a really clean cut making the filing job easier.  I like that the clippers are “just clippers” and do not have a built-in nail file/cleaning tool, which tends to be useless, gets bent easily and cause strain on the clipper itself when used.  The only thing about the design I might note is that the edges of the clippers (on the sides) are milled square and have a sharp corner that some may not like.  You won’t cut yourself, but they are not rounded like most other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial hair scissors are nice and have rounded tips to prevent jabbing yourself.  This is especially important for men that use them to cut their eyebrows. As with most Tweezerman tools, they cut well and don’t have that loose feel associated with cheaper scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are top notch.  Very sharp and pointed, putting on a pair of glasses or a magnifying glass will make these useful for the smallest of tasks.  I have several pair of tweezerman tweezers, some are more than 15 years old.  If you take care of them, they will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination tool gives you a nail file (metal), and has two tips for cuticle tasks, one fairly square with a slightly rounded end and the other with a more pointed tip that has a very slight curvature.  What I like about the design of this tool, beyond the quality which is quitegood, is that the tips are slightly thin (thinner than the metal base) and softly sharpened, but not so much you’ll hurt the sensitive cuticle area of your nails.  Many of cuticle tools I’ve seen are too rounded to do the job very well.  These seem just right.  The pointed tip will get under the nails without tearing the underside of your fingertip like the cheaper quality tools will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with a leather case, which is OK, although I am not going to knock off any points for that since the carrying case is not an essential element of this gear, it is provided for convenience and that in itself is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this a great kit and the only other areas I see for improvement might be to include a smaller nail cleaning tool with a somewhat narrower tip.</li>
            <li> This is a very functional kit.  I received it right before spending five months abroad so I packed it as it had all the essential components.  It came in handy several times.  However, the case is poorly designed and does not hold the tools effectively.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel facial hair scissors are made in Italy (it is engraved with &amp;#34;Italy&amp;#34;). Everything else (and for sure the clippers which state &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;), is likely made in China. All tools seem to be made of good quality with the exception of the case, which is not holding the 4 items nicely - it has a baggy feeling to it. Of the 4 tools, expect the nail file to have the shortest lifespan. Good set for guys.</li>
            <li> This small case is not just for the men-folk!  You get very high quality tools that are all very useful for lady grooming, as well.  The small scissors are perfect for trimming eyebrows (because, of course, you don&#x27;t just pluck them).  The nail clippers are very high quality.  The combination file/nail cleaner/cuticle pusher is, by far, the best of the kit.  I am surprised by just how fab it is.  No more of those annoying wooden sticks!  It&#x27;s also not as hard on my natural nails as I&#x27;d thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are *really* small.  They are still useful, but I prefer a larger size, so I tossed my bigger tweezerman ones in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is... horrifyingly bad.  The sides are open, and all of the tools will fall out if it&#x27;s put unsecured in a bag of any sort.  That is annoying, because otherwise the set is really quite amazing.  Even when I stick it in my pocket I have this problem, alas.</li>
            <li> An ok set....the nail file is just silly, awkward to use, the tweezers....sharp!  This set would be much better if it came with a case that actually held the items in it.  I put it in my purse only to have every item but the scissors fall out of the pouch and as I was digging around I stabbed myself with the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the items have been useful, definitely won&#x27;t depend on the nail file or the pouch.  Would I buy this for someone, nope.</li>
            <li> Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Essential Grooming Kit” for review. Inside the neat small package is a pouch, a nail file, a nail clipper, a pointed tweezer, and a pair of facial hair scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this kit is that everything is above average, but all can use some improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch, as many reviewers have noted, is large enough but have too much opening when closed. In practice, the nail clipper can easily fall out of the opening in travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file is quite good but in the one month of testing, I already feel that the file is has reduced efficiency. No, that&#x27;s not because my mails are that strong. Instead, it has to do with the pattern: when the nail pieces start accumulating in the grooves, you are effectively “un-sharpening” the file. The pattern Tweezerman used happens to make accumulation easier than the other files I have used. (However, it is still very effective, so long as you remember to clean the file regularly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is typical Tweezerman quality, which is good. The problem is it&#x27;s not competitive: no file built-in, and no nail catcher. These are standard these days. (If you can, get a nail clipper by the Japanese brand Muji. It&#x27;s the standard I judge every nail clipper that comes my way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezer is the pointed variant, so you should be careful about the point when handling. Fortunately the pouch has a special slot for it so that the point can be properly stored. The points on my pair match up perfectly. Kudos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair of scissors is actually a re-branded Inox. It&#x27;s as good as any other pair of Inox scissors I have come across. Be careful not to use it to cut anything hard. I ruined a pair before by trying to cut a small fragment of nail away. (The metal on the Inox is softer, I don&#x27;t know why.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a nice starter kit. But I cannot give this a perfect score.So 4/5.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better pair of clippers. For some reason, these are not as awesome as I&#x27;d hoped. The clippers seem a tad small with harder edges, so when I&#x27;m pressing down to cut my nails, the edges dig into my fingers. It leaves me with indentations on my fingertips. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut is good, they don&#x27;t leave jagged edges, so that&#x27;s a positive. I just wish the design was a bit better so that I could cut my nails without pain. If they were longer with rounded edges, I bet they&#x27;d be wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is the saddest for me: it&#x27;s a great file, but the way it&#x27;s designed (again, design problem) I can&#x27;t get to the edges of my nails, only the tips. So after you clip your nails, you can only file the tips, not the sides. If the file part wasn&#x27;t surrounded by plastic, it would be great. But it&#x27;s essentially useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Every man should have one of these essential grooming kids in his collection. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but every piece in here is the finest quality. The clippers are sturdy and built to last, and they clamp down on each nail with a highly satisfying CLINK! The safety scissors are great for trimming unwanted hairs, and the precision tweezers work very well. I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;multitool&amp;#34; is for, but I think it&#x27;s good for dealing with nail issues. I don&#x27;t use that one as much. But overall the package is solid, and the leather pouch is a nice touch. Recommended.</li>
            <li> great tweezers, effective nail cleaner, cutters are ok but not for nails, the clippers were good also but not great (could be sharper) I have to say i found the case useless. everything  simply did not fit well and fell out when I could get it in.</li>
            <li> A fine collection of grooming instruments. I use the nail trimmer and toenail trimmer the most, and they are both sharp, accurate and reliable. Definitely recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought &amp;#34;how bad can the case be?&amp;#34;  Answer:  &amp;#34;Pretty frick&#x27;n bad&amp;#34;.  The items are great, really good quality; the case, which is one of the main reason you get a travel kit, is very poor at best.  I don&#x27;t want to say it is a useless case, but it&#x27;s not good either.  This would be 4 to 5 stars if it had a decent case you could trust to hold everything.</li>
            <li> The machined quality of each tool is top-notch and precise, which is the standard for Tweezerman. However, reviewing the kit itself, it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done. I understand there are different size nail clippers, but this being a male grooming kit, I was expecting something a little larger. Though the clippers are nice and sharp, I can barely position them properly in my hand to get enough tension due to the small size. The file looked promising, but it&#x27;s too thick to get under the corner of the nail and the textured metal is too far from the edge of the file. No complaints on the tweezers and scissors, but they and the other two pieces continually fall out the sides of the holding pouch.</li>
            <li> Great shears, clippers, etc.  Terrible case that lets nearly everything fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> My husband evaluated this item.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, he did not find it to be very good compared to others that he has had/used.&lt;br /&gt;This was primarily because the items in the kit did not fit snuggly in the case.&lt;br /&gt;The case was also not made of a good quality material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the name file was excellent and the scissors were just about perfect.  There is a small space within the case specifically for the scissors that is perfectly positioned (great idea).&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers come with a covering which is also a great idea since they are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;All of the items within the grooming case are of the highest quality metal.  The utensils are well-made and designed.</li>
            <li> They sure look good in the box. But I expect this to be an item you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up at a discount type store for last years fashions maybe re-boxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the nail clippers. They are almost as good as my seki clippers but are missing a little bit of the heavy duty feel. Still they are sharp and cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are great as well. Very sharp and perfect for all your detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers... WHAT THE HECK?!? Most guys i know don&#x27;t use and probably done even know that these sharp point type tweezers exist. They are great for ingrown hairs but mostly useless for the much more common stray hair plucking. I can only guess tweezerman didn&#x27;t want to cannibalize on its existing tweezer sails since they make a fantastic product standard tweezer product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is whatevs. Its ok for limited smoothing work, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as the disposable type. Or the porcelain type if you prefer those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the case is just crap. Its bad. It feels cheap, it looks cheap, it smells cheap its just all around bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So its sorta a mixed bag. As a present though I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate. It looks good being presented and does have great if limited usefulness.</li>
            <li> It has everything my husband needs when he travels.  The scissors are particularly nice.  The only thing I would change about the set is the carrying case.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a way to close, and the tools just slide around, and it seems like it would be easy to lose a tool by sliding out the top.  A slightly smaller zipper bag would be preferred.</li>
            <li> this was a gft and the recipient was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Good quality but a bit expensive and wish that the nail clipper could be bigger. The pouch is really bad, can&#x27;t even hold all the item securely sometimes.</li>
            <li> My nails seem to grow crazy fast when I&#x27;m on vacation.  Maybe it&#x27;s the R&amp;R, all I know is that one minute I&#x27;ve got no cares in the wold and then I look down at my hands and BAM!  I&#x27;ve got randomly-long and oddly pointy claws on both thumbs and three out of the eight other fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little kit, as long as I can keep it together, will go a long way toward saving my life and my teeth when I&#x27;m living the good life.  A solid little pair of clippers, a nice tweezer, nail scissors, and a weird nail file all fit in a leather pouch that in turn fits into any bathroom bag.  My only problem with the thing is the pouch itself - there&#x27;s way too much open space on the sides, and nothing stays in the thing.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome kit. I had been looking at Tweezerman ingrown hair tweezers and for about the same price you can get this entire ser. I also want to say that Tweezerman brand tweezers are the only brand I&#x27;ll buy as I find other brands don&#x27;t get a close enough grip to actuallu pluck most hairs. The scissors in this kit are described as being for beard trimming, but you can definitely use them for trimming hang nails or nose hair. The nail file is pretty cool, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before. The center has a file and then it can also be used as a cuticle pusher and for cleaning nails. The clippers are just standard clippers, nothing too exciting. Overall a great, high quality kit. I think I&#x27;ll get a second kit for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Its a handy little tool kit, got it as a travel kit for my husband. He loved it ! Improve the leather pouch design so that they don&#x27;t keep falling out !</li>
            <li> Rather than continue to me a masochist, I bought this for the scissors, to replace a decade-old pair I&#x27;ve used until it stopped cutting and instead started plucking out nose hairs. I figured a couple bucks more for the kit rather than just the scissors was justifiable. The tools themselves are great. Excellent quality, sturdy, sharp and useful. The case is the only drawback. I was excited about the prospect of having a good case to hold them in when put in with my toiletries, but found this case to be a strap of leather with holes on either side. So the tools, which don&#x27;t have good-fitting places to sit within it, slip out the sides and eventually can puncture the toiletries bag. So, all but the case is excellent. The case, a failure.</li>
