            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Purchase Myrurgia Yacht Man Toilette Spray for Men&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The product is great love the smell but know that it doesnt work for everyone.</li>
            <li>Mist from the bottle is very fine</li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real thing when I ordered it, and I&#x27;m happy with what I got.</li>
            <li>and I love love love it.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing :)</li>
            <li>and you will surely have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, not overbearing yet very distinct</li>
            <li>is a lotion that smells very rich and one, highly recommended, very economical later I will be buying more, very good seller</li>
            <li>And since I don&#x27;t know what the original smell is, I am living my life wearing it.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume, not the original, and I advise you not to buy this..</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like chocolate but still smells nice,fresh,and clean.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product specially knowing that I did not get the original.</li>
            <li>had no scent, the bottle was full and the trigger that pumps cologne up stop working.</li>
            <li>Loved it my second bottle</li>
            <li>The size and the price is unbeatable and you should take advantage of the full line as I did.</li>
            <li>I buy on amazon mainly because of this and this makes me confident to shop online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like chocolate; but more of a bright floral over moss blend.&lt;br /&gt;The label doesn&#x27;t give anything away in regards to the mystery</li>
            <li>Not very long lasting, nevertheless very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It was what it said, it was on time, it was in an unopened package, it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Normally, Amazon sells items that are original.</li>
            <li>the Price of this Toilette Spray was very much Affordable</li>
            <li>Very Well::!</li>
            <li>The cap was flimsy, the letters on the package cover did not match with the original ones (I have two more Yacht Man brand perfumes, one red &amp; the other blue) and the cap was made of some cheap material that made it way too easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t wear this one very often.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like it soo Much,</li>
            <li>Scent was nice though didn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li>Upon first spray I detect some spice and cocoa notes which are not too sweet and a little on the powdery side.</li>
            <li>so you may need to spray more than usual.</li>
            <li>Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
            <li>Not heavy overpowering.</li>
            <li>They stopped spraying and with even changing the tops, I was still not able to enjoy the cologne that was purchased</li>
            <li>I lack the expertise to explain the sense of smell using my limited vocabulary, but too much of it</li>
            <li>Not a very complex fragrance, but that&#x27;s expected for this price range.</li>

            <li> wouldn&#x27;t wear this one very often. but, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> It could have been stronger, but then I absorb cologne like a sponge.</li>
            <li> Were given as a gift for a family member.</li>
            <li> had no scent, the bottle was full and the trigger that pumps cologne up stop working.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of the Yacht Man products.  The last 4 that I purchased were defected.  They stopped spraying and with even changing the tops, I was still not able to enjoy the cologne that was purchased so I had no choice but to throw them away.</li>
            <li> For all you mystery fans out there, todays question is \\&quot;Why is this Product labeled CHOCOLATE???\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like chocolate; but more of a bright floral over moss blend.&lt;br /&gt;The label doesn&#x27;t give anything away in regards to the mystery either.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is it&#x27;s called chocolate because the box is BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;It does remind me of a scent from the past; but I can&#x27;t begin to guess what that scent was.&lt;br /&gt;If you like bright floral, mossy cologne this one is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for Chocolate, this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, not overbearing yet very distinct</li>
            <li> Delicious fragrance for men.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery. Good price.</li>

            <li> Normally, Amazon sells items that are original. I buy on amazon mainly because of this and this makes me confident to shop online. However, this perfume was a knockoff. The cap was flimsy, the letters on the package cover did not match with the original ones (I have two more Yacht Man brand perfumes, one red &amp; the other blue) and the cap was made of some cheap material that made it way too easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t return it. I am using it. And since I don&#x27;t know what the original smell is, I am living my life wearing it. The smell does last long. I lack the expertise to explain the sense of smell using my limited vocabulary, but too much of it and you will surely have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product specially knowing that I did not get the original. I will post some pictures to convince you.</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with chocolate except the color of the box!</li>
            <li> I like it soo Much, Smell Very Well::! Buy again</li>
            <li> it is too bad ,&lt;br /&gt;When i am opened the box i found broken cover and smell only a few seconds , and, unfortunately, I can not do a return to the company</li>
            <li> Upon first spray I detect some spice and cocoa notes which are not too sweet and a little on the powdery side. After a few minutes, it settles down to a musky scent. Ideal for fall/winter season. Not a very complex fragrance, but that&#x27;s expected for this price range. Mist from the bottle is very fine so you may need to spray more than usual.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume, not the original, and I advise you not to buy this..ya kupil etu eto ne orginal,zapax dermo!!!</li>
            <li> otimo product I recommend.</li>
            <li> A great collection of  cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the entire collection and must say it&#x27;s been a valuable addition to my travel kit!!</li>
            <li> Scent was nice though didn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and didn&#x27;t last long at all. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Not very long lasting, nevertheless very pleasant. I can recommend it - especially at the price point that is offered</li>
