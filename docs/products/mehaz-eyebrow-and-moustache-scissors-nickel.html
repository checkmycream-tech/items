            <li>They are Swiss quality for sure.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting better products than this.</li>
            <li>These scissors are okay, but once you figure in the pricing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to get the crane-shaped ones at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Sure beats using scissors for paper.</li>
            <li>These scissors would be perfect for those with coarse mustache hair, NOT for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Hubby reports nice clean precision; his sausage fingers are easily accommodated too.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done for my teeny eyebrow hairs, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d do fantastic for your mustache too...</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>He really liked them ...and when my mother saw how nice they were in action, she started using them to trim his stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>We needed a good pair of trim scissors for the main bath.  </li>
            <li>It cuts easily through the light to medium work I need them for.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, I use them to trip my eyebrows and they do a fine job..</li>
            <li>They are a nice weight and seem very well made.</li>
            <li>Okay so it didnt come in a fancy packaging and it irked me at first.</li>
            <li>there more heavy duty, attractive, &amp;uuml;ber precise scissors on the market?</li>
            <li>very sharp, very good</li>
            <li>Excellent.  Very sharp and stays very sharp, great for trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable but if you want a classic style these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>And, since occasionally even I have a hair or two out of place, ladies looking for a nice affordable, easy to travel with pair of scissors should consider these too.  </li>
            <li>They work great and the finger holes are large enough.</li>
            <li>sturdy, sharp, does a great job trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>, they are very sharp and do a great job at trimming.</li>
            <li>I always cut too much/too slanted and then have to bust out an eyebrow pencil, else I&#x27;ll look a little bald lol    </li>
            <li>This is a great little scissor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not as sharp and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package, these scissors could not cut, but rather pulled my hair.</li>
            <li>Great little pair of scissors!</li>
            <li>I trimmed my eyebrows with these, there isn&#x27;t much to write about scissors but all you need to know is that they cut well and have a nice solid feel.</li>
            <li>This one feels a lot better in hand than my last pair.</li>
            <li>Researched for a week online to find the best scissors for trimming the Mustach growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mehaz seemed to be a well-made scissors but it does seem expensive for $11.39&lt;</li>
            <li>but I suppose stainless steel should never rust!</li>
            <li>, the two finger holes are exactly symmetrical.</li>
            <li>These are nice quality sharp scissors.</li>
            <li>there scissors sharp and effective they work every time</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Works well, nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>This small pair or trim scissors is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp scissors that get the job done!</li>
            <li>Very nice finish and metal quality, will definitely purchase other Mehaz items.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my moustache and beard.</li>
            <li>I would return this product but given the low cost of the product, the shipping costs aren&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li>but they do not cut very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also was able to use them to carefully trim my nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I like the straight edge.  </li>
            <li>and they work great, even if the holes are a little small for his fingers!  :)</li>
            <li>Those are MUCH sharper than these.</li>
            <li>My old ones are just that old, about a hundred years old, but the action on them is very easy and they still cut very well.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m trying to trim my eyebrows halfway between waxing appointments, it is such a pain to operate the slanted ones and get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>As expected, I use it for Mustache and it really help and cut fast and easily.</li>
            <li>listen, these are not worth more than $2.</li>
            <li>I bought these for cutting nail tape and other fine craft jobs and it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>hubby, whose upper lip once only sprouted the most pitiful of offerings, finally hit puberty overnight; he&#x27;s got a cop stache now or, as the professionals call it, a \\&quot;full</li>
            <li>my previous scissors (also from amazon) was so much better &amp; smoother to operate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of years now and they look exactly the same as they did when I first got them and cut just as well too.</li>
            <li>They are high quality, work well, and are compact.</li>
            <li>I also like that although it is a right handed configuration (that is, for left handers, the blades will be backwards)</li>
            <li>It works fine for mustaches, but is more difficult to use for eyebrows as the blades are on the thicker side.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for eyebrows but can be used in other areas of the face.</li>
            <li>Sharp &amp; precise.</li>
            <li>light weight and sharp.  </li>
            <li>I guess that is what I was expecting from the new ones.</li>
            <li>I will give these new ones a chance to break in and see.</li>
            <li>They cut ok, but the way they are made they have an almost stiff action to them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, have smooth action, and, do all that they are required to do:</li>
            <li>It is sharp enough to not try to cut the hair more than one time.</li>
            <li>They arrived sharp and cut OK, but they don&#x27;t get quite as close to my skin as the last pair that I owned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a scissors to take on vacation that keeps the hair in my ears from growing down the side of my face!!!!</li>
            <li>I plan on spending the extra money for a pair of stainless steel scissors.</li>
            <li>definetly not something u want to bring near to ur face skin.</li>
            <li>A very sharp and true line scissor.</li>
            <li>So many small grooming scissors are not actually man-hand-friendly.</li>
            <li>I have only had them a short time, so I cannot comment on durability of the blades, but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Needing a pair of scissors that were higher quality than what the drugstore offered, but not willing to break the bank, we ordered these again.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and cut very well.  </li>

            <li> definetly not something u want to bring near to ur face skin.</li>
            <li> A very sharp and true line scissor.</li>
            <li> So many small grooming scissors are not actually man-hand-friendly.</li>
            <li> I have only had them a short time, so I cannot comment on durability of the blades, but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Needing a pair of scissors that were higher quality than what the drugstore offered, but not willing to break the bank, we ordered these again.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and cut very well.  </li>
            <li> and I keep a pair in my makeup kit to cut false strip lashes and for the occasional clean up job on someone else&#x27;s bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Often these little scissors will have one larger hold for the right handers thumb which sucks for left handers since we have to put our index finger through it and can&#x27;t control the scissors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realize this is a very specific reason to like a pair of scissors, but it might be helpful to other left handed people!</li>
            <li> only other thing worth noting is that they are very sharp, and so sharp that I&#x27;m always anxious about dropping them on my feet, etc.  </li>

            <li> this mehaz scissors is rigid &amp; unable to give u the confidence to cut a straight hair length for ur mustach.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and cut the finest hairs.  </li>
            <li> These are bigger than I thought, which makes them harder to get at little hairs and they stick when you open and close them, which makes them a little dangerous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these! this is my second pair. I buy one for my house to trim my eyebrows and I keep a pair in my makeup kit to cut false strip lashes and for the occasional clean up job on someone else&#x27;s bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good quality! Won&#x27;t need to buy another for years and years!</li>
            <li> These scissors are well constructed and sharp.  Easy to handle.  Great for mustache and eyebrows.  Andy Rooney could have used these.</li>
            <li> I believe these are made in Japan. Everything made in Japan seems to be of superior quality when it comes to grooming sorts of hardware.    I detest the eyebrow scissors that are slanted.  For the life of me, I could not find a single eyebrow scissor in Walmart/Target/Walgreens that was not slanted.  I could not understand it.  The best salon I had ever been to (literally did my eyebrows perfect every time) used a regular straight mini scissors.    When I&#x27;m trying to trim my eyebrows halfway between waxing appointments, it is such a pain to operate the slanted ones and get a clean cut.  I always cut too much/too slanted and then have to bust out an eyebrow pencil, else I&#x27;ll look a little bald lol    This fits the bill for such a simple product, but such a hard one to find.  It gets the job done for my teeny eyebrow hairs, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d do fantastic for your mustache too...if you have one.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and cut very well.  They are a nice weight and seem very well made. Very happy with my purchase and can fully recommend.</li>
            <li> Within a week of use, these scissors began to rust. I have included a picture that shows the status of the scissors at 2 weeks, extensive rust. The poor quality nickel finish is evident. I plan on spending the extra money for a pair of stainless steel scissors. I would return this product but given the low cost of the product, the shipping costs aren&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my moustache and beard. The mehaz 4\\&quot; scissors #371 from amazon are totally perfect for keeping me in perfect sartorial trim.</li>
            <li> These are rusting. They have a good feel but they do not cut very well. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Okay so it didnt come in a fancy packaging and it irked me at first. They were sealed in a small plastic bag. Which tells me that the seller bought them in bulk and then sealed them individually. But when I used it I could tell that its a well made product. I mean for $6 you cant go wrong. My last scissors I bought for $14 from CVS and they lasted me 10 years until I mistakenly dropped them in my bathroom commode. Yeah, dont trim your mustache and do No. 2 at the same time. BAD IDEA. Back to the scissors. This one feels a lot better in hand than my last pair. I might buy another pair and save it for a rainy day.</li>
            <li> Omg! Its perfect and so precise! I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;m definitely content with it. It also came in good time!</li>
            <li> Cits perfectly and easy to use.  I have had no problems at all with this product and would recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> I made a grave mistake when I purchased the \\&quot;advertised on TV\\&quot; Samurai Knife Sharpener and tried to sharpen my scissors! Needless to say, these were their replacement and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Nice compact size and cut like a charm. Item was shipped quickly. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Researched for a week online to find the best scissors for trimming the Mustach growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mehaz seemed to be a well-made scissors but it does seem expensive for $11.39&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find it cheaper, I did definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 04/19/2014 - The scissors are rusted and now it&#x27;s hard to cut anything with them...Not recommended but I suppose stainless steel should never rust!</li>
            <li> very sharp, very good</li>
            <li> At my age I&#x27;ve got hair growing in places I never dreamed of!  It&#x27;s nice to have a scissors to take on vacation that keeps the hair in my ears from growing down the side of my face!!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice quality sharp scissors. I use them to trim my bangs and my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of years now and they look exactly the same as they did when I first got them and cut just as well too.</li>
            <li> Great little pair of scissors! Lifetime guarantee and free sharpening! Very nice finish and metal quality, will definitely purchase other Mehaz items.</li>
            <li> A very sharp and true line scissor. It cuts easily through the light to medium work I need them for.  They have a lifetime sharpness guarantee, but I doubt that I will take advantage of that.  Not the most comfortable but if you want a classic style these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> He liked it. The are sharp and have the cured edge for trimming. I would recommend for other people to try.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp scissors that get the job done! My eyebrows are much more groomed now. Also was able to use them to carefully trim my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> poor quality , scissors not smooth to operate . definetly not something u want to bring near to ur face skin. this construction not suitable for stated purpose -maybe to cut paper . my previous scissors (also from amazon) was so much better &amp; smoother to operate. this mehaz scissors is rigid &amp; unable to give u the confidence to cut a straight hair length for ur mustach. this purchase is wasted , (to dustbin).</li>
            <li> My husband wanted me to purchase these for goatee trimming.  He mentioned that they were smaller than he thought they would be and are a little difficult to manage with a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s hand&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m only making comments he stated as I wouldn&#x27;t be personally using them myself.</li>
            <li> They work great and the finger holes are large enough. Some other brands have TINY finger holes.</li>
            <li> thought these were going to be oerfect for my brow waxing services ! it rusted and wont even open and i ahvent even had it a month!! SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a pair od scissors that are well made and finally found them in this selection.  Bottom line is that if I need another pair I will order these.</li>
            <li> there scissors sharp and effective they work every time and id buy them again if I needed to that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> These are nice scissors.  They cut like scissors should cut.  I like the straight edge.  When my curved edge dulls on me, I will by another curved edge scissor from this brand.</li>
            <li> These scissors are perfect for eyebrow shaping. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve made do with only tweezers for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing worth noting is that they are very sharp, and so sharp that I&#x27;m always anxious about dropping them on my feet, etc.  It would be awesome if the sellers started putting rubber caps on the ends of them (like the ones that tweezers come with).</li>
            <li> My scissors rusted after a week. It was unusuable as it was harder to move because of the rust. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great little scissor. I use it primarily for eyebrows but can be used in other areas of the face. Be careful. Make sure you SEE the tips of the scissor when you cut (as you should with any scissor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy with big hands and maneuvering these scissors is not easy.  That&#x27;s my review, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> listen, these are not worth more than $2. Blunt, poorly overlapping blades. They crush, rather than cut, hairs. The tips of the cut hairs are visibly frayed after cutting. Definitely not worth the money. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a stocking stuffer type gift for my moustache-sportin&#x27; father. He really liked them ...and when my mother saw how nice they were in action, she started using them to trim his stray eyebrow hairs. He&#x27;s now groomed within an inch of his life! Good thing he&#x27;s bald or she&#x27;d also be obsessively trying to even his sideburns or styling him some bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby, whose upper lip once only sprouted the most pitiful of offerings, finally hit puberty overnight; he&#x27;s got a cop stache now or, as the professionals call it, a \\&quot;full natural\\&quot;.  Needing a pair of scissors that were higher quality than what the drugstore offered, but not willing to break the bank, we ordered these again. Hubby reports nice clean precision; his sausage fingers are easily accommodated too. So many small grooming scissors are not actually man-hand-friendly. Thankfully, unlike my farher, he&#x27;s left to landscape the &#x27;stache all on his lonesome. He&#x27;s grunted out his approval of these Mehaz 4 inchers more than once. That&#x27;s the equivalent of a glowing review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there more heavy duty, attractive, &amp;uuml;ber precise scissors on the market? Indeed. But for Amazon&#x27;s price point and the results the males of my family receive, these are a quality bargain. They&#x27;re sharp, have smooth action, and, do all that they are required to do: they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surly brows and wily follicles have no chance. And, since occasionally even I have a hair or two out of place, ladies looking for a nice affordable, easy to travel with pair of scissors should consider these too.  (Last I checked, TSA allows scissors with blades under 4 inches in your carry-on).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not as sharp and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a tough time choosing between 3 and 4 stars. These definitely feel solid and well made. My issue is that it is promoted as eyebrow scissors as well as for mustaches. It works fine for mustaches, but is more difficult to use for eyebrows as the blades are on the thicker side.</li>
            <li> Sharp &amp; precise. This pair of scissors are solidly built with blunted tips for safety reasons. Pass everything else and get these once. They&#x27;ll last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> These are bigger than I thought, which makes them harder to get at little hairs and they stick when you open and close them, which makes them a little dangerous. Not a good pair of scissors, sadly. Maybe to trim your bangs?</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband to trim his mustache and they work great, even if the holes are a little small for his fingers!  :)</li>
            <li> These are excellent scissors.  They are very sharp and cut the finest hairs.  They are Swiss quality for sure.  I don&#x27;t know how I gotten by without them.</li>
            <li> I trimmed my eyebrows with these, there isn&#x27;t much to write about scissors but all you need to know is that they cut well and have a nice solid feel. They&#x27;re made of nickle though so for those who are allergic, beware. i am allergic myself, but i have had no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> sturdy, sharp, does a great job trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> This small pair or trim scissors is a good value for the price. We needed a good pair of trim scissors for the main bath.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This one did not even last one week before it got rust all over. Was expecting better products than this.</li>
            <li> As expected, I use it for Mustache and it really help and cut fast and easily. It is sharp enough to not try to cut the hair more than one time.</li>
            <li> I guess the days of buying a simple product and expecting it to function as intended are gone! Right out of the package, these scissors could not cut, but rather pulled my hair. In the garbage they went...</li>
            <li> Scissors are not sharpened well at all.  Wish I could return it, but I tossed the packaging out.</li>
            <li> These scissors are okay, but once you figure in the pricing it&#x27;s better to get the crane-shaped ones at the drug store. Those are MUCH sharper than these.</li>
            <li> I needed one of these to trim my mustache and beard from time to time. I was impressed with the quality of these when they arrived. Nice and sharp and sturdy. Sure beats using scissors for paper. lol</li>
            <li> I bought these for cutting nail tape and other fine craft jobs and it does the job perfectly. I also like that although it is a right handed configuration (that is, for left handers, the blades will be backwards), the two finger holes are exactly symmetrical. Often these little scissors will have one larger hold for the right handers thumb which sucks for left handers since we have to put our index finger through it and can&#x27;t control the scissors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I realize this is a very specific reason to like a pair of scissors, but it might be helpful to other left handed people!</li>
            <li> Great scissors.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these.</li>
            <li> Great scissors, thanks!</li>
            <li> I use these scissors on my mustache.  They arrived sharp and cut OK, but they don&#x27;t get quite as close to my skin as the last pair that I owned.  If I had to buy again, I&#x27;d probably try another brand or style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if they did cut closer to the skin I might occasionally nick myself.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  The quality of product is also very good.  I am very happy to use and take with me on travel.</li>
            <li> Was looking to find a cheaper pair of scissors to trim some facial hair and gave these a try. They work well. I have only had them a short time, so I cannot comment on durability of the blades, but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Very sharp and stays very sharp, great for trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I use them to trip my eyebrows and they do a fine job.. it also has lifetime warranty so I can sharpen them if they ever get dull. Nice all in all. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great product for quick trims...on bangs, mustaches, eyebrows etc. light weight and sharp.  Just try not to run with them.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice and sharp. Good quality, great size. I initially got it to cut my eyebrows but now use it for bangs.</li>
            <li> While the product is of good quality, it&#x27;s not what I was looking for. These scissors would be perfect for those with coarse mustache hair, NOT for eyebrows. The scissors are stiff and difficult to use for delicate eyebrows. Disappointed. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Works as described and met all expectations. Nice addition to grooming tools. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item okay!</li>
            <li> These mustache scissors work great, they are very sharp and do a great job at trimming. I recommend these scissors.</li>
            <li> These work really great for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very impressed with these scissors. They are high quality, work well, and are compact. Good product and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> They cut ok, but the way they are made they have an almost stiff action to them. The two cutting surfaces come together and they rub rather hard. I am wondering if in time this will loosen up. It would almost have to because of the amount of friction between them. It should keep them sharp. Mixed feelings with these scissors. My old ones are just that old, about a hundred years old, but the action on them is very easy and they still cut very well. I guess that is what I was expecting from the new ones. I will give these new ones a chance to break in and see.</li>
