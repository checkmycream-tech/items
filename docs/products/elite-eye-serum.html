    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best item to use would be to drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>This marketing website thought it was great</li>
            <li>this stuff was GREAT though.</li>
            <li>I loved it and began tellin gall my friends about it.</li>
            <li>Of course it takes some time to get some really good results, as it would with any cream.</li>
            <li>But I am so glad I found this because it&#x27;s already began undoing my damage!</li>
            <li>I have used every skincare/anti-aging product in the book, and I&#x27;ll tell you what --- Elite Skin PRODUCTS are WITHOUT EXCEPTION -- the best, as far as ingredients and effectiveness</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to find one.</li>
            <li>Was very hopeful when I purchased it and paid a good amount for it.</li>
            <li>Before trying this product I had easily tested a dozen of them and not one of them delivered the results that this product has already.</li>
            <li>, I was most definately right!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything for fine lines, either.</li>
            <li>My wife is more amazed that my fine lines and smile lines around my eyes have been significanly reduced.      </li>
            <li>How can I be sure that I have gotten the real deal???</li>
            <li>but this is the first one with strong results.  </li>
            <li>I have found the product firms the area but the reason I purchased this &#x27;super&#x27; eye serum was to reduce the darkness under my eyes</li>
            <li>I also really liked the fact that the product was actually manufcatured in the USA!</li>
            <li>The product is worth the price</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone, young or old, who wants to have beautiful eyes.  </li>
            <li>Botox has always pressured many women to try it out, only to find they don&#x27;t like the results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed using Elite Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Try it; you&#x27;ll like it\\&quot; ;-) and won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;JMHO ....</li>
            <li>Almost all of the reviews that I have read have been positive.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this product would help reduce the appearance of my dark circles and smooth out fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.you can feel and see the difference in a week.</li>
            <li>You have to use it am and pm to see fast results</li>
            <li>For $100, I would have expected a better packaged product.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser gives way too much product out with each pump, however you try and use it.</li>
            <li>She did not purchase it straight from the company and felt that she did not receive the correct product.</li>
            <li>Thanks  KG</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this eye gel after lots of research online.  </li>
            <li>so I researched the ingredients &amp; had high hopes as this one contains Haloxyl.</li>
            <li>Works really gooooood on dark circle and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Spreads easily, and within about 2-3 weeks my eyes were less puffy, and the skin looked and felt firmer.</li>
            <li>The seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns - they made that clear, so I didn&#x27;t even try.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized dark circles are pretty much irreversible.  </li>
            <li>Like her, the bottles I received were not in individual boxes ( I ordered the 2 pack) and the pump does seem to release too much of the product at once.</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly reccomend Elite Eye Serum to anyone!</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing which was a very big dissapointment..</li>
            <li>I used this product a few months ago when I was searching for a good eye cream, something to take a few years off of my face.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I started to notice significant reduction in puffiness under my eyes and also some wrinkle fading.  </li>
            <li>This serum honestly is my personal substitute for botox and it looks/feels very natural!</li>
            <li>Personally I notice that a lot of the sun damage (freckles) around the soft tissue on my eye area has almost been completely eliminated.    </li>
            <li>I have to put the excess in a clean small covered bottle &amp; use it from there between pumps.    </li>
            <li>I was slightly skeptical at first, but I thought at that price, it must definately be worth it...</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and hopefully I will have a positive review to share in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>(I figured I wouldn&#x27;t mind looking a little lopsided if it really worked.)</li>

            <li> Elite eye serum claims to eliminate wrinkles, puffiness and dark shadows around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum made my puffy eyes puffier and did nothing for my dark circles, so I followed instructions via their website and faxed their cancellation form within 30 days (well before the 45-day trial period had expired).  </li>
            <li> Tried this in 2010, to reduce my dark circles but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>

            <li> In the past I have tried other products that did not work</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week, my face felt tighter, smoother, and the wrinkles and crows feet seemed to fade away a little.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for a little bit of rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> Do I feel it was a waste of money?</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a plain envelope (not padded), just wrapped in brown packaging paper, no box and no instructions for use.</li>
            <li> It went on easily, no residue, no nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for the past 4 months and would recommend this serum to anyone looking for that anti aging breakthrough.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointing and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My Wife is a Dermatologist in a high-end MediSpa and this is her secret little weapon!  </li>
            <li> I usually get annoyed with the greasiness, the smell, the stickiness, etc....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken before and after pictures, and unfortunately I notice no difference at all in the appearance of the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I am afraid to say it has not made any difference.</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive products before without the excellents results that Elite Serum has done on my eyes.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I used Elite Under Eye Serum twice a day for 4 months as directed and it did NOTHING for my under eye bags :(  ...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works.you can feel and see the difference in a week. I highly recommend this product.  Works really gooooood on dark circle and fine lines. I have used very expensive products before without the excellents results that Elite Serum has done on my eyes.I know this product is expensive, but is worth it.  You&#x27;ll love it. You have to use it am and pm to see fast results</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye gel after lots of research online.  I have tried practically every other eye cream/gel out there. I have a masters in chemistry so I researched the ingredients &amp; had high hopes as this one contains Haloxyl. This marketing website thought it was great ([..])      I thought I would try it on just one eye, and see if it made any difference (I figured I wouldn&#x27;t mind looking a little lopsided if it really worked.) I used it twice a day for 2 months.     Pro&#x27;s: Absorbs quickly, not greasy, cooling. Skin looks slightly smoother... but I wasn&#x27;t worried about the wrinkles. They aren&#x27;t so bad. No allergic reaction.    Con&#x27;s: did not decrease dark circles.    For $100, I would have expected a better packaged product. It arrived in a plain envelope (not padded), just wrapped in brown packaging paper, no box and no instructions for use. (I know... it&#x27;s an eye gel, you put it on your eyes) The print on the label is tiny, and the label was on crooked. The seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns - they made that clear, so I didn&#x27;t even try.    The pump dispenser gives way too much product out with each pump, however you try and use it. I have to put the excess in a clean small covered bottle &amp; use it from there between pumps.    Do I feel it was a waste of money? Yes.     Which creams am I using now? I am still trying this one. If I see results after a longer time using, I&#x27;ll update this review.     I am using Origins \\&quot;eye doctor\\&quot; and Clinique \\&quot;all about eyes\\&quot; - they don&#x27;t help the dark circles either, but they do moisturize well. If you find an eye gel that works, please add feedback to this review. I&#x27;d love to find one. My search continues......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized dark circles are pretty much irreversible.  My dermatologist confirms this as well.  I feel like such a fool buying this POS for $99.  I feel duped.  What an awful product.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased the Elite Eye Serum. Almost all of the reviews that I have read have been positive. However, I did read one review where the person was upset. She did not purchase it straight from the company and felt that she did not receive the correct product. Like her, the bottles I received were not in individual boxes ( I ordered the 2 pack) and the pump does seem to release too much of the product at once. It was shipped from SkinPro International and I am hopeful that I got the correct product and not some imitation. How can I be sure that I have gotten the real deal??? I will continue to use this product and hopefully I will have a positive review to share in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first bought the All Around Eye Serum. Before trying this product I had easily tested a dozen of them and not one of them delivered the results that this product has already. I have been using the product for the past 4 months and would recommend this serum to anyone looking for that anti aging breakthrough. Botox has always pressured many women to try it out, only to find they don&#x27;t like the results. This serum honestly is my personal substitute for botox and it looks/feels very natural!</li>
            <li> I used Elite Under Eye Serum twice a day for 4 months as directed and it did NOTHING for my under eye bags :(  ...It didn&#x27;t do anything for fine lines, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye creams. I usually get annoyed with the greasiness, the smell, the stickiness, etc.... this stuff was GREAT though. I loved it and began tellin gall my friends about it. It went on easily, no residue, no nothing. Spreads easily, and within about 2-3 weeks my eyes were less puffy, and the skin looked and felt firmer. I highly recommend this to anyone, young or old, who wants to have beautiful eyes.  I am younger but spend a lot of time in the sun and unfortunately you can see that in the fine lines around my eyes.  But I am so glad I found this because it&#x27;s already began undoing my damage! Oh, and the bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would help reduce the appearance of my dark circles and smooth out fine lines.  I purchased the 2 pack as a birthday gift to myself, and I&#x27;ve been using this product twice daily for 2 months now.  I&#x27;ve taken before and after pictures, and unfortunately I notice no difference at all in the appearance of the skin around my eyes.  Before switching to this product, I was using the Oil of Olay eye serum.  I will switch back to that product today, because although it&#x27;s no miracle solution, I did notice some improvements with that serum unlike with the Elite.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed using Elite Eye Serum. I was slightly skeptical at first, but I thought at that price, it must definately be worth it... And I have to say, I was most definately right! After using Elite Eye Serum for several days, I found that I was already noticing the dark areas and wrinkles around my eyes dissapearing already! I also really liked the fact that the product was actually manufcatured in the USA! Overall I would highly reccomend Elite Eye Serum to anyone!</li>
            <li> Well, ladies (gents) . . . I have used every skincare/anti-aging product in the book, and I&#x27;ll tell you what --- Elite Skin PRODUCTS are WITHOUT EXCEPTION -- the best, as far as ingredients and effectiveness go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Try it; you&#x27;ll like it\\&quot; ;-) and won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;JMHO ....</li>
            <li> I tried this eye serum to help reduce puffiness under my eyes.  After a few uses I started to notice significant reduction in puffiness under my eyes and also some wrinkle fading.  I&#x27;ve tried several creams and serums before but this is the first one with strong results.  The product is worth the price and I&#x27;d recommend it to those wanting wrinkle reductions around the eye.</li>
            <li> My Wife is a Dermatologist in a high-end MediSpa and this is her secret little weapon!  Being the husband to a Dermatologist I am the test subject to all my wifes experiments.  This is the ONLY product that has ever reduced the appearence of my chronic dark circles and puffines that I have mostly due to genetics.  My wife is more amazed that my fine lines and smile lines around my eyes have been significanly reduced.      Personally I notice that a lot of the sun damage (freckles) around the soft tissue on my eye area has almost been completely eliminated.    I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough and I have used similar products that cost in the $300 range that you can only get through a dermatologist that don&#x27;t come close to this.    Get it NOW    Thanks  KG</li>
            <li> I started using Elite Eye Serum about 6 weeks ago and I am noticing less wrinkles and improvements in how my skin looks around my eyes.  In the past I have tried other products that did not work so I am definitely going to stick with this product.</li>
            <li> Elite eye serum, in my opinion, is a miracle among miracles. I used this product a few months ago when I was searching for a good eye cream, something to take a few years off of my face. This was the product I stuck with and swear by. After using it for about a week, my face felt tighter, smoother, and the wrinkles and crows feet seemed to fade away a little. Of course it takes some time to get some really good results, as it would with any cream. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a little bit of rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> Elite eye serum claims to eliminate wrinkles, puffiness and dark shadows around the eye area. I have found the product firms the area but the reason I purchased this &#x27;super&#x27; eye serum was to reduce the darkness under my eyes and I am afraid to say it has not made any difference. Won&#x27;t be purchasing at that price again!</li>
            <li> I followed reviews on this product for months before signing up for their replenishment program on their website (cheaper that way).  I figured the risk was low since the offer came with a satisfaction guarantee.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  There is no real \\&quot;satisfaction guarantee\\&quot; in terms of a refund within the trial period.  Elite Serum made my puffy eyes puffier and did nothing for my dark circles, so I followed instructions via their website and faxed their cancellation form within 30 days (well before the 45-day trial period had expired).  Within two weeks of cancellation, I received another shipment.  I emailed customer service with the cancellation form and cover sheet attached and told them I had cancelled weeks prior via fax.  Customer service wrote back and said the form I attached was blank and, furthermore, they never received my fax.  I re-sent the cancellation form via email (this time scanned from my printer) and have yet to have the charges reversed or receive confirmation of my cancellation.  Next step, I guess is to have my bank reverse the charges and block all future charges.</li>
            <li> Tried this in 2010, to reduce my dark circles but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Maybe only works on women?</li>
            <li> This item did not do what it promised to do.  actually...it did nothing.  The company will not accept returns on an opened item.  How am I to know this product is bogus without actually opening it &amp; trying it?  Don&#x27;t buy it because you can not return it.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointing and a total waste of money. Was very hopeful when I purchased it and paid a good amount for it. Does not do what it promises. Infact, it does nothing! Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product. I used it for 6 + weeks like the instructions said and it did absolutely nothing which was a very big dissapointment..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.  The best item to use would be to drink plenty of water.</li>
