            <li>It has a nice viscosity</li>

            <li>I was super hopeful about this conditioner being as great as everyone who wrote rave reviews</li>
            <li>But, beyond smelling wonderful, my hair is also very soft with plenty of shine.  </li>

            <li>but this one is far and away the best!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li>When using this conditioner with the Tru Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, it works incredibly well to help keep the moisture in my damaged hair and makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, smells great, makes my hair shine, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very fine.</li>
            <li>As a person with very fine hair, this conditioner has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I love love love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice light scent, and does a nice job moisturizing my scalp as well as conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great conditioner and great smelling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>hair smells, great, looks great and is maintaining that lovely red color!</li>
            <li>Smells delicious and is nice and thick making it a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells AWESOME...and along with the Tru Moroccan Shampoo, it leaves my hair silky, shiny and super manageable!!</li>
            <li>It also hydrates which is very important fact in keeping healthy looking hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>my hair fall out more</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice but again - I don&#x27;t see a huge difference and for the money ($18</li>
            <li>so I have to unscrew the top and force the conditioner out of the bottle instead of just being able to squeeze it out like I can with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo is ok.  </li>
            <li>and I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product 100 vegan :)</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love this.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels &amp; looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>It really helps soften my hair and greatly reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>also love that Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner contains no sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of weeks now and am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is better than the shampoo, but I am not a fan of either.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so smooth without making it look greasy and it gave it tons of shine!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is simply fabulous for cleansing and moisturizing my hair and scalp ... and organic to boot!  </li>
            <li>A luxurious consistency with aloe and numerous wonderful oils.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased and can feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li>Maybe two more times and my hair will be restored to how I like it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable.</li>
            <li>It also smells like love spell from 8th grade...</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was so very happy to not see a red tinted lather!!</li>
            <li>but besides that nothing &amp;#34; great&amp;#34; about it, matter fact Aussie 3 min mask was waaaayyy better.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with this product, don&#x27;t wait, buy now</li>
            <li>After using it my hair looks silky smooth and a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE BETTER FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>but I rather enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought this conditioner would be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I want to tell anyone who&#x27;s reading that this stuff smells absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I really love this product but it makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel...</li>
            <li>and I think it smells way better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this, with the Tru Moroccan shampoo, and honestly love both of them.</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>The seller was great for this product, and I believe other reviewers had a great experience, it just wasn&#x27;t the case for me.</li>
            <li>This conditioner claims to be the &amp;#34;best hair conditioner&amp;#34; and I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>The delivery is usually very fast as well, and the product is simply fascinating</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff...</li>
            <li>I love how easy I can manage my hair and</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more easy to be styled.</li>
            <li>enhanced the effects of the Tru Moroccan shampoo and gave my hair a nice silky clean feel and made drying my hair easy with or without using a dryer</li>
            <li>Washes out feeling clean not oily!</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>--it is good to do really works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>Very nice conditioner, leaves hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily with water.  </li>
            <li>My hair is damaged and breaks easily</li>
            <li>most importantly makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Helped solve my itchy flaky scalp,,,,has a very mild scent</li>
            <li>First of all let me say they smell absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I was opening the conditioner was the nice seal that was on it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was junk the first week I used it, but then I noticed my hair changing more and more with each use.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better, and I can tell it doesn&#x27;t get as oily as quickly.</li>
            <li>order arrived quickly and was preceded by a lovely email from the company with detailed instructions on product use and letting me know the order was out for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a prior Argan Moroccan Oil conditioner that I liked much better but could not find the name of the manufacturer anywhere on the tube!  </li>
            <li>makes my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>Great product, just wish is wasn&#x27;t so much smaller for the cost.</li>
            <li>(while it smells great guess it could be mixed with lotion?)</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My colorist told me to use a shampoo that was free of sulfates</li>
            <li>/&gt;Order arrived securely packaged with no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not used yet, as I am still using the lemongrass conditioner, but if the results are the same as the Argan Oil Hair Mask,it will work great.</li>
            <li>By week two, it was so silky smooth, I had no problem running a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SULFRATE FREE</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>Such a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Did not find this overpriced conidtioner leaving my hair silky smooth or anything.</li>
            <li>I will be 64 in a few days, and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>These are worth the money :)</li>
            <li>I color treat my hair alot,so this is good for your hair without all the extra additives most have.</li>
            <li>Since I keep getting kicked out of leaving a good review, this basically feels like you&#x27;re putting lotion in your hair and feels nothing like natural oils.</li>
            <li>I must say, the fragrance is very close to Victorias Secrets Love Spell which is one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>It smells so good as well as makes me hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky and smooth, not greasy or heavy like some conditioners and an added bonus, it smells great!</li>
            <li>The quest continues, my top pick right now are Pantene BB products which seem to keep the frizz under control.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find the original one I used.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this conditioner and also the shampoo to anyone looking for natural hair care with moisturizer and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Along with the shampoo, I got these Tru Moroccan products for my mom who has been a beautician for more than 25 years, and yes, she really likes them!  </li>
            <li>Just started using this product and it works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li>This is actually a great product, but I think is too little for the price, specially if you are like me and love applying conditioner on your hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great on dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair turned out clean and moist</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great conditioner for dry frizzy hair like I have.  </li>
            <li>and I think washed cleanly, but it just didn&#x27;t work any miracles on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I felt like my hair did not get clean</li>
            <li>I have had much better success with Melu (but didn&#x27;t want to pay the increased price tag, hence trying another one), and some success with Wella.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, and it leaves the hair soft and still manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love the combo together, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I love the combo together, and it really works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I just purchased another bottle of shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>True Moroccan Hair Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>I love that this Conditioner has Oatmeal in it as well as Shea Butter, you can really tell.</li>
            <li>, she mentioned it really controlled the static and helped the damaged parts of her hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I am stuck with a full bottle of each</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and...</li>
            <li>I took a chance on switching to new hair products and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>but it works really good for dry, damaged and color treated hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair soft ,Perfect for super long hair!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter and I both use this product and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this much shine and fullness to my hair, ever!!</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the email that I received after each order to give me tips for using the product effectively.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try though.</li>
            <li>I was using Pantene conditioner but wanted to make the transition to a more natural product.</li>
            <li>Wrapped a towel around my head and was thrilled to no longer see red streaks on the towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth it .</li>
            <li>I do like that the conditioner uses natural ingredients and is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Not strong but great scenet and leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>so that was an additional positive for me!</li>
            <li>this product is very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>I feel so awake, fresh and pretty.</li>
            <li>I have never spent more than $5 on shampoo/conditioner, but decided to splurge in an attempt to save my tried out hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers but not in a huge way, just a nice, little cleansing lather.</li>
            <li>I have spent a fortune on sulfate free top end &amp;#34;luxery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this product would be the magic serum for my perimenopausal hair which some days is overly frizzy, something new since I have entered my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>All the natural oils really give it a pretty suppleness, I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any hair products that are not organic.</li>
            <li>But what I like best is the more natural ingredients it contains, there are less chemicals than other conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, elastic, and even though we&#x27;re expecting a huge storm today it&#x27;s not at all frizzy or unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I guess my expectations were set pretty</li>
            <li>but... my hair felt pretty good for the first few weeks</li>
            <li>The scent is light and nice and it is rich and thick and nourishing for my hair!</li>
            <li>So I figured they are all pretty similiar</li>
            <li>Tru Moroccan is the first product I&#x27;ve found that did not irritate my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I could see and feel the difference after my first use  with Tru Moroccan and will continue to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try using a lot more next time and see if I see a difference.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of things that I miss about coloring my hair, first is the shine.</li>
            <li>The product is very concentrated and  well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just did my first wash and condition.</li>
            <li>Smell is only ok.</li>
            <li>Well smells really pretty</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb to go through my hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner for some perplexing reason seems exactly like shampoo in both consistency and function.</li>
            <li>The OCD girl in me appreciates knowing that they care enough to make sure each product was sealed after they produced it, so that I know the product hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to get used to it first.</li>
            <li>it felt very moisturized!</li>
            <li>I used Suave with Argan Oil and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li>Can definitely find something comprable for a better price.</li>
            <li>It left my hair drier and more tangled than the $4 L&#x27;oreal conditioner I was using before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it when people say things are miracle products, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>next thing I noticed was the amazing Moroccan Argan Oil smell, it has a very unique smell unlike any other</li>
            <li>Honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in this shampoo than any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it really does make your hair feel good and maybe a little shiny.</li>
            <li>After using this for almost a year and a half, I STILL love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...</li>
            <li>I have been using the Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with them both.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and works extremely well with the Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner, my daughter has VERY curly hair and these products are the only ones that I have found that manage her hair!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about the products that I use on my hair.</li>
            <li>for how well it works on my hair, well, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My dry ends are slightly better..</li>
            <li>wish it came in large bottles</li>
            <li>After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>this stuff is very drying to hair.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>I became very picky</li>
            <li>Not so much without it.</li>
            <li>A small amount of this very potent and rehydrating conditioner is all you need to thoroughly seal in moisture, shine and protection to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff did not do much for me.  </li>
            <li>It seems like the manufature put to much pressure on the cap when sealing it.</li>
            <li>My hair has been easier to style and has felt much healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it for my daughter, to keep her hair from tangling so much.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>really changed my color treated hair</li>
            <li>though, I thought it worked really well.</li>
            <li>My husband even uses it on his beard and looks SO much healthier.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I have straight hair with extensions.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell that much difference.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>it gets really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>After using it, I can pull a brush or comb straight through it with virtually no</li>
            <li>So they both take care of all my needs and wants in a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>then kind of dried out and now my scalp is flaky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad.</li>
            <li>The key ingredients are Jojoba Oil and  Argan oil which help heal, repair, strengthen and add shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;There are no artificial colors, no artificial additives, or impurities</li>
            <li>product is good but cannot get out of bottle so thick????</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner, but it does not feel any different on my fine, bleach-damaged blonde hair than any cheap conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure why this has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li>My fine greying hair hair is no longer dry and with a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair (somewhere between a 3c and 3b) and this has been my least favorite conditioner of the many I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li>So far this condition makes my already thick and wavy hair into healthy but HUGE hair.  </li>
            <li>It honestly smells very similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Lovespell&amp;#34; perfume and that is my favorite fragrance of all time.</li>
            <li>conditioner bottle itself was a downer because the top has a big piece of plastic blocking it from dispensing properly</li>
            <li>Not impressed with results in terms of making hair softer or more healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review for a hair product before, but this particular shampoo and conditioner deserves some accolade.</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot more of it than regular conditioner to get it through all of my hair and the effect it had was the same as anything else for me, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will buy for life now.</li>
            <li>My friend ordered this conditioner (along with the shampoo) and highly recommended that I try it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for both hair cleansing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>Dissapointed in the product despite the high reviews.</li>
            <li>When I use my other conditioners my hair is easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, frizzy hair (in bad need of a trim) and this makes it amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>it really does feel natural on my hair.</li>
            <li>Sometime later I&#x27;ll be sure to give a review on the long term differences.</li>
            <li>I understand, from the manufacturer, that it often takes a few weeks to really see a difference, but I saw how nice it left my hair after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could this be the savior for my new color?</li>
            <li>Tru Moroccan conditioner is my new go to product.</li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and it has a nice scent, but my hair looked dull.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it left it feeling flat and all tangled up.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>this stuff made my hair so soft and manageable...love it!</li>
            <li>A bit pricy,but the better products usually are.</li>
            <li>how unbelievably soft it feels after I use this!</li>
            <li>The conditioner applies easily and a little goes</li>
            <li>I recently colored my blonde hair a very bold red..</li>
            <li>Nice smelling &amp; very thick.</li>
            <li>lathered into my head very well and the conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and nothing helps ..</li>
            <li>As with any of these natural ingredient shampoos, your hair can feel &#x27;stripped&#x27; when your hair is wet, however this is only because most people are used to the way hair feels when it is washed with and coated with chemicals in regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was recommended this brand conditioner (and shampoo) from a hair care proffesional to try and have been very pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>My hair isnâ€™t too soft that it doesnâ€™t hold a style.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Moroccan Repair Conditioner also uses natural ingredients to moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>but so far not the option I want for controlled hair.  </li>
            <li>BUT I can say that it does leaves my hair so so soft and shiny after each use.</li>
            <li>But so far that has not been the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tru Moroccan conditioner leaves your hair feeling so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft, but not greasy as a quality conditioner</li>
            <li>This conditioner has tamed some of that wild woman</li>
            <li>However, unlike &amp;#34;Lovespell,&amp;#34; this product is made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace another argan oil shampoo I had been using and it just doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve stored it for a while, it&#x27;s a week old)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes hair soft..</li>
            <li>So far, the Tru Moroccan has &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; my hair, the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After going through a bottle, on her mid-back length hair, she said that it didn&#x27;t leave her hair soft or silky.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, this product is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry curly hair</li>
            <li>During pregnancy my hair has been horribly dry and brittle and this is helping so much!</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this after reading the reviews, but at least for my hair, it is not creamy enough at all and feels almost like it dries my hair out more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Now granted, I did have a bit of a tangled mess after lathering up that full mane of mine so it was time to try the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Again I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a deep conditioner out there that would do the same for half the price</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and sometimes it falls flat, so I was worried that the argan oil would weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily or normal hair  and do not need extra moisture</li>
            <li>I co-wash everyday and do a full wash once a week.</li>
            <li>It helps maintain the natural wave and body in my hair, something I had lost after years of using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am not left with a soft moisturized feel that I like from conditioners...  </li>
            <li>Smell is nice, not WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>Victoria&#x27;s secret love spell lotion</li>
            <li>Not a great detangler and my hair feels kind of dry</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the recipe a bit because it&#x27;s thick enough for me, and it lathers just fine.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this conditioner to anyone suffering from extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will use the rest of the product but won&#x27;t waste my money on purchasing more unless it goes down to about $4 /</li>
            <li>It really helps tame the frizz and makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and it was not a good fit.  </li>
            <li>It really does moisturize your hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 and have very little strength in my right hand--even turning it upside down and pounding it--I really have difficulty squeezing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li>I have very long, naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>Great product ,small bottle ,a bit expensive</li>
            <li>After i blow dry my hair it is so soft .</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair and it tends to get frizzy in the summer heat.</li>

            <li> This conditioner comes in a nice size bottle.  </li>
            <li> To each their own.</li>
            <li> It has a nice viscosity</li>
            <li> scent is nice and not overpowering as some Moroccan products can be.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> and my thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This duo will be my new go-to to make my hair look its best!!</li>
            <li> I was super hopeful about this conditioner being as great as everyone who wrote rave reviews</li>
            <li> But, beyond smelling wonderful, my hair is also very soft with plenty of shine.  </li>
            <li> The best conditioner that I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> Love love this conditioner !</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for sure!</li>
            <li> but this one is far and away the best!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li> When using this conditioner with the Tru Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, it works incredibly well to help keep the moisture in my damaged hair and makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, smells great, makes my hair shine, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very fine.</li>
            <li> As a person with very fine hair, this conditioner has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I love love love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice light scent, and does a nice job moisturizing my scalp as well as conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great conditioner and great smelling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> hair smells, great, looks great and is maintaining that lovely red color!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and is nice and thick making it a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells AWESOME...and along with the Tru Moroccan Shampoo, it leaves my hair silky, shiny and super manageable!!</li>
            <li> It also hydrates which is very important fact in keeping healthy looking hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> my hair fall out more</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice but again - I don&#x27;t see a huge difference and for the money ($18</li>
            <li> so I have to unscrew the top and force the conditioner out of the bottle instead of just being able to squeeze it out like I can with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo is ok.  </li>
            <li> and I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product 100 vegan :)</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels &amp; looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> It really helps soften my hair and greatly reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> also love that Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner contains no sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of weeks now and am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is better than the shampoo, but I am not a fan of either.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so smooth without making it look greasy and it gave it tons of shine!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is simply fabulous for cleansing and moisturizing my hair and scalp ... and organic to boot!  </li>
            <li> A luxurious consistency with aloe and numerous wonderful oils.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased and can feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe two more times and my hair will be restored to how I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable.</li>
            <li> It also smells like love spell from 8th grade...</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was so very happy to not see a red tinted lather!!</li>
            <li> but besides that nothing &amp;#34; great&amp;#34; about it, matter fact Aussie 3 min mask was waaaayyy better.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with this product, don&#x27;t wait, buy now</li>
            <li> After using it my hair looks silky smooth and a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE BETTER FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> but I rather enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner would be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I want to tell anyone who&#x27;s reading that this stuff smells absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I really love this product but it makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel...</li>
            <li> and I think it smells way better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this, with the Tru Moroccan shampoo, and honestly love both of them.</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> The seller was great for this product, and I believe other reviewers had a great experience, it just wasn&#x27;t the case for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner claims to be the &amp;#34;best hair conditioner&amp;#34; and I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> The delivery is usually very fast as well, and the product is simply fascinating</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff...</li>
            <li> I love how easy I can manage my hair and</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more easy to be styled.</li>
            <li> enhanced the effects of the Tru Moroccan shampoo and gave my hair a nice silky clean feel and made drying my hair easy with or without using a dryer</li>
            <li> Washes out feeling clean not oily!</li>
            <li> I did receive this product complimentary for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> --it is good to do really works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner, leaves hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily with water.  </li>
            <li> My hair is damaged and breaks easily</li>
            <li> most importantly makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Helped solve my itchy flaky scalp,,,,has a very mild scent</li>
            <li> First of all let me say they smell absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I was opening the conditioner was the nice seal that was on it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was junk the first week I used it, but then I noticed my hair changing more and more with each use.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better, and I can tell it doesn&#x27;t get as oily as quickly.</li>
            <li> order arrived quickly and was preceded by a lovely email from the company with detailed instructions on product use and letting me know the order was out for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a prior Argan Moroccan Oil conditioner that I liked much better but could not find the name of the manufacturer anywhere on the tube!  </li>
            <li> makes my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> Great product, just wish is wasn&#x27;t so much smaller for the cost.</li>
            <li> (while it smells great guess it could be mixed with lotion?)</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My colorist told me to use a shampoo that was free of sulfates</li>
            <li> /&gt;Order arrived securely packaged with no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used yet, as I am still using the lemongrass conditioner, but if the results are the same as the Argan Oil Hair Mask,it will work great.</li>
            <li> By week two, it was so silky smooth, I had no problem running a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SULFRATE FREE</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> Such a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not find this overpriced conidtioner leaving my hair silky smooth or anything.</li>
            <li> I will be 64 in a few days, and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> These are worth the money :)</li>
            <li> I color treat my hair alot,so this is good for your hair without all the extra additives most have.</li>
            <li> Since I keep getting kicked out of leaving a good review, this basically feels like you&#x27;re putting lotion in your hair and feels nothing like natural oils.</li>
            <li> I must say, the fragrance is very close to Victorias Secrets Love Spell which is one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> It smells so good as well as makes me hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and smooth, not greasy or heavy like some conditioners and an added bonus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> The quest continues, my top pick right now are Pantene BB products which seem to keep the frizz under control.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find the original one I used.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner and also the shampoo to anyone looking for natural hair care with moisturizer and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo, I got these Tru Moroccan products for my mom who has been a beautician for more than 25 years, and yes, she really likes them!  </li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product, but I think is too little for the price, specially if you are like me and love applying conditioner on your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned out clean and moist</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner for dry frizzy hair like I have.  </li>
            <li> and I think washed cleanly, but it just didn&#x27;t work any miracles on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I felt like my hair did not get clean</li>
            <li> I have had much better success with Melu (but didn&#x27;t want to pay the increased price tag, hence trying another one), and some success with Wella.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, and it leaves the hair soft and still manageable.  </li>
            <li> I love the combo together, and it really works.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I love the combo together, and it really works.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I just purchased another bottle of shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> True Moroccan Hair Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> I love that this Conditioner has Oatmeal in it as well as Shea Butter, you can really tell.</li>
            <li> , she mentioned it really controlled the static and helped the damaged parts of her hair.  </li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with a full bottle of each</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and...</li>
            <li> I took a chance on switching to new hair products and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> but it works really good for dry, damaged and color treated hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft ,Perfect for super long hair!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I both use this product and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this much shine and fullness to my hair, ever!!</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the email that I received after each order to give me tips for using the product effectively.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is worth a try though.</li>
            <li> I was using Pantene conditioner but wanted to make the transition to a more natural product.</li>
            <li> Wrapped a towel around my head and was thrilled to no longer see red streaks on the towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth it .</li>
            <li> I do like that the conditioner uses natural ingredients and is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Not strong but great scenet and leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> so that was an additional positive for me!</li>
            <li> this product is very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> I feel so awake, fresh and pretty.</li>
            <li> I have never spent more than $5 on shampoo/conditioner, but decided to splurge in an attempt to save my tried out hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers but not in a huge way, just a nice, little cleansing lather.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on sulfate free top end &amp;#34;luxery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would be the magic serum for my perimenopausal hair which some days is overly frizzy, something new since I have entered my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> All the natural oils really give it a pretty suppleness, I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any hair products that are not organic.</li>
            <li> But what I like best is the more natural ingredients it contains, there are less chemicals than other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, elastic, and even though we&#x27;re expecting a huge storm today it&#x27;s not at all frizzy or unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I guess my expectations were set pretty</li>
            <li> but... my hair felt pretty good for the first few weeks</li>
            <li> The scent is light and nice and it is rich and thick and nourishing for my hair!</li>
            <li> So I figured they are all pretty similiar</li>
            <li> Tru Moroccan is the first product I&#x27;ve found that did not irritate my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I could see and feel the difference after my first use  with Tru Moroccan and will continue to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try using a lot more next time and see if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things that I miss about coloring my hair, first is the shine.</li>
            <li> The product is very concentrated and  well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just did my first wash and condition.</li>
            <li> Smell is only ok.</li>
            <li> Well smells really pretty</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb to go through my hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner for some perplexing reason seems exactly like shampoo in both consistency and function.</li>
            <li> The OCD girl in me appreciates knowing that they care enough to make sure each product was sealed after they produced it, so that I know the product hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to get used to it first.</li>
            <li> it felt very moisturized!</li>
            <li> I used Suave with Argan Oil and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li> Can definitely find something comprable for a better price.</li>
            <li> It left my hair drier and more tangled than the $4 L&#x27;oreal conditioner I was using before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it when people say things are miracle products, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> next thing I noticed was the amazing Moroccan Argan Oil smell, it has a very unique smell unlike any other</li>
            <li> Honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in this shampoo than any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it really does make your hair feel good and maybe a little shiny.</li>
            <li> After using this for almost a year and a half, I STILL love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with them both.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and works extremely well with the Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner, my daughter has VERY curly hair and these products are the only ones that I have found that manage her hair!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about the products that I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> for how well it works on my hair, well, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My dry ends are slightly better..</li>
            <li> wish it came in large bottles</li>
            <li> After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very drying to hair.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> I became very picky</li>
            <li> Not so much without it.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this very potent and rehydrating conditioner is all you need to thoroughly seal in moisture, shine and protection to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do much for me.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the manufature put to much pressure on the cap when sealing it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been easier to style and has felt much healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it for my daughter, to keep her hair from tangling so much.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> really changed my color treated hair</li>
            <li> though, I thought it worked really well.</li>
            <li> My husband even uses it on his beard and looks SO much healthier.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I have straight hair with extensions.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell that much difference.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> it gets really frizzy.  </li>
            <li> After using it, I can pull a brush or comb straight through it with virtually no</li>
            <li> So they both take care of all my needs and wants in a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> then kind of dried out and now my scalp is flaky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> The key ingredients are Jojoba Oil and  Argan oil which help heal, repair, strengthen and add shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;There are no artificial colors, no artificial additives, or impurities</li>
            <li> product is good but cannot get out of bottle so thick????</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner, but it does not feel any different on my fine, bleach-damaged blonde hair than any cheap conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why this has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li> My fine greying hair hair is no longer dry and with a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (somewhere between a 3c and 3b) and this has been my least favorite conditioner of the many I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li> So far this condition makes my already thick and wavy hair into healthy but HUGE hair.  </li>
            <li> It honestly smells very similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Lovespell&amp;#34; perfume and that is my favorite fragrance of all time.</li>
            <li> conditioner bottle itself was a downer because the top has a big piece of plastic blocking it from dispensing properly</li>
            <li> Not impressed with results in terms of making hair softer or more healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a hair product before, but this particular shampoo and conditioner deserves some accolade.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot more of it than regular conditioner to get it through all of my hair and the effect it had was the same as anything else for me, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will buy for life now.</li>
            <li> My friend ordered this conditioner (along with the shampoo) and highly recommended that I try it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for both hair cleansing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed in the product despite the high reviews.</li>
            <li> When I use my other conditioners my hair is easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, frizzy hair (in bad need of a trim) and this makes it amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> it really does feel natural on my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometime later I&#x27;ll be sure to give a review on the long term differences.</li>
            <li> I understand, from the manufacturer, that it often takes a few weeks to really see a difference, but I saw how nice it left my hair after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could this be the savior for my new color?</li>
            <li> Tru Moroccan conditioner is my new go to product.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and it has a nice scent, but my hair looked dull.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it left it feeling flat and all tangled up.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> this stuff made my hair so soft and manageable...love it!</li>
            <li> A bit pricy,but the better products usually are.</li>
            <li> how unbelievably soft it feels after I use this!</li>
            <li> The conditioner applies easily and a little goes</li>
            <li> I recently colored my blonde hair a very bold red..</li>
            <li> Nice smelling &amp; very thick.</li>
            <li> lathered into my head very well and the conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and nothing helps ..</li>
            <li> As with any of these natural ingredient shampoos, your hair can feel &#x27;stripped&#x27; when your hair is wet, however this is only because most people are used to the way hair feels when it is washed with and coated with chemicals in regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was recommended this brand conditioner (and shampoo) from a hair care proffesional to try and have been very pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair isnâ€™t too soft that it doesnâ€™t hold a style.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Moroccan Repair Conditioner also uses natural ingredients to moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> but so far not the option I want for controlled hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT I can say that it does leaves my hair so so soft and shiny after each use.</li>
            <li> But so far that has not been the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tru Moroccan conditioner leaves your hair feeling so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft, but not greasy as a quality conditioner</li>
            <li> This conditioner has tamed some of that wild woman</li>
            <li> However, unlike &amp;#34;Lovespell,&amp;#34; this product is made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace another argan oil shampoo I had been using and it just doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve stored it for a while, it&#x27;s a week old)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes hair soft..</li>
            <li> So far, the Tru Moroccan has &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; my hair, the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After going through a bottle, on her mid-back length hair, she said that it didn&#x27;t leave her hair soft or silky.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, this product is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry curly hair</li>
            <li> During pregnancy my hair has been horribly dry and brittle and this is helping so much!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this after reading the reviews, but at least for my hair, it is not creamy enough at all and feels almost like it dries my hair out more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Now granted, I did have a bit of a tangled mess after lathering up that full mane of mine so it was time to try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Again I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a deep conditioner out there that would do the same for half the price</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and sometimes it falls flat, so I was worried that the argan oil would weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily or normal hair  and do not need extra moisture</li>
            <li> I co-wash everyday and do a full wash once a week.</li>
            <li> It helps maintain the natural wave and body in my hair, something I had lost after years of using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am not left with a soft moisturized feel that I like from conditioners...  </li>
            <li> Smell is nice, not WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> Victoria&#x27;s secret love spell lotion</li>
            <li> Not a great detangler and my hair feels kind of dry</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the recipe a bit because it&#x27;s thick enough for me, and it lathers just fine.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this conditioner to anyone suffering from extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will use the rest of the product but won&#x27;t waste my money on purchasing more unless it goes down to about $4 /</li>
            <li> It really helps tame the frizz and makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and it was not a good fit.  </li>
            <li> It really does moisturize your hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 and have very little strength in my right hand--even turning it upside down and pounding it--I really have difficulty squeezing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> I have very long, naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> Great product ,small bottle ,a bit expensive</li>
            <li> After i blow dry my hair it is so soft .</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair and it tends to get frizzy in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very curly, but also pretty thin hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I just like the creamy soft lather I&#x27;ve gotten out of other conditioners.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny  but as far as a conditioner it does not work like my other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to wash my hair without leaving it flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to notice if it repairs split ends or not</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and this bottle wouldnt last me 2 weeks.wont buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY dry and dead, full of split ends and before using this conditioner my hair was such a dry, frizzy, tangled mess after stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this conditioner brought it back to life!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks with no noticeable difference aside from it being less soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have dry scalp too especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for a couple of minutes and when I went to blow my hair dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day because I&#x27;m afraid since it is an oil shampoo/conditioner, that it will make my hair look greasy after awhile, but I love it on the days I do use it.</li>
            <li> Helps comb glide through my long hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair like me  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did not wow me or help &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair has been feeling so soft and silky since I started using it a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Thick consistency and really like the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not any different then any other product I use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to identify all of the individual ingredients I am sensitive to.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> w hair prodicts bc of problematic scalp and dry hair</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have oily hair, and she doesn&#x27;t have dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner even helps with dry scalp and dandruff which I every now and than battle.</li>
            <li> Only average for conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, makes my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> I have corse , highlighted hair very very dry ...</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and the conditioner gave it a heavy waxy feel</li>
            <li> I have thick, natural wavy/curly hair and when I let it air dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I also wait until my hair is dry, and then put a small &amp;#34;dollop&amp;#34; of the conditioner in the palm of one hand, rub my hands together, and distribute that through about the last 2 inches of my long hair.</li>
            <li> I expected the consistency to be something like the Moroccan Oil shampoo brand..</li>
            <li> It made my thick curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t however, leave her hair feeling refreshed as it didn&#x27;t weigh down her long locks.</li>
            <li> But a little flat.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the price, because chances are, you&#x27;ll be using one bottle for a month or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times I washed my newly red hair, I watched my expensive color go down the drain.</li>
            <li> I will try their other products, too.</li>
            <li> Probably other things as well</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 star review is due to the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use one of my other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year while still regularly dyeing it, and as a result my hair has become brittle and wiry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but my bottle was mostly water and quite ineffective.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as the description says it does &amp; definitely is not worth the money (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> and I used the conditioner and left it in for at least 15 minutes and rinsed and when I got out I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the conditioner is the fact that it was so thick.</li>
            <li> Flipped my head upside down and started to work it through.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry due to the pool water; Alice and I swim everyday; not only am I exhausted at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say the shampoo is runny.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the cost!  </li>
            <li> Its ok, not great /not bad.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> I still give five stars because it works and they tell you the size of the bottle; However, I am using the now the Hair One cleanser that is cheaper and does wonders to my dried hair.</li>
            <li> it says I have to use it for few months to see results.</li>
            <li> I apply coconut oil and let it sit for few hours then wash it off with shampoo and this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I try t change ever few months</li>
            <li> and I wasted close to $30.00.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if conditioner goes bad, but I just got this stuff and used it for the first time</li>
            <li> I have very dry, and, weak hair.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sometimes very dry.</li>
            <li> but so thick you have trouble squeezing it out of the container...</li>
            <li> I see no improvement for my hair, I usually use Pantene and Dove.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its me</li>
            <li> with the shampoo, use a small amount of the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I tend to use a small amount once a week for a hydrating boosst.</li>
            <li> I am not able to \\&quot;pop\\</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the fragrance is that they use</li>
            <li> and it looked oily way quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> But she did notice that this winter her hair felt a bit coarser than usual and wanted something to hydrate the hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway I have hair past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive to bad</li>
            <li> I have very thick medium porosity hair and this conditioner ranks the lowest among my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a pain to unscrew the bottle, poor conditioner in one hand and try to recap it with the other.</li>
            <li> Need to remove cap and shake hard to come out.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really hard to get a shine.</li>
            <li> I find my hair is extremely hard to comb through after I use it..</li>
            <li> Conditioner is too thick for the opening  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Will not come out of bottle, too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have Caucasian thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean it didn&#x27;t bother me that it was thick, but the packaging it was in made it a little difficult for it to get out of the bottle because of it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less expensive</li>
            <li> Not for thick curly hair - way too thin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment about it&#x27;s effectiveness as right after I applied it and realized that the horrible smell was coming from head</li>
            <li> This conditionermakes my hair lifeless, and dull....also leaves a residue that makes my hair feel dirty again in less than 8 hours, and leaves a sticky finish....  </li>
            <li> Pool water is HARD on hair!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of t-gel and dandruff shampoos that also smell badly, but this smelled like bad food or rancid oil</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> said it was, but sadly it was not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive for the outcome.</li>
            <li> Sadly, all I got were mediocre results.</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner and would recommend it except the bottle is almost impossible to squeeze.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad allergy to anything with lauryl, laureth, or sulfate in it.  </li>
            <li> Just be prepared to be frustrated for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> If that is what you are looking for too, do not try this product - you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed in hair results.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst conditioner I have ever used made my hair even dryer and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Worst I ever used.</li>
            <li> but it smells TERRIBLE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my hair fall out more</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived on time in perfect condition. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice light scent, and does a nice job moisturizing my scalp as well as conditioning my hair.  It rinses out easily with water.  The best conditioner that I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff...but so thick you have trouble squeezing it out of the container...The fragrance is nice, and it leaves the hair soft and still manageable.  I will try their other products, too.</li>
            <li> This had been soooo great for my hair.  Finally!</li>
            <li> wish it came in large bottles</li>
            <li> Conditioner is too thick for the opening  Need to remove cap and shake hard to come out.  Also found need to use a lot to get smoother feel to hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! Not any different then any other product I use.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week. I co-wash everyday and do a full wash once a week. I have very dry, and, weak hair. I see no improvement for my hair, I usually use Pantene and Dove. It&#x27;s over priced for no difference.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and nothing helps ..this stuff made my hair so soft and manageable...love it!</li>
            <li> Great product ,small bottle ,a bit expensive</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice but again - I don&#x27;t see a huge difference and for the money ($18+ / bottle) I guess my expectations were set pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner bottle itself was a downer because the top has a big piece of plastic blocking it from dispensing properly so I have to unscrew the top and force the conditioner out of the bottle instead of just being able to squeeze it out like I can with the shampoo.  Overall, I will use the rest of the product but won&#x27;t waste my money on purchasing more unless it goes down to about $4 / bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is ok.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as the description says it does &amp; definitely is not worth the money (in my opinion).  I have the conditioner as well</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best! It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing. It really helps tame the frizz and makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Not for thick curly hair - way too thin</li>
            <li> Very thick and sometimes very dry. After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels. After i blow dry my hair it is so soft .</li>
            <li> This product is the best that I&#x27;ve found.Nice smelling &amp; very thick. My hair is naturally very fine.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. I was super hopeful about this conditioner being as great as everyone who wrote rave reviews said it was, but sadly it was not. I have long thick curly brown hair. I guess I just like the creamy soft lather I&#x27;ve gotten out of other conditioners. If that is what you are looking for too, do not try this product - you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Argan oils are rage these days. I was provided a sample for review. Nice packaging/well made. No side effects observed.</li>
            <li> I have been using coconut oil to deep condition my hair until I found this conditioner. This stuff works amazingly! It is creamy, silky and feels great on my hair. I leave it on while I shower to give my hair a deeper conditioning and I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product 100 vegan :)</li>
            <li> Not sure if its me but... my hair felt pretty good for the first few weeks then kind of dried out and now my scalp is flaky. I used both the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry curly hair and I am pleased with this conditioner.  The scent is light and nice and it is rich and thick and nourishing for my hair! I received this conditioner as well as the coordinating shampoo in order to leave an honest review and I am pleased with both!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It smells so good and I love love love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.It allows me to wash my hair without leaving it flat and lifeless.  It helps maintain the natural wave and body in my hair, something I had lost after years of using regular shampoo and conditioner. I will continue to use and recommend this product to others. I especially appreciate the email that I received after each order to give me tips for using the product effectively.</li>
            <li> My handicapped wife uses this about 2 times a week and she thinks it is the best conditioner she has ever used on her hair.</li>
            <li> I used a prior Argan Moroccan Oil conditioner that I liked much better but could not find the name of the manufacturer anywhere on the tube!  So I figured they are all pretty similiar, right?  WRONG!  I wish I could find the original one I used.  It was great!</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this.  It makes my hair very soft.  I have wavy hair that likes to frizz and this helps with that.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because I&#x27;m afraid since it is an oil shampoo/conditioner, that it will make my hair look greasy after awhile, but I love it on the days I do use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner, leaves hair soft and easy to comb through. Well worth the money. Be sure to use in conjunction with the shampoo for best results.</li>
            <li> After Naked Naturals was discontinued years ago, I searched for a shampoo and conditioner I could use that would not cause my lower scalp by my neck to peel and flake.  I have a bad allergy to anything with lauryl, laureth, or sulfate in it.  Probably other things as well but it&#x27;s hard to identify all of the individual ingredients I am sensitive to.  Tru Moroccan is the first product I&#x27;ve found that did not irritate my scalp.  As with any of these natural ingredient shampoos, your hair can feel &#x27;stripped&#x27; when your hair is wet, however this is only because most people are used to the way hair feels when it is washed with and coated with chemicals in regular shampoo.  With Tru Moroccan my hair looks and feels great, and I have no scalp peeling.  My hair is damaged and breaks easily so I&#x27;m eager to see if it helps this problem over time.  Last but not least, this product is made in the USA!  I hope it is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on dry and damaged hair. I&#x27;ve switched from using my store bought conditioner to Tru Moroccan.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and this works better than 95%.The oil has a pleasant smell and most importantly makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft ,Perfect for super long hair! my hair feels &amp; looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner, I use it right after the tru moroccan best hair shampoo and leave it in for 5 minutes. It really helps soften my hair and greatly reduces the frizz. It&#x27;s great conditioner and great smelling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very drying to hair.</li>
            <li> Best ever conditioner! Use only on ends of hair, not on scalp. Your hair just shines and feels so healthy!</li>
            <li> Will not come out of bottle, too thick.  Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but it&#x27;s okay. I have dry hair and this doesn&#x27;t really help. Still on the search for a really good organic shampoo and conditioner that isn&#x27;t 50,000 dollars. (I know, exaggerating.) This is worth a try though.</li>
            <li> Great product to use with its sister shampoo,as it adds more smell(that I like) and feels fluffier and healthier. I color treat my hair alot,so this is good for your hair without all the extra additives most have. A bit pricy,but the better products usually are.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this brand conditioner (and shampoo) from a hair care proffesional to try and have been very pleasantly surprised with the results. I could see and feel the difference after my first use  with Tru Moroccan and will continue to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about the products that I use on my hair. I was referred over to this conditioner by a friend and I am so happy that I gave it a try. My hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I was using Pantene conditioner but wanted to make the transition to a more natural product. I have been very pleased with this conditioner. It works well on my hair and I feel good about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Not strong but great scenet and leaves my hair silky. I became very picky w hair prodicts bc of problematic scalp and dry hair but i am completely happy with this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will buy for life now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once and I&#x27;m on the fence with it.  My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean.  I&#x27;ll have to try using a lot more next time and see if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> makes my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things that I miss about coloring my hair, first is the shine. When I color my hair I have the shiniest hair!! Not so much without it. I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to review Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Iâ€™m thoroughly impressed with both the Tru Moroccan Repair Shampoo and the Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioners. Both are made of high-quality ingredients. Both smell divine!!  But, beyond smelling wonderful, my hair is also very soft with plenty of shine.  My hair isnâ€™t too soft that it doesnâ€™t hold a style.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is great my silver hair. Tru Moroccan Conditioner contains Jojoba along with Argan oil to strengthen, protect, and provide shine.&lt;br /&gt;Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner also uses natural ingredients to moisturize my hair and scalp. My hair is so dry due to the pool water; Alice and I swim everyday; not only am I exhausted at the end of the day but my hair also takes the brunt of the damage. Pool water is HARD on hair!! This duo has truly helped to repair my hair, restore itâ€™s shine and make my hair feel so soft!&lt;br /&gt;As with the shampoo, use a small amount of the conditioner as well. A small amount of this very potent and rehydrating conditioner is all you need to thoroughly seal in moisture, shine and protection to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner contains no sulfates or parabens. This shampoo is not tested on animals. The shampoo is gentle enough to use everyday.I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> enhanced the effects of the Tru Moroccan shampoo and gave my hair a nice silky clean feel and made drying my hair easy with or without using a dryer</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased the Tru Morocaan Shampoo, you HAVE to purchase the Conditioner as well!  I love the combo together, and it really works.  I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy.  I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...and it&#x27;s true.  You have to try this out!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this conditioner. Not a great detangler and my hair feels kind of dry</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great, love the product design, and it makes my hair feel great afterwards. Very satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of weeks now and am extremely pleased with the results. My fine greying hair hair is no longer dry and with a tendency to frizz. The product is very concentrated and  well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this has such great reviews. I have very long, naturally wavy hair and I used the conditioner and left it in for at least 15 minutes and rinsed and when I got out I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it. Wasted money. I&#x27;ll go back to my 3.00 bottle of Aussie 3 minute miracle.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product, but I think is too little for the price, specially if you are like me and love applying conditioner on your hair. I still give five stars because it works and they tell you the size of the bottle; However, I am using the now the Hair One cleanser that is cheaper and does wonders to my dried hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do much for me.  I have curly hair (somewhere between a 3c and 3b) and this has been my least favorite conditioner of the many I have tried recently.  I am not left with a soft moisturized feel that I like from conditioners...  Would not buy this again.  The conditioner is better than the shampoo, but I am not a fan of either.</li>
            <li> Great product, just wish is wasn&#x27;t so much smaller for the cost.</li>
            <li> My friend ordered this conditioner (along with the shampoo) and highly recommended that I try it. I am so glad that I did! I have dry hair and this conditioner brought it back to life! It made my hair so smooth without making it look greasy and it gave it tons of shine! Plus, it smells AMAZING! I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I am a no shampoo girl, have used conditioner only to cleanse my short sassy hair for 2 1/2 years.  This conditioner is simply fabulous for cleansing and moisturizing my hair and scalp ... and organic to boot!  A luxurious consistency with aloe and numerous wonderful oils.  Leaves your scalp and hair moisturized and softened, and also cleansed if you are a no shampoo person like me.  The tropical scent makes me feel as if I am on vacation.  Highly recommend for both hair cleansing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> This item is garbage....</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner it really does make your hair feel good and maybe a little shiny.</li>
            <li> This did not agree with my hair.  I have Caucasian thick wavy hair and it was not a good fit.  It also made my back and chest break out.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel &amp;#34;Silky, and gives no Body&amp;#34;. Left my hair feeling tangled and heavy/greasy feeling at the scalp. Dissapointed in the product despite the high reviews. I have fine hair and it left it feeling flat and all tangled up.</li>
            <li> Just did my first wash and condition. I was pleased and can feel and see the difference. Maybe two more times and my hair will be restored to how I like it. The aroma is pleasant for showers in the morning too. I feel so awake, fresh and pretty.</li>
            <li> I wish I had just started with the similarly priced but way nicer product I use now.Love it</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner and would recommend it except the bottle is almost impossible to squeeze.  I am 75 and have very little strength in my right hand--even turning it upside down and pounding it--I really have difficulty squeezing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> Not even close to MoroccanOil conditioner.  I had high expectations for this after reading the reviews, but at least for my hair, it is not creamy enough at all and feels almost like it dries my hair out more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Helped solve my itchy flaky scalp,,,,has a very mild scent</li>
            <li> So far this condition makes my already thick and wavy hair into healthy but HUGE hair.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying it but so far not the option I want for controlled hair.  I will update if this changes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to notice if it repairs split ends or not BUT I can say that it does leaves my hair so so soft and shiny after each use. My hair is VERY dry and dead, full of split ends and before using this conditioner my hair was such a dry, frizzy, tangled mess after stepping out of the shower. I really do recommend this conditioner to anyone suffering from extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair shiny or silky at all.</li>
            <li> Its ok, not great /not bad. Smell is nice, not WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> I expected the consistency to be something like the Moroccan Oil shampoo brand.. this product is very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable. I have very long, very curly, but also pretty thin hair. I have never spent more than $5 on shampoo/conditioner, but decided to splurge in an attempt to save my tried out hair. I went with this one based on reviews, but would not but again.  The conditioner is much better than the shampoo, but I still need to use a lot of leave in conditioning creme for my hair to be manageable. A biggest pro is that it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased the Tru Morocaan Shampoo, you HAVE to purchase the Conditioner as well! I love the combo together, and it really works. I think the conditioner did wonders in helping my dry damaged hair feel soft, silky, and healthy. I&#x27;ve already said a lot of positive things in the review for the shampoo...and it&#x27;s true. You have to try this out!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works extremely well with the Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner, my daughter has VERY curly hair and these products are the only ones that I have found that manage her hair! The delivery is usually very fast as well, and the product is simply fascinating</li>
            <li> Only average for conditioner. Not impressed with results in terms of making hair softer or more healthy. Smell is only ok. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Since I keep getting kicked out of leaving a good review, this basically feels like you&#x27;re putting lotion in your hair and feels nothing like natural oils. Also smells like Victoria&#x27;s secret love spell lotion (while it smells great guess it could be mixed with lotion?)</li>
            <li> I does a great job. Helps comb glide through my long hair. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks with no noticeable difference aside from it being less soft to the touch. It also smells like love spell from 8th grade... Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and hydrated. It never feels greasy. I tend to use a small amount once a week for a hydrating boosst. The reason for the 4 star review is due to the bottle itself. I am not able to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; the cap open like it should. It seems like the manufature put to much pressure on the cap when sealing it. It is a bit of a pain to unscrew the bottle, poor conditioner in one hand and try to recap it with the other. With out that isssue the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on switching to new hair products and I am so glad that I did. Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner are great products. My hair has been easier to style and has felt much healthier.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair.smells&lt;br /&gt;awesome.too pricey for me.I have long hair, and this bottle wouldnt last me 2 weeks.wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with them both.  I have fine hair and sometimes it falls flat, so I was worried that the argan oil would weigh my hair down.  But so far that has not been the case.&lt;br /&gt;This is a deeper conditioner that also provides shine to my hair.  I&#x27;ve also been using it for my daughter, to keep her hair from tangling so much.  But what I like best is the more natural ingredients it contains, there are less chemicals than other conditioners.  The scent is fruity and smells nice without aggravating my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service has also been very kind and helpful.  I would recommend this conditioner and also the shampoo to anyone looking for natural hair care with moisturizer and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Tru Moroccan conditioner leaves your hair feeling so soft and manageable. The smell is great, too! It makes me think of summertime and the beach. My teenage daughter and I both use this product and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but my bottle was mostly water and quite ineffective. It did not do any conditioning.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. it really does feel natural on my hair. I have tried several comditioners but this one does make a difference. it says I have to use it for few months to see results. I have medium thick hair so it&#x27;s really hard to get a shine. I apply coconut oil and let it sit for few hours then wash it off with shampoo and this conditioner. it doesn&#x27;t need lot of water to rinse it off either. I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I recently colored my blonde hair a very bold red.. The first few times I washed my newly red hair, I watched my expensive color go down the drain. My colorist told me to use a shampoo that was free of sulfates so I took to Amazon to find a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Tru Moroccan, read over the ingredients and decided to give it a try, ordering both shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived quickly and was preceded by a lovely email from the company with detailed instructions on product use and letting me know the order was out for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived securely packaged with no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, next to wash my waist length, newly red mane. This product smells so great!! The shampoo lathers but not in a huge way, just a nice, little cleansing lather. I was so very happy to not see a red tinted lather!! Could this be the savior for my new color? Now granted, I did have a bit of a tangled mess after lathering up that full mane of mine so it was time to try the conditioner. I used an amount equal to a grape. Flipped my head upside down and started to work it through. All those tangles melted away and no red color left my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed my hair, did not repeat. Wrapped a towel around my head and was thrilled to no longer see red streaks on the towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells, great, looks great and is maintaining that lovely red color! I love this product so much, I just purchased another bottle of shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am posting this same review on the shampoo)</li>
            <li> My hair turned out clean and moist</li>
            <li> Well smells really pretty but besides that nothing &amp;#34; great&amp;#34; about it, matter fact Aussie 3 min mask was waaaayyy better. I have corse , highlighted hair very very dry ... I read all the wonderful reviews and I was expecting wonders... If you have long hair like me  and you decide to purchase this make sure you get 2 bottles because unlikely joico and Aussie this won&#x27;t last you long.&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review helps...</li>
            <li> Love love this conditioner ! My hair feels like silk and looks full and beautiful ! You will be pleased with this product, don&#x27;t wait, buy now it&#x27;s so worth it . 07/10/15 I have been using this Tru Morrocan conditioner for over a year &amp; my hair dresser said my hair is in the greatest condition. Love this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of Moroccan Oil products...but this one is far and away the best!!! It smells AWESOME...and along with the Tru Moroccan Shampoo, it leaves my hair silky, shiny and super manageable!! Love this stuff!!  This duo will be my new go-to to make my hair look its best!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick medium porosity hair and this conditioner ranks the lowest among my other conditioners. Did not hydrate my hair at all. Unfortunately, I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> As a person with very fine hair, this conditioner has done wonders for my hair. Makes my hair smooth, and it smells good too. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! Excellent product, smells great, makes my hair shine, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Washes out feeling clean not oily!</li>
            <li> Worst conditioner I have ever used made my hair even dryer and unmanageable. Sent back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and is nice and thick making it a great conditioner. Love!</li>
            <li> I have not used yet, as I am still using the lemongrass conditioner, but if the results are the same as the Argan Oil Hair Mask,it will work great.</li>
            <li> You must give this product a week or two to work.  I thought it was junk the first week I used it, but then I noticed my hair changing more and more with each use.  The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb to go through my hair.  By week two, it was so silky smooth, I had no problem running a comb through it.  Just be prepared to be frustrated for a week or so.  I actually like it now and plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner comes in a nice size bottle.  It&#x27;s a great conditioner for dry frizzy hair like I have.  Sometimes I have dry scalp too especially in the winter.  I use it 2-3 times a week.  It really does moisturize your hair without weighing it down.  After using it my hair looks silky smooth and a nice shine.  A little goes a long way.  I just leave it on about 2 minutes after shampooing and then rinse.  It smells good too.  I also like they do not test any animals for their products.  I did receive this product complimentary for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> loved this I try t change ever few months--it is good to do really works well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this stuff. Made my hair feel weighed down. Not a huge fan of the scent. I gave it to a friend. She loves it. To each their own.</li>
            <li> This conditioner for some perplexing reason seems exactly like shampoo in both consistency and function.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SULFRATE FREE WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE BETTER FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> True Moroccan Hair Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;has really changed my color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;no frizz and such a silky shine now&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I must say, the fragrance is very close to Victorias Secrets Love Spell which is one of my favorite fragrances so that was an additional positive for me! I have yet to try the product yet, after I&#x27;m done with my workout I&#x27;ll be sure to give a review of the immediate feeling! Sometime later I&#x27;ll be sure to give a review on the long term differences.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I was opening the conditioner was the nice seal that was on it. May not be a big deal to some, but for me that was a big plus. The OCD girl in me appreciates knowing that they care enough to make sure each product was sealed after they produced it, so that I know the product hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was the amazing Moroccan Argan Oil smell, it has a very unique smell unlike any other but I rather enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to put it on my hair and left it on for about a minute or two, just so my hair could fully take in all it&#x27;s nutrients. I love that this Conditioner has Oatmeal in it as well as Shea Butter, you can really tell. It made my hair so soft, but not greasy as a quality conditioner should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the conditioner is the fact that it was so thick. I mean it didn&#x27;t bother me that it was thick, but the packaging it was in made it a little difficult for it to get out of the bottle because of it. Other than that though, I thought it worked really well. I would recommend this product as well, and think it is a great product to pair with the Tru Moroccan Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad. If this review happened to be good than it deserved it).</li>
            <li> If you buy the shampoo you will need 2 bottles of this conditioner to get a comb through your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditions very well and smells like fresh brewed ice tea, along with a faint citrus scent. I love how easy I can manage my hair and how unbelievably soft it feels after I use this! This, paired with the shampoo, also seem to help with my dandruff and scalp build up!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, makes my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Hands down. I have wavy, frizzy hair (in bad need of a trim) and this makes it amazing!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does notttttt work.... smells goods</li>
            <li> Great product when used with the corresponding shampoo</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and it has a nice scent, but my hair looked dull. I&#x27;d rather use one of my other products.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would be the magic serum for my perimenopausal hair which some days is overly frizzy, something new since I have entered my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;.  This product didn&#x27;t work for me, however.  It has a nice viscosity and I think washed cleanly, but it just didn&#x27;t work any miracles on my hair.  The quest continues, my top pick right now are Pantene BB products which seem to keep the frizz under control.  The seller was great for this product, and I believe other reviewers had a great experience, it just wasn&#x27;t the case for me.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair and it tends to get frizzy in the summer heat. This conditioner has tamed some of that wild woman frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and not overpowering as some Moroccan products can be. The conditioner applies easily and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the shampoo, this is a great combination treatment to repair your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells so good as well as makes me hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This conditionermakes my hair lifeless, and dull....also leaves a residue that makes my hair feel dirty again in less than 8 hours, and leaves a sticky finish....  Worst I ever used.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner would be more moisturizing.  I have been using it with the shampoo to get the best results.  If you have oily or normal hair  and do not need extra moisture this would be great for you.  I do like that the conditioner uses natural ingredients and is safe for color treated hair.  The scent is very nice.  This product did not wow me or help &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; my hair.  Overall, just okay.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to tell anyone who&#x27;s reading that this stuff smells absolutely AMAZING! Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell fantastic. It says in the description that it is &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scented, but it does have floral undertones, in my opinion. It honestly smells very similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Lovespell&amp;#34; perfume and that is my favorite fragrance of all time. However, unlike &amp;#34;Lovespell,&amp;#34; this product is made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it works on my hair, well, it makes my hair super soft and shiny. My husband even uses it on his beard and looks SO much healthier. I highly, highly recommend this product! A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the price, because chances are, you&#x27;ll be using one bottle for a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love this product but it makes my scalp itchy. Maybe I just need to get used to it first. Besides that it is amazing. My hair has never felt better, and I can tell it doesn&#x27;t get as oily as quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a hair product before, but this particular shampoo and conditioner deserves some accolade. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year while still regularly dyeing it, and as a result my hair has become brittle and wiry. Nothing like it used to be. With just ONE shower using this shampoo and conditioner my hair feels like it used to. It&#x27;s soft, elastic, and even though we&#x27;re expecting a huge storm today it&#x27;s not at all frizzy or unmanageable. Also, I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say the shampoo is runny. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the recipe a bit because it&#x27;s thick enough for me, and it lathers just fine. Such a great purchase. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This conditioner worked great to give my hair moisture and silkiness! I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel...definitely glad I purchased this product along with the shampoo!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was amazing! I left it on my hair for a couple of minutes and when I went to blow my hair dry it felt very moisturized! The product was delivered promptly...so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and smooth, not greasy or heavy like some conditioners and an added bonus, it smells great! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Like it but it is too expensive for the outcome. The same outcome can be achieved with Matrix or ISO that is 10 times cheaper.</li>
            <li> When using this conditioner with the Tru Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, it works incredibly well to help keep the moisture in my damaged hair and makes it very manageable. I&#x27;ve never had this much shine and fullness to my hair, ever!! It&#x27;s a must have for me from now on!!</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo, I got these Tru Moroccan products for my mom who has been a beautician for more than 25 years, and yes, she really likes them!  Not only did it make her hair shiny, she mentioned it really controlled the static and helped the damaged parts of her hair.  I hope she continues with them, and I&#x27;m glad I got a real good deal on these!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Not overwhelming. Thick consistency and really like the ingredients.  My son has frizzy hair and I have straight hair with extensions.  I have spent a fortune on sulfate free top end &amp;#34;luxery&amp;#34; hair care. This is definitely comparable to any of them.</li>
            <li> Honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in this shampoo than any other shampoo.  I used Suave with Argan Oil and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li> Did not find this overpriced conidtioner leaving my hair silky smooth or anything. I had to use a lot more of it than regular conditioner to get it through all of my hair and the effect it had was the same as anything else for me, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace another argan oil shampoo I had been using and it just doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  It left my hair feeling dry and the conditioner gave it a heavy waxy feel but it wasn&#x27;t soft.  Now I am stuck with a full bottle of each and I wasted close to $30.00.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft.  Its great</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel and look beautiful, I love it love it!&lt;br /&gt;Please design a leave-in too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if conditioner goes bad, but I just got this stuff and used it for the first time (so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve stored it for a while, it&#x27;s a week old) but it smells TERRIBLE. I can&#x27;t comment about it&#x27;s effectiveness as right after I applied it and realized that the horrible smell was coming from head I rinsed it out and applied another conditioner that didn&#x27;t reek.  I&#x27;m not super sensitive to bad smells either- I&#x27;m a regular user of t-gel and dandruff shampoos that also smell badly, but this smelled like bad food or rancid oil, I don&#x27;t know but it was not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it works great on my long hair. Customer service id top-notch.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! It made my thick curly hair soft and manageable. It has a very nice scent. I will be buying more for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been loving this Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner &amp; Shampoo!  My hair has been feeling so soft and silky since I started using it a few weeks ago.  I think this a perfect dupe for the Moroccan Oil but it&#x27;s less expensive and I think it smells way better.  I am not sure what the fragrance is that they use but it&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and...I don&#x27;t know it just smells yummy!&lt;br /&gt;The Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioner is great for any hair type but it works really good for dry, damaged and color treated hair like mine.  The key ingredients are Jojoba Oil and  Argan oil which help heal, repair, strengthen and add shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;There are no artificial colors, no artificial additives, or impurities and it is not tested on animals (and no ingredients are derived from animals, Cruelty Free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> I felt like my hair did not get clean and it looked oily way quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> disappointed in hair results. Can&#x27;t tell that much difference.</li>
            <li> Tru Moroccan conditioner is my new go to product. It makes my hair more easy to be styled. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner, but it does not feel any different on my fine, bleach-damaged blonde hair than any cheap conditioner.  Definitely not worth the cost!  I have had much better success with Melu (but didn&#x27;t want to pay the increased price tag, hence trying another one), and some success with Wella.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not that great.. It&#x27;s makes hair soft.. But a little flat. Can definitely find something comprable for a better price. My dry ends are slightly better.. Again I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a deep conditioner out there that would do the same for half the price</li>
            <li> This conditioner claims to be the &amp;#34;best hair conditioner&amp;#34; and I was very excited to try this product. Sadly, all I got were mediocre results. It left my hair drier and more tangled than the $4 L&#x27;oreal conditioner I was using before. This is definitely going back!!</li>
            <li> I bought this, with the Tru Moroccan shampoo, and honestly love both of them. I understand, from the manufacturer, that it often takes a few weeks to really see a difference, but I saw how nice it left my hair after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I have been purchasing a lot of different shampoos and conditioners, as an experiment. So far, the Tru Moroccan has &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; my hair, the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I also wait until my hair is dry, and then put a small &amp;#34;dollop&amp;#34; of the conditioner in the palm of one hand, rub my hands together, and distribute that through about the last 2 inches of my long hair. My hair looks great, and has body again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE: After using this for almost a year and a half, I STILL love it! I will be 64 in a few days, and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair perfect. I don&#x27;t like it when people say things are miracle products, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. The shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel so much healthier. All the natural oils really give it a pretty suppleness, I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any hair products that are not organic. These are worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Perfect combination with the shampoo.  My hair feels great and hair color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> this has to be rinsed out after application</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the results</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I will ever use!!  This works!!</li>
            <li> product is good but cannot get out of bottle so thick????</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife. After going through a bottle, on her mid-back length hair, she said that it didn&#x27;t leave her hair soft or silky. It didn&#x27;t however, leave her hair feeling refreshed as it didn&#x27;t weigh down her long locks. She doesn&#x27;t have oily hair, and she doesn&#x27;t have dry, frizzy hair. But she did notice that this winter her hair felt a bit coarser than usual and wanted something to hydrate the hair. This didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> I have thick, natural wavy/curly hair and when I let it air dry it gets really frizzy.  This conditioner keeps my hair hydrated and frizz-free.  My hair is soft and smooth after using it.  I use it in conjunction with the Tru Moroccan Shampoo.  After using it, I can pull a brush or comb straight through it with virtually no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this conditioner at no cost to myself for review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to review both the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner by Tru  Moroccan. First of all let me say they smell absolutely amazing. I love the scent and it&#x27;s a must if its a shampoo I am going to use as I always want my hair smelling good! Anyway I have hair past my shoulders and I still didn&#x27;t have to use that much.&lt;br /&gt;This lathered into my head very well and the conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and rejuvenating. This shampoo also restores hair and helps with damage which I could use since I color treat my hair once a month. It also hydrates which is very important fact in keeping healthy looking hair that is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner even helps with dry scalp and dandruff which I every now and than battle. So they both take care of all my needs and wants in a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner. But I was not as impressed by the shampoo. I think the product is over-priced. It&#x27;s not the quality of the price.</li>
            <li> Really is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! During pregnancy my hair has been horribly dry and brittle and this is helping so much!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a a natural shampoo.  It leaves my hair shiny  but as far as a conditioner it does not work like my other conditioners.  Although it might good for my hair it does not make it easier to comb my hair.  I find my hair is extremely hard to comb through after I use it.. When I use my other conditioners my hair is easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this conditioner would have a nicer scent.  It is a good product; just don&#x27;t know that I would re-order.</li>
