            <li>but I still love it.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I was able the fit almost all of my plates in this case.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I contacted amazon and will be returning this defective item and will look for something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>yet :) I bought the Salon Designs brand Nail Art Stamping Starter kit (the 100-plate one) and those plates fit in these.</li>
            <li>and I can easily see them now.</li>
            <li>Easy to look through and choose which nail plate you would like because you can see them in there holders.</li>
            <li>Has lots of pockets and its easy to put in and take out the plates.</li>
            <li>Super slim and fashionable!</li>
            <li>They all fit in the slots without a problem.</li>
            <li>About 8 plates didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Plates fit snuggly in the pages</li>
            <li>I wanted this for the non Pueen plates I have bought as singles, but they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>A great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;The construction is very well made and the plastic where the plates go hasn&#x27;t torn, its very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>Bundle Monster seemed like a nice choice, and I love the fact that it is available in different colors.</li>
            <li>love how well it holds all my plates wont fall off and stylish, I definitely recommend it to everyone:)</li>
            <li>and i love the hot pick color and floral pattern.</li>
            <li>Keeping them all in one place has made it so much easier and more fun!  </li>
            <li>I still have to look through them all, but they are all neat and tidy and easy to see in this cute pink wallet!</li>
            <li>Good quality big capacity</li>
            <li>In addition the whole thing seems sturdy enough, so a win all</li>
            <li>As seen in picture, super fast shipping &amp; fits my round stamping plates perfectly!!</li>
            <li>very satisfied overall</li>
            <li>Plus the case itself is very sturdy and really pretty too. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting another when I get more plates!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>plates fit very snuggly into this Pueen case without the use of foam</li>
            <li>It has a really cute lace pattern over the pink that looks cute.</li>
            <li>i did not get it until 2 years later but its nice</li>
            <li>This item looks great on the outside but as soon as you open it, the plastic pages fall right out.  </li>
            <li>I just received this the other day and love it!</li>
            <li>Plenty of room to fit my nail stamps so far I have custom etsy nail plates, bundle monster, and konad.</li>
            <li>Pretty much exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>i love that the pages are double sided, makes it easier to remove&lt;br /&gt;plates.</li>
            <li>wait to order more in different colors</li>
            <li>Purchased their nail plates when they first popped up on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Zipper works great, it isn&#x27;t too thick, and I like the grip</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the outside look of this organizer.</li>
            <li>So far i have about 100 plates filled in it, and it is holding up well--not close to bursting at the seams...</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; (LOL) just suck it up and try the holder, its an investment thats worth it , yes its pricier than the other storage alternatives , but it will save you money in the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant</li>
            <li>they fit very snug around the plates I wish they were a little bit more give</li>
            <li>I really the softness of the case and its so pretty.</li>
            <li>And if you love hot pink then the organizer case is for you.</li>
            <li>It had enough room to hold my new set of Pueen plates as well as the rest of my collection (with room for a bit more).</li>
            <li>Holds the plates very well without tearing</li>
            <li>she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It really holds a lot of plates.</li>
            <li>This is a must for those that love to use the nail stampers and have a wide collection of them.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take too much space, about the size of a book.easy to take with you if you need to.  </li>
            <li>it holds most of my plates except cheeky 2012 summer plates from pink package that are xl</li>
            <li>And has held up very well</li>
            <li>VERY DIS-APPOINTING.</li>
            <li>It is very well made</li>
            <li>Very each to see which plates I want to use.  </li>
            <li>This holder is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The smaller Pueen cases fit both sizes</li>
            <li>Cute in pink too!</li>
            <li>plates fit nice and snug so theres no chance of them slipping out even if you hold it upside down.</li>
            <li>In hot pink it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry and fit in almost any purse, at least that&#x60;s what my girlfriend told me.</li>
            <li>This case is nearly identical to the black Bundle Monster case, so I think it must have been made by the same manufacturer, which means it&#x27;s of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>nice and small</li>
            <li>although the pink is pretty it wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice ;]</li>
            <li>The outside of the organizer is very pretty and the idea behind this was good.  </li>
            <li>and she started screaming and dancing right there in her tiny salon.</li>
            <li>My new nail stamping Bible.</li>
            <li>The plastic pages are pretty sturdy too; the BM case I have has the same thickness</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pockets are on BOTH sides of each page!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even fill this completely and the fasteners broke!</li>
            <li>wish they has this color first since I ended up with a plain black one that im gonna have to either donate or fill with more plates!</li>
            <li>There are fourteen double sided pages with pockets on both sides of each page (the BM case only had a pocket on one side of each page but each pocket fits two plates back to back) which is nice, so it will hold up to 168 plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very decent quality you can even double up on each pocket without worry</li>
            <li>and you can see the plates clearly when they are inside the pockets.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and this has withstood the abuse of being flipped through all the time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and disappointednthat these slots only fit the very smallest round plates, not the hexagon or octagon plates.  </li>
            <li>cover is hot pink with a lacy sort of pressed pattern, and closes with a sturdy fabric zipper up around the side.</li>
            <li>Its a hot pink with roses and lace patter.</li>
            <li>It does get heavy as it&#x27;s almost full, but it&#x27;s still slim and not bulky at all.</li>
            <li>The pink is a lovely color, a little brighter in person.</li>
            <li>They only fit circle plates, small circle plates from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>I have 3 sets of Pueen plates as well as some other brands and this case holds them all very well.</li>
            <li>plates have sharp edges, pockets are tight fit...</li>
            <li>The binder was very heavy and the first one broke!</li>
            <li>Is very well made the plastic inserts are not thin very thick, has pockets on each side that you don&#x27;t have to put 2 stamping plates in one.</li>

            <li> and i love the hot pick color and floral pattern.</li>
            <li> Keeping them all in one place has made it so much easier and more fun!  </li>
            <li> I still have to look through them all, but they are all neat and tidy and easy to see in this cute pink wallet!</li>
            <li> Good quality big capacity</li>
            <li> In addition the whole thing seems sturdy enough, so a win all</li>
            <li> As seen in picture, super fast shipping &amp; fits my round stamping plates perfectly!!</li>
            <li> very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> Plus the case itself is very sturdy and really pretty too. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting another when I get more plates!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> plates fit very snuggly into this Pueen case without the use of foam</li>
            <li> It has a really cute lace pattern over the pink that looks cute.</li>
            <li> i did not get it until 2 years later but its nice</li>
            <li> This item looks great on the outside but as soon as you open it, the plastic pages fall right out.  </li>
            <li> I just received this the other day and love it!</li>
            <li> Plenty of room to fit my nail stamps so far I have custom etsy nail plates, bundle monster, and konad.</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> i love that the pages are double sided, makes it easier to remove&lt;br /&gt;plates.</li>
            <li> wait to order more in different colors</li>
            <li> Purchased their nail plates when they first popped up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Zipper works great, it isn&#x27;t too thick, and I like the grip</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the outside look of this organizer.</li>
            <li> So far i have about 100 plates filled in it, and it is holding up well--not close to bursting at the seams...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; (LOL) just suck it up and try the holder, its an investment thats worth it , yes its pricier than the other storage alternatives , but it will save you money in the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant</li>
            <li> they fit very snug around the plates I wish they were a little bit more give</li>
            <li> I really the softness of the case and its so pretty.</li>
            <li> And if you love hot pink then the organizer case is for you.</li>
            <li> It had enough room to hold my new set of Pueen plates as well as the rest of my collection (with room for a bit more).</li>
            <li> Holds the plates very well without tearing</li>
            <li> she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It really holds a lot of plates.</li>
            <li> This is a must for those that love to use the nail stampers and have a wide collection of them.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take too much space, about the size of a book.easy to take with you if you need to.  </li>
            <li> it holds most of my plates except cheeky 2012 summer plates from pink package that are xl</li>
            <li> And has held up very well</li>
            <li> VERY DIS-APPOINTING.</li>
            <li> It is very well made</li>
            <li> Very each to see which plates I want to use.  </li>
            <li> This holder is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The smaller Pueen cases fit both sizes</li>
            <li> Cute in pink too!</li>
            <li> plates fit nice and snug so theres no chance of them slipping out even if you hold it upside down.</li>
            <li> In hot pink it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry and fit in almost any purse, at least that&#x60;s what my girlfriend told me.</li>
            <li> This case is nearly identical to the black Bundle Monster case, so I think it must have been made by the same manufacturer, which means it&#x27;s of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> nice and small</li>
            <li> although the pink is pretty it wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice ;]</li>
            <li> The outside of the organizer is very pretty and the idea behind this was good.  </li>
            <li> and she started screaming and dancing right there in her tiny salon.</li>
            <li> My new nail stamping Bible.</li>
            <li> The plastic pages are pretty sturdy too; the BM case I have has the same thickness</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pockets are on BOTH sides of each page!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even fill this completely and the fasteners broke!</li>
            <li> wish they has this color first since I ended up with a plain black one that im gonna have to either donate or fill with more plates!</li>
            <li> There are fourteen double sided pages with pockets on both sides of each page (the BM case only had a pocket on one side of each page but each pocket fits two plates back to back) which is nice, so it will hold up to 168 plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very decent quality you can even double up on each pocket without worry</li>
            <li> and you can see the plates clearly when they are inside the pockets.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and this has withstood the abuse of being flipped through all the time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and disappointednthat these slots only fit the very smallest round plates, not the hexagon or octagon plates.  </li>
            <li> cover is hot pink with a lacy sort of pressed pattern, and closes with a sturdy fabric zipper up around the side.</li>
            <li> Its a hot pink with roses and lace patter.</li>
            <li> It does get heavy as it&#x27;s almost full, but it&#x27;s still slim and not bulky at all.</li>
            <li> The pink is a lovely color, a little brighter in person.</li>
            <li> They only fit circle plates, small circle plates from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> I have 3 sets of Pueen plates as well as some other brands and this case holds them all very well.</li>
            <li> plates have sharp edges, pockets are tight fit...</li>
            <li> The binder was very heavy and the first one broke!</li>
            <li> Is very well made the plastic inserts are not thin very thick, has pockets on each side that you don&#x27;t have to put 2 stamping plates in one.</li>
            <li> it feels sturdy and well made, definitely something that will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material used in making the product should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The Pueen plate holder gets rid of that tedious by making it easy to pick the plate you want.</li>
            <li> Slightly slimmer than the BM case, though that could be because it&#x27;s still new and stiff and my BM case is about 6 months old now.</li>
            <li> so my octagon shaped ones could fit, unfortunately they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I only have 6 empty</li>
            <li> I got this case because it is a different color than my other nail art plate holders.</li>
            <li> Holds Pueen and other similar sized plates.</li>
            <li> The top of one of the fasteners completely popped off and the bottom one is detached from the base.</li>
            <li> the plates would constantly fall out and it was so bulky it took up half of my work space.</li>
            <li> I actually like the color of the case and that there is a little texture to the cover.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monser set minus about 8 plates</li>
            <li> They will not fit because they are too big.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavier than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> Storing 2 plates back to back is pretty common, but fumbling to get to the plat you want gets tedious.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> No more scratching the discs loose in a box.</li>
            <li> Faster to find what I want than my previous organizational method.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer that the metal fasteners are too flimsy.</li>
            <li> My half sheets are now dangling by one fastener.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a little steep</li>
            <li> Not too tight and not to heavy.</li>
            <li> However, a number of the little plate holding sleeves were already broken  upon initial inspection.</li>
            <li> I put them in a heavy duty binder and it was heavy and clunky to carry around</li>
            <li> i finally got tired of picking up and organizing over 200 stamping plates every time i held it</li>
            <li> CHEEKY plates do not fit in this case ...</li>
            <li> Gets really heavy with all the plates in it.</li>
            <li> I moved all the very small round plates from another Pueen case, to this one.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m excited to have this, I am disappointed that 2 minutes into my ownership, some of my plates are already slipping out. :(</li>
            <li> I tried the &#x27;baseball card holder in a binder with Velcro tab&#x27; route before--what a pain in the behind.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the rivets holding the pages in is extremely thin metal.  </li>
            <li> Thought that it was coming with some of the nail art stamps, but it didn&#x27;t, not happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what poor quality this was for the price.</li>
            <li> the wrong way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> prevent cutting finger tips</li>
            <li> but it does make it difficult to get them out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This case is nearly identical to the black Bundle Monster case, so I think it must have been made by the same manufacturer, which means it&#x27;s of pretty good quality. There are fourteen double sided pages with pockets on both sides of each page (the BM case only had a pocket on one side of each page but each pocket fits two plates back to back) which is nice, so it will hold up to 168 plates.&lt;br /&gt;The cover is hot pink with a lacy sort of pressed pattern, and closes with a sturdy fabric zipper up around the side. Slightly slimmer than the BM case, though that could be because it&#x27;s still new and stiff and my BM case is about 6 months old now. The plastic pages are pretty sturdy too; the BM case I have has the same thickness and I haven&#x27;t had a tear yet.  I tried the &#x27;baseball card holder in a binder with Velcro tab&#x27; route before--what a pain in the behind. This is way simpler, classier, easier to search through to find the plate you&#x27;re looking for, and best yet, nothing falls out. My only beef is that the pockets seem to be slightly smaller, so if your plates don&#x27;t have a paper backing, they&#x27;re tricky to pull out, but that could change as the pockets stretch a bit with use.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it has so many slots for my circular plates Konad or non-Konad. It can&#x27;t hold my octagon shaped plates though but I still love it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect storage if you ever plan on purchasing more nail plates, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Delivered and the rings are torn away from the cover.</li>
            <li> I love that this booklet can hold so many sets of plates. It is a lot easier to transport and show others when doing nails. Faster to find what I want than my previous organizational method. Will buy again when I have more plates.</li>
            <li> This organizer is very good quality and fits the standard size plates perfectly. I chose this one over the bundle monster case because I liked that this one was double sided with pockets on each side of the page. :D</li>
            <li> Thinking on buying another one since I collect poker chips. Fits perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Perfect ize for the stamping plates, however, use a tweezer to remove plate from pocket...plates have sharp edges, pockets are tight fit...prevent cutting finger tips</li>
            <li> I just received this the other day and love it! The design is beautiful and a good quality. Its a hot pink with roses and lace patter. Plenty of room to fit my nail stamps so far I have custom etsy nail plates, bundle monster, and konad. They all fit in the slots without a problem. I would definitely recommend this product! Also great price!</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a Konad one sided case. The ability to hold double sided slots makes it a winner. I only have 6 empty slots- so it may be time for a second!!</li>
            <li> works perfect for all my stamp plates for my nails.. Great pruchase</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter get plenty of use out of these. They love them</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly what I needed. It had enough room to hold my new set of Pueen plates as well as the rest of my collection (with room for a bit more). I&#x27;m definitely getting another when I get more plates!</li>
            <li> When I was deciding what case I should get in order to hold my nail stamping plates, I was choosing between Pueen and Bundle Monster. Bundle Monster seemed like a nice choice, and I love the fact that it is available in different colors. But I chose Pueen over Bundle Monster because the Pueen case has a slot for each plate, without having to double up plates back to back. I actually like the color of the case and that there is a little texture to the cover. In addition the whole thing seems sturdy enough, so a win all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I love this case and will be buying another when needed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was able the fit almost all of my plates in this case. About 8 plates didn&#x27;t fit.  I have several sets of plates that I had in baseball card holders and inserted into a binder.  The binder was very heavy and the first one broke! Actually sheared off the metal.  I put them in a heavy duty binder and it was heavy and clunky to carry around and they often fell out even though I inserted a foam backing into the slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plates fit very snuggly into this Pueen case without the use of foam and I got all of these sets installed in the case:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Red Angel set&lt;br /&gt;1 Cheeky set&lt;br /&gt;2 Mash sets&lt;br /&gt;1 Winstonia Set&lt;br /&gt;1 Bundle Monser set minus about 8 plates&lt;br /&gt;5 Konad plates&lt;br /&gt;5 Salon Perfect plates&lt;br /&gt;1 Fairy Princess set</li>
            <li> love how well it holds all my plates wont fall off and stylish, I definitely recommend it to everyone:) great  buy</li>
            <li> It has a really cute lace pattern over the pink that looks cute. Holds the plates very well without tearing and you can see the plates clearly when they are inside the pockets. Fits 2 plates back to back without a problem. Not too tight and not to heavy. If you have any plates that are not circle, like I have 2 that are in the shape of an octogon(8 sides, not circle) They will not fit because they are too big.</li>
            <li> awesome, perfect case for nail stamping set. It is easy to carry and fit in almost any purse, at least that&#x60;s what my girlfriend told me. she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It hold all my stamp plates and I have plenty of room for more! I really the softness of the case and its so pretty. It really holds a lot of plates. A great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;The construction is very well made and the plastic where the plates go hasn&#x27;t torn, its very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I can keep all my stamp plates in here and not get scratched. Need to make one for the rectangle plates.</li>
            <li> This is a must for those that love to use the nail stampers and have a wide collection of them.  Keeping them all in one place has made it so much easier and more fun!  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> This item looks great on the outside but as soon as you open it, the plastic pages fall right out.  As it turns out, the rivets holding the pages in is extremely thin metal.  Two of the three were not even connected when the item arrived and the third broke shortly after turning the pages.  Very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Very cute case I will be getting another...&lt;br /&gt;U can put the total 168 plates in but it does make it difficult to get them out!</li>
            <li> I got this case because it is a different color than my other nail art plate holders. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pockets are on BOTH sides of each page! Storing 2 plates back to back is pretty common, but fumbling to get to the plat you want gets tedious. The Pueen plate holder gets rid of that tedious by making it easy to pick the plate you want.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this case, I&lt;br /&gt;I did not plan on buying a case holder for all of my plates, but when I came across this case on Amazon I had to order. I do jot regret ordering this case and it hold my plates perfectly well. It does what it is meant to do in a nice fashionable way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before i purcased the pueen holder i was using a 3 ring binder and trading card pages, it was such a hassle! the plates would constantly fall out and it was so bulky it took up half of my work space. i finally got tired of picking up and organizing over 200 stamping plates every time i held it the wrong way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i bit the bullet and order the pueen holder, and im so happy i did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t take too much space, about the size of a book.easy to take with you if you need to.  plates fit nice and snug so theres no chance of them slipping out even if you hold it upside down. i love that the pages are double sided, makes it easier to remove&lt;br /&gt;plates. it feels sturdy and well made, definitely something that will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you feel like i did &amp;#34; but i can buy another set of stamping plates with that money! &amp;#34; (LOL) just suck it up and try the holder, its an investment thats worth it , yes its pricier than the other storage alternatives , but it will save you money in the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant wait to order more in different colors</li>
            <li> I have everything Pueen has made now! Purchased their nail plates when they first popped up on Amazon. This case is amazing! In hot pink it is fabulous. My new nail stamping Bible. I have to buy more because I have so many plates!</li>
            <li> CHEEKY plates do not fit in this case ...</li>
            <li> great item. Gets really heavy with all the plates in it. will buy again, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product if you are a nail stamper in enthusiast like me... It holds all my plates</li>
            <li> wish they has this color first since I ended up with a plain black one that im gonna have to either donate or fill with more plates! very decent quality you can even double up on each pocket without worry</li>
            <li> Love it...fits all of my plates perfectly (except the square and oversized) the color is super cute and now all of my plates are incredibly organized. Couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> it holds all my plates and I can easily see them now. Its an assume organizer and I can keep them organized.</li>
            <li> Great storage for all my nail plates. Easy to look through and choose which nail plate you would like because you can see them in there holders.</li>
            <li> I have 3 sets of Pueen plates as well as some other brands and this case holds them all very well. It does get heavy as it&#x27;s almost full, but it&#x27;s still slim and not bulky at all. I also bought one for a friend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It is nice and pretty fits everything perfect ...cover is great quality and zipper it holds most of my plates except cheeky 2012 summer plates from pink package that are xl</li>
            <li> It fits all my stamp plates and I also store my decals and stickers in it. Perfect. And has held up very well, I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and this has withstood the abuse of being flipped through all the time. And if this one falls apart eventually, I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> Plates fit snuggly in the pages</li>
            <li> holds plates on front and back of pages</li>
            <li> i did not get it until 2 years later but its nice</li>
            <li> This case is a must have! Is very well made the plastic inserts are not thin very thick, has pockets on each side that you don&#x27;t have to put 2 stamping plates in one. And if you love hot pink then the organizer case is for you.</li>
            <li> This is really nice, though when it&#x27;s loaded up with steel it&#x27;s heavier than I would have expected.  It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.  I put in PUEEN, Bundle Monster and Salon Designs (getting the impression that they&#x27;re KONAD reject plates), and I still have 27 open slots.  All of them fit perfectly.  Zipper works great, it isn&#x27;t too thick, and I like the grip the lace stamped cover gives with the weight.</li>
            <li> THIS CAME WITH THE ZIPPER BROKE....... I HAVE ASKED FOR REPLACEMENT AND NOOOOO RESPONSE....VERY DIS-APPOINTING.</li>
            <li> fast shipping - great quality</li>
            <li> All that u need to organize your plates.</li>
            <li> Beautiful case! Only deducted a star because of a manufacturing defect in the middle sleeve.  There are no pockets on one side of the sheet (not really a big deal, just thought others might want to know).  Other than that, this case is great and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of this product.  This leather case works well with holding in place my nail plates and has cute embossed designs of crowns on its cover.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this product. Nice, slim design. Good quality outer shell that has a nice feel to it. However, a number of the little plate holding sleeves were already broken  upon initial inspection. While I&#x27;m excited to have this, I am disappointed that 2 minutes into my ownership, some of my plates are already slipping out. :(</li>
            <li> Excellent way to stay organized and keep all of those plates in one place!!!!</li>
            <li> It would be great to have the option of the car and filed with plates for a great deal</li>
            <li> This is a very nice case to keep your nail stamps in. It zips shut and is very nice and compact. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile and it seems to be working out well. It is very well made and I would recommend this to others for storing their nail stamps.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Very each to see which plates I want to use.  Holds Pueen and other similar sized plates.</li>
            <li> Good quality big capacity</li>
            <li> nice case for nail plates</li>
            <li> Love this organizational tool! No more scratching the discs loose in a box. Want to buy more plates to fill it up now.</li>
            <li> Thought that it was coming with some of the nail art stamps, but it didn&#x27;t, not happy with the price. Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it when I found ou that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the outside look of this organizer. I thought the price was a little steep but I wanted to keep my nail stamping plates safe as they are somewhat expensive. I didn&#x27;t even fill this completely and the fasteners broke! This occurred within hours of receiving my item. I can&#x27;t believe what poor quality this was for the price. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I feel that for the price they are charging, the plastic sheets should stay bound to the outer casing. I agree with a previous reviewer that the metal fasteners are too flimsy. The top of one of the fasteners completely popped off and the bottom one is detached from the base. My half sheets are now dangling by one fastener. The outside of the organizer is very pretty and the idea behind this was good.  However, the overall quality of the product falls short. I don&#x27;t understand why they wouldn&#x27;t make it stronger considering almost all stamping platters are made from metal. Fortunately, I contacted amazon and will be returning this defective item and will look for something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I started to collect stamping plates and this holder is incredible. Has lots of pockets and its easy to put in and take out the plates. A must have product</li>
            <li> Love this. Like that it holds discs on both sides of a sleeve. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I rate this 5 stars because it holds all my plates, (and I have a lot) and I still have extra space so I put my nail tapes in it which it also holds perfectly. I only wish I could pick a different color, although the pink is pretty it wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice ;]</li>
            <li> This holder is very convenient. It holds most of my nail plates and the compartments are nice and secure so that the plates never come out until you want them too. Plus the case itself is very sturdy and really pretty too. :)</li>
            <li> This case is perfect for carrying the nail art discs in.  The material used in making the product should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The pink is a lovely color, a little brighter in person. Plus, the design/texture looks even better in person. So far i have about 100 plates filled in it, and it is holding up well--not close to bursting at the seams...yet :) I bought the Salon Designs brand Nail Art Stamping Starter kit (the 100-plate one) and those plates fit in these.</li>
            <li> I love these Pueen products. I was surprised and disappointednthat these slots only fit the very smallest round plates, not the hexagon or octagon plates.  I wanted this for the non Pueen plates I have bought as singles, but they don&#x27;t fit.  I moved all the very small round plates from another Pueen case, to this one.  The smaller Pueen cases fit both sizes, I thought this one would a well, but, nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s superb Pueen quality</li>
            <li> Love this product!! As seen in picture, super fast shipping &amp; fits my round stamping plates perfectly!! If I fill this one up, I will repurchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> Works great for all my plates.  Cute in pink too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my nail tech and she started screaming and dancing right there in her tiny salon. I suppose it was a hit! I love when she uses the stamps on my nails, but sometimes I found it daunting to sort through the plates. I still have to look through them all, but they are all neat and tidy and easy to see in this cute pink wallet!</li>
            <li> I got this nail plate organizer as a gift and i love the hot pick color and floral pattern. the design is nice and the quality is very good. very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> The ad for this product was misleading as I thought the stamps were included with the case as it states 168 stamps in the ad for the product</li>
            <li> i love to be ornized and this is perfect</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> It does the job keeping organize the stamping plates</li>
            <li> they fit very snug around the plates I wish they were a little bit more give so my octagon shaped ones could fit, unfortunately they didn&#x27;t.  They only fit circle plates, small circle plates from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> Super slim and fashionable!</li>
            <li> love them all, great imprints</li>
            <li> The holder is much bigger than I anticipated.  Seems to be of good quality and the design is very nice.</li>
