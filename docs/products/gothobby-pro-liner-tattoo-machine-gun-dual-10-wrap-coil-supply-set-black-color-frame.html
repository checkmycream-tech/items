            <li>Perfect item no flaws and very fast shipping</li>

            <li>Needed some adjustments , but works ok.</li>
            <li>To call this machine appropriate for tattooing is quite a stretch.</li>

            <li>but hopefully it works out fine.</li>
            <li>for the price its worth it, its done well so far, great machine for the price</li>
            <li>After I got it and used it, it turns out that it is a great liner machine and a very low price.</li>
            <li>You need to rescale your molds and have them adjusted to where all tubes fit</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let this be your first option of a tattoo machine.</li>
            <li>and I had to bump my hertz and voltage up substantially to the point where if I didn&#x27;t have a fast hand speed i&#x27;d more than likely scar the Hell out of somebody.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li>can you send me a new one I would appreciate it very much</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered this machine cause of the coils, I really like the design of the coils on this machine.</li>

            <li>Decent gun for the price.</li>
            <li>Tried using my 7rl tubes didnt fit or any other tubes at that....</li>
            <li>frame.i recommend getting new coils if u like the frame</li>
            <li>Great hard hitting dependable little gun.  </li>
            <li>If I had a complaint, it would be about the design of the tattoo grip vice, it frequently strips out, but a new screw/bolt can be easily added to fix it.  </li>

            <li> Was not happy with this machine.  My husband used it for 15 minutes and it broke.  The company required that I send it back to get a refund.  I didn&#x27;t want to bother to waist my time.</li>
            <li> Very good machine for the price did the the art work with know problem.</li>
            <li> great purchase, loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> nice weight and nice design. havent put it to work yet but hopefully it works out fine. to get a very good machine you have to spend around $200 but i only got this cuz of the design</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this machine cause of the coils, I really like the design of the coils on this machine. After I got it and used it, it turns out that it is a great liner machine and a very low price.</li>
            <li> no it broke when I open the package was broken can you send me a new one I would appreciate it very much</li>
            <li> for the price its worth it, its done well so far, great machine for the price</li>
            <li> Perfect item no flaws and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Decent gun for the price. Needed some adjustments , but works ok. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The coils are weak.nice frame.i recommend getting new coils if u like the frame</li>
            <li> It sucks i tuned up the thing like in 10 diferent ways and still sucks</li>
            <li> I buy these guns for kits, and my artists in the shop will buy them from me for backup.  They work great, and get the job  done.  If I had a complaint, it would be about the design of the tattoo grip vice, it frequently strips out, but a new screw/bolt can be easily added to fix it.  Great hard hitting dependable little gun.  I am a shop owner.</li>
            <li> came in fast and brand new thank u my sister loved it as a birthday gift. time to get a kit</li>
            <li> IS working perfect and Was a good deal...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to who is in the business or tattoos... Good luck</li>
            <li> To call this machine appropriate for tattooing is quite a stretch. This thing kept dying out and I had to bump my hertz and voltage up substantially to the point where if I didn&#x27;t have a fast hand speed i&#x27;d more than likely scar the Hell out of somebody. Don&#x27;t let this be your first option of a tattoo machine. I only used this machine on myself once and it&#x27;s pretty much useless at this point.&lt;br /&gt;Upside, it runs. That&#x27;s all I can really say. Trust me, you&#x27;re going to want to spend the extra money when it comes to machines.</li>
            <li> Reliable machine, tuned out of the box.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain! Works great but I rebuilt it any way! Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Tried using my 7rl tubes didnt fit or any other tubes at that.... You need to rescale your molds and have them adjusted to where all tubes fit</li>
            <li> I did not expect a lot of this machine considering the price was GREAT! i can say that it runs and works for what it is..... I should have purchased 5 more...</li>
