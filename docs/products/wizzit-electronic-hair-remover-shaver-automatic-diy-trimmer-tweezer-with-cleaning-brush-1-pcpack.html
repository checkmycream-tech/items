            <li>My sister is very happy.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT  !!!  </li>
            <li>and I still LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>

            <li>Would recommend it for those that cannot afford more!</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be to everyone&#x27;s liking</li>
            <li>You would do better getting a tweezer and plucking the hairs your self.</li>
            <li>After a lot of fussing (way more hassle than any customer should have to go through)</li>
            <li>Works great and is the second wone I purchased - gavee the first to someone else who loved it.</li>
            <li>It does not grab the hairs easily.  </li>
            <li>Will be just fine with them.</li>
            <li>Bought for my sister, works fine.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made (don&#x27;t remember what I paid for it)</li>
            <li>I received my Wizzit and immediately read the instructions in it&#x27;s entirety before proceeding, inserted AA batteries as instructed and tried to remove a couple  of hairs off of the top of my arm as a test before moving on to my under arms, which is the reason why I purchased the Wizzit in the first place, so as not to have to use a razor any longer.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I llove mine fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprise how the hair does not grow back as fast as a razor.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt worth the amount i paid ,</li>
            <li>I own an epilater for my legs and it works great and hardly any hairs come back ,</li>
            <li>I bough one of these many years back</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This thing really freakin hurts!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M UNSURE OF HOW ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A POSITIVE RATING...</li>
            <li>This was a total waste of good money!  </li>
            <li>The hair I need removed is fine and not very long.  </li>
            <li>I finally got the batteries to fit, and</li>
            <li>BUT THE VERY FINEST HAIR THAT REALLY ISN&#x27;T VISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is small, neat and travels nicely..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li>bought this to remove those tiny, fine barely-there facial hairs to give a smoother surface for makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this little shaver, bought one for my sister, too!</li>
            <li>did not remove any hair, very loud.</li>
            <li>I bought one before for my mother few month ago and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li>and it does pinch a bit, but then so does tweezing and this is way easier than trying to catch one wild hair with a mirror and tweezers.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really use it also srapped my skin and left scars</li>
            <li>The one star is over rated as far as I&#x27;m concerned .</li>
            <li>you can removed unwanted facial hair fast, and it finds the little hairs quick, and since the hair is plucked from the root it does not grow back fast</li>
            <li>Tried a new set of batteries, same thing.</li>
            <li>and they are so light I hardly notice.</li>
            <li>I am at the age where there are wild facial hairs on my face here</li>
            <li>Based on other customer reviews it doesn&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m missing anything.</li>

            <li> Well, this was useless right out of the package.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this little jewel, my MIL gave me one.  </li>
            <li> and there and this little thing gets the job done</li>
            <li> it would not grab the hairs and when it did, they came back worse.</li>
            <li> This do not Wark the way they say waste of money</li>
            <li> So this is just another waste of money for me.  .</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AS IT IS A WASTE OF THEIR MONEY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful not as general as the commercial makes it seem..</li>

            <li> it works, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> The little springs in the battery compartment were not the usual type - these were completely inflexible, like galvanized steel, so that it was impossible to get the batteries in.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT  !!!  It does what it is supposed to do withputmcausing any pain . I highly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I found it almost useless! it would not grab the hairs and when it did, they came back worse. I own an epilater for my legs and it works great and hardly any hairs come back ,if so, it is just a touch- up and they are so light I hardly notice. I was hopeing for better results for my face!</li>
            <li> If you are ues ti using tweezer this wont hurt at all. Hurts on lip but not use to it. I llove mine fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Use this on face. Works great and is the second wone I purchased - gavee the first to someone else who loved it.</li>
            <li> I bough one of these many years back and I love it I recently bought another one on here and I still LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> when i used it it hurts n it gave me bumps and it wasnt worth the amount i paid ,</li>
            <li> Love this little shaver, bought one for my sister, too! Would recommend it for those that cannot afford more! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this little jewel, my MIL gave me one.  It is small, neat and travels nicely..PLUS it works, at least for me.  I am at the age where there are wild facial hairs on my face here and there and this little thing gets the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I felt I had to add a good review.  I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be to everyone&#x27;s liking and it does pinch a bit, but then so does tweezing and this is way easier than trying to catch one wild hair with a mirror and tweezers.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of good money!  This product is bogus.  I received my Wizzit and immediately read the instructions in it&#x27;s entirety before proceeding, inserted AA batteries as instructed and tried to remove a couple  of hairs off of the top of my arm as a test before moving on to my under arms, which is the reason why I purchased the Wizzit in the first place, so as not to have to use a razor any longer.  Not a sprig of hair was removed.  The Wizzit makes a lot of impressive buzzing noise, but does not catch, cut nor remove any hair.  I would not recommend this product to anyone, and would definitely appreciate a refund!!!!</li>
            <li> takes too long and the batteries get weak fast</li>
            <li> It works great, and I love the zipper bound extras....thank you very much!</li>
            <li> dont buy this . It does not work at all. You would do better getting a tweezer and plucking the hairs your self.</li>
            <li> The batteries fail often.  It does not grab the hairs easily.  It is cheaply made (don&#x27;t remember what I paid for it) but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> did not remove any hair, very loud. Very Very disappointed. Tried it several different places face, arm, legs, same results...which was no results. Save your money.</li>
            <li> very painful I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This do not Wark the way they say waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful not as general as the commercial makes it seem.. Can&#x27;t really use it also srapped my skin and left scars</li>
            <li> Chose this rating only so could write this. I ordered this item Dec 2013,aS to be celeb. In jan that time h as come and gone. I am trying to get my money back at this time. The one star is over rated as far as I&#x27;m concerned . But maybe your orders. Will be just fine with them.</li>
            <li> Shipped in time. Bought for my sister, works fine. My sister is very happy. I bought one before for my mother few month ago and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but FYI....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to remove those tiny, fine barely-there facial hairs to give a smoother surface for makeup. Well, this was useless right out of the package. The little springs in the battery compartment were not the usual type - these were completely inflexible, like galvanized steel, so that it was impossible to get the batteries in. After a lot of fussing (way more hassle than any customer should have to go through) I finally got the batteries to fit, and.... nothing. The thing didn&#x27;t turn on. Tried a new set of batteries, same thing. Based on other customer reviews it doesn&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m missing anything. My advice is to go with wax.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprise how the hair does not grow back as fast as a razor.</li>
            <li> I found Wizzit almost useless. The hair I need removed is fine and not very long.  So this is just another waste of money for me.  .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this thing at all. It is hard to use, and doesn&#x27;t do the job. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing really freakin hurts! I got it for my face.... it rips the hairs out but takes forever as there are not enough tweezer things on it and you have to go over and over the area you are working on. It made my face all red and itchy and some of the hairs bled when they were ripped out. I would rather shave than use this thing ever again. Or use Nair or something instead.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED 2 WIZZIT HAIR REMOVAL SHAVERS AND THEY ARE WORTHLESS.  THEY DON&#x27;T TAKE AWAY ANYTHING BUT THE VERY FINEST HAIR THAT REALLY ISN&#x27;T VISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AS IT IS A WASTE OF THEIR MONEY.  I&#x27;M UNSURE OF HOW ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A POSITIVE RATING...??&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW IT COULD WORK ON ONE PERSON AND NOT WORK AT ALL ON OTHERS.</li>
            <li> Painful to use and does not cover a wide enough area of skin</li>
            <li> you can removed unwanted facial hair fast, and it finds the little hairs quick, and since the hair is plucked from the root it does not grow back fast</li>
            <li> I am satisfy with the product.</li>
