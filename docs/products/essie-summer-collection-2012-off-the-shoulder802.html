            <li>Essie is a great quality product, only polish I will use and have used for years.</li>
            <li>Essie goes on beautifully and lasts really long.</li>
            <li>A perfect for Summer hot pink.</li>
            <li>After seeing this color elsewhere I was so excited to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Photo is true to the color.</li>
            <li>It appears a shade darker once you put it on compared to the bottle; but the picture with the product is true to the color.</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deep hot pink, and the polish covers nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Essie and have most of their pinks and reds but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>This shade of pink is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what I was looking for a good bright color that&#x27;s not too crazy.</li>
            <li>It has all the qualities of much pricier nail enamels such as easy application, dependable 2 coat coverage ,stays true to color,  and long shelf life, PLUS cute colors!</li>
            <li>It would definetely look pretty on everyone.</li>
            <li>Even better, my order came in only 3 days!</li>
            <li>This will make my chipped manicures much easier to fix!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very polished and can literally go with anything.</li>
            <li>It stays on longer than others and doesn&#x27;t chip as much.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous that the color of the polish would be off, or that the bottle would break during the shipping process</li>
            <li>A fantastic summer pink.</li>
            <li>I wore my polish for nearly two weeks before removing it!</li>
            <li>This color is very pink, but pretty for summer.</li>
            <li>I put 4-5 coats on and still the polish was a hot mess.</li>

            <li> can&#x27;t say whether or not shipping was prompt, there was a month long back up at my post office.</li>
            <li> Completely engulfed in bubble wrap in a small envelope, no chance of breaking it.</li>

            <li> Despite the color being so pretty in the bottle, something must have been wrong with the actual formula.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was clumpy and old I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Received via mail within just a few days of purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Usually go for darker colors, but tried this on a friends suggestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think I just had a bad bottle, which was unfortunate because the color is so pretty otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked that the polish was streaky, extremely thin and washed out when being applied to my nail.</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING bad to say.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will not order from this company again</li>

            <li> Essie is a great product at a great price.  It has all the qualities of much pricier nail enamels such as easy application, dependable 2 coat coverage ,stays true to color,  and long shelf life, PLUS cute colors! I wore this one as my &amp;#34;go with everything&amp;#34; summer color on my beach vacation in Hawaii! Fabulous! Love it!</li>
            <li> A perfect for Summer hot pink. It would definetely look pretty on everyone. It is a MUST buy, and a color that would just want to be wore over and over again.</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I was looking for a good bright color that&#x27;s not too crazy. It&#x27;s very polished and can literally go with anything.</li>

            <li> After seeing this color elsewhere I was so excited to purchase it. Well, I honestly ended up rather disappointed in the product after getting it and trying it out. Despite the color being so pretty in the bottle, something must have been wrong with the actual formula. As a devoted fan of Essie nail color I was a little shocked that the polish was streaky, extremely thin and washed out when being applied to my nail. I put 4-5 coats on and still the polish was a hot mess. I ended up taking it off and I haven&#x27;t used the polish since. I&#x27;d like to think I just had a bad bottle, which was unfortunate because the color is so pretty otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved essie nail polish they are the best and this color looks AMAZING.....i got lots of complements on this color. :)</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and put on two coats-I love this color. It appears a shade darker once you put it on compared to the bottle; but the picture with the product is true to the color. It&#x27;s a great deep hot pink, and the polish covers nicely. I probably didn&#x27;t need two coats but it&#x27;s a habit. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether or not shipping was prompt, there was a month long back up at my post office. :( BUT, the packaging was great. Completely engulfed in bubble wrap in a small envelope, no chance of breaking it. Over all a great purchase, would def recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Essie is one of my favorite brands of nail polish.  It goes on nicely, lasts, and looks great!  I love this color!  It&#x27;s perfect for summer.  I always keep my toenails painted, especially during the summer!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this order! I was really nervous that the color of the polish would be off, or that the bottle would break during the shipping process but it didn&#x27;t! Even better, my order came in only 3 days! i am surely ordering from this seller again:) This polish is amazing and pretty and cheaper than in stores. There is NOTHING bad to say.</li>
            <li> The color in the photo is accurate. It took about three applications to get the finish I wanted. Nice shade for spring and summer fashions.</li>
            <li> This shade of pink is absolutely gorgeous. This is the first polish I own of the Essie brand, and I must say I will be converting lol. I find that with Essie two costs is sufficient, which is great, and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t chip easily. I wore my polish for nearly two weeks before removing it! A must have for summer, ladies!</li>
            <li> Usually go for darker colors, but tried this on a friends suggestion. This color really pops and perfectly matches a shellac color that I was using on my hands. Essie goes on beautifully and lasts really long. I have received a ton of compliments. This is a perfect spring/summer color.</li>

            <li> I love this color.  I call it &amp;#34;Barbie Pink.&amp;#34;  It doesn&#x27;t chip, it&#x27;s vibrant, super girly, summery, and bright.  I love it.</li>
