            <li>:-)</li>
            <li>I love silicon mix for my Afro Caribbean Hair.</li>
            <li>It really does help revitalize your hair, works great for hair extensions too.</li>
            <li>love this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AND THEY LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love this I will buy again</li>
            <li>Leaves a bit of a film, but make sure you thoroughly rinse.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Hydrating and weighs down my frizzy curly hair smells so great!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>The product offers a good hair treatment.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>Yesss.. I had got the original silicon mix 35oz.</li>
            <li>It has definitely lived up to all that each person has said that&#x27;s good about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair is softer, able to take heat better, &amp; the styling seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>but I have not used it long enough, but I can say it makes my hair really soft, has great slip, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>After I flat iron like the other two I still get that bouncy beautiful flow!</li>
            <li>If your hair is dry, frizzy and tangles a lot when you wash it this conditioner works like magic!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that it had so many ingredients that aren&#x27;t healthy for hair (Mineral oil, synthetic colors, heavy fragrance), plus it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really softens your hair and makes blow drying and/or roller setting your hair a breeze!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it like 5 times and my hair definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>You know when you put that special conditioner in your hair that comes with a new box of color and how after using that conditioner, your hair feels silky?</li>
            <li>And the bambu 8oz, I wish I had did the other way around, don&#x27;t get me wrong the original works but not as good as the bambu is gives your hair more of a bounce and it smells so much better</li>
            <li>I love how well it moisturizes my hair without adding weight, as long as I rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li>With few day of use you can notice the difference, the hair become more and more soft</li>
            <li>A huge jar is only about 250 Dominican pesos (around $6.50 USD)if</li>
            <li>I never saw anything work this fast or this well.</li>
            <li>I was very expressed with how much stronger my hair became in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product</li>
            <li>It really helped with my split ends because Im trying to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>very versatile product.</li>
            <li>This produt helped my hair to grow up faster and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I am always trying new products, but that one is always on my bathroom ;)</li>
            <li>The product is the same as the original Silicon Mix but with a Twist.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it at a local beauty supply store for 4.99 same 8oz jar.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that is having hair problems to use.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair soft and silky and ready for blow drying or setting or air drying naturally.  </li>
            <li>Does its job, but again, make sure you rinse it completely out of your hair or it will remain stiff.</li>
            <li>and it makes your hair extremely soft</li>
            <li>I really see a big improvement when I use this on my hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair is all natural.</li>
            <li>It is a professional product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is the same as the original Silicon Mix but with a Twist. If you are looking for a different smell and scent. The product still does what it does... CONDITIONS GREAT!!! :-) I love silicon mix for my Afro Caribbean Hair. &lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally finished this jar.  I  wished that I had tried to find the ingredients listed somewhere before I bought it.  I didn&#x27;t like that it had so many ingredients that aren&#x27;t healthy for hair (Mineral oil, synthetic colors, heavy fragrance), plus it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Great product and Seller, I recommend.</li>
            <li> After the 1st time using the product I&#x27;m happy to say I WILL NOT Be using anything else!!!!!!! Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair was dry and after only one use my hair was soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, frizzy and tangles a lot when you wash it this conditioner works like magic! In just seconds your hair goes from a tangled mess to a buttery soft dream! And smells wonderful too. I love how well it moisturizes my hair without adding weight, as long as I rinse thoroughly. And that heavenly fragrance lasts for days! Some people leave it on as a deep conditioner, I personally use it as a rinse/detangler because it works instantly, seriously! I never saw anything work this fast or this well. But I would never buy it in the States, it is ridiculously overpriced. A huge jar is only about 250 Dominican pesos (around $6.50 USD)if you buy it in the Dominican Republic, lol. I always stock up when I go visit my parents.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so smooth. LOOKING FOWARD TO ORDERING ALL PRODUCTS FROM Silicon mix in the future. Excellent</li>
            <li> Im a black females I deep condition my hair with This...smells so good and it lasts for weeks and it makes your hair extremely soft</li>
            <li> It really does help revitalize your hair, works great for hair extensions too. Doesn&#x27;t last for as long as I&#x27;d like so you might have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I use this product as a deep conditioner and a rinse. It is has a wonderful smell and gives my hair shine and protects it from the heat that i use during styling. I recommend using this every other week as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really softens your hair and makes blow drying and/or roller setting your hair a breeze! I was very expressed with how much stronger my hair became in just 2 uses. I would definitely recommend this product and continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;I love this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I use it along with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful smell and leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER MADE. I HAVE REFERRED IT TO EVERYONE I KNOW AND THEY LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It was beyond my exceptions. It left my hair feeling like I had just left the beauty salon. I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair!</li>
            <li> I really see a big improvement when I use this on my hair. I went a few days to get my hair washed and blow dried and my hair still is straight and soft, no frizzies yet and my hair is all natural.</li>
            <li> This is just based on the conditioner because I didn&#x27;t order it here. What made me purchase this product was the reviews I read here.  I was able to find it at a local beauty supply store for 4.99 same 8oz jar.  I plan on using it today and I will post another review on my results by next week.  I want to give a honest review on this to help others decide if they want to try it also.</li>
            <li> Let me say that this silicon had the softes smell of all the Avanti silicon mixes. I really do like this product but I have not used it long enough, but I can say it makes my hair really soft, has great slip, and smells nice. After I flat iron like the other two I still get that bouncy beautiful flow!</li>
            <li> This stuff starts to work as soon as you put it on. It really helped with my split ends because Im trying to grow my hair out. I bought this product because my stylist recommended it for my hair. It is a professional product.</li>
            <li> Love this I will buy again</li>
            <li> This produt helped my hair to grow up faster and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I am always trying new products, but that one is always on my bathroom ;)</li>
            <li> Order arrived well be fore it should have, huge plus! Packaged wonderfully and it smells great, can&#x27;t wait to try it out! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading several hair blogs and watching youtube videos. It has definitely lived up to all that each person has said that&#x27;s good about this conditioner. I mix it with Kanechom, it has become my staple conditioner. I&#x27;m on my second container. It leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The product offers a good hair treatment. With few day of use you can notice the difference, the hair become more and more soft</li>
            <li> Delivered in time and really good product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t came the correct product.</li>
            <li> I use this every month or so to give my hair a conditioning treat.  the smell is so delicious and appealing.  it makes your hair soft and silky and ready for blow drying or setting or air drying naturally.  very versatile product.</li>
            <li> You know when you put that special conditioner in your hair that comes with a new box of color and how after using that conditioner, your hair feels silky? Well, that is this stuff for your regular shampoo/conditioner routine. The new packaging has english &amp; spanish instructions, but it&#x27;s the typical deep conditioning instructions. After using this product (which smells great) my hair is softer, able to take heat better, &amp; the styling seems to last longer. This has become a regular purchase of mine!</li>
            <li> I bought this because that youtuber MakeupbyCamilla swears by it and my curly hair is always thirsty. I&#x27;ve used it like 5 times and my hair definitely looks better. Not as dry or frizzy as it was. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my holy grail item but so far so good</li>
            <li> very good, and it arrived really fast!</li>
            <li> Hydrating and weighs down my frizzy curly hair smells so great!</li>
            <li> I am deployed and have to have my hair up ALL THE TIME! I use this once a week after I shampoo and I will even go to sleep with it in my hair. It doesnt stain my pillows or anything. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that is having hair problems to use. And I will be using it again. And it also smells HEAVENLY!</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a film, but make sure you thoroughly rinse. It smells wonderful. Does its job, but again, make sure you rinse it completely out of your hair or it will remain stiff.</li>
            <li> Smells great..helps with split ends and over processed hair...not heavy or greasy..doesnt weigh hair down&lt;br /&gt;good buy..hard to find product</li>
            <li> Yesss.. I had got the original silicon mix 35oz. And the bambu 8oz, I wish I had did the other way around, don&#x27;t get me wrong the original works but not as good as the bambu is gives your hair more of a bounce and it smells so much better so Im going to purches the 16 oz</li>
