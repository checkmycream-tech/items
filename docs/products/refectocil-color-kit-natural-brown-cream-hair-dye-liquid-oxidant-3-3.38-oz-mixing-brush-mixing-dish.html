            <li>Easy and effective.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I think you have more control over the product when you mix the tint with the creme oxidant.</li>
            <li>Better than powder.</li>
            <li>Tried this and it lasts 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>I had it on for only 7 minutes and it worked perfectly!</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I prefer the look when I get them tinted as it looks better and also dyes the skin of my brows</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I found that the best way to mix the product is to use the brush that comes with it (or any standard lip brush--</li>
            <li>Nor sure yet.  </li>
            <li>Will try one more time.</li>
            <li>The kit they give you is perfect and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The wife loved it, says its the exact one they use in salons.</li>
            <li>So excited I found this!</li>
            <li>Will last easily a year or more from the amount needed&lt;br /&gt;Per use and highly effective!!</li>
            <li>Better product than the others, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also much more comfortable not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>Even more excited I became when I saw it came as a kit.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions</li>
            <li>I have never dyed my lashes before, and doing so with this kit was so easy.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and makes my brows look darker and thicker</li>
            <li>This brown is perfect for my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine with me &amp; my pockets</li>
            <li>Use it about every 2-3 weeks - use the brush and be precise in applying.  </li>
            <li>but I just purchased the light brown tube</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I have everything that I need to keep my naturally light auburn tipped eyelashes and brows</li>
            <li>and I think my eyebrows look as good as when they are done professionally.  </li>
            <li>The kit itself is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>and now I can do it fast (in about 10 minutes) at home and get every bit as good a look as I did in the high dollar salons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Shhould be use the right color for each ones and the excess out of the eyebrown skin should be removed quickly</li>
            <li>Good price, will last forever!</li>
            <li>I took my daughter to get her eyebrows threaded and the lady actually commented that she loved my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I bought this natural brown color and it is a nice color</li>
            <li>Not 100 percent, but good enough.</li>
            <li>The color sets within 10 minutes and leaves no redness or irritation, leaving me with beautiful, dark brows that I don&#x27;t have to worry about slathering moisturizer and concealer on to hide redness.</li>
            <li>I am extremely fair with white brows and lashes and while the natural brown is great for my lashes, I would get the light brown next time for my brows.  </li>
            <li>With that color remover on a cotton swab I can quickly remove any spots of dye on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the way this color mixed with the developer and how we&#x27;ll it worked on my brows.</li>
            <li>It is SO easy to use and very inexpensive compared to a monthly visit to a salon.</li>
            <li>Also, try explaining to ppl that you really do have eyebrows they just don&#x27;t show because the hair is so light.</li>
            <li>It mixes up to a nice paste in the little glass bowl so it won&#x27;t drip and is fairly easy to apply to your lashes with the grooved plastic stick that is included.</li>
            <li>lasts a long time and nice kit.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a quick and easy process</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to schedule an appointment with her before I left on my vacation</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see this product as I used it back in Germany and ran out of my supplies.</li>
            <li>Color last more then 4 weeks .</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My threader showed me how to use it the first time, and now Im hooked.</li>
            <li>Very neat product!</li>
            <li>Yes, test it on your arm, etc first.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this product and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>...does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Ordered the kit and it came in super fast &amp; packaged very well.</li>
            <li>If you are interested, do your own due diligence and try this out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile in shade, can be light brown for fair skin or dark brown for darker skin depending on time left on the hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally looked at the kit in light brown, looked it up later and got the natural brown without realizing it.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and by the looks of it, this will last forever.</li>
            <li>Be smart about this.</li>
            <li>but lo and behold Amazon sells the whole kit which was fantastic and at a an incredibly low price.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Very like.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole kit</li>
            <li>I used to spend way too much money having my brows dyed in salons</li>
            <li>I really like my eyebrow lady</li>
            <li>After doing much research and youtube videos I found this kit.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving soooo much money though</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I get just the results my client wants.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this color on light blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had some left from my last Roux kit and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I showed my sister (half of her eyebrows had gone blonde) and she LOVED the results.</li>
            <li>and it is more black than brown.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is when you scrub your face at night most of it comes off and you will have to do it again the next day if your going out again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li>so I am sure this tube will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use, works quickly and last a few weeks.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need that much so the tubes last for over 2 years!</li>
            <li>The little dish makes it easy to mix the color and oxidant without making a mess, and the brush allows for easy application.</li>
            <li>and it is totally professional!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and last a long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply with the little brush that comes with a kit, looks natural, lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>I have my eyebrows shaped and tinted by a professional esthetician.  </li>
            <li>I gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars because the natural brown is darker than what I thought</li>
            <li>a natural brown should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have brown hair naturally this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, my friend used it and it worked well with her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette, and natural brown works for me and covers my grays.</li>
            <li>Used on me and my very blond teenage girls.  </li>
            <li>My skimpy, scarce brows come alive with this kit.  </li>
            <li>I got the natural brown</li>
            <li>Refectocil is what my professional hairstylist has used in his salon for years.</li>
            <li>I get my eyebrows threaded professionally then tint them myself.</li>
            <li>It does fade, but not too fast or too obviously.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair red  (manic panic vampire red) and my eyebrows are like an ashy blonde light brown and it just clashes.</li>
            <li>COLOR KIT - Natural Brown Cream Hair Dye +</li>
            <li>I also mix the brown, with a smudge of black, to give a little more intense color.</li>
            <li>but if you leave it on for a while it becomes a nice rich dark brown without becoming an artificial looking black.</li>
            <li>I do wash my face several times a day so if you wash less, I am sure it will last longer.</li>
            <li>applied chap stick with a q-tip around my eyebrow to prevent the color from dyeing my skin; only left the color on for about 1 minute the first application for precautionary measures then re-applied.</li>
            <li>It only takes me barely a minute on each brow to get ready now, when I used to spend five minutes on them.</li>
            <li>The dark actually works super</li>
            <li>Refectocil met my expectations, it covers all white hair leaving my eyebrow so natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, on my eyebrows, which is what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>After 2 minutes, I have natural looking brows and acheived the same result I got at the spa!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural platinum/beige blonde.</li>
            <li>It is pretty dark though.</li>
            <li>Tintocil took a long time for the color to set, much longer than stated on the box, would leave me with red, irritated skin around my brow area, and would only last about a week or two.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the color will continue to develop even after you remove the cream from your brows, so it may take a few times to get the timing right, but typically I only leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really brown, almost black.</li>
            <li>It is not your typical &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; kit, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Way less expensive than salon version, easier to apply and, more than that, it actually lasts much  longer too!</li>

            <li> This brown is perfect for my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine with me &amp; my pockets</li>
            <li> Use it about every 2-3 weeks - use the brush and be precise in applying.  </li>
            <li> but I just purchased the light brown tube</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I have everything that I need to keep my naturally light auburn tipped eyelashes and brows</li>
            <li> and I think my eyebrows look as good as when they are done professionally.  </li>
            <li> The kit itself is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> and now I can do it fast (in about 10 minutes) at home and get every bit as good a look as I did in the high dollar salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Shhould be use the right color for each ones and the excess out of the eyebrown skin should be removed quickly</li>
            <li> Good price, will last forever!</li>
            <li> I took my daughter to get her eyebrows threaded and the lady actually commented that she loved my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought this natural brown color and it is a nice color</li>
            <li> Not 100 percent, but good enough.</li>
            <li> The color sets within 10 minutes and leaves no redness or irritation, leaving me with beautiful, dark brows that I don&#x27;t have to worry about slathering moisturizer and concealer on to hide redness.</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair with white brows and lashes and while the natural brown is great for my lashes, I would get the light brown next time for my brows.  </li>
            <li> With that color remover on a cotton swab I can quickly remove any spots of dye on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way this color mixed with the developer and how we&#x27;ll it worked on my brows.</li>
            <li> It is SO easy to use and very inexpensive compared to a monthly visit to a salon.</li>
            <li> Also, try explaining to ppl that you really do have eyebrows they just don&#x27;t show because the hair is so light.</li>
            <li> It mixes up to a nice paste in the little glass bowl so it won&#x27;t drip and is fairly easy to apply to your lashes with the grooved plastic stick that is included.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and nice kit.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a quick and easy process</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to schedule an appointment with her before I left on my vacation</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this product as I used it back in Germany and ran out of my supplies.</li>
            <li> Color last more then 4 weeks .</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My threader showed me how to use it the first time, and now Im hooked.</li>
            <li> Very neat product!</li>
            <li> Yes, test it on your arm, etc first.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I love this product and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> ...does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Ordered the kit and it came in super fast &amp; packaged very well.</li>
            <li> If you are interested, do your own due diligence and try this out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versatile in shade, can be light brown for fair skin or dark brown for darker skin depending on time left on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally looked at the kit in light brown, looked it up later and got the natural brown without realizing it.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and by the looks of it, this will last forever.</li>
            <li> Be smart about this.</li>
            <li> but lo and behold Amazon sells the whole kit which was fantastic and at a an incredibly low price.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Very like.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit</li>
            <li> I used to spend way too much money having my brows dyed in salons</li>
            <li> I really like my eyebrow lady</li>
            <li> After doing much research and youtube videos I found this kit.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving soooo much money though</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I get just the results my client wants.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this color on light blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had some left from my last Roux kit and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I showed my sister (half of her eyebrows had gone blonde) and she LOVED the results.</li>
            <li> and it is more black than brown.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is when you scrub your face at night most of it comes off and you will have to do it again the next day if your going out again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> so I am sure this tube will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use, works quickly and last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need that much so the tubes last for over 2 years!</li>
            <li> The little dish makes it easy to mix the color and oxidant without making a mess, and the brush allows for easy application.</li>
            <li> and it is totally professional!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and last a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply with the little brush that comes with a kit, looks natural, lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have my eyebrows shaped and tinted by a professional esthetician.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars because the natural brown is darker than what I thought</li>
            <li> a natural brown should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have brown hair naturally this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, my friend used it and it worked well with her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brunette, and natural brown works for me and covers my grays.</li>
            <li> Used on me and my very blond teenage girls.  </li>
            <li> My skimpy, scarce brows come alive with this kit.  </li>
            <li> I got the natural brown</li>
            <li> Refectocil is what my professional hairstylist has used in his salon for years.</li>
            <li> I get my eyebrows threaded professionally then tint them myself.</li>
            <li> It does fade, but not too fast or too obviously.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair red  (manic panic vampire red) and my eyebrows are like an ashy blonde light brown and it just clashes.</li>
            <li> COLOR KIT - Natural Brown Cream Hair Dye +</li>
            <li> I also mix the brown, with a smudge of black, to give a little more intense color.</li>
            <li> but if you leave it on for a while it becomes a nice rich dark brown without becoming an artificial looking black.</li>
            <li> I do wash my face several times a day so if you wash less, I am sure it will last longer.</li>
            <li> applied chap stick with a q-tip around my eyebrow to prevent the color from dyeing my skin; only left the color on for about 1 minute the first application for precautionary measures then re-applied.</li>
            <li> It only takes me barely a minute on each brow to get ready now, when I used to spend five minutes on them.</li>
            <li> The dark actually works super</li>
            <li> Refectocil met my expectations, it covers all white hair leaving my eyebrow so natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, on my eyebrows, which is what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> After 2 minutes, I have natural looking brows and acheived the same result I got at the spa!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural platinum/beige blonde.</li>
            <li> It is pretty dark though.</li>
            <li> Tintocil took a long time for the color to set, much longer than stated on the box, would leave me with red, irritated skin around my brow area, and would only last about a week or two.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the color will continue to develop even after you remove the cream from your brows, so it may take a few times to get the timing right, but typically I only leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really brown, almost black.</li>
            <li> It is not your typical &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; kit, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than salon version, easier to apply and, more than that, it actually lasts much  longer too!</li>
            <li> It is a dark natural brown, which I need.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep your eyebrows tinted for a long time</li>
            <li> The hair I dyed was blonde, and I left it on for 4 minutes because I didn&#x27;t want it to turn out too dark.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the countless hours I&#x27;ve spent in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> It take so long</li>
            <li> The pointed end of the swab is also good for removing any dye that may have gotten close to your eye at the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> it came with directions in other languages but none in English.  </li>
            <li> I tried dying them with the same stuff I use on my hair but that only seemed to work for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Going from white brows to dark changes everything.</li>
            <li> Only for owners of black hair.</li>
            <li> so I spend much less time in front of the mirror drawing them back on.  </li>
            <li> Then I wipe it off with a dry cotton pad and a wet one and viola!</li>
            <li> No Thanks.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not cons to this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to realize I can do it myself for half the price.  </li>
            <li> This will also last me years as I just need very little.</li>
            <li> Used some other brow tint sold on Amazon and it washed out in about one weeks time.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are, you will need it!  </li>
            <li> Do be very careful not to get the color on the surfaces in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for other products, I narrowed it down and bought this brand.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want your lashes to dark, just wash it of after 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after 4 or 5 days or so, the color seems to fade from a dark brown to a medium brown.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a bit dark.</li>
            <li> The liquid takes less time to develope</li>
            <li> This took less than 10 minutes and lasted over a month.  </li>
            <li> will also mention that I&#x27;ve been dyeing them about every week and a half to two weeks.</li>
            <li> the color was a little to dark</li>
            <li> well, I&#x27;m extremely pale so dark brows frame</li>
            <li> I got several small splatters on my white faux marble countertop and even with a lot of scrubbing I can still make out a faint stain.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to do it everyday.</li>
            <li> The dye lasts approximately 3-4 weeks and the tube of dye should last you 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> My gray eyebrows needed penciling everyday.  </li>
            <li> My formerly-thick brows have become sparse from overplucking, and I had been using Tintocil for the past year to dye my brows a dark brown color and make them appear fuller.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to apply mascara and eye brow pencil everyday.</li>
            <li> Almost seems like a waste to use disposable items when you buy the brush in the kit though) and leave it on for five minutes.</li>
            <li> found it stained the skin heavily.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily, no dying of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The are not very handy or stable.</li>
            <li> You need very little for just your brows.</li>
            <li> did buy the kit that includes the color, the developer, a small mixing container, and mixing and application brushes and would suggest doing that.</li>
            <li> No more colored pencils.</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the dye on my brows for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> One of developer fluid containers was not screwed tight and leaked (I think I have lost about a quarter of fluid), making for a very unpleasant smell all over and ruined boxes of creme tubes.</li>
            <li> For 20, I can buy this kit and do it myself probably at least 10 times.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of letting my brows fill back in after a few bad brow waxings, so this helps!</li>
            <li> and I just got tired of paying that when I could do it myself.</li>
            <li> I have to fill my brows in every day as they are thin and sparse.</li>
            <li> but the packaging was extremely sloppy.</li>
            <li> The brown tube has lasted me about 2 1/2 years, and has not gone bad or changed in color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t burn or smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a loda crap.</li>
            <li> It was getting increasingly annoying to dye my brows</li>
            <li> It burns terribly if it gets in the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t discovered a dye that doesn&#x27;t when tinting eyelashes.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and did a perfect job ...love it</li>
            <li> Refectocil colors have always worked excellent on all skin types and hair colors I perferr the liquid developer over the cream. The liquid takes less time to develope</li>
            <li> I have my eyebrows shaped and tinted by a professional esthetician.  She does amazing work and is truly an artist when it comes to shaping and tinting my brows.  This is the product she uses when she tints my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to schedule an appointment with her before I left on my vacation so I had to tint my own brows.  This product worked great and I think my eyebrows look as good as when they are done professionally.  The only suggestion I would make would be to include the creme oxidant in the color kit rather than the liquid oxidant.  I think you have more control over the product when you mix the tint with the creme oxidant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all year. Good product b</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this product as I used it back in Germany and ran out of my supplies.Even more excited I became when I saw it came as a kit. The product is great, works wonders for sparse eyebrows, although it says not to use on eyebrows, (I know, I know) but the packaging was extremely sloppy. One of developer fluid containers was not screwed tight and leaked (I think I have lost about a quarter of fluid), making for a very unpleasant smell all over and ruined boxes of creme tubes. Which was a shame, because I purchased two sets to give one to my Mom as a gift. Also mixing dishes I received were nothing like the ones on the picture. The are not very handy or stable. I think next time I order I try a different seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and I find it very easy to mix and apply. I wanted a true brown color to ensure good definition of my brows. Be aware that the color will continue to develop even after you remove the cream from your brows, so it may take a few times to get the timing right, but typically I only leave it on for a few minutes. Everything needed is included. I use a simple astringent to remove excess tint from my skin. Do be very careful not to get the color on the surfaces in your bathroom. I got several small splatters on my white faux marble countertop and even with a lot of scrubbing I can still make out a faint stain.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way this color mixed with the developer and how we&#x27;ll it worked on my brows. I gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars because the natural brown is darker than what I thought a natural brown should be.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy the kit that includes the color, the developer, a small mixing container, and mixing and application brushes and would suggest doing that.</li>
            <li> The hair I dyed was blonde, and I left it on for 4 minutes because I didn&#x27;t want it to turn out too dark. It&#x27;s really brown, almost black. If you have brown hair naturally this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, my friend used it and it worked well with her.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the results are great.  Best product!! It lasts a lot.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Better than powder. I think this will last me 6 months doing it every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde and have no eyebrows so I will use this to touch up my eyebrows every 3-5 weeks.  No more colored pencils.</li>
            <li> Used some other brow tint sold on Amazon and it washed out in about one weeks time. Tried this and it lasts 3 weeks or more. I do wash my face several times a day so if you wash less, I am sure it will last longer. So easy to apply and by the looks of it, this will last forever. You need very little for just your brows. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, works quickly and last a few weeks. The color sets in just a minute or 2. I&#x27;m a brunette, and natural brown works for me and covers my grays. I bought it for my brows. My only concern is the box says its not for eyebrows or eyelashes—it could cause blindness. Yikes! REFECTOCIL lists a very similar product for eyebrows and lashes, but I cannot find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Refectocil met my expectations, it covers all white hair leaving my eyebrow so natural. I recommend</li>
            <li> I have my eyebrows tattooed which gave them very good shape but my hair are very light so I decided to give them some color with this dye. I had it on for only 7 minutes and it worked perfectly! Good price, will last forever!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I was paying for my eyebrows every 2 weeks $30 with just couple minutes and minimum afford I can safe tons $! Color last more then 4 weeks .</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it came up in my \\&quot;eyelash tint\\&quot; search but the product box says not to use it for that???!!!!  It says it can cause blindness.</li>
            <li> good color and coveage</li>
            <li> Only for owners of black hair. I use for coloring eyelashes only. Very like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every product on the market to &amp;#34;create&amp;#34; my eyebrows every day for the last 5 years since my fiance pointed out to me that my eyebrows had disappeared. Not to mention the countless hours I&#x27;ve spent in front of the mirror. Also, try explaining to ppl that you really do have eyebrows they just don&#x27;t show because the hair is so light. Anyway, one day it occurred to me.........DYE the hair (I know simple thought). After reading the reviews for other products, I narrowed it down and bought this brand. I LOVE IT!! I did take some of the tips from the reviews: applied chap stick with a q-tip around my eyebrow to prevent the color from dyeing my skin; only left the color on for about 1 minute the first application for precautionary measures then re-applied. I showed my sister (half of her eyebrows had gone blonde) and she LOVED the results. It&#x27;s been about a month and it still looks good. I took my daughter to get her eyebrows threaded and the lady actually commented that she loved my eyebrows. ;)</li>
            <li> Used on me and my very blond teenage girls.  We all really liked the results.  Use it about every 2-3 weeks - use the brush and be precise in applying.  Second it starts to burn/tingle we know it&#x27;s time to wash off.</li>
            <li> Love this product just wished it would stay on longer. It starts fading in three days. Either way I would recommend it to anyone that would like to tint their eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easy to apply with the little brush that comes with a kit, looks natural, lasts for weeks. I waited 2 minutes after applying on my braws and 15 min. on my lashes. The longer you wait the darker the color. If you don&#x27;t want your lashes to dark, just wash it of after 1-2 minutes. Use gloves!</li>
            <li> Easy and effective. Awesome I think this is better than any brow makeup and does the best job of framing the eye area.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  There are no sensitivity issues, the color is perfect, and anyone can use it!  My threader showed me how to use it the first time, and now Im hooked. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I watched the video on You Tube and was able to use this product easily! I dyed my eyebrows myself and found it good quality color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, on my eyebrows, which is what I bought it for.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. The only thing is when you scrub your face at night most of it comes off and you will have to do it again the next day if your going out again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for tinting eyebrows every 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> Very neat product! The tint (for me) lasts about 3-4 days. I use it to fill in my eye brows so I don&#x27;t need to do it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow dye out there! The dye lasts approximately 3-4 weeks and the tube of dye should last you 4-6 months. Great product!</li>
            <li> Better product than the others, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Says use Refectocil spot remover to remove any spots. THAT MEANS ORDERING this stuff separately. That&#x27;s a loda crap. No Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit so I would be sure and have what I needed.  My gray eyebrows needed penciling everyday.  I tried dying them with the same stuff I use on my hair but that only seemed to work for a few days.  This took less than 10 minutes and lasted over a month.  I bought this natural brown color and it is a nice color but I just purchased the light brown tube...word of caution...it came with directions in other languages but none in English.  I wouldn&#x27;t have know what to do with it if I hadn&#x27;t already purchased this kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and last a long time!</li>
            <li> Have been getting my eyebrows done at spa for last 3 years and they use this product. Love it and saves me lots of money! So excited I found this!</li>
            <li> The best for eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Fill in those eyebrows no more...color them instead!  This products works wonders and brings out the eyes. Gives your face that extra pop.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The wife loved it, says its the exact one they use in salons. It lasts for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> This kit rocks!  My skimpy, scarce brows come alive with this kit.  So easy to use.  Only takes a smidgen to do both brows so I am sure this tube will last a very long time.  Nothing frames your face and eyes like good brows.  I used to spend way too much money having my brows dyed in salons and now I can do it fast (in about 10 minutes) at home and get every bit as good a look as I did in the high dollar salons.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff! It take so long do go away from the eyebrow. It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Shhould be use the right color for each ones and the excess out of the eyebrown skin should be removed quickly</li>
            <li> I was paying $40/bi-weekly to get my brows tinted and I just got tired of paying that when I could do it myself. Ordered the kit and it came in super fast &amp; packaged very well. Well I tried it and it is AMAZING! Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to realize I can do it myself for half the price.  I really like my eyebrow lady but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever see her again and that&#x27;s fine with me &amp; my pockets</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions</li>
            <li> This is a great product - much better than the Roux I was using.  I got the natural brown and it is more black than brown.  I am extremely fair with white brows and lashes and while the natural brown is great for my lashes, I would get the light brown next time for my brows.  I have never dyed my lashes before, and doing so with this kit was so easy.  Make sure you also purchase the stain remover.  No matter how careful you are, you will need it!  Luckily I had some left from my last Roux kit and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Work very good! I love it.</li>
            <li> Did the job. Not 100 percent, but good enough.</li>
            <li> I have to fill my brows in every day as they are thin and sparse. I prefer the look when I get them tinted as it looks better and also dyes the skin of my brows so I spend much less time in front of the mirror drawing them back on.  I didn&#x27;t like the cost or the time it took to get to spa that tints them.  After doing much research and youtube videos I found this kit.  This brown is perfect for my dark brown hair.  A lot of browns have too much red in them and this one does not.  You have to buy the oxidant too so this kit is perfect. After 2 minutes, I have natural looking brows and acheived the same result I got at the spa! This will also last me years as I just need very little. If you are interested, do your own due diligence and try this out. Yes, test it on your arm, etc first.  Be smart about this.</li>
            <li> My formerly-thick brows have become sparse from overplucking, and I had been using Tintocil for the past year to dye my brows a dark brown color and make them appear fuller. Tintocil took a long time for the color to set, much longer than stated on the box, would leave me with red, irritated skin around my brow area, and would only last about a week or two. It was getting increasingly annoying to dye my brows so I decided to make the switch to Refectocil. The little dish makes it easy to mix the color and oxidant without making a mess, and the brush allows for easy application. The color sets within 10 minutes and leaves no redness or irritation, leaving me with beautiful, dark brows that I don&#x27;t have to worry about slathering moisturizer and concealer on to hide redness. My only complaint is that after 4 or 5 days or so, the color seems to fade from a dark brown to a medium brown. Unlike Tintocil, some color is still there though, and the medium brown lasts for weeks. The appearance of the color fading might be because I&#x27;m currently growing out my brows though. Anyway, I love this product and would definitely buy it again! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product the color was a little to dark but that was my fault, I ordered another on in a lighter shade because it is a great buy and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Refectocil is what my professional hairstylist has used in his salon for years. It is not your typical &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; kit, it&#x27;s the real deal. I have used this product for 10+ years to dye my eye brows and I absolutely LOVE it. I use a vaseline all over before applying. I also mix the brown, with a smudge of black, to give a little more intense color. It is SO easy to use and very inexpensive compared to a monthly visit to a salon. The brown tube has lasted me about 2 1/2 years, and has not gone bad or changed in color.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT! Saves you a ton of money on tinting and it is totally professional!</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than salon version, easier to apply and, more than that, it actually lasts much  longer too! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff about every month and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC and lasts quite a while.  Not only does it keep your eyebrows tinted for a long time but you really don&#x27;t need that much so the tubes last for over 2 years!</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes in the morning. Waterproof mascara can be a trial to get off at night. Now that I have used this product to dye my eyelashes I don&#x27;t need to wear mascara anymore. This eyelash and brow dye is a great product. Unlike the hair coloring that you use on your head this has no ammonia type aroma to make your eyes run. It mixes up to a nice paste in the little glass bowl so it won&#x27;t drip and is fairly easy to apply to your lashes with the grooved plastic stick that is included. It starts out medium brown but if you leave it on for a while it becomes a nice rich dark brown without becoming an artificial looking black. I found it easier to use a pointed cotton swab to apply the dye to the hair of my brows. The pointed end of the swab is also good for removing any dye that may have gotten close to your eye at the base of your lashes. After reading the reviews I ordered Roux hair color remover. With that color remover on a cotton swab I can quickly remove any spots of dye on my skin. With this Refectocil color kit, some Fran Wilson Eye Tees make up applicator cotton tipped swabs, and  Roux hair color remover I have everything that I need to keep my naturally light auburn tipped eyelashes and brows colored so I don&#x27;t need to apply mascara and eye brow pencil everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this product and very easy to use</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for me and it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use. Will last easily a year or more from the amount needed&lt;br /&gt;Per use and highly effective!! Once again, a happy customer.</li>
            <li> love this. I no longer have to pay to get my brows tinted. I get my eyebrows threaded professionally then tint them myself. It is so easy to use and makes my brows look darker and thicker</li>
            <li> So I messed up. I originally looked at the kit in light brown, looked it up later and got the natural brown without realizing it. I&#x27;m a natural platinum/beige blonde. So it&#x27;s a bit dark. BUT, I love it! The dark actually works super well, I&#x27;m extremely pale so dark brows frame my face well and make my eyes stand out. The kit itself is super easy to use. I found that the best way to mix the product is to use the brush that comes with it (or any standard lip brush-- that&#x27;s all it is). It&#x27;s the only way I could get the &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; consistency the directions describe. I apply it with the brush (I may experiment with qtips... Almost seems like a waste to use disposable items when you buy the brush in the kit though) and leave it on for five minutes. Then I wipe it off with a dry cotton pad and a wet one and viola! Great brows! It only takes me barely a minute on each brow to get ready now, when I used to spend five minutes on them. Looooove it. I&#x27;m also much more comfortable not wearing any makeup. Going from white brows to dark changes everything. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;I will also mention that I&#x27;ve been dyeing them about every week and a half to two weeks. It does fade, but not too fast or too obviously. I&#x27;m saving soooo much money though and it&#x27;s such a quick and easy process that&#x27;s there&#x27;s really not cons to this. If you&#x27;re on the fence, forget about it. Just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; this time. Easier having it all together</li>
            <li> Nor sure yet.  found it stained the skin heavily.  Will try one more time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for tinting eyebrows/lashes.  As a makeup artist I get just the results my client wants.  It&#x27;s versatile in shade, can be light brown for fair skin or dark brown for darker skin depending on time left on the hair.  It burns terribly if it gets in the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t discovered a dye that doesn&#x27;t when tinting eyelashes.  I use eye-makeup remover when removing it so my client doesn&#x27;t have tinted skin; shade is not comprised with eye-makeup remover either.</li>
            <li> Just now used this and I love it! I dye my hair red  (manic panic vampire red) and my eyebrows are like an ashy blonde light brown and it just clashes. The color of this dye is perfect. My eyebrows are the color I want and it didn&#x27;t burn or smell bad at all. The kit they give you is perfect and will last quite a while. So happy I bought this. It is pretty dark though. I wouldn&#x27;t use this color on light blonde eyebrows. Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> Perfect little set up to dye my own brows!! I admittedly go to a girl who only charges about 14 dollars to dye my brows, but still. For 20, I can buy this kit and do it myself probably at least 10 times. It is a dark natural brown, which I need. The dye only lasts about 2 weeks or so, with daily face washing, but the same can be said for the dye job that I get at the salon. I usually leave the dye on my brows for about 10 minutes. It washes off easily, no dying of my skin.  Voila&#x27;! My eyebrows look fuller!! I am in the process of letting my brows fill back in after a few bad brow waxings, so this helps! I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works well...does exactly what it is supposed to do. Follow instructions explicitly or you&#x27;ll end up looking like Groucho Marx.</li>
            <li> bought 2, one was a gift.  lasts a long time and nice kit. comes with everything you need.  would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> After being shown how to use this product by a friend and then being told what products I needed to accomplish this look, I thought I would have to buy them separately but lo and behold Amazon sells the whole kit which was fantastic and at a an incredibly low price.  It works wonderfully.  Thank you[[ASIN:B007URZFKQ REFECTOCIL COLOR KIT - Natural Brown Cream Hair Dye + Liquid Oxidant 3% 1.7oz + Mixing Brush + Glass Dappen Dish]]</li>
