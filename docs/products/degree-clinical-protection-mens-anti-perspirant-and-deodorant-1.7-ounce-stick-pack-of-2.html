    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff i have ever found.  </li>
            <li>Best men&#x27;s anti-perspirant deodorant ever!</li>
            <li>Degree Clinical Protection is the best deodarant/anti-perspirant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Also the best smelling in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I tried the degree after reading all the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li>and yes it works great</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I just hope that one day they perfect their formula even more.</li>
            <li>idk if its works good or great or not at all.    </li>
            <li>This stuff even has a pleasant fragrance, a bonus for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after having read all the 5 star and 4 star reviews and thought this would be good.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for almost 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant as well, so I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great product and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Clean smell is great and the Amazon price is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>This is far one of the best product to use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this is a tad embarrassing to admit, but I sweat.  </li>
            <li>(okay, a lot pricey), but what can you do about that.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the upgraded one it does not work at all and leaves a funky smell to top it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I guess some people have more time in the morning than I do....</li>
            <li>Unlike many gel antiperspirants it also does not clump my under arm hair or have any type of residue that could get on my undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, in most cases, it made it worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I thought this deodarant might be perfect just as an extra security.</li>
            <li>This works for all the guys in our family better than others we tried&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the more one applies, the stronger the smell.</li>
            <li>First of all, it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>The Cool Rush smell is quite ok by me, and I&#x27;ve tried all 3 of the fragrances.</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t bring this one back they gona lose a lot of happy customers.</li>
            <li>Great product will buy again If possible.</li>
            <li>It does a great job in the &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; department - eliminating odor without adding on extra scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this is the best deodorant/anti-perspirant I have tried, and it is what I everyday.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my script and my primary care asked me to make another appointment in order to get a refill.</li>
            <li>It REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell of Clean is</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the 1.7 oz size lasts approx 5 weeks for me at 2-3 clicks/day, while the larger 2.7 oz stick (rarely in-stock but a great value) lasts me about 2 months.</li>
            <li>This product is great, lots of chemicals and additives to keep you cool and dry.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go next morning!</li>
            <li>but I was getting mystery stains on my favorite (fairly expansive) black T shirts.  </li>
            <li>When I apply the product the night before as instructed, I certainly see a strong improvement as an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>Works Ok for sweat but the amount that&#x27;s is actualy in the bottle is a complete rip!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much what I experienced, however, I did not use it at night, only after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>fragrance is quite nice, and really isn&#x27;t all that strong for me - and I am somewhat sensitive to strong smells (I get headaches if exposed long to strong fragrances).</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s well worth the price...</li>
            <li>Ever since I was in grade school, I can remember kids making fun of my under arm sweat.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s rarely any itchiness during the day.</li>
            <li>I suffered throughout high school with this problem and into adulthood, too embaressed to talk about it even with my primary care physician.</li>
            <li>My right underarm sweats more then my left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the first product that I have used for over a week at a time that has not caused a rash, sticky pits, or stains.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>once I actually screwed it all the way to the top.</li>
            <li>This works better than the standard degree stuff you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that if I only apply it at night it works better.</li>
            <li>price used to be good - I&#x27;ve ordered it several times, but I see it&#x27;s now priced higher than it is in the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this doesn&#x27;t eliminate it the way I&#x27;d like it to (my undershirts are not COMPLETELY dry), it works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, so I&#x27;ll keep using it unless I find something better.  </li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, but does have some strange directions that are unlike normal antiperspirant</li>
            <li>I have also enjoyed having completely dry arm pits for the duration of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me, I bought certain dri and that does the trick.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very dissapointed and embarrased that I have to throw away some of my clothes because of the sweat stains.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well</li>
            <li>no matter how much I applied</li>
            <li>I occasionally roll on a bit more if I&#x27;m changing and headed back out in the evening, but rarely need that.</li>
            <li>After trying several other traditioinal &amp; alternative anti-perspiration products, I&#x27;ve found this product to be great because, in addition to keeping me completely dry, it has a mild fragrance</li>
            <li>I have heard that there are some Clean ones out there that smell different though.</li>
            <li>Not like gross puddles of icky sweat, but I do sweat more than most people I know.  </li>
            <li>The smaller size is a lot better to keep in your bag for daily use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know why or what was causing the sweat because I wasn&#x27;t doing anything high stress or high exertion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Wow, this D O REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I perspire a lot, and summer in New York city isn&#x27;t fun, especially when I wear a suit.</li>
            <li>They came out with a new one.</li>
            <li>Also my pits are so much dryer, I rarely have them wet anymore ever since switching to this brand (4+ years).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used it in the morning, and it&#x27;s good for at least 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li>Any of the major brands of deodorant that touts a &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>only drawback for me, as with other reviewers, is the itchiness, and I could see some folks suffering more than others.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t destroy my clothes, like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>In addition, the high price of this deodarant was very dissapointing when I noticed that the the deodarant itself was only half full</li>
            <li>I must have went through over 20 different items trying to find something that really works.</li>
            <li>Degree Clinical has become a real life-saver for me in the last 2 years.</li>
            <li>This stick keeps my underarms dry even while I&#x27;m on a steaming hot subway platform...</li>
            <li>and I can actually wear shirts with color and feel confident, instead of the same old black shirts that hide my pits.</li>
            <li>product has not stained any of my darker coloured shirts, is not sticky like normal anti-perspirants, and seems to instantly sink into my skin and start working.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have a major sweat problem, but my undershirts are a lifesaver on those days when I&#x27;m up in front of people at work for hours at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then found out that this is a very common problem amonst many people I know.</li>
            <li>My husband has a really strong body odor and other guys were actually giving him a hard time about it at work.</li>

            <li> I then found out that this is a very common problem amonst many people I know.</li>
            <li> My husband has a really strong body odor and other guys were actually giving him a hard time about it at work.</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice, not too uncomfortable Like other antiperspirant deodorants.</li>
            <li> well no more searching for me, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I find that my &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; usually coincides with my stress level... and when I&#x27;m stressed, this doesn&#x27;t help all that much</li>
            <li> The contents are in the form of a white cream, but it is a dry cream, so once you rub it in your arm pit you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the underarms of my shirt will be wet shortly, promise you that.  </li>
            <li> While this \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; version is roughly twice the cost of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; anti-perspirant, it provides double the protection to cover all my personalities...</li>
            <li> Customer service told me that you need to let the product completely dry before putting on your clothes....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s irritating, not only because it&#x27;s unattractive (who wants to see that)</li>
            <li> They are serious when they say that putting it on at night will last you through the next day (although I always put it on after a shower, morning or evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However after usage of a few days, I found that when I did not apply the deodorant, for no apparent reason, my underarms will start sweating/perspiring.     </li>
            <li> I never sweat extremely except in stressful situations.</li>
            <li> Thus, I googled the side effects of the active ingredient aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and found that there are harmful side effects of long-term usage of the product</li>
            <li> (I hardly ever wear white because of that)</li>
            <li> I tried every over the counter antipersperant/deoderant there was with no success.</li>
            <li> I wore black shirts and dark colors to try to mask the wetness.</li>
            <li> However the next day or so, while doing tasks such as reading or studying, my underarms would start sweating even though the weather is cold and dry.    </li>
            <li> Lasts about a week and a half</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even work as normal deodorant which is unfortunate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like it goes fast, so it&#x27;s money well spent, especially if you have a problem with overactive glands (ugh, don&#x27;t you hate that).  </li>
            <li> It helps a little bit</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed as having hyperhydrosis, i.e. heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> hardly any of the product is expelled and I&#x27;m forced to use at least 5-6 clicks just to barely managed to coat my underarm.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my son. The scent is really nice, not too uncomfortable Like other antiperspirant deodorants. My son likes it .I recommend this product . Buy it you won&#x27;t be disaponted.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this is a tad embarrassing to admit, but I sweat.  Not like gross puddles of icky sweat, but I do sweat more than most people I know.  It could be 30 degrees outside and yet the underarms of my shirt will be wet shortly, promise you that.  It&#x27;s irritating, not only because it&#x27;s unattractive (who wants to see that) but it&#x27;s also a problem with staining my underarms (I hardly ever wear white because of that) so I am always looking for a product that will limit the sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this doesn&#x27;t eliminate it the way I&#x27;d like it to (my undershirts are not COMPLETELY dry), it works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, so I&#x27;ll keep using it unless I find something better.  They are serious when they say that putting it on at night will last you through the next day (although I always put it on after a shower, morning or evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tad pricey (okay, a lot pricey), but what can you do about that.  It&#x27;s not like it goes fast, so it&#x27;s money well spent, especially if you have a problem with overactive glands (ugh, don&#x27;t you hate that).  I recommend this.  I just hope that one day they perfect their formula even more.</li>
            <li> After trying several other traditioinal &amp; alternative anti-perspiration products, I&#x27;ve found this product to be great because, in addition to keeping me completely dry, it has a mild fragrance and it does not make me itchy or allergic! For me, it&#x27;s well worth the price...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone. This is far one of the best product to use. Only problem is that are no longer selling it in the stores. They came out with a new one. Don&#x27;t buy the upgraded one it does not work at all and leaves a funky smell to top it off. If they don&#x27;t bring this one back they gona lose a lot of happy customers.</li>
            <li> Product does what is says it does. Expensive but if you need to find something that actually works this is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see the package is now 1.7 oz.  When I ordered it before I got 2 sticks that were 2.7 oz each, for the same price, if I remember right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product is outstanding.  Apply it just before bedtime (that took some getting used to) and I can&#x27;t sweat (underarms) if I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also lasts forever (months and months), even when you think the stick is about out of product, it still lasts another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> While this \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; version is roughly twice the cost of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; anti-perspirant, it provides double the protection to cover all my personalities...you know, at work and everywhere else.  Sometimes it&#x27;s as if I could go two days without re-applying even after a shower, but worry not, I don&#x27;t.  Because that&#x27;s just uncivilized.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having read all the 5 star and 4 star reviews and thought this would be good.    However after usage of a few days, I found that when I did not apply the deodorant, for no apparent reason, my underarms will start sweating/perspiring.     Yes, after applying the deodorant, my underarms did not perspire. However the next day or so, while doing tasks such as reading or studying, my underarms would start sweating even though the weather is cold and dry.    Thus, I googled the side effects of the active ingredient aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and found that there are harmful side effects of long-term usage of the product ([...])     I have since stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Works Ok for sweat but the amount that&#x27;s is actualy in the bottle is a complete rip! Lasts about a week and a half and there little 2 click directions is frankly stupid. All I know is that&#x27;s I have man sized pits and need about 4 clicks at least</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and yes it works great but I was getting mystery stains on my favorite (fairly expansive) black T shirts.  The stains do not come out! I put two and two together/ did a test and this product is causing the greasey nasty stains.  Customer service told me that you need to let the product completely dry before putting on your clothes....I guess some people have more time in the morning than I do....regardless they are working with me to replace the T-shirts.(4 that I can recently think of)  I will post how they handle this situation.  For now be forewarned that this product can ruin your expensive clothes...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have a major sweat problem, but my undershirts are a lifesaver on those days when I&#x27;m up in front of people at work for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the clinical protection product several months ago, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it (and I like how amazon.com allows for recurring shipments of the product). The product is very easy to use, but does have some strange directions that are unlike normal antiperspirant products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you&#x27;re supposed to apply it at night before bed - two \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; of the dial send out a couple millimeters of product and while you are sleeping the formula \\&quot;acclimates to the body, forming a deep level of protection.\\&quot; This antiperspirant is then supposed to last even after taking a shower in the morning, then all through your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much what I experienced, however, I did not use it at night, only after getting out of the shower. The contents are in the form of a white cream, but it is a dry cream, so once you rub it in your arm pit you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has not stained any of my darker coloured shirts, is not sticky like normal anti-perspirants, and seems to instantly sink into my skin and start working. Unlike many gel antiperspirants it also does not clump my under arm hair or have any type of residue that could get on my undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the first product that I have used for over a week at a time that has not caused a rash, sticky pits, or stains. I have also enjoyed having completely dry arm pits for the duration of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in grade school, I can remember kids making fun of my under arm sweat. I must have tried every antiperspirant and deodorant on the market from sprays to gels to roll-ons and nothing worked. In fact, in most cases, it made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;  So, here we are now, I have my miracle for my arm pits. This stuff really works well and I can actually wear shirts with color and feel confident, instead of the same old black shirts that hide my pits. I apply the product after my shower before bed and I&#x27;m good for almost 24 hours. No clumps, no powder residue, and no slimy gel. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff i have ever found.  I must have went through over 20 different items trying to find something that really works. well no more searching for me, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again If possible.</li>
            <li> Thanx Degree!!! I&#x27;ve finally found what I was looking for ... for YEARS! Best men&#x27;s anti-perspirant deodorant ever! Highly recommend it! Look NO further, guys!!! Apply it every night (2 clicks) and you&#x27;re good to go next morning! Period! Do NOT trust Mitchum products - they&#x27;re all just glorified JUNK!</li>
            <li> I never sweat extremely except in stressful situations. So I thought this deodarant might be perfect just as an extra security. Immediately after starting this deodarant I started sweating profusely through my clothes. I didn&#x27;t even know why or what was causing the sweat because I wasn&#x27;t doing anything high stress or high exertion. In addition, the high price of this deodarant was very dissapointing when I noticed that the the deodarant itself was only half full once I actually screwed it all the way to the top. This is absolutely the worst product on the market and I&#x27;m very dissapointed and embarrased that I have to throw away some of my clothes because of the sweat stains.</li>
            <li> well i sweat alot for no reason. i could be freezing cold and just chilllen and ill sweat.     1st day i tried it i was working and i still sweat. not a ton but it still was there. now i knowits a wetness reducer. and not a total block for sweat. but being under no controlled experiment... idk if its works good or great or not at all.    the second day i wear it and i get sweat marks on my undershirt before im even done getting dressed.. so i dont approve.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I bought certain dri and that does the trick. This doesn&#x27;t even work as normal deodorant which is unfortunate</li>
            <li> Degree Clinical Protection is the best deodarant/anti-perspirant I have ever tried. I started using it about 6 months ago, and I have been sticking with it since. It does a great job in the &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; department - eliminating odor without adding on extra scent. However, in terms of &amp;#34;anti-perspirant&amp;#34;, I think it can use some improvement. Even though it is clinical strength, I still find myself sweating through from time to time. When I apply the product the night before as instructed, I certainly see a strong improvement as an anti-perspirant. However, it is simply not as effective as I want it to be. That said, I have never tried a product that meets my expectation, and it may just be what I expect is beyond what an anti-perspirant can do without causing some serious health problem.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is the best deodorant/anti-perspirant I have tried, and it is what I everyday.</li>
            <li> Any of the major brands of deodorant that touts a &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength is the real deal.  They are more expensive, but once you try them, you will no longer have confidence in anything else. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow, this D O REALLY WORKS. I can go to work sweat and the next day I am still covered so I don&#x27;t sweat the next day either!</li>
            <li> This product is great, lots of chemicals and additives to keep you cool and dry. When it comes to deodorant I want to not sweat and don&#x27;t care what sort or crazy chemicals are in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean smell is great and the Amazon price is an amazing deal. The smaller size is a lot better to keep in your bag for daily use.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well, I have noticed a steep decline in under-arm perspiration and odor. This stuff even has a pleasant fragrance, a bonus for me.</li>
            <li> My husband has a really strong body odor and other guys were actually giving him a hard time about it at work. I purchased this for him and he&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyperhidrosis and using regular strength deodorant was never enough. It was so bad that sweat would be dripping from my armpits no matter how much I applied. My wife found this deodorant for me and I finally have relief from dripping pits! The scent is pleasant as well, so I&#x27;m very satisfied. If regular strength doesn&#x27;t work for you, I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> This works for all the guys in our family better than others we tried&lt;br /&gt;the smell of Clean is their favorite&lt;br /&gt;We began buying on amazon as we kept having a hard time finding it at the store we go to often</li>
            <li> I used this before and enjoyed it, but it was fairly expensive for only one stick, I like the fact I could by a two pack for the price of one</li>
            <li> This works better than the standard degree stuff you can buy anywhere.  I find that my &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; usually coincides with my stress level... and when I&#x27;m stressed, this doesn&#x27;t help all that much either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price used to be good - I&#x27;ve ordered it several times, but I see it&#x27;s now priced higher than it is in the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Also the best smelling in my opinion. I have heard that there are some Clean ones out there that smell different though. Also my pits are so much dryer, I rarely have them wet anymore ever since switching to this brand (4+ years).</li>
            <li> First of all, it WORKS!!! It REALLY WORKS!!! Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t destroy my clothes, like the way it smells. I&#x27;m totally hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought the product in hopes of stopping my sweat problem but this product does not work. I read and followed the instructions but I still sweat in mere minutes after applying. The two clicks thing is also not guaranteed because with 2 clicks hardly any of the product is expelled and I&#x27;m forced to use at least 5-6 clicks just to barely managed to coat my underarm.</li>
            <li> Caused allergies. Never had allergies before.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed as having hyperhydrosis, i.e. heavy sweating. My right underarm sweats more then my left. I suffered throughout high school with this problem and into adulthood, too embaressed to talk about it even with my primary care physician. I wore black shirts and dark colors to try to mask the wetness. I used to put napkins under my arms to absorb the sweat. I tried every over the counter antipersperant/deoderant there was with no success. I then found out that this is a very common problem amonst many people I know. I finally saw my doctor and he prescribed me with a prescription strength called Hypercare. This is the only thing that has ever worked for me. You apply it at night and there is no need to put anything on in the morning. For me it lasts for several weeks before I need to reapply. I ran out of my script and my primary care asked me to make another appointment in order to get a refill. I have not had time to do that so I tried the degree after reading all the wonderful reviews. I have noticed that if I only apply it at night it works better. Otherwise if I use it in the morning, I still sweat and it leaves marks on my shirt. It helps a little bit but my goal is to have no sweat at all. I would not recommend this to anyone who suffers from severe sweating as I do. I would go to your doctor and get a script.</li>
            <li> Degree Clinical has become a real life-saver for me in the last 2 years. I perspire a lot, and summer in New York city isn&#x27;t fun, especially when I wear a suit. This stick keeps my underarms dry even while I&#x27;m on a steaming hot subway platform... so it&#x27;s at least not embarrassing to raise my hand when I get on the train!  It&#x27;s been tested in the worst humidity and held up. I just wish they made a similar product that reduced facial perspiration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is quite nice, and really isn&#x27;t all that strong for me - and I am somewhat sensitive to strong smells (I get headaches if exposed long to strong fragrances). However the more one applies, the stronger the smell. Also, as a person who sweats, I tend to wear an undershirt, so that may help mitigate the fragrance. The Cool Rush smell is quite ok by me, and I&#x27;ve tried all 3 of the fragrances. I don&#x27;t wear undershirts under tees or polos though, and have never felt the smell to be overbearing, nor have I had anyone say anything to me about my d-o (no - this product won&#x27;t have the Axe effect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me, as with other reviewers, is the itchiness, and I could see some folks suffering more than others. For me the itchiness is not there until I come home and take off the undershirt. And even then it last 3-4 minutes and then dissipates. The instructions ask you to use &#x27;2 clicks&#x27; (two half-turns) in the morning and another 2 after a bed-time shower. I&#x27;ve only ever used it in the morning, and it&#x27;s good for at least 8-10 hours. I occasionally roll on a bit more if I&#x27;m changing and headed back out in the evening, but rarely need that. There&#x27;s rarely any itchiness during the day. It may take a trial and I would recommend trying it for those of you that perspire a lot. Not a lot to lose, and a lot to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the 1.7 oz size lasts approx 5 weeks for me at 2-3 clicks/day, while the larger 2.7 oz stick (rarely in-stock but a great value) lasts me about 2 months.</li>
