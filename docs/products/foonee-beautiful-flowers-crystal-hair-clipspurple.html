            <li>i like it very much!!</li>
            <li>It looks prettier in the picture, like FULL of stones, itÂ´s</li>
            <li>However, all of the rhinestones are in place (many such products seem to have one or more in the bottom of the bag that must be re-applied).</li>
            <li>this is soooooo pretty....</li>

            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture (much cheaper, smaller stones) and three of the rhinestones had fallen out before I even opened the package.</li>
            <li>very pretty but too heavy for senior citizen hair</li>
            <li>The combs are so very pretty but a bit heavy in weight</li>
            <li>pretty but not FULL, you can definitly see the space between each stone.</li>

            <li> very pretty but too heavy for senior citizen hair</li>
            <li> I recieved this comb in excellent condition and at a great price. A lot of bang for your buck. For those with tin hair I would reccomend using it with a bun. Have had it for quite a while now and hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Nice all stones were in place. These did look like the pictures.</li>
            <li> Really cute, but remember that you get what you pay for. Fits great in thick hair! Might have to glue some rhinestones back in.</li>
            <li> this is soooooo pretty.... I suggest you buy 2 or more, and use them to accent your bun.....</li>
            <li> Arrived with a few gems already fallen out, luckily loose gems were still in the small clear bag, will attempt to glue back in.</li>
            <li> I bought this one. It is very pretty! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up, since I just received it. However, all of the rhinestones are in place (many such products seem to have one or more in the bottom of the bag that must be re-applied). It is a larger comb, but will make doing my hair in a rush easy. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The combs are so very pretty but a bit heavy in weight but I am enjoying them!</li>
            <li> I bought the blue one. It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture (much cheaper, smaller stones) and three of the rhinestones had fallen out before I even opened the package.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY, I recieved something totally different from the picture. It is not overfilled with jewels as the picture. A total rip off.</li>
            <li> This is truly beautiful i like it very much!!ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> It looks prettier in the picture, like FULL of stones, itÂ´s pretty but not FULL, you can definitly see the space between each stone.</li>
            <li> I love this! Will definitely look at more of there merchandise. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I used it. The colors were quite lovely tho. Nice bright crystals. It is missing some blue ones. A shame cause the we&#x27;re pretty and they showed so much.</li>
