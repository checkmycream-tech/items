            <li>As with all electric razors, works best with pre-shave, but also works well without pre-shave.</li>

            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Well Ive been using this Braun shaver for about a week now, it is very good.</li>
            <li>This Series 5 razor is the best yet, great shave and it cleans itself to boot.  </li>
            <li>A JOY AND THE SELF CLEANER IS WONDERFUL .</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband after he tried his brother&#x27;s it is a great razor at a great price!!</li>

            <li>The case is the best I&#x27;ve seen -- attractive and offering good protection.  </li>
            <li>The reason I debated giving it a lower rating was because I am not as happy with the charging/cleaning station.</li>
            <li>and they do a great job.</li>
            <li>Combine that with a great price makes this a Great Value.</li>
            <li>Which is great.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver.</li>
            <li>great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WELL SINCE DAY ONE I AM 100% HAPPY WITH MY BRAUN SERIES 5 590CC ELECTRIC SHAVER .</li>
            <li>This shaver works great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner/charging unit works great as well.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works great.</li>
            <li>Great razor,</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought it at a great price.</li>
            <li>and had great results.</li>
            <li>and it has great battery life.</li>
            <li>However, it did a great job shaving.  </li>
            <li>so that is great.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a great charge.  </li>
            <li>It has been great.</li>
            <li>This as you can imagine did not make me happy here</li>
            <li>thank goodness amazon has a great return policy</li>
            <li>This shaver does give the closest shave of any any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun for years and they are great shavers.  </li>
            <li>*Quality of the shave is great</li>
            <li>This was recommend to me and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Takes time to get used to but GREAT shave</li>
            <li>The description sounded great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great for sideburns and mustache and even the nose.  </li>
            <li>A great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>They have all been great and lasted almost forever.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning station is great.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, great customer service.</li>
            <li>the cleaning system seemed an overkill but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to the series 5-590cc from a series 3 primarily for the charging/cleaning station but the superb shave was also great!  </li>
            <li>It has been remarkable experience since I had Braun Series 5-590cc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed at the sleek handle design, which is more fashionable, away from Braun clean-cut design for 30 years, I have to adapt my taste to accept.</li>
            <li>Cleaning system works well and imparts a pleasant lemon aroma to the shaver.  </li>
            <li>is a great way to keep the razor clean and operating at its best.</li>
            <li>Good shaving system.</li>
            <li>Probably somewhat over priced but all in all a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this is a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li>You can see the difference in the blades by looking at them on the ends, but they both fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner is good.  </li>
            <li>Feels good on face</li>
            <li>I wanted to stay with Braun out of my 20 plus years of good shaves.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I am getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>razor is well built, extremely comfortable to use and does an excellent job of shaving.</li>
            <li>Gives a good close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>and I would not know what is a good level</li>
            <li>We have always had good luck with Braun products.</li>
            <li>Replace 51S with 30B cutter assembly - wonderful close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>loved it.  </li>
            <li>This goes to show you now days if you want to be treated fair</li>
            <li>fair price</li>
            <li>But after a week it is the best shave: smooth and effortless.</li>
            <li>Also, the semi-auto clean is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>He is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the series 5 razor.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I pulled the trigger, because I also received the newest version.</li>
            <li>and I am still very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the ease and effectiveness of the Braun Series 5-590cc.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great , a lot better than scraping my face with baldes.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but I still love it!</li>
            <li>Really great, easy to use shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best and certainly the easiest to take care of.</li>
            <li>and the difference was totally amazing.  </li>
            <li>It really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I got it as a deal of the day and Amazon screwed the pooch on shipping it, but the razor itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>-Sensitivity function is actually effective  </li>
            <li>the carrying case is nice but there is no room for the wall charger in it.</li>
            <li>Amazon does not accept it as a return because of the &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; it contains.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it,</li>
            <li>You cannot return this item as it contains hazardous materials (cleansing solution)</li>
            <li>But the best part is the smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>My Braun 7505 died after many good years of service.  </li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy.</li>
            <li>: I liked the trimmer on this shaver.</li>
            <li>Under Dieter Rams, the Braun name used to be synonymous with elegant and good design.</li>
            <li>This Series 5 gives a much closer shave and even does a great job on the neck!</li>
            <li>trimmer is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good shaver</li>
            <li>For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>The cleaning tank is a nice accessory, as is the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>It shaves nice and close with almost no irritation.  </li>
            <li>but it’s nice to know that the option is there.  </li>
            <li>Is it as good as razors costing over $100 more?  </li>
            <li>It’s nice to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>My friend kindly bought this as gift from Amazon, so I review it under my account after a week use.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li>The shaver just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective and it takes a lot of effort to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, on board indicators good.</li>
            <li>The shaver works quickly, does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning solution has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, like this brand</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>Now that I own this shaver, I am pleased to report that said power comb works.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor for over two months, I have to say this is by far the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>In addition to the night light, the series 5 gives a darn good shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor handles a 2-3 day growth much more effectively than my Series 3 Braun.  </li>
            <li>The first Braun Series 5 worked beautifully for 4 years and then stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li>Really good shaver does not quite get me totally smooth</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find the Series 5 and even more pleased when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the purchase and for 100 bucks, whats not to love!</li>
            <li>Back in the day Braun was a company that used great design to produce great products.</li>
            <li>good quality, well design, comfortable to use, better than  my philips.</li>
            <li>Awesome shaver, way better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>have great shaves from the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>Reviews were very accurate.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very smooth on the face, does not irritate my skin and</li>
            <li>It provides a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to use and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Cuts easy, cleans nice.</li>
            <li>Sent well packaged, super fast, and was an excellent transaction!</li>
            <li>Great German quality, shaves great and the cleaner and charger works super!</li>
            <li>This is quite simply the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li>The cleaning routine keeps the shaver in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I used the disposable razor most days.    </li>
            <li>Go for the cheaper models, they seem to work better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is much better than my previuos one (5000 serie).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the cleaning system seems to be OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>As a bonus my Braun came with the pocket razor for free, nice for traveling.</li>
            <li>I used a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li>but the more I used it, the more I wanted a Braun.</li>
            <li>and like i said its ok.</li>
            <li>So make sure you want it before you order it.</li>
            <li>It gets close to the skin and you can pop the top off and rinse it when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>Lights should have been more stylish    -</li>
            <li>I will contact Braun again and hope for the best, but reliability is important and thus far I have not had that with this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one more thing to stow somewhere, or take up precious counter top space.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been checking reviews, etc to try and determine the best shaver to replace my current one.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried... nothing.  </li>
            <li>I love the portability of taking the shaver when I travel on business.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of the cleaning feature, place it in the charger and press the cleaning button and walk away.</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun shaving products for the last 15 years and I am very happy with the quality, durability and function.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this shaver!</li>
            <li>I have used Braun Electric Shavers for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I did not want to settle for the bottom of the line nor pay for top of the line, so I chose the 550cc.</li>
            <li>If I put it in the corner of the counter, it is sort of ok.</li>
            <li>For me, I think it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s way of just making more money off the solution.</li>
            <li>I *LOVE</li>
            <li>I was not used to having a cleaning system with a charger, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Some shavers are better to me than others.</li>
            <li>Not the system itself so much, which works great, but two things about the system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find setting the sensitivity of the head to medium works best especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li>I would spill it and have to buy more refill cartridges.      </li>
            <li>I love the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>30B fits perfectly, colors are different.</li>
            <li>A better configuration.  </li>
            <li>And I wanted to love it--</li>
            <li>I love the foil style for accuracy</li>
            <li>Better yet go for the 550 or 560 if you don&#x27;t think you need the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Shaver does an excellent job at shaving short hairs on face.</li>
            <li>And then they wonder why the legendary Braun quality, design, longevity, service, or even the warranty period is vastly inferior to what it used to be.</li>
            <li>I concluded that some short-stubble roughness will remain, no matter how many times you repeat areas with the 590cc.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m guessing it will probably be able to deal with all stray hairs, if you take the time necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER</li>
            <li>I was able to sculpt my mustache with it, so it can be used for precision</li>
            <li>And their friends and associates will reinforce the notion that newer is always better, as this is the way people condition themselves to think.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would do a better job</li>
            <li>So I got this Braun, &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>However, if you have more than about three days of growth it tends to pull some of you hairs rather than cut them.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is just the particulars of my beard, but for me rotary is a lot better.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with the cleaning station, keeps things supper</li>
            <li>I love shaving with a razor</li>
            <li>but my face doesn&#x27;t love being shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll add more on this at the end).  </li>
            <li>I was not at all satisfied by the shaves</li>
            <li>I have had this Braun razor for about 2 weeks and while it is okay, it does not shave as close as the Norelco brands that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Guess I have to stick with the cheap (and effective trimmers for that).  </li>
            <li>(seems to cover more area).</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had many issues since,</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the recommended shaving instructions.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy and the product performs like a Braun!It has a very  close shave</li>
            <li>I expect much better from a $150 razor and this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Panasoinc</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a better shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find any better</li>
            <li>The trimmer accessory works significantly better than on cheaper versions too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>top it off, after just 6 months of use, the foil is torn.</li>
            <li>dislike this shaver more every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This (free!)</li>
            <li>There is a button on top that adjusts the tightness of the pivot on top</li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>For most of us, I’d give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li>and I love it ,</li>
            <li>so thats why i decided to try the Braun foil shave and glad i did.</li>
            <li>The complete fittings quality is great with very convenient handle is also very good charging time very quickly After use feeling very smooth face</li>
            <li>(somehow i plan on making my own blend of this or filtering and reusing the original blend)  </li>
            <li>the cleaner is nice to have to keep the machine clean.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can rinse the shaver head clean after you use it is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li>No skin burn nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun older 5 Series, &amp; I explained how Great these razors are.</li>
            <li>It is more affordable than comparable high-end models from other manufactures and provides excellent features and most importantly a very smooth and irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li>I am overly happy with my new Braun 590cc shaver and really glad I picked this model.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the Braun Series 5 shaver, because it gives me a good, clean, and quick shave.</li>
            <li>consistent and shaver in good working condition  - Shaver can be used while plugged in    </li>
            <li>This razor gives a great shave and the side burn trimer works much better than the trimmer on my old Braun.</li>
            <li>Works best on dry beard.  </li>
            <li>All of my past shavers have performed beautifully, and have given me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Like always very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>The station itself is cheap plastic (as are so many things now)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>but I would say it’s more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I always got a good, fast shave.    </li>
            <li>Great product and no regrets!!!</li>
            <li>Does a good job at giving me a pretty close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>He told me it is the best razor he has ever used to include two other Braun razors.</li>
            <li>It looks so cool!</li>
            <li>I feels like a cheap plastic toy you would find in a happy meal compared to my old 7540.</li>
            <li>and Easy</li>
            <li>and I am getting the results very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleaning system makes maintenance easy.  </li>
            <li>EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>Overall a great shaver, certainly better than the Philips Coolskin</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution seems to keep the shaver clean but you have to make sure you change the solution on time monthly</li>
            <li>easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning....</li>
            <li>Cuts as good as older unit and quieter.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I settled on this one after much research.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning is pretty nice, but it stills leaves some droppings inside the blade assembly that should be removed every week or so.  </li>
            <li>I really liked my Braun, at first...  </li>
            <li>It works OK, but for the money and the good reviews, I expected better than OK.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is fine for sideburns, neck har.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The shaver was fine -- what you&#x27;d expect from an electric.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you have never owned a Norelco, the Braun would be just fine.</li>
            <li>Women around me seem to be interested in me, I am experiencing heightened level of sex drive, and I am more confident at work.</li>
            <li>I locked mine in place and it works fine that way.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself did a fine job.</li>
            <li>The new model has a head replacement indicator light which should be good feature if indeed it does come on 18 months from now.</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, especially since the new version MSRPs for a lot more than 100 bucks.   </li>
            <li>It shaves really well, easy to clean, the cleaning station is really good, luckily I can close the cleaning capsule after use</li>
            <li>Set up was easy and straightforward.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, its clean and looks brand new.</li>
            <li>Coming from a Norelco rotary shaver years ago, this was a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Boy was this a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus over the panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is important to set to the closest position to get this effect.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this shaver for two weeks now and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I came from a relatively inexpensive Norelco to opt for this one hoping for really great shaves.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Braun Series 5; and, yes, it is smooth.  </li>
            <li>The reason why it is so smooth is you don&#x27;t get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>- Charge light blinks and is distracting.  </li>
            <li>Light and dependable.  </li>
            <li>NOT even close in fit or function.</li>
            <li>I called their service for repair, and they told me that they can replace the battery for free.</li>
            <li>The base/cleaning station was also a cheap gimmick, or so I thought.</li>
            <li>From the hype, I was expecting an effortless shave that came close to a manual razor, and gave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The 3d is smooth as silk, and will shave a 4 day beard faster than the braun will shave a 1 day beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I have a light beard if that is helpful.</li>
            <li>Both of them worked well, and depending on your facial hair, you will probably be happy with either.</li>
            <li>The 590cc shaver feels comfortable and secure in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have favored electric razors for the last 24 years and have owned a handful of models.</li>
            <li>Runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li>In all, good product so far.</li>
            <li>Because the old one was so good</li>
            <li>They were sold to Gillette and then P&amp;G, to profit off of the good reputation that was created in the 20th century by Braun&#x27;s top world class engineers.</li>
            <li>By charging it every day, it reduces the battery life, as the batteries are only good for so many charges.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system on the brauns are also far superior.  </li>
            <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I might try the cleaning system once a month or longer, but right now I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The Series 5 is even better because you have a cleaning solution station built right in the charger holder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would be just as happy with the other unit.    </li>
            <li>THANKS !!!</li>
            <li>I get clean comfortable</li>
            <li>Results in a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The new desing is better but this one is still okay.</li>
            <li>The original blades lasted over two years.</li>
            <li>-Long battery life (great for camping)  </li>
            <li>A significant improvement has been made in the cleaning method.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First shave - Amazingly close on the face, I could have spent more time under the chin to  get it smoother, but it was still ok.  </li>
            <li>I must say I am not disappointed,</li>
            <li>I was excited when I ordered this shaver.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in the self cleaning feature but all of the better models have it</li>
            <li>pretty sure the battery just gave out.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the original head had finer/smaller openings and the replacement foil head had \\&quot;larger\\&quot; openings.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li>My first self cleaning Braun razor lasted 20 years and the series 5 razor gives an even better, closer shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver and the stand had both changed designs significantly.  </li>
            <li>As long as I shaved every day, they were great.  </li>
            <li>It feels very nice in my hand when shaving as it&#x27;s handle is more ergonomic than the previous geneation.  </li>
            <li>I like having a clean shaver every morning.</li>
            <li>More easily fits the hand than the older versions.</li>
            <li>The renew clean unit is quieter.  </li>
            <li>Provides a quick, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I charge and clean my shaver once a week.  </li>
            <li>The clean station works well.</li>
            <li>and I use the brush included to clean up during the week.</li>
            <li>You can also clean the shaver manually and instructions are included to show you how to do this so using the cleaning stand is not mandatory</li>
            <li>Surgeons use that stuff to clean their hands after all.</li>
            <li>I think they tried to improve the clean and charge station, which no longer has the arm that can break.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>overall very happy with product and far exceeds my expectations of an electric razor.</li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean.</li>
            <li>just clean it every weekend, the cleaning cartridge lasts longer</li>
            <li>So now it doesn&#x27;t charge or clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and smooth, keeps it charge longer and cleans up well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have had two different rotary shavers and this is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a student and had more time and money, I would spring for a straight razor kit (professional) or a safety razor kit (enthusiast) for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li>With $80, I can 100% certain that I can buy a much better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li>/liquid has become clogged and I can&#x27;t seem to clean it well enough for him to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>good basic electric shaver, get it at bed,bath,and beyond to get a discount.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, optional system works well</li>
            <li>For most people, by the time they need a new cutter head in two years, they&#x27;ll be convinced by the latest P&amp;G marketing that they have to have the latest bells &amp; whistles gadgets or shiny colours in the new line of shavers.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected, Very pleased with thlis purchase.</li>
            <li>You can eventually get a good shave with this razor, but you will go over and over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>Full  </li>
            <li>The good news is that I have been able to go for a week without charging so on short trips the wall charger probably isn&#x27;t really needed anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Braun 5510 for many years and it always gave a very close shave</li>
            <li>Cut OK on my face but never did very well on my neck.</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, it gives as good a shave as any electric</li>
            <li>It does a good job above the neck, but that has never been the issue.</li>
            <li>- Shaver is solid, ergonomic, and has good power.  </li>
            <li>and I imagine most people will find it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the Norelco Arcitec, it shaves much faster and does a better job on the neck.      </li>
            <li>The end that plugs into the wall sticks straight out from the wall more than 3 inches.</li>
            <li>so the old one fit more comfortably in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am over seventy years of age and have done a lot of shaving with a full face of hair.</li>
            <li>Does not do as well with longer growth hairs, will pull hairs and will require multiple passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d done research for 2 solid days on these things, and I read all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is overall a good electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner also allows for a much faster and better clean-up.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would get such a good shave from an electric.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the middle sensitivity level and it seems to be producing good results.</li>
            <li>It took me the full 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can shop around for the most reasonable price on the cleaner that helps also.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use it to shave ,worth the price under 100 dollars.</li>
            <li>a-full-beard-by-4:30-anyway gentlemen with a full sprout</li>
            <li>It makes for a comfortable shave in all the right places.     </li>
            <li>It is generally nice and I like the blue light in the self clean system.</li>
            <li>-Quick</li>
            <li>Maybe not as close as with a real razor but close enough to make me happy</li>
            <li>Its okay. should have paid the extra $20 and gotten the better one</li>
            <li>Lucky I kept it.</li>
            <li>(I returned that unit under their 45-day money back guarantee) with this unit and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and shaves as close as you could expect for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Again, same great, close, fast shave, but with convenience of cordless.</li>
            <li>Thereis no substitute for good old barbersol and a straight mach 3 or quattro, etc etc.  </li>
            <li>The shaver feels comfortable and solid in the hand and looks nice.</li>
            <li>I have been a Loyal Braun user for 20 years</li>
            <li>Unlike my rotary and my last (cheaper) shaver of this type, this gets a close and nearly perfect shave with only a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to this I had the best braun shaver (whichever the highest series was back in 2001).  </li>
            <li>Is “Contour Hugging Head Shaver” worthy of capitalization?  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of other brands of razors that I don&#x27;t use because Braun by far, is the best!</li>
            <li>and I’d say that were accurate if I had noted how it felt the first time and attempted to tally any differences in the feel.  </li>
            <li>So far for me, purchasing more cleaning kits has not been costly since I&#x27;m still using the original cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Braun Shaver and once again I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I got the new one and have been extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new one from Amazon and was pleased with the ease of ordering process and shipping.  </li>
            <li>AMAZON THANKS FOR MAKING IT EASY TO GET THE PRODUCTS I WANT .</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Gives me a really close shave,very easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted a shaver with a cleaning system at first, but now that I have it I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I am very surprised that is seems to work better than a blade ( Mach 3).  </li>
            <li>Exactly What my brother wanted!</li>
            <li>It provides a close quick shave, it is smooth not irritating my skin</li>
            <li>When I am done shaving, I run the head under hot water as the instructions say, and I find that it is just as clean as using the cleaning solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the new opti-foil shaver head is so far so good compared with old 8585, I still need more time to tell the on-going performance and durability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 590 did fine on my face, but did seem to require more passes than the 7 series for the same closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t owned the razor very long, I think it&#x27;s probably fine to manually clean it most of the time and use the cleaning system once a week or so.</li>
            <li>He was using an old Norelco before and this was a huge upgrade for him!</li>
            <li>and I can get a very close, smooth shave, it just takes longer to achieve that than with shave cream and a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cut much faster and more precisely than the old 5561, without giving me razor burn.</li>
            <li>I found this electric razor to be much more effective on my beard as I don&#x27;t shave everyday.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts, it&#x27;ll be worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I must say it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This, however, seems to be as good as could be reasonably expected.  </li>
            <li>Shaving not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old Norelco rotary shaver does better on the neckline than this shaver.</li>
            <li>Thus extending the useful life of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>Well, most important, the designated repairer is not a Braun entity, they farm it out, and the person had only a passing familiarity with the product.</li>
            <li>To me it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My old razor&#x27;s battery technology was BETTER?</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not as wide and close to shaver as the 590cc but does a good job.</li>
            <li>and so far, I love it.     </li>
            <li>The unit runs cooler than my prior unit, so that is nice.  </li>
            <li>I would finally have a really nice electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Upgrading from a tiny mobile shaver to something more advanced.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco rotary did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It’s also made more comfortable by the cleaning system which, though I thought to be a scam initially, actually seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li>It is far better.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good,reliable and not bad for $60.00.i</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my new shaver, the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my old razor Norelco.</li>
            <li>No electric razor is perfect, but this one comes closer to perfection for me than any other Braun or Norelco I have used over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my face felt soft and smooth instead of the sleek and smooth feeling I got from the Gillette.</li>
            <li>It not only gives a great shave, but it does so even after 2 or 3 days without shaving, when my whiskers are much longer than normal.</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li>And right from the start</li>
            <li>And I can trust the machine doing it right.</li>
            <li>The new one is easy to use with a close shave.</li>
            <li>It does feel clean every time, I’ll say that much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does one judge the value of an electric razor?  </li>
            <li>, I primarily leave the sensitivity high or medium.</li>
            <li>and I must say it is the best one yet of the 2 that I previously owned prior to this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s excellent; it cuts as close as a blade shave, at least for me, it is smooth and, with three swivel head settings, it shaves all areas of the face equally well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t control the three wheels as accurately as my Braun prior, and overall felt the quality of the shave just wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>cheap 10 year old norelco with an aging original blade can shave a multi-day growth as fast as it will shave a 1 day growth.  </li>
            <li>My new Braun Series 5-590cc is a fantastic electric shaver to.  </li>
            <li>and the shaver must be in exactly the right position to activate the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>My last Braun one was a 9595 pulsonic model and it was great compared to the Norelco I had prior to it.</li>
            <li>Runs much quieter and seems to cut better at a lower RPM than my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, the clean and renew fluid is kind of a ripoff -- if you use it as much as the manufacturer suggests (every day, all the time), that&#x27;s about an extra $75 a year; one more expense I really don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>I was even able to gently go over the still sore area on my throat where I developed razor burn the day before.</li>
            <li>I bought this item in June 2014 after had great luck with my last 2 Braun razors which lasted 5 and 7 years respectively.  </li>
            <li>The holder is huge and glows a blue light.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a nicely made razor, and feels good in my hand, though perhaps a little long.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd new Braun shaver and I am very pleased with the shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li>love the ways it shaves - much closer than older braun shavers - pivoting head is good - I only use the fancy cleaning system every couple of weeks - keep the fluid container covered the rest of the time and just recharge with the cord</li>
            <li>very much like this razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good,I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Always liked my Philips shavers, never fussed with them, and they did the job on my fine (not coarse) facial hair, without bother.</li>
            <li>The new shaver has given me close clean shaves comparable to a multi-blade saftey razor.  </li>
            <li>-Self-cleaning function is loud and could be problematic for light sleepers in a nearby room.  </li>
            <li>First I will admit that I have noticed that the cleaning does seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I do NOT use it daily as suggested, but once a week seems to be OK.</li>
            <li>I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li>I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this model, instead of one $24 cheaper, is it seemed like it was better.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is very well made, which is a breath of fresh air these days.</li>
            <li>He had great luck with it, so he gave me one for Christmas in the late 1980s.</li>
            <li>The price is steep, more than double the entry Norelco or Braun.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient!  </li>
            <li>first change is that the body is longer and narrower.</li>
            <li>For my face and skin, it&#x27;s pretty close to a razor.</li>
            <li>The shave is actually better and the various functions are no longer in one switch.  </li>
            <li>first I bought a competitors three-circle-wheel style razor.  </li>
            <li>If you use it daily then this razor won&#x27;t be a problem, but if you go more than a day....</li>
            <li>At first your skin might turn reddish and become irritated but this will subside as your skin adapts to it.</li>
            <li>I have had it for three months now and am not sorry that I bought it.</li>
            <li>(The real Braun company used to offer 3 years on their shavers!).</li>
            <li>So for the razor, I did my research and ended up purchasing the 590cc and also tried my dads razor for about a week which is a higher end norelco.</li>
            <li>Very well done!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that does the job, you should be able to get one at $50, they are all the same.</li>
            <li>For some reason though it just can&#x27;t shave my neck consistently.  </li>
            <li>First off, don&#x27;t expect manual razor blade results, but the shaves are pretty close.</li>
            <li>Shaving my lower jaw/upper neck area takes awhile with several passes over to thoroughly shave, but it sure beats getting cuts.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because my love in my life didn&#x27;t like my facial hair.</li>
            <li>unlike I did my first month owning it.</li>
            <li>Does it make everything simple and better?</li>
            <li>My first shave was exellent and have had it a week</li>
            <li>I have had many different models.</li>
            <li>I hope and pray the new 7 series performs as well or better than the old.</li>
            <li>NOT recommended, there is better available for less $$.</li>
            <li>Ok, well the alcohol dip is a nice feature but at the same time I’m not aware of electric razors being a breeding zone for Ebola or the Hanta virus.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant because the picture shows the older version (gen. 1) and recently many people said they received the old version but others mentioned they received the newest version (gen 4).</li>
            <li>Braun does offer a pretty decent trial period so that might be worth taking advantage of if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li>It has a nice trimmer and some how it manages to get those stray wiskers that can elude other shavers.</li>
            <li>I actually use it to trim my hairline often times because it is a bit more gentle than my hair clippers on my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>biggest hesitation before purchasing was whether the extra money really does translate into any better performance.</li>
            <li>While I can agree to the positive reviews to some extent, its not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This shaving product is very smooth, dont feel dry after shave.</li>
            <li>Of the so many models that Braun offers (in fact too many models) it took me a few days to decide which one to get</li>
            <li>Eventually, I was able to get some areas of my face smooth enough that no stubble was felt when brushing upward against my face with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>very good,my first braun shaver</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the differences really became evident.  </li>
            <li>Well, Braun did slightly better with the long whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Close clean shave, the powerful but quiet motor works</li>
            <li>The most serious competition came when my wife purchased a top of the line Panasonic.</li>
            <li>ever shave popping the foil and head of giving them a nice rinse and pat down and dusting out the razor chamber then re-assembling and running through the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>It feels like it is doing the job and its very easy on sensitive skin, but the shave just isn&#x27;t close enough.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting hairs the first time as apposed to my previous razor that took multiple passes.</li>
            <li>Finally, the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; system leaves the shaver feeling like new for the next shave, which is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have used every method of shaving known to man;every new type of blade, &amp; hundreds of $&#x27;s worth of all brands of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>The alcohol-based cleaner of the brauns always makes the shaver smell fresh and new, each day.  </li>
            <li>Well, first of all the shaver is a terrific night light for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does not go in and out as easily as the last one did.</li>
            <li>The unit arrived nicely boxed with a semi-hard black zippered travel case which is not mentioned in the literature.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had the shaver long enough to tell if it was a good</li>
            <li>I certainly wont be cleaning it every day.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the Dieter Rams era post-modernist design, and the amazing heavy solid build quality of this precision machine that was the Classic Braun 5561.</li>
            <li>In addition, this shaver is much quieter and has gentler vibration than my last one, but still gets the job done easily.  </li>
            <li>for I have found it far superior to any of the previously owned electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I like about the Braun, since I also shave my head, is the fact that it handles everything from the stiffest beard to the fine hairs on the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using Braun for the past 5-6 years, this Series 5 590c is a significant difference, for the better.  </li>
            <li>And honestly, compared to most men I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, so it should be easy for this shaver to take care of - but it fails.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I replaced the heads many times, simply because they were not clean or lubricated.</li>
            <li>He loves the three blade across, says it gives a much closer shave, and works great for his tough beard.</li>
            <li>The device works very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Eventually I took to having a manual razor and shaving cream for days when I didn&#x27;t have much time.  </li>
            <li>-Very</li>
            <li>and I started getting very close shaves.</li>
            <li>but this makes my life much easier.</li>
            <li>The Remington gave a noticeably much closer shave.</li>
            <li>This is the most $$ I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>If you are the type that doesn&#x27;t shave every day then this razor is not for you as it does not handle longer hairs very well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like braun&#x27;s vibration.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expect too much when transferred from Philips.</li>
            <li>Nothing really stands out for this shaver.</li>
            <li>They should have used stainless steel or something much cooler looking to match the shaver.    </li>
            <li>On the whole, I like the shaver</li>
            <li>It is lighter and is slighty curved along the verticle axis, which makes it much easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>I SHAVE DAILY AND LIKE A CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE .</li>
            <li>Gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>gentle on the face with no razor burn</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t compare to the 8995.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommned!</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I must say I was also very hesitant to spend so much because I had 3 Remington foil MS3 electric razors that retailed at maybe $50 max.</li>
            <li>but it really does work.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to decide on this Braun after all I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a shaver.</li>
            <li>Besides, I didn&#x27;t want to open the sealed cartridge filled with cleaning solution for fear</li>
            <li>The User Guide recommends cleaning the unit after each shave or when the yellow LED light comes on.</li>
            <li>The yellow \\&quot;time to clean\\&quot; light never came on so after a month, I cleaned the shaver anyway.</li>
            <li>I have owned Braun Shavers in the past and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>It can provide a reasonably close shave comparable to a razor blade</li>
            <li>I had to shave every day for my employment, and that was a chore I really dreaded.</li>
            <li>Self cleaning station/charger works very well.</li>
            <li>People judge the Braun company of today by the reputation that was built when they really were Braun.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky, so that&#x27;s high praise!  </li>
            <li>Charges fast.</li>
            <li>So I decided to send a very pointed email to Braun to give them a written form of my disgust in their lack of customer service and how I felt about how they should have to put out the money for shipping since it was their lack of quality control that caused this situation.</li>
            <li>When the skin can&#x27;t press in against the foils, it really doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t we just purchase a foil screen when needed at a reasonable price?</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave and the cleaning system</li>
            <li>I absolutely regret purchasing this shaver.</li>
            <li>The head swivels but not as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>provides a close comfortable shave, as well as sleek styling and solid feel.</li>
            <li>cons:  doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much face as a triple head  </li>
            <li>He took it, in the case it came with, to work with him for a whole week before he brought it home to charge.</li>
            <li>Rotary razors scratch my face too much, so I wanted to stick with a foil-top.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>but I did not expect as it usualy takes a barbar and straight razor for that,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Not only is it noisy and vibrate too much (far more than the clippers used by my hair stylist) but it grabs and pulls the whiskers, which really hurts.  </li>
            <li>Is “not for sale in Catalina Island” really a product feature?  </li>
            <li>Shout out to my friends from college that listened to waaaay too much Phish.  </li>
            <li>Or rather made ME listen to waaaay too much Phish.)  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>Too boot, when it broke recently, amazon replaced it free of charge.</li>
            <li>Not that big a deal, just recharge it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!thanks a lot</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first couple times but now it runs slow and makes an odd humming sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun for more than 10 years, this is my 3rd and always trying to upgrade the previous one, not for malfuntioning just because i wanted a new one :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item was factory sealed, new and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the old Panasonic particularly in those areas where, if your growth is at all like mine, you have hairs sprouting in different directions.  </li>
            <li>At night, the cleaning station gives off a small blue light which is nice should you have to find the unit without turning on the lights.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>especially if you let your beard go too many days, you could pop up the trimmer, and lay the razor at the right angle to let it cut the long hairs, afterwhich the foil part would shave the stubble.</li>
            <li>I also have a Remington micro-screen and get a faster and much closer shave with fewer strokes with the older Remington.  </li>
            <li>The Clean &amp; Renew station for the Series 5 is of exceptionally low quality construction and reliability.  </li>
            <li>The head and cutter is washable under running water and if that&#x27;s not enough, you can use the Clean &amp; Renew System.</li>
            <li>However, there is no way to clean the shaver without charging it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a clean shave everytime I use it,cleaning after usage is very simple.</li>
            <li>Of course, the  cleaning solution does cost quite a bit of money, but I&#x27;d rather spend extra money to keep my unit clean with their alcohol solution than just rinsing my unit under tap water.</li>
            <li>First inspections show it comes with a good travel case, but I was dismayed that the removable blade housing is made of flimsy, thin plastic.</li>
            <li>Though my facial hair will kil a $12 dollar disposable in 2 shaves so it is overall more economical for old Iron beard here, MWS Barbar trips and disposables.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in how well it shaves from one time to the next and extends the time when I think I may need to get a new shaving head for it.  </li>
            <li>Good shave, wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li>, the charger has a function that stops charging once it&#x27;s full for an hour, so essentially you can leave it on the charger (which doubles as the cleaner) when it&#x27;s not in use without worrying about the battery losing its memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I mean is as far as an electric razor, I think it is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>One customer review claimed that it “felt like a new razor every time!”</li>
            <li>with those two things mentioned, I really like my new razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li>For folk who have the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; of not having to shave everyday, this razor does a great job with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>This works better and cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li>So is it better than electric razors costing $75 less?  </li>
            <li>I have not yet had to replace the cleaning cartridge, but the cartridge itself is the same as my former shaver, so I was able to use already purchased cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The more expensive one has many geek features.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery life is listed as 45 minutes while my older Braun had a supposed life of 60 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This razor is a piece of junk compared to the older razors.</li>
            <li>Purchased this model to replace an older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Coming from an older model Braun now.</li>
            <li>But to achieve that I had to do many passes over the same area, and this was over several shaving sessions that evening.</li>
            <li>If it does even a comparable job, then I&#x27;ll go with the older model and return this one.</li>
            <li>I have owned several Braun shavers, including most recently a 7680.  </li>
            <li>after trying many types of electric razors, finally one that I can use daily and without irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the service and support I have received from Braun and particularly Amazon, I will not hesitate to buy Braun products from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This shaver does not meet my expectations because it does not shave as close as my older products.  </li>
            <li>If so, why is it only worthy once?  </li>
            <li>I had an older Braun</li>
            <li>The new stand is very light and no longer provides the options for power savings and in depth cleaning of the previous shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was similar to this but was the VERY first generation &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; system.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is a bit high.  </li>
            <li>The razor FEELS like a high quality device, but the design is not.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>The cool blue glow from the LED that illuminates the cleaning solution level makes it easy to find the bathroom in the dark.  </li>
            <li>The only negative I have is that the shaver could do a better job on neck hairs, but does as good a job as any other electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My Panasonic foil-top was older than I remember, so I needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>After my last one, which was a low-end disappointment, this one is great -- as smooth of a shave as I believe you can get from an electric.</li>
            <li>This electric razor does dry shave like a child eating eating ice cream, clean and gone in seconds.</li>
            <li>After one-week use, I came to conclude can neither clean to my satisfaction nor dry the shaver within 2 hours.</li>
            <li>And the Remington lasted barely more than a year (WITH a few blade &amp; screen changes along the way).</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic did at least as good a job and is presently considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li>curiosity got the better of me about a month ago - I tried replenishing the cleaning cartridge with Sea Breeze, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the Braun fluid; the Sea Breeze contains water whereas I don&#x27;t believe the Braun fluid does.</li>
            <li>The shaver feels so much better than any Remington, even when it had 3 blades and the Braun has 2 with the middle long wiskar cutter.</li>
            <li>powerful enough and never worry about your shaving problem.</li>
            <li>Braun just needs to go back to making quality products that are worth the price they charge for them.  </li>
            <li>I usually purchased the mid to high-end models and had good results.</li>
            <li>Overall quality and workmanship are the same as old Braun, it is manufactured by those who commit themselves and love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I would have said that the fisherman either started the first tours or invented the first glass-bottomed boat since the statement as-is implies that prior to 1896, tours didn’t exist which I’m almost positive that they did.  </li>
            <li>The only thing they got right is the trimmer</li>
            <li>The wall adapter for my Norelco is a right angle arrangement that is only 3/4 inch tall when plugged in.</li>
            <li>A red line appeared right across my throat, followed by a burny sensation.</li>
            <li>My last Braun worked fine for 15 years until it needed a new battery for the charge to last more than a few days.</li>
            <li>As long as Braun makes shavers I wouldn&#x27;t own any other.</li>
            <li>I figure if I cut my usage by using the cleaning fluid only about once a week, that&#x27;s fine with</li>
            <li>It’s comfortable to use with finger notches in the side like you might find on the grip of a handgun or some other manly object with finger notches.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and since Braun is a name I associate with quality, I bought this razor.    </li>
            <li>New body style is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks to get used to the new ergonomic streamlined handle and flex-head adjustment switch, but I am adapting well.  </li>
            <li>I followed the advise of those that said you need to acclimate your beard to a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver out of hopes that the Braun name would live up to their quality and price hype.</li>
            <li>I bought a new replacement head, and some of the foil strips came off after a month.</li>
            <li>I will post review of new 7 series.</li>
            <li>After cleaning the razor, it feels like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>and now i find myself shopping for a new razor...</li>
            <li>will buy the 1987 Braun 3525 model (new in box), then see how that compares.</li>
            <li>This option made no since, why would I pay the price of a new item and get a refurbished item plus pay shipping three times.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m switching to a new norelco 3d.  </li>
            <li>so I started my quest to find a new one.     </li>
            <li>I purchased this as I had a promotional certificate to use on Amazon and needed a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I think this shaver is new to the Braun line-up.  </li>
            <li>, I could see new 5 series (cassette head design) was launched in Europe and replaced this 5 series.</li>
            <li>and it makes the inside look brand new.</li>
            <li>The feel on the skin is much smoother, unit feels very good and solid in your hand, its not missing much of the hair when cutting.    </li>
            <li>So I bought the Braun 590cc to see how the new crop of shavers compared to my old classic Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot; IN NAME</li>
            <li>Also, the cleaning fluid level is no longer a set of LEDs but a light shining on the internal plastic tank.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much but not as much as my old Braun because the old one charging/cleaning stand has lights indicating when and how much the cleaning is needed as well as how much cleaning fluid is left where as the 5-590cc&#x27;s charging/cleaning only has a light that lights up the bottom to manually see how much solution is left.  </li>
            <li>So coming from another Braun, the difference is very clear.    </li>
            <li>If your bathroom door opens directly to your bedroom, be aware that the LED light on the charging base is obnoxiously bright at night.</li>
            <li>I normally would not have considered paying as much for a razor, burt at my age, I felt I had finally deserved a chance to try a highly rated shaver.</li>
            <li>While the Braun shaver is not the top of the line, it is quite an improvement from the Braun shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned this to a friend and he&#x27;d had the exact same experience switching from Norelco to Braun.     </li>
            <li>So, now I  have a shaver that works pretty well and several bottles of unusable cleaning liquid.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Braun Razor, the first one latex over 8 years.</li>
            <li>The battery lasted nearly 14 years!</li>
            <li>(the first follow-up call they still said it needed to take 2-3 weeks to send it back to me).</li>
            <li>When I use it daily it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I, like many of the other reviewers, have tried various brands and style of electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether 7 series will be better.</li>
            <li>They’re all pretty similar.  </li>
            <li>I’m not sure it’s THAT much more convenient for me to drop this razor into a charging cradle than it is to plug in a cord.  </li>
            <li>I was using an old Braun series 1 and rather than buy a new head and cutters I decided to go with a new razor.</li>
            <li>But absolutely none of them had the weight, solid feel or materials and build quality of my classic Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Well, to my surprise, my new Braun 590cc model isn&#x27;t even pulsonic and it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model did.</li>
            <li>They last a long time; they&#x27;re really comfortable to shave with</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only cleaned the unit 3 times and only because I thought it was time to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor didn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as the first one and there have been numerous complaints about the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>But so far, after almost 3 years of almost daily use this things is going just like the first day that I got it and was shaving.</li>
            <li>I then bought this more expensive one, and it did as well, although not nearly as often (and it seems to be getting better).  </li>
            <li>but it was easier to get a new one that get the old one fixed.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s quiet (compared to my old Remington), and gives me smooth, dry close shaves.</li>
            <li>First I thought well at least their service was good disregard the poor quality, however, after one month of waiting after mailing the product back to them on my own money, they told me that it needs $80 for replacing the battery on my second following call.</li>
            <li>, they might be little bit pricey, but they last for many years, if you take care of them.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on the Braun shavers and was a little concerned about the inital price and the cost of the cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>close shave (gets all those hard to reach hairs and more)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a dull hum.</li>
            <li>But just to get a close shave, I had to go over areas many times, and often press hard against my skin (which you&#x27;re not supposed to do).</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but I think the designers could have done a better job of fabricating a base that was a little more in fitting with the price/look of the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back straight away and have been using my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>second change is that the motor does not run as fast as the old one did.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need the features of the 7 series, as compared to the 590, but I was surprised how different the two shavers performed.  </li>
            <li>Still see clear roots of beards.</li>
            <li>I had to wash it under water then insert to clean, finally remove foil to dry.</li>
            <li>I have always used Braun and turned to Braun when my old razor died.  </li>
            <li>However, the quality of my shaves has not been affected and comparing it with my old Braun screen</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a closer shave than my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>He has had it for a month so far and</li>
            <li>He even has sensitive skin but the switch between razors wasn&#x27;t a problem</li>
            <li>end cleaned it out once, but it was clear that the end was near.</li>
            <li>I actually worried that they would damage my hearing (they might even be partly responsible for my tinnitus - who knows???).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry at all about using it near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my skin so sensitive that when I shaved before going to bed my face was still hurting in the morning.</li>
            <li>I miss the fluid level indicator in the cleaning reservoir, but that may still be available on the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>Had a 360 complete before this and it lasted over 8 years.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get my series 3985 fixed and Braun suggested this.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun (I think it was the 6552) died after *</li>
            <li>My old Braun had a snap over plasic cover.  </li>
            <li>It would have added 10 cents to the cost to include such a plastic cover, and I&#x27;d much rather have it than some bulky box with air, or a color brochure that I throw</li>
            <li>my old Braun?  </li>
            <li>of coarse it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model even though my old 9595 pulsonic model gave a really close shave.     </li>
            <li>AND A VERY CLOSE SHAVE, WENT BACK</li>
            <li>In the early 1990s, they came out with the cordless models, so bought one.</li>
            <li>Going up the side of my ear requires all kinds of maneuvers to get the hair next to my earlobe (or maybe it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t cut very well period).</li>
            <li>I think with the rebate it makes the intial cost reasonable and you shouldn&#x27;t worry about the cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old.</li>
            <li>Panasonic will be my next shaver, real soon.</li>
            <li>However, I had a problem getting parts for my old Remington so decided to bite the bullet.</li>
            <li>One of the early concerns I had before purchasing the unit was the added cost of cleaning the unit using the Clean&amp;Renew Station and cleaning solution as often as Braun recommends.</li>
            <li>Gives a close professional shave.</li>
            <li>The only razor that really got the job done in a timely manner was a razor blade.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars but my old 3 series head gives a closer shave</li>
            <li>Braun, I don&#x27;t know what you were thinking when you developed this shaver.  </li>
            <li>But the Braun really only wants to shave a one day growth...  </li>
            <li>While the end result is similar, the Braun is much faster so thats</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been exclusively using straight foil-type shavers for the last 8-10 years.</li>
            <li>I had to use my old Braun 1775 to finish areas on my chin and neck</li>
            <li>the cleaning fluid is used up fast</li>
            <li>It ends up looking like a 10 year old on a mower - patches everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have needed to replace my old electric razor (rotary) for some time.</li>
            <li>This model never had the battery life of my 7 year old model 8585.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and I&#x27;ve had a bunch of shavers.</li>
            <li>but then as I said I&#x27;m old and shake and then there are the wrinkles that somehow cause cuts.</li>
            <li>I consider my skin to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The Catalina Island website also has, under the “Media &amp; Filming” section, a sub-section of “Story Ideas” just in case, as a budding filmmaker, you have the budget and equipment to film on Catalina, but no thoughts on what to film.  </li>
            <li>Its arrival time might be scheduled after dealers run out of old inventory.</li>
            <li>Safe to say I have sensitive skin, and this trimmer was not kind to it, when I used it to mow my months of beard growth (against the grain).</li>
            <li>it got a nice, close shave without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a somewhat thick growth of facial hair, and this shaver gave me a nice and close shave.</li>
            <li>I was wrongly mislead by the good reviews posted on this item.</li>
            <li>The charging station cleaner does a decent job, but I usually manually clean it out semi-regularly with a brush as well.    </li>
            <li>I have long been a rotary shaver user, but I bought this shaver around 2 years ago to see if it is any better than the previous norelco&#x27;s I have used.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small travel case and is easy to shave on-the-go.</li>
            <li>It did take a week of shaving with the new razor for the face to get used to the new shaving technique (rotary blades shave differently).</li>
            <li>I really like the form, fit and feel of this new shaver however, despite using the clean and lubricate system daily, the shaver started pulling wiskers out instead on cutting them after 5 months.</li>
            <li>My last razor older 8000</li>
            <li>You can even use same cleaner cartridges as with older renew&#x27;/charge bases.</li>
            <li>My other option was to ship it back and get a refund for the purchase price, they would not pay for the price of the original shipping or for me to ship the faulty shaver to them.</li>
            <li>had an older and lesser model from Braun before and it died...</li>
            <li>For that price, though, I really should have just gotten my previous model which was:    Braun Syncro Smart Logic Shaving System, Model 7526</li>
            <li>very reliable has not broken down on me yet and charges well.</li>
            <li>I live in western NC--about as far away as you can get and still be in the Carolinas.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a cheap gimmick and just made the razor less solid and well built.</li>
            <li>and I must have some super tough facial hair as I haft to replace the head and foil about every forty-five days even though I clean it welllk after</li>
            <li>Was happy with my old Braun, but finally got to a point where the unit wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the motor was straining when cutting a heavier beard.    </li>
            <li>I started with my chin and throat, and noticed the shaver was not rough on my sensitive skin face.</li>
            <li>My husbands face feels so smooth now and there are NO MORE cut marks or stubby bumps caused by those dern blades.</li>
            <li>Battery would go a couple weeks of every other day use without a recharge, AND I could plug it in and keep shaving if the battery ran down :-).</li>
            <li>In hind sight I should have returned it immediately, but in the beginning it was lasting long enough for a weeks worth of shaves (my 7 year old 8585 model still holds its charge for 2 weeks at a time).</li>
            <li>Sounds a little big, should follow the direction with the beard, slightly less convenient, overall is good.</li>
            <li>I have now retired this model in favor of a brand new Norelco--which has a similar self cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I persuaded them to send me a new cleaning element which they finally did.</li>
            <li>Solution was to buy the new series 7 and wife opted for series 5 for Xmas present.</li>
            <li>I am going back to Panasonic for my new shaver.</li>
            <li>The support person, took the information, located the sales data, and said the new shaving unit would arrive 5 days later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that having your shaver sit in a bath of dirty denatured alcohol that&#x27;s been stagnating in your bathroom for 2 months, is somehow better than cleaning it under fresh running water.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a year now, and I hate it more and more every day.  </li>
            <li>the battery would last nearly seven days!  </li>
            <li>; thought I was going to have to go back to blades when I couldn&#x27;t reorder parts for my 5-year old 3612!</li>
            <li>Im the type who does alot of research before any major purchase, and</li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers since I purchased my first one in 1967, and have never used any other.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost and expensive bathroom counter space, but it does make the razor smell good.</li>
            <li>However if my thick beard gets more than a day long, this shaver really takes a lot longer to get the long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first couple shaves I was skeptical as getting a good shave was not easy at all.</li>
            <li>But I had dropped it a few times, the battery was not holding a charge much anymore, and it was just older Braun technology.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it is expensive and for optimum performance needs supplies for the clean and renew system.</li>
            <li>Except I would expect plastic dog doody to fare better if dropped over a hard bathroom tile floor than any of these thin cheap brittle plastic hi-tech pieces of disposable trash.</li>
            <li>Clear Skin  Facial Hair:</li>
            <li>The battery in the model barely lasts 3 days, and I don&#x27;t see God when I shave with it.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the head had another row or two for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>The series 5 is a marked improvement over my last Braun and over the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>When my old Braun electric shaver died after almost three years of faithful service, I began searching the net for its replacement.  </li>
            <li>tried my old plastic cover, but its around 2 millimeters too short on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The width is about the same as the old shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I WOULD GO BACK SHAVING WITH A BLADE TO GET THE CLOSE SHAVE I WANTED , BUT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND WOULD GET CUTS EVERY SHAVE .</li>
            <li>I also am curious if the cleaning solution causes my skin to break out, but hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I picked this unit over the Series 5 570 because as far as I could tell, the only difference were the LED lights.</li>
            <li>The head is the same as the old one</li>
            <li>But I recently tried foil shavers when on a whim, I picked up an old Braun 5561, from a Goodwill store.</li>
            <li>A far cry from the solid steel and acrylic housing that covers the blade on my 5561.</li>
            <li>After my old Braun shaver finally wore out, I knew I wanted another Braun.  </li>
            <li>Closer shave, shorter time to remove hair, especially on the sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li>expected a much closer shave</li>
            <li>It seems inevitable Braun quits their old cutter/foil design.</li>
            <li>I HAVE OWNED MANY ELECTRIC SHAVERS , BUT WAS NEVER HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS .</li>
            <li>and I would not pay full price for this because I&#x27;m not sure what the cleaning mode does,</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and keep ready for use with the charger/cleaner base.</li>
            <li>This Braun 5-590 is OK but not great.</li>
            <li>I cheat and only clean it every other day and thus make the cleaning fluid last longer.</li>
            <li>norelco is less expensive and gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review again later based on how the new razor performs, but at least Amazon handled the issue quickly.</li>
            <li>I like that you can rinse it off with hot water and only use the cleaning solution every other week or so.</li>
            <li>fourth change is the cleaning station, which is much noisier than the old one and much more inconvenient.</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.  </li>
            <li>The cord sticks out of the back right area about half way up about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>It does not work in areas where you neglect to actually run the razor over your face, as apparently I did this morning on a little patch on the right side of my chin.  </li>
            <li>Feels smooth, none of the painful razor burns you get with cheap electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I kept that old razor until a couple years ago when it became impossible to find good replacement foil/cutters - Braun discontinued them, and Chinese knockoffs were hit and miss.</li>
            <li>It takes a really long time--much longer than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>This thing took me twice as long as my old razor to shave and never would cut as close.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as long of a time between charges as my old razor but</li>
            <li>At least the grip and balance of the shaver is not bad.</li>
            <li>the motor bogs down because of too much hair.   </li>
            <li>With my recent experience with the Braun 5561 as a reference point, EVERY single one of the new crop of shavers,  looked and felt like pieces of plastic dog doody warmed over.</li>
            <li>And i know for a fact the old Brauns will last much much longer, and are actually worth investing expensive cutter heads for.</li>
            <li>Braun series 5 fails at this which is why I give it only 2 stars - especially if my 3 year old Norelco rotary does a better job.</li>
            <li>It was a bit on the expensive side compared to other shavers, but the promotional certificate made it more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have to be quite careful in how I use this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I did not really want a new shaver</li>
            <li>but for 2-3 weeks after, the area under my chin near my throat started getting severely irritated, dry and it was itchy.</li>
            <li>After 1 and half years usage, the battery started falling apart, it only can hold up one time of use, leas than 4 minutes after whole day fully charge.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job at close shaving with the foil part, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>The cleaner also works very well, although it can be a little noisy (you select when it runs manually, so it won&#x27;t wake you up or anything).</li>
            <li>Due to battery issues and droppage, time to get a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy with the cleaning cartridges which I use due to the hard water we have -</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price tag--this is a below average shaver.  </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve had most of them over the years), I&#x27;ll be curious how it holds up to the tough treatment of my travel.  </li>
            <li>I chose the 5 Series because it came with the charger/cleaner, had a cool, high tech, quality look, but wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the 7 Series.    </li>
            <li>As a young teen, I was never able to go more than 2 consecutive days when attempting to shave with razor and cream; without serious skin irritation.</li>
            <li>so i was willing to try because i was tired of buying blades a high prices.</li>

            <li> Well Ive been using this Braun shaver for about a week now, it is very good.</li>
            <li> This Series 5 razor is the best yet, great shave and it cleans itself to boot.  </li>
            <li> A JOY AND THE SELF CLEANER IS WONDERFUL .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he tried his brother&#x27;s it is a great razor at a great price!!</li>

            <li> The case is the best I&#x27;ve seen -- attractive and offering good protection.  </li>
            <li> The reason I debated giving it a lower rating was because I am not as happy with the charging/cleaning station.</li>
            <li> and they do a great job.</li>
            <li> Combine that with a great price makes this a Great Value.</li>
            <li> Which is great.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver.</li>

            <li> WELL SINCE DAY ONE I AM 100% HAPPY WITH MY BRAUN SERIES 5 590CC ELECTRIC SHAVER .</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner/charging unit works great as well.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Great razor,</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it at a great price.</li>
            <li> and had great results.</li>
            <li> and it has great battery life.</li>
            <li> However, it did a great job shaving.  </li>
            <li> so that is great.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a great charge.  </li>
            <li> It has been great.</li>
            <li> This as you can imagine did not make me happy here</li>
            <li> thank goodness amazon has a great return policy</li>
            <li> This shaver does give the closest shave of any any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for years and they are great shavers.  </li>
            <li> *Quality of the shave is great</li>
            <li> This was recommend to me and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Takes time to get used to but GREAT shave</li>
            <li> The description sounded great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great for sideburns and mustache and even the nose.  </li>
            <li> A great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> They have all been great and lasted almost forever.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning station is great.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, great customer service.</li>
            <li> the cleaning system seemed an overkill but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to the series 5-590cc from a series 3 primarily for the charging/cleaning station but the superb shave was also great!  </li>
            <li> It has been remarkable experience since I had Braun Series 5-590cc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed at the sleek handle design, which is more fashionable, away from Braun clean-cut design for 30 years, I have to adapt my taste to accept.</li>
            <li> Cleaning system works well and imparts a pleasant lemon aroma to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> is a great way to keep the razor clean and operating at its best.</li>
            <li> Good shaving system.</li>
            <li> Probably somewhat over priced but all in all a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this is a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li> You can see the difference in the blades by looking at them on the ends, but they both fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is good.  </li>
            <li> Feels good on face</li>
            <li> I wanted to stay with Braun out of my 20 plus years of good shaves.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I am getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> razor is well built, extremely comfortable to use and does an excellent job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Gives a good close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> and I would not know what is a good level</li>
            <li> We have always had good luck with Braun products.</li>
            <li> Replace 51S with 30B cutter assembly - wonderful close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> loved it.  </li>
            <li> This goes to show you now days if you want to be treated fair</li>
            <li> fair price</li>
            <li> But after a week it is the best shave: smooth and effortless.</li>
            <li> Also, the semi-auto clean is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> He is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the series 5 razor.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I pulled the trigger, because I also received the newest version.</li>
            <li> and I am still very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the ease and effectiveness of the Braun Series 5-590cc.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great , a lot better than scraping my face with baldes.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Really great, easy to use shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best and certainly the easiest to take care of.</li>
            <li> and the difference was totally amazing.  </li>
            <li> It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I got it as a deal of the day and Amazon screwed the pooch on shipping it, but the razor itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> -Sensitivity function is actually effective  </li>
            <li> the carrying case is nice but there is no room for the wall charger in it.</li>
            <li> Amazon does not accept it as a return because of the &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; it contains.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it,</li>
            <li> You cannot return this item as it contains hazardous materials (cleansing solution)</li>
            <li> But the best part is the smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> My Braun 7505 died after many good years of service.  </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy.</li>
            <li> : I liked the trimmer on this shaver.</li>
            <li> Under Dieter Rams, the Braun name used to be synonymous with elegant and good design.</li>
            <li> This Series 5 gives a much closer shave and even does a great job on the neck!</li>
            <li> trimmer is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good shaver</li>
            <li> For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning tank is a nice accessory, as is the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It shaves nice and close with almost no irritation.  </li>
            <li> but it’s nice to know that the option is there.  </li>
            <li> Is it as good as razors costing over $100 more?  </li>
            <li> It’s nice to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My friend kindly bought this as gift from Amazon, so I review it under my account after a week use.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> The shaver just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective and it takes a lot of effort to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, on board indicators good.</li>
            <li> The shaver works quickly, does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning solution has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, like this brand</li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> Now that I own this shaver, I am pleased to report that said power comb works.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for over two months, I have to say this is by far the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> In addition to the night light, the series 5 gives a darn good shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor handles a 2-3 day growth much more effectively than my Series 3 Braun.  </li>
            <li> The first Braun Series 5 worked beautifully for 4 years and then stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li> Really good shaver does not quite get me totally smooth</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find the Series 5 and even more pleased when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the purchase and for 100 bucks, whats not to love!</li>
            <li> Back in the day Braun was a company that used great design to produce great products.</li>
            <li> good quality, well design, comfortable to use, better than  my philips.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, way better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> have great shaves from the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> Reviews were very accurate.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very smooth on the face, does not irritate my skin and</li>
            <li> It provides a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Cuts easy, cleans nice.</li>
            <li> Sent well packaged, super fast, and was an excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> Great German quality, shaves great and the cleaner and charger works super!</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> The cleaning routine keeps the shaver in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I used the disposable razor most days.    </li>
            <li> Go for the cheaper models, they seem to work better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is much better than my previuos one (5000 serie).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the cleaning system seems to be OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> As a bonus my Braun came with the pocket razor for free, nice for traveling.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li> but the more I used it, the more I wanted a Braun.</li>
            <li> and like i said its ok.</li>
            <li> So make sure you want it before you order it.</li>
            <li> It gets close to the skin and you can pop the top off and rinse it when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> Lights should have been more stylish    -</li>
            <li> I will contact Braun again and hope for the best, but reliability is important and thus far I have not had that with this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one more thing to stow somewhere, or take up precious counter top space.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been checking reviews, etc to try and determine the best shaver to replace my current one.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried... nothing.  </li>
            <li> I love the portability of taking the shaver when I travel on business.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of the cleaning feature, place it in the charger and press the cleaning button and walk away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shaving products for the last 15 years and I am very happy with the quality, durability and function.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this shaver!</li>
            <li> I have used Braun Electric Shavers for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I did not want to settle for the bottom of the line nor pay for top of the line, so I chose the 550cc.</li>
            <li> If I put it in the corner of the counter, it is sort of ok.</li>
            <li> For me, I think it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s way of just making more money off the solution.</li>
            <li> I *LOVE</li>
            <li> I was not used to having a cleaning system with a charger, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Some shavers are better to me than others.</li>
            <li> Not the system itself so much, which works great, but two things about the system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find setting the sensitivity of the head to medium works best especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I would spill it and have to buy more refill cartridges.      </li>
            <li> I love the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> 30B fits perfectly, colors are different.</li>
            <li> A better configuration.  </li>
            <li> And I wanted to love it--</li>
            <li> I love the foil style for accuracy</li>
            <li> Better yet go for the 550 or 560 if you don&#x27;t think you need the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Shaver does an excellent job at shaving short hairs on face.</li>
            <li> And then they wonder why the legendary Braun quality, design, longevity, service, or even the warranty period is vastly inferior to what it used to be.</li>
            <li> I concluded that some short-stubble roughness will remain, no matter how many times you repeat areas with the 590cc.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m guessing it will probably be able to deal with all stray hairs, if you take the time necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER</li>
            <li> I was able to sculpt my mustache with it, so it can be used for precision</li>
            <li> And their friends and associates will reinforce the notion that newer is always better, as this is the way people condition themselves to think.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would do a better job</li>
            <li> So I got this Braun, &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> However, if you have more than about three days of growth it tends to pull some of you hairs rather than cut them.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is just the particulars of my beard, but for me rotary is a lot better.</li>
            <li> and I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with the cleaning station, keeps things supper</li>
            <li> I love shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t love being shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll add more on this at the end).  </li>
            <li> I was not at all satisfied by the shaves</li>
            <li> I have had this Braun razor for about 2 weeks and while it is okay, it does not shave as close as the Norelco brands that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Guess I have to stick with the cheap (and effective trimmers for that).  </li>
            <li> (seems to cover more area).</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had many issues since,</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the recommended shaving instructions.</li>
            <li> Anyway I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and the product performs like a Braun!It has a very  close shave</li>
            <li> I expect much better from a $150 razor and this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Panasoinc</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a better shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any better</li>
            <li> The trimmer accessory works significantly better than on cheaper versions too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> top it off, after just 6 months of use, the foil is torn.</li>
            <li> dislike this shaver more every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking for a great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This (free!)</li>
            <li> There is a button on top that adjusts the tightness of the pivot on top</li>
            <li> Sure.  </li>
            <li> For most of us, I’d give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> and I love it ,</li>
            <li> so thats why i decided to try the Braun foil shave and glad i did.</li>
            <li> The complete fittings quality is great with very convenient handle is also very good charging time very quickly After use feeling very smooth face</li>
            <li> (somehow i plan on making my own blend of this or filtering and reusing the original blend)  </li>
            <li> the cleaner is nice to have to keep the machine clean.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can rinse the shaver head clean after you use it is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li> No skin burn nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun older 5 Series, &amp; I explained how Great these razors are.</li>
            <li> It is more affordable than comparable high-end models from other manufactures and provides excellent features and most importantly a very smooth and irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li> I am overly happy with my new Braun 590cc shaver and really glad I picked this model.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Braun Series 5 shaver, because it gives me a good, clean, and quick shave.</li>
            <li> consistent and shaver in good working condition  - Shaver can be used while plugged in    </li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave and the side burn trimer works much better than the trimmer on my old Braun.</li>
            <li> Works best on dry beard.  </li>
            <li> All of my past shavers have performed beautifully, and have given me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Like always very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> The station itself is cheap plastic (as are so many things now)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> but I would say it’s more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I always got a good, fast shave.    </li>
            <li> Great product and no regrets!!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job at giving me a pretty close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> He told me it is the best razor he has ever used to include two other Braun razors.</li>
            <li> It looks so cool!</li>
            <li> I feels like a cheap plastic toy you would find in a happy meal compared to my old 7540.</li>
            <li> and Easy</li>
            <li> and I am getting the results very quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleaning system makes maintenance easy.  </li>
            <li> EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> Overall a great shaver, certainly better than the Philips Coolskin</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution seems to keep the shaver clean but you have to make sure you change the solution on time monthly</li>
            <li> easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning....</li>
            <li> Cuts as good as older unit and quieter.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I settled on this one after much research.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning is pretty nice, but it stills leaves some droppings inside the blade assembly that should be removed every week or so.  </li>
            <li> I really liked my Braun, at first...  </li>
            <li> It works OK, but for the money and the good reviews, I expected better than OK.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is fine for sideburns, neck har.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The shaver was fine -- what you&#x27;d expect from an electric.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you have never owned a Norelco, the Braun would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Women around me seem to be interested in me, I am experiencing heightened level of sex drive, and I am more confident at work.</li>
            <li> I locked mine in place and it works fine that way.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself did a fine job.</li>
            <li> The new model has a head replacement indicator light which should be good feature if indeed it does come on 18 months from now.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, especially since the new version MSRPs for a lot more than 100 bucks.   </li>
            <li> It shaves really well, easy to clean, the cleaning station is really good, luckily I can close the cleaning capsule after use</li>
            <li> Set up was easy and straightforward.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, its clean and looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Coming from a Norelco rotary shaver years ago, this was a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> Boy was this a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus over the panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is important to set to the closest position to get this effect.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this shaver for two weeks now and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I came from a relatively inexpensive Norelco to opt for this one hoping for really great shaves.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Series 5; and, yes, it is smooth.  </li>
            <li> The reason why it is so smooth is you don&#x27;t get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> - Charge light blinks and is distracting.  </li>
            <li> Light and dependable.  </li>
            <li> NOT even close in fit or function.</li>
            <li> I called their service for repair, and they told me that they can replace the battery for free.</li>
            <li> The base/cleaning station was also a cheap gimmick, or so I thought.</li>
            <li> From the hype, I was expecting an effortless shave that came close to a manual razor, and gave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The 3d is smooth as silk, and will shave a 4 day beard faster than the braun will shave a 1 day beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I have a light beard if that is helpful.</li>
            <li> Both of them worked well, and depending on your facial hair, you will probably be happy with either.</li>
            <li> The 590cc shaver feels comfortable and secure in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have favored electric razors for the last 24 years and have owned a handful of models.</li>
            <li> Runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li> In all, good product so far.</li>
            <li> Because the old one was so good</li>
            <li> They were sold to Gillette and then P&amp;G, to profit off of the good reputation that was created in the 20th century by Braun&#x27;s top world class engineers.</li>
            <li> By charging it every day, it reduces the battery life, as the batteries are only good for so many charges.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system on the brauns are also far superior.  </li>
            <li> buy.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I might try the cleaning system once a month or longer, but right now I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Series 5 is even better because you have a cleaning solution station built right in the charger holder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would be just as happy with the other unit.    </li>
            <li> THANKS !!!</li>
            <li> I get clean comfortable</li>
            <li> Results in a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The new desing is better but this one is still okay.</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted over two years.</li>
            <li> -Long battery life (great for camping)  </li>
            <li> A significant improvement has been made in the cleaning method.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First shave - Amazingly close on the face, I could have spent more time under the chin to  get it smoother, but it was still ok.  </li>
            <li> I must say I am not disappointed,</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t interested in the self cleaning feature but all of the better models have it</li>
            <li> pretty sure the battery just gave out.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the original head had finer/smaller openings and the replacement foil head had \\&quot;larger\\&quot; openings.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li> My first self cleaning Braun razor lasted 20 years and the series 5 razor gives an even better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver and the stand had both changed designs significantly.  </li>
            <li> As long as I shaved every day, they were great.  </li>
            <li> It feels very nice in my hand when shaving as it&#x27;s handle is more ergonomic than the previous geneation.  </li>
            <li> I like having a clean shaver every morning.</li>
            <li> More easily fits the hand than the older versions.</li>
            <li> The renew clean unit is quieter.  </li>
            <li> Provides a quick, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I charge and clean my shaver once a week.  </li>
            <li> The clean station works well.</li>
            <li> and I use the brush included to clean up during the week.</li>
            <li> You can also clean the shaver manually and instructions are included to show you how to do this so using the cleaning stand is not mandatory</li>
            <li> Surgeons use that stuff to clean their hands after all.</li>
            <li> I think they tried to improve the clean and charge station, which no longer has the arm that can break.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> overall very happy with product and far exceeds my expectations of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean.</li>
            <li> just clean it every weekend, the cleaning cartridge lasts longer</li>
            <li> So now it doesn&#x27;t charge or clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and smooth, keeps it charge longer and cleans up well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have had two different rotary shavers and this is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a student and had more time and money, I would spring for a straight razor kit (professional) or a safety razor kit (enthusiast) for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> With $80, I can 100% certain that I can buy a much better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li> /liquid has become clogged and I can&#x27;t seem to clean it well enough for him to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> good basic electric shaver, get it at bed,bath,and beyond to get a discount.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, optional system works well</li>
            <li> For most people, by the time they need a new cutter head in two years, they&#x27;ll be convinced by the latest P&amp;G marketing that they have to have the latest bells &amp; whistles gadgets or shiny colours in the new line of shavers.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected, Very pleased with thlis purchase.</li>
            <li> You can eventually get a good shave with this razor, but you will go over and over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> Full  </li>
            <li> The good news is that I have been able to go for a week without charging so on short trips the wall charger probably isn&#x27;t really needed anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 5510 for many years and it always gave a very close shave</li>
            <li> Cut OK on my face but never did very well on my neck.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, it gives as good a shave as any electric</li>
            <li> It does a good job above the neck, but that has never been the issue.</li>
            <li> - Shaver is solid, ergonomic, and has good power.  </li>
            <li> and I imagine most people will find it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the Norelco Arcitec, it shaves much faster and does a better job on the neck.      </li>
            <li> The end that plugs into the wall sticks straight out from the wall more than 3 inches.</li>
            <li> so the old one fit more comfortably in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am over seventy years of age and have done a lot of shaving with a full face of hair.</li>
            <li> Does not do as well with longer growth hairs, will pull hairs and will require multiple passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d done research for 2 solid days on these things, and I read all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is overall a good electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner also allows for a much faster and better clean-up.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would get such a good shave from an electric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the middle sensitivity level and it seems to be producing good results.</li>
            <li> It took me the full 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can shop around for the most reasonable price on the cleaner that helps also.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use it to shave ,worth the price under 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> a-full-beard-by-4:30-anyway gentlemen with a full sprout</li>
            <li> It makes for a comfortable shave in all the right places.     </li>
            <li> It is generally nice and I like the blue light in the self clean system.</li>
            <li> -Quick</li>
            <li> Maybe not as close as with a real razor but close enough to make me happy</li>
            <li> Its okay. should have paid the extra $20 and gotten the better one</li>
            <li> Lucky I kept it.</li>
            <li> (I returned that unit under their 45-day money back guarantee) with this unit and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and shaves as close as you could expect for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Again, same great, close, fast shave, but with convenience of cordless.</li>
            <li> Thereis no substitute for good old barbersol and a straight mach 3 or quattro, etc etc.  </li>
            <li> The shaver feels comfortable and solid in the hand and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have been a Loyal Braun user for 20 years</li>
            <li> Unlike my rotary and my last (cheaper) shaver of this type, this gets a close and nearly perfect shave with only a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to this I had the best braun shaver (whichever the highest series was back in 2001).  </li>
            <li> Is “Contour Hugging Head Shaver” worthy of capitalization?  </li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of other brands of razors that I don&#x27;t use because Braun by far, is the best!</li>
            <li> and I’d say that were accurate if I had noted how it felt the first time and attempted to tally any differences in the feel.  </li>
            <li> So far for me, purchasing more cleaning kits has not been costly since I&#x27;m still using the original cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun Shaver and once again I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I got the new one and have been extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new one from Amazon and was pleased with the ease of ordering process and shipping.  </li>
            <li> AMAZON THANKS FOR MAKING IT EASY TO GET THE PRODUCTS I WANT .</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Gives me a really close shave,very easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted a shaver with a cleaning system at first, but now that I have it I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised that is seems to work better than a blade ( Mach 3).  </li>
            <li> Exactly What my brother wanted!</li>
            <li> It provides a close quick shave, it is smooth not irritating my skin</li>
            <li> When I am done shaving, I run the head under hot water as the instructions say, and I find that it is just as clean as using the cleaning solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the new opti-foil shaver head is so far so good compared with old 8585, I still need more time to tell the on-going performance and durability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 590 did fine on my face, but did seem to require more passes than the 7 series for the same closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t owned the razor very long, I think it&#x27;s probably fine to manually clean it most of the time and use the cleaning system once a week or so.</li>
            <li> He was using an old Norelco before and this was a huge upgrade for him!</li>
            <li> and I can get a very close, smooth shave, it just takes longer to achieve that than with shave cream and a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cut much faster and more precisely than the old 5561, without giving me razor burn.</li>
            <li> I found this electric razor to be much more effective on my beard as I don&#x27;t shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts, it&#x27;ll be worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I must say it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This, however, seems to be as good as could be reasonably expected.  </li>
            <li> Shaving not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old Norelco rotary shaver does better on the neckline than this shaver.</li>
            <li> Thus extending the useful life of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> Well, most important, the designated repairer is not a Braun entity, they farm it out, and the person had only a passing familiarity with the product.</li>
            <li> To me it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My old razor&#x27;s battery technology was BETTER?</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not as wide and close to shaver as the 590cc but does a good job.</li>
            <li> and so far, I love it.     </li>
            <li> The unit runs cooler than my prior unit, so that is nice.  </li>
            <li> I would finally have a really nice electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Upgrading from a tiny mobile shaver to something more advanced.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco rotary did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It’s also made more comfortable by the cleaning system which, though I thought to be a scam initially, actually seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li> It is far better.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good,reliable and not bad for $60.00.i</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new shaver, the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my old razor Norelco.</li>
            <li> No electric razor is perfect, but this one comes closer to perfection for me than any other Braun or Norelco I have used over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my face felt soft and smooth instead of the sleek and smooth feeling I got from the Gillette.</li>
            <li> It not only gives a great shave, but it does so even after 2 or 3 days without shaving, when my whiskers are much longer than normal.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li> And right from the start</li>
            <li> And I can trust the machine doing it right.</li>
            <li> The new one is easy to use with a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does feel clean every time, I’ll say that much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does one judge the value of an electric razor?  </li>
            <li> , I primarily leave the sensitivity high or medium.</li>
            <li> and I must say it is the best one yet of the 2 that I previously owned prior to this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s excellent; it cuts as close as a blade shave, at least for me, it is smooth and, with three swivel head settings, it shaves all areas of the face equally well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t control the three wheels as accurately as my Braun prior, and overall felt the quality of the shave just wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> cheap 10 year old norelco with an aging original blade can shave a multi-day growth as fast as it will shave a 1 day growth.  </li>
            <li> My new Braun Series 5-590cc is a fantastic electric shaver to.  </li>
            <li> and the shaver must be in exactly the right position to activate the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> My last Braun one was a 9595 pulsonic model and it was great compared to the Norelco I had prior to it.</li>
            <li> Runs much quieter and seems to cut better at a lower RPM than my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, the clean and renew fluid is kind of a ripoff -- if you use it as much as the manufacturer suggests (every day, all the time), that&#x27;s about an extra $75 a year; one more expense I really don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I was even able to gently go over the still sore area on my throat where I developed razor burn the day before.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in June 2014 after had great luck with my last 2 Braun razors which lasted 5 and 7 years respectively.  </li>
            <li> The holder is huge and glows a blue light.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a nicely made razor, and feels good in my hand, though perhaps a little long.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd new Braun shaver and I am very pleased with the shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li> love the ways it shaves - much closer than older braun shavers - pivoting head is good - I only use the fancy cleaning system every couple of weeks - keep the fluid container covered the rest of the time and just recharge with the cord</li>
            <li> very much like this razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Always liked my Philips shavers, never fussed with them, and they did the job on my fine (not coarse) facial hair, without bother.</li>
            <li> The new shaver has given me close clean shaves comparable to a multi-blade saftey razor.  </li>
            <li> -Self-cleaning function is loud and could be problematic for light sleepers in a nearby room.  </li>
            <li> First I will admit that I have noticed that the cleaning does seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I do NOT use it daily as suggested, but once a week seems to be OK.</li>
            <li> I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this model, instead of one $24 cheaper, is it seemed like it was better.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is very well made, which is a breath of fresh air these days.</li>
            <li> He had great luck with it, so he gave me one for Christmas in the late 1980s.</li>
            <li> The price is steep, more than double the entry Norelco or Braun.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient!  </li>
            <li> first change is that the body is longer and narrower.</li>
            <li> For my face and skin, it&#x27;s pretty close to a razor.</li>
            <li> The shave is actually better and the various functions are no longer in one switch.  </li>
            <li> first I bought a competitors three-circle-wheel style razor.  </li>
            <li> If you use it daily then this razor won&#x27;t be a problem, but if you go more than a day....</li>
            <li> At first your skin might turn reddish and become irritated but this will subside as your skin adapts to it.</li>
            <li> I have had it for three months now and am not sorry that I bought it.</li>
            <li> (The real Braun company used to offer 3 years on their shavers!).</li>
            <li> So for the razor, I did my research and ended up purchasing the 590cc and also tried my dads razor for about a week which is a higher end norelco.</li>
            <li> Very well done!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that does the job, you should be able to get one at $50, they are all the same.</li>
            <li> For some reason though it just can&#x27;t shave my neck consistently.  </li>
            <li> First off, don&#x27;t expect manual razor blade results, but the shaves are pretty close.</li>
            <li> Shaving my lower jaw/upper neck area takes awhile with several passes over to thoroughly shave, but it sure beats getting cuts.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because my love in my life didn&#x27;t like my facial hair.</li>
            <li> unlike I did my first month owning it.</li>
            <li> Does it make everything simple and better?</li>
            <li> My first shave was exellent and have had it a week</li>
            <li> I have had many different models.</li>
            <li> I hope and pray the new 7 series performs as well or better than the old.</li>
            <li> NOT recommended, there is better available for less $$.</li>
            <li> Ok, well the alcohol dip is a nice feature but at the same time I’m not aware of electric razors being a breeding zone for Ebola or the Hanta virus.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant because the picture shows the older version (gen. 1) and recently many people said they received the old version but others mentioned they received the newest version (gen 4).</li>
            <li> Braun does offer a pretty decent trial period so that might be worth taking advantage of if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> It has a nice trimmer and some how it manages to get those stray wiskers that can elude other shavers.</li>
            <li> I actually use it to trim my hairline often times because it is a bit more gentle than my hair clippers on my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> biggest hesitation before purchasing was whether the extra money really does translate into any better performance.</li>
            <li> While I can agree to the positive reviews to some extent, its not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This shaving product is very smooth, dont feel dry after shave.</li>
            <li> Of the so many models that Braun offers (in fact too many models) it took me a few days to decide which one to get</li>
            <li> Eventually, I was able to get some areas of my face smooth enough that no stubble was felt when brushing upward against my face with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> very good,my first braun shaver</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where the differences really became evident.  </li>
            <li> Well, Braun did slightly better with the long whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Close clean shave, the powerful but quiet motor works</li>
            <li> The most serious competition came when my wife purchased a top of the line Panasonic.</li>
            <li> ever shave popping the foil and head of giving them a nice rinse and pat down and dusting out the razor chamber then re-assembling and running through the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is doing the job and its very easy on sensitive skin, but the shave just isn&#x27;t close enough.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of getting hairs the first time as apposed to my previous razor that took multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Finally, the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; system leaves the shaver feeling like new for the next shave, which is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I have used every method of shaving known to man;every new type of blade, &amp; hundreds of $&#x27;s worth of all brands of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> The alcohol-based cleaner of the brauns always makes the shaver smell fresh and new, each day.  </li>
            <li> Well, first of all the shaver is a terrific night light for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does not go in and out as easily as the last one did.</li>
            <li> The unit arrived nicely boxed with a semi-hard black zippered travel case which is not mentioned in the literature.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the shaver long enough to tell if it was a good</li>
            <li> I certainly wont be cleaning it every day.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Dieter Rams era post-modernist design, and the amazing heavy solid build quality of this precision machine that was the Classic Braun 5561.</li>
            <li> In addition, this shaver is much quieter and has gentler vibration than my last one, but still gets the job done easily.  </li>
            <li> for I have found it far superior to any of the previously owned electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I like about the Braun, since I also shave my head, is the fact that it handles everything from the stiffest beard to the fine hairs on the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using Braun for the past 5-6 years, this Series 5 590c is a significant difference, for the better.  </li>
            <li> And honestly, compared to most men I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, so it should be easy for this shaver to take care of - but it fails.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I replaced the heads many times, simply because they were not clean or lubricated.</li>
            <li> He loves the three blade across, says it gives a much closer shave, and works great for his tough beard.</li>
            <li> The device works very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Eventually I took to having a manual razor and shaving cream for days when I didn&#x27;t have much time.  </li>
            <li> -Very</li>
            <li> and I started getting very close shaves.</li>
            <li> but this makes my life much easier.</li>
            <li> The Remington gave a noticeably much closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is the most $$ I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> If you are the type that doesn&#x27;t shave every day then this razor is not for you as it does not handle longer hairs very well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like braun&#x27;s vibration.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expect too much when transferred from Philips.</li>
            <li> Nothing really stands out for this shaver.</li>
            <li> They should have used stainless steel or something much cooler looking to match the shaver.    </li>
            <li> On the whole, I like the shaver</li>
            <li> It is lighter and is slighty curved along the verticle axis, which makes it much easier to hold.  </li>
            <li> I SHAVE DAILY AND LIKE A CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE .</li>
            <li> Gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> gentle on the face with no razor burn</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t compare to the 8995.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommned!</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I must say I was also very hesitant to spend so much because I had 3 Remington foil MS3 electric razors that retailed at maybe $50 max.</li>
            <li> but it really does work.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to decide on this Braun after all I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a shaver.</li>
            <li> Besides, I didn&#x27;t want to open the sealed cartridge filled with cleaning solution for fear</li>
            <li> The User Guide recommends cleaning the unit after each shave or when the yellow LED light comes on.</li>
            <li> The yellow \\&quot;time to clean\\&quot; light never came on so after a month, I cleaned the shaver anyway.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun Shavers in the past and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> It can provide a reasonably close shave comparable to a razor blade</li>
            <li> I had to shave every day for my employment, and that was a chore I really dreaded.</li>
            <li> Self cleaning station/charger works very well.</li>
            <li> People judge the Braun company of today by the reputation that was built when they really were Braun.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky, so that&#x27;s high praise!  </li>
            <li> Charges fast.</li>
            <li> So I decided to send a very pointed email to Braun to give them a written form of my disgust in their lack of customer service and how I felt about how they should have to put out the money for shipping since it was their lack of quality control that caused this situation.</li>
            <li> When the skin can&#x27;t press in against the foils, it really doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t we just purchase a foil screen when needed at a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave and the cleaning system</li>
            <li> I absolutely regret purchasing this shaver.</li>
            <li> The head swivels but not as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> provides a close comfortable shave, as well as sleek styling and solid feel.</li>
            <li> cons:  doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much face as a triple head  </li>
            <li> He took it, in the case it came with, to work with him for a whole week before he brought it home to charge.</li>
            <li> Rotary razors scratch my face too much, so I wanted to stick with a foil-top.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> but I did not expect as it usualy takes a barbar and straight razor for that,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Not only is it noisy and vibrate too much (far more than the clippers used by my hair stylist) but it grabs and pulls the whiskers, which really hurts.  </li>
            <li> Is “not for sale in Catalina Island” really a product feature?  </li>
            <li> Shout out to my friends from college that listened to waaaay too much Phish.  </li>
            <li> Or rather made ME listen to waaaay too much Phish.)  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> Too boot, when it broke recently, amazon replaced it free of charge.</li>
            <li> Not that big a deal, just recharge it more frequently.  </li>
            <li> good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!thanks a lot</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first couple times but now it runs slow and makes an odd humming sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for more than 10 years, this is my 3rd and always trying to upgrade the previous one, not for malfuntioning just because i wanted a new one :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item was factory sealed, new and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It works better than the old Panasonic particularly in those areas where, if your growth is at all like mine, you have hairs sprouting in different directions.  </li>
            <li> At night, the cleaning station gives off a small blue light which is nice should you have to find the unit without turning on the lights.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> especially if you let your beard go too many days, you could pop up the trimmer, and lay the razor at the right angle to let it cut the long hairs, afterwhich the foil part would shave the stubble.</li>
            <li> I also have a Remington micro-screen and get a faster and much closer shave with fewer strokes with the older Remington.  </li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Renew station for the Series 5 is of exceptionally low quality construction and reliability.  </li>
            <li> The head and cutter is washable under running water and if that&#x27;s not enough, you can use the Clean &amp; Renew System.</li>
            <li> However, there is no way to clean the shaver without charging it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a clean shave everytime I use it,cleaning after usage is very simple.</li>
            <li> Of course, the  cleaning solution does cost quite a bit of money, but I&#x27;d rather spend extra money to keep my unit clean with their alcohol solution than just rinsing my unit under tap water.</li>
            <li> First inspections show it comes with a good travel case, but I was dismayed that the removable blade housing is made of flimsy, thin plastic.</li>
            <li> Though my facial hair will kil a $12 dollar disposable in 2 shaves so it is overall more economical for old Iron beard here, MWS Barbar trips and disposables.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in how well it shaves from one time to the next and extends the time when I think I may need to get a new shaving head for it.  </li>
            <li> Good shave, wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li> , the charger has a function that stops charging once it&#x27;s full for an hour, so essentially you can leave it on the charger (which doubles as the cleaner) when it&#x27;s not in use without worrying about the battery losing its memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I mean is as far as an electric razor, I think it is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> One customer review claimed that it “felt like a new razor every time!”</li>
            <li> with those two things mentioned, I really like my new razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li> For folk who have the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; of not having to shave everyday, this razor does a great job with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> This works better and cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li> So is it better than electric razors costing $75 less?  </li>
            <li> I have not yet had to replace the cleaning cartridge, but the cartridge itself is the same as my former shaver, so I was able to use already purchased cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The more expensive one has many geek features.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery life is listed as 45 minutes while my older Braun had a supposed life of 60 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a piece of junk compared to the older razors.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model to replace an older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Coming from an older model Braun now.</li>
            <li> But to achieve that I had to do many passes over the same area, and this was over several shaving sessions that evening.</li>
            <li> If it does even a comparable job, then I&#x27;ll go with the older model and return this one.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Braun shavers, including most recently a 7680.  </li>
            <li> after trying many types of electric razors, finally one that I can use daily and without irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the service and support I have received from Braun and particularly Amazon, I will not hesitate to buy Braun products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not meet my expectations because it does not shave as close as my older products.  </li>
            <li> If so, why is it only worthy once?  </li>
            <li> I had an older Braun</li>
            <li> The new stand is very light and no longer provides the options for power savings and in depth cleaning of the previous shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was similar to this but was the VERY first generation &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; system.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is a bit high.  </li>
            <li> The razor FEELS like a high quality device, but the design is not.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> The cool blue glow from the LED that illuminates the cleaning solution level makes it easy to find the bathroom in the dark.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that the shaver could do a better job on neck hairs, but does as good a job as any other electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My Panasonic foil-top was older than I remember, so I needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> After my last one, which was a low-end disappointment, this one is great -- as smooth of a shave as I believe you can get from an electric.</li>
            <li> This electric razor does dry shave like a child eating eating ice cream, clean and gone in seconds.</li>
            <li> After one-week use, I came to conclude can neither clean to my satisfaction nor dry the shaver within 2 hours.</li>
            <li> And the Remington lasted barely more than a year (WITH a few blade &amp; screen changes along the way).</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic did at least as good a job and is presently considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li> curiosity got the better of me about a month ago - I tried replenishing the cleaning cartridge with Sea Breeze, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the Braun fluid; the Sea Breeze contains water whereas I don&#x27;t believe the Braun fluid does.</li>
            <li> The shaver feels so much better than any Remington, even when it had 3 blades and the Braun has 2 with the middle long wiskar cutter.</li>
            <li> powerful enough and never worry about your shaving problem.</li>
            <li> Braun just needs to go back to making quality products that are worth the price they charge for them.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchased the mid to high-end models and had good results.</li>
            <li> Overall quality and workmanship are the same as old Braun, it is manufactured by those who commit themselves and love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I would have said that the fisherman either started the first tours or invented the first glass-bottomed boat since the statement as-is implies that prior to 1896, tours didn’t exist which I’m almost positive that they did.  </li>
            <li> The only thing they got right is the trimmer</li>
            <li> The wall adapter for my Norelco is a right angle arrangement that is only 3/4 inch tall when plugged in.</li>
            <li> A red line appeared right across my throat, followed by a burny sensation.</li>
            <li> My last Braun worked fine for 15 years until it needed a new battery for the charge to last more than a few days.</li>
            <li> As long as Braun makes shavers I wouldn&#x27;t own any other.</li>
            <li> I figure if I cut my usage by using the cleaning fluid only about once a week, that&#x27;s fine with</li>
            <li> It’s comfortable to use with finger notches in the side like you might find on the grip of a handgun or some other manly object with finger notches.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and since Braun is a name I associate with quality, I bought this razor.    </li>
            <li> New body style is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to get used to the new ergonomic streamlined handle and flex-head adjustment switch, but I am adapting well.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advise of those that said you need to acclimate your beard to a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver out of hopes that the Braun name would live up to their quality and price hype.</li>
            <li> I bought a new replacement head, and some of the foil strips came off after a month.</li>
            <li> I will post review of new 7 series.</li>
            <li> After cleaning the razor, it feels like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> and now i find myself shopping for a new razor...</li>
            <li> will buy the 1987 Braun 3525 model (new in box), then see how that compares.</li>
            <li> This option made no since, why would I pay the price of a new item and get a refurbished item plus pay shipping three times.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m switching to a new norelco 3d.  </li>
            <li> so I started my quest to find a new one.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this as I had a promotional certificate to use on Amazon and needed a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I think this shaver is new to the Braun line-up.  </li>
            <li> , I could see new 5 series (cassette head design) was launched in Europe and replaced this 5 series.</li>
            <li> and it makes the inside look brand new.</li>
            <li> The feel on the skin is much smoother, unit feels very good and solid in your hand, its not missing much of the hair when cutting.    </li>
            <li> So I bought the Braun 590cc to see how the new crop of shavers compared to my old classic Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot; IN NAME</li>
            <li> Also, the cleaning fluid level is no longer a set of LEDs but a light shining on the internal plastic tank.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much but not as much as my old Braun because the old one charging/cleaning stand has lights indicating when and how much the cleaning is needed as well as how much cleaning fluid is left where as the 5-590cc&#x27;s charging/cleaning only has a light that lights up the bottom to manually see how much solution is left.  </li>
            <li> So coming from another Braun, the difference is very clear.    </li>
            <li> If your bathroom door opens directly to your bedroom, be aware that the LED light on the charging base is obnoxiously bright at night.</li>
            <li> I normally would not have considered paying as much for a razor, burt at my age, I felt I had finally deserved a chance to try a highly rated shaver.</li>
            <li> While the Braun shaver is not the top of the line, it is quite an improvement from the Braun shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned this to a friend and he&#x27;d had the exact same experience switching from Norelco to Braun.     </li>
            <li> So, now I  have a shaver that works pretty well and several bottles of unusable cleaning liquid.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Braun Razor, the first one latex over 8 years.</li>
            <li> The battery lasted nearly 14 years!</li>
            <li> (the first follow-up call they still said it needed to take 2-3 weeks to send it back to me).</li>
            <li> When I use it daily it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I, like many of the other reviewers, have tried various brands and style of electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether 7 series will be better.</li>
            <li> They’re all pretty similar.  </li>
            <li> I’m not sure it’s THAT much more convenient for me to drop this razor into a charging cradle than it is to plug in a cord.  </li>
            <li> I was using an old Braun series 1 and rather than buy a new head and cutters I decided to go with a new razor.</li>
            <li> But absolutely none of them had the weight, solid feel or materials and build quality of my classic Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Well, to my surprise, my new Braun 590cc model isn&#x27;t even pulsonic and it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model did.</li>
            <li> They last a long time; they&#x27;re really comfortable to shave with</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only cleaned the unit 3 times and only because I thought it was time to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor didn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as the first one and there have been numerous complaints about the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> But so far, after almost 3 years of almost daily use this things is going just like the first day that I got it and was shaving.</li>
            <li> I then bought this more expensive one, and it did as well, although not nearly as often (and it seems to be getting better).  </li>
            <li> but it was easier to get a new one that get the old one fixed.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s quiet (compared to my old Remington), and gives me smooth, dry close shaves.</li>
            <li> First I thought well at least their service was good disregard the poor quality, however, after one month of waiting after mailing the product back to them on my own money, they told me that it needs $80 for replacing the battery on my second following call.</li>
            <li> , they might be little bit pricey, but they last for many years, if you take care of them.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on the Braun shavers and was a little concerned about the inital price and the cost of the cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> close shave (gets all those hard to reach hairs and more)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a dull hum.</li>
            <li> But just to get a close shave, I had to go over areas many times, and often press hard against my skin (which you&#x27;re not supposed to do).</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I think the designers could have done a better job of fabricating a base that was a little more in fitting with the price/look of the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I sent it back straight away and have been using my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> second change is that the motor does not run as fast as the old one did.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need the features of the 7 series, as compared to the 590, but I was surprised how different the two shavers performed.  </li>
            <li> Still see clear roots of beards.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it under water then insert to clean, finally remove foil to dry.</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun and turned to Braun when my old razor died.  </li>
            <li> However, the quality of my shaves has not been affected and comparing it with my old Braun screen</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a closer shave than my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> He has had it for a month so far and</li>
            <li> He even has sensitive skin but the switch between razors wasn&#x27;t a problem</li>
            <li> end cleaned it out once, but it was clear that the end was near.</li>
            <li> I actually worried that they would damage my hearing (they might even be partly responsible for my tinnitus - who knows???).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry at all about using it near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my skin so sensitive that when I shaved before going to bed my face was still hurting in the morning.</li>
            <li> I miss the fluid level indicator in the cleaning reservoir, but that may still be available on the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> Had a 360 complete before this and it lasted over 8 years.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my series 3985 fixed and Braun suggested this.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun (I think it was the 6552) died after *</li>
            <li> My old Braun had a snap over plasic cover.  </li>
            <li> It would have added 10 cents to the cost to include such a plastic cover, and I&#x27;d much rather have it than some bulky box with air, or a color brochure that I throw</li>
            <li> my old Braun?  </li>
            <li> of coarse it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model even though my old 9595 pulsonic model gave a really close shave.     </li>
            <li> AND A VERY CLOSE SHAVE, WENT BACK</li>
            <li> In the early 1990s, they came out with the cordless models, so bought one.</li>
            <li> Going up the side of my ear requires all kinds of maneuvers to get the hair next to my earlobe (or maybe it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t cut very well period).</li>
            <li> I think with the rebate it makes the intial cost reasonable and you shouldn&#x27;t worry about the cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old.</li>
            <li> Panasonic will be my next shaver, real soon.</li>
            <li> However, I had a problem getting parts for my old Remington so decided to bite the bullet.</li>
            <li> One of the early concerns I had before purchasing the unit was the added cost of cleaning the unit using the Clean&amp;Renew Station and cleaning solution as often as Braun recommends.</li>
            <li> Gives a close professional shave.</li>
            <li> The only razor that really got the job done in a timely manner was a razor blade.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars but my old 3 series head gives a closer shave</li>
            <li> Braun, I don&#x27;t know what you were thinking when you developed this shaver.  </li>
            <li> But the Braun really only wants to shave a one day growth...  </li>
            <li> While the end result is similar, the Braun is much faster so thats</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been exclusively using straight foil-type shavers for the last 8-10 years.</li>
            <li> I had to use my old Braun 1775 to finish areas on my chin and neck</li>
            <li> the cleaning fluid is used up fast</li>
            <li> It ends up looking like a 10 year old on a mower - patches everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have needed to replace my old electric razor (rotary) for some time.</li>
            <li> This model never had the battery life of my 7 year old model 8585.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and I&#x27;ve had a bunch of shavers.</li>
            <li> but then as I said I&#x27;m old and shake and then there are the wrinkles that somehow cause cuts.</li>
            <li> I consider my skin to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The Catalina Island website also has, under the “Media &amp; Filming” section, a sub-section of “Story Ideas” just in case, as a budding filmmaker, you have the budget and equipment to film on Catalina, but no thoughts on what to film.  </li>
            <li> Its arrival time might be scheduled after dealers run out of old inventory.</li>
            <li> Safe to say I have sensitive skin, and this trimmer was not kind to it, when I used it to mow my months of beard growth (against the grain).</li>
            <li> it got a nice, close shave without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a somewhat thick growth of facial hair, and this shaver gave me a nice and close shave.</li>
            <li> I was wrongly mislead by the good reviews posted on this item.</li>
            <li> The charging station cleaner does a decent job, but I usually manually clean it out semi-regularly with a brush as well.    </li>
            <li> I have long been a rotary shaver user, but I bought this shaver around 2 years ago to see if it is any better than the previous norelco&#x27;s I have used.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small travel case and is easy to shave on-the-go.</li>
            <li> It did take a week of shaving with the new razor for the face to get used to the new shaving technique (rotary blades shave differently).</li>
            <li> I really like the form, fit and feel of this new shaver however, despite using the clean and lubricate system daily, the shaver started pulling wiskers out instead on cutting them after 5 months.</li>
            <li> My last razor older 8000</li>
            <li> You can even use same cleaner cartridges as with older renew&#x27;/charge bases.</li>
            <li> My other option was to ship it back and get a refund for the purchase price, they would not pay for the price of the original shipping or for me to ship the faulty shaver to them.</li>
            <li> had an older and lesser model from Braun before and it died...</li>
            <li> For that price, though, I really should have just gotten my previous model which was:    Braun Syncro Smart Logic Shaving System, Model 7526</li>
            <li> very reliable has not broken down on me yet and charges well.</li>
            <li> I live in western NC--about as far away as you can get and still be in the Carolinas.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a cheap gimmick and just made the razor less solid and well built.</li>
            <li> and I must have some super tough facial hair as I haft to replace the head and foil about every forty-five days even though I clean it welllk after</li>
            <li> Was happy with my old Braun, but finally got to a point where the unit wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the motor was straining when cutting a heavier beard.    </li>
            <li> I started with my chin and throat, and noticed the shaver was not rough on my sensitive skin face.</li>
            <li> My husbands face feels so smooth now and there are NO MORE cut marks or stubby bumps caused by those dern blades.</li>
            <li> Battery would go a couple weeks of every other day use without a recharge, AND I could plug it in and keep shaving if the battery ran down :-).</li>
            <li> In hind sight I should have returned it immediately, but in the beginning it was lasting long enough for a weeks worth of shaves (my 7 year old 8585 model still holds its charge for 2 weeks at a time).</li>
            <li> Sounds a little big, should follow the direction with the beard, slightly less convenient, overall is good.</li>
            <li> I have now retired this model in favor of a brand new Norelco--which has a similar self cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I persuaded them to send me a new cleaning element which they finally did.</li>
            <li> Solution was to buy the new series 7 and wife opted for series 5 for Xmas present.</li>
            <li> I am going back to Panasonic for my new shaver.</li>
            <li> The support person, took the information, located the sales data, and said the new shaving unit would arrive 5 days later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that having your shaver sit in a bath of dirty denatured alcohol that&#x27;s been stagnating in your bathroom for 2 months, is somehow better than cleaning it under fresh running water.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a year now, and I hate it more and more every day.  </li>
            <li> the battery would last nearly seven days!  </li>
            <li> ; thought I was going to have to go back to blades when I couldn&#x27;t reorder parts for my 5-year old 3612!</li>
            <li> Im the type who does alot of research before any major purchase, and</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers since I purchased my first one in 1967, and have never used any other.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost and expensive bathroom counter space, but it does make the razor smell good.</li>
            <li> However if my thick beard gets more than a day long, this shaver really takes a lot longer to get the long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first couple shaves I was skeptical as getting a good shave was not easy at all.</li>
            <li> But I had dropped it a few times, the battery was not holding a charge much anymore, and it was just older Braun technology.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is expensive and for optimum performance needs supplies for the clean and renew system.</li>
            <li> Except I would expect plastic dog doody to fare better if dropped over a hard bathroom tile floor than any of these thin cheap brittle plastic hi-tech pieces of disposable trash.</li>
            <li> Clear Skin  Facial Hair:</li>
            <li> The battery in the model barely lasts 3 days, and I don&#x27;t see God when I shave with it.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the head had another row or two for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> The series 5 is a marked improvement over my last Braun and over the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> When my old Braun electric shaver died after almost three years of faithful service, I began searching the net for its replacement.  </li>
            <li> tried my old plastic cover, but its around 2 millimeters too short on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The width is about the same as the old shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I WOULD GO BACK SHAVING WITH A BLADE TO GET THE CLOSE SHAVE I WANTED , BUT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND WOULD GET CUTS EVERY SHAVE .</li>
            <li> I also am curious if the cleaning solution causes my skin to break out, but hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I picked this unit over the Series 5 570 because as far as I could tell, the only difference were the LED lights.</li>
            <li> The head is the same as the old one</li>
            <li> But I recently tried foil shavers when on a whim, I picked up an old Braun 5561, from a Goodwill store.</li>
            <li> A far cry from the solid steel and acrylic housing that covers the blade on my 5561.</li>
            <li> After my old Braun shaver finally wore out, I knew I wanted another Braun.  </li>
            <li> Closer shave, shorter time to remove hair, especially on the sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li> expected a much closer shave</li>
            <li> It seems inevitable Braun quits their old cutter/foil design.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED MANY ELECTRIC SHAVERS , BUT WAS NEVER HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS .</li>
            <li> and I would not pay full price for this because I&#x27;m not sure what the cleaning mode does,</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and keep ready for use with the charger/cleaner base.</li>
            <li> This Braun 5-590 is OK but not great.</li>
            <li> I cheat and only clean it every other day and thus make the cleaning fluid last longer.</li>
            <li> norelco is less expensive and gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review again later based on how the new razor performs, but at least Amazon handled the issue quickly.</li>
            <li> I like that you can rinse it off with hot water and only use the cleaning solution every other week or so.</li>
            <li> fourth change is the cleaning station, which is much noisier than the old one and much more inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.  </li>
            <li> The cord sticks out of the back right area about half way up about 2 inches.</li>
            <li> It does not work in areas where you neglect to actually run the razor over your face, as apparently I did this morning on a little patch on the right side of my chin.  </li>
            <li> Feels smooth, none of the painful razor burns you get with cheap electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I kept that old razor until a couple years ago when it became impossible to find good replacement foil/cutters - Braun discontinued them, and Chinese knockoffs were hit and miss.</li>
            <li> It takes a really long time--much longer than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> This thing took me twice as long as my old razor to shave and never would cut as close.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as long of a time between charges as my old razor but</li>
            <li> At least the grip and balance of the shaver is not bad.</li>
            <li> the motor bogs down because of too much hair.   </li>
            <li> With my recent experience with the Braun 5561 as a reference point, EVERY single one of the new crop of shavers,  looked and felt like pieces of plastic dog doody warmed over.</li>
            <li> And i know for a fact the old Brauns will last much much longer, and are actually worth investing expensive cutter heads for.</li>
            <li> Braun series 5 fails at this which is why I give it only 2 stars - especially if my 3 year old Norelco rotary does a better job.</li>
            <li> It was a bit on the expensive side compared to other shavers, but the promotional certificate made it more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I have to be quite careful in how I use this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I did not really want a new shaver</li>
            <li> but for 2-3 weeks after, the area under my chin near my throat started getting severely irritated, dry and it was itchy.</li>
            <li> After 1 and half years usage, the battery started falling apart, it only can hold up one time of use, leas than 4 minutes after whole day fully charge.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at close shaving with the foil part, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The cleaner also works very well, although it can be a little noisy (you select when it runs manually, so it won&#x27;t wake you up or anything).</li>
            <li> Due to battery issues and droppage, time to get a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy with the cleaning cartridges which I use due to the hard water we have -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price tag--this is a below average shaver.  </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve had most of them over the years), I&#x27;ll be curious how it holds up to the tough treatment of my travel.  </li>
            <li> I chose the 5 Series because it came with the charger/cleaner, had a cool, high tech, quality look, but wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the 7 Series.    </li>
            <li> As a young teen, I was never able to go more than 2 consecutive days when attempting to shave with razor and cream; without serious skin irritation.</li>
            <li> so i was willing to try because i was tired of buying blades a high prices.</li>
            <li> I physically clean the shaver foil and cutter block once a week, sometimes every other week when lazy.</li>
            <li> The other thing was the old razor took a simple cord.</li>
            <li> Only for the tough and stubborn areas do I go full lock.  </li>
            <li> (although that&#x27;s still less than paying for new razor blades)  </li>
            <li> Bought new razor to replace previous Braun that I had for 6 years.</li>
            <li> But seriously, This razor isn&#x27;t worth over $100.</li>
            <li> From June to November the battery life deteriorated to the point where it will not hold a charge long enough to complete 1 complete shave - it only functions as a corded razor at this point, but I was well past my 60-day Amazon return</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve switched back and forth, from blades to electric and back again (and again), but this razor will probably keep me humming along for a long time.</li>
            <li> No more issue trying to get to certain spots.   </li>
            <li> I will say, it is less likely to leave a burn, or bite, but my old Braun was twice the shaver.    </li>
            <li> Technically, it’s quite simple with a single button (push to turn on, push to turn off.  </li>
            <li> My last electric was a Remington and would pull on long whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a 7 series for a long time, and it recently died on me.  </li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that said an older system had an active drying process</li>
            <li> The only negative, really, is the price.  </li>
            <li> (dry shave)  -Durable and Low Maintenance (18 months per blade change, self-cleaning, and solid/weighted feel)  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the battery life is HALF the old one.</li>
            <li> The shaver is sleeker and works well, but the stand, is a far \\&quot;cheaper and simpler\\&quot; design than the previous unit.  </li>
            <li> I have very course and thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> The old Braun would shave my two day stubble like a gas mower, but the new Braun needs at least twice the time, twice the pressure, and is a lot more difficult to shave as close, or get into tight spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with other Braun models not giving a close shave because the foil wasn&#x27;t open enough.  </li>
            <li> I received a email back saying they would send me a $15 check in the mail to pay for the shipping so they finally decided to do the right thing, too bad it took me calling them out to get them to be ethical in their business transactions.</li>
            <li> As my 7680 was getting a little old, I decided to buy the 590.  </li>
            <li> The 5 series&#x27; foils are recessed into the head, and this makes it very ineffective on a hard surface, like my bony head.  </li>
            <li> Well if they are, \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; certainly doesn&#x27;t mean what it did in Braun&#x27;s heyday.</li>
            <li> Still not awful, but disappointing compared to what these used to be and considering what they cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a bit too early to give this a comprehensive &#x27;two thumbs up&#x27; review -- I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so -- but it seems to be at least the equal of the Braun shaver that it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I hope my replacement lasts as long.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, but with the bathroom door closed, its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and what is not since it is not marked on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to go over sections over and over, and it took me 2x as long as it should have.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user (over 20 years)</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer can pull your hair if it is too long, so needs some pre-shave with the beard cutter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, it takes me twice as long to get my shaving done.</li>
            <li> But if I let things go for 3 or 4 days, the rotary wouldn&#x27;t cut the long whiskers.  </li>
            <li> and it is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> any electric razor I’ve ever used, it’s not quite as close as shaving with a new, sharp blade (except in the ‘stache area where it’s closer for some odd reason)  </li>
            <li> For me, the razor works well, but still not quick enough to replace my standard blade.</li>
            <li> Here is the unbelievable part about my new Braun 590cc shaver ....</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to those who have thick facial hair and is tired of having to quickly shave in the bathroom (causing multiple cuts and stubs on the face) because your razor needs water.</li>
            <li> All my daily shaves are extremely close.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution cartridges are easier and neater to use than similar shaver cleaning systems made by other companies.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time – long enough for me to shave my face, at least, and reportedly long enough to shave my face for an entire hour.  </li>
            <li> but sadly it will no longer hold a charge and the clean and renew system</li>
            <li> And because the panasonic uses a blower to dry the shaver, it spreads that funkiness all around the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is the power cord.</li>
            <li> I can get a week on a single charge.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;3-stage Cutting System Twin Foils and integrated cutter shave long hairs and stubble progressively close.&lt;br /&gt;Washable under running water for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Contour</li>
            <li> Coming from my old, single head cutter to the new, twin \\&quot;head\\&quot; design, it&#x27;s a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an aging Remington Microscreen 2, and I had been eyeing the Braun 5-series for some time, mainly due to the &#x27;Power Comb&#x27; that&#x27;s supposed to lift up and trim hairs that are lying flat.  </li>
            <li> I only use about once a week and just empty the head manually after the other shaves.</li>
            <li> ORDERED A SECOND ONE TO KEEP IN MY OTHER HOUSE!</li>
            <li> The worst thing about it is the clean and charge unit takes four hours to clean, charge and dry this razor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every other day or its too long for this thing</li>
            <li> This means that there is more pinching and pulling of long whiskers, a very painful experience that the old one did not have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not clean enough after use.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that this shaver is made in Germany, not China like their low-end ones, and although a little pricey, after a $50 promo certificate, it essentially put the price within reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the base is large, and the refills for the cleaning solution are a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> After a few years of using another Braun foil shaver, it just didn&#x27;t have the power of its earlier days.  </li>
            <li> spent hours on Amazon looking at diffeent shavers, reading the reviews, looking for problems, before settling on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After researching and taking my time carefully considering all options I decided to purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had my unit for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see the need to give it a bath so soon.</li>
            <li> The cost between both units was minimal</li>
            <li> You could save yourself a few bucks if you get the 570 over this one as the only difference seems to be the cleaning LED on the shaver.</li>
            <li> ONLY: When I went to the store to see nearly all of the current shavers on the market - models from Remington to Philips to Braun to weird names</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried in shower or set up the wet cleaning system.</li>
            <li> However, I am also bald (partially by choice), so I use the shaver on my head as well.  </li>
            <li> I figured the time would be well spent on the razor since its something I use every day.</li>
            <li> have no real cons that I can think of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought the Braun series 5 for our mentally challanged son in June and have had to replace the screen and cutter twice already.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> , I have no real problems or praises.</li>
            <li> It did what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> It was OK.The shaver did what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> so, made in China!&lt;br /&gt;I would not have spent my money, had I known that</li>
            <li> but that’s not really what it’s made for</li>
            <li> The charging base is too big, but it sure is convenient to just pull the shaver out and not worry about the charging cord.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable that a more expensive product 10 years down the road is inferior to a predecessor.</li>
            <li> It cuts all hairs, even the difficult ones on my neck, is small and compact and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> The motor is not strong enough - if you miss a day of shaving and you go at it with this it will grab a hair and pull it rather than cut it...pathetic for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have had my 5-590cc for 8 months and found a very small metal strip on bathroom rug recently that is same width as shaver screen indicating that it should have come from the Braun shaver screen.  </li>
            <li> While I think the panasonic may offer a slightly closer shave overall, the braun shavers do the job in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a braun syncro for ~ 8-10 years (i dont remember exactly how long) before the button started to fail</li>
            <li> I have a few spots on my neck where my whiskers lay down, and with my last shaver, I had to use the pop-up trimmer to get them.  </li>
            <li> After 10 years the battery was starting to fail and I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Despite my disappointment with today&#x27;s cheap China-quality construction standards, I was determined to find out if I should go with one of the newer P&amp;G derived fake Brauns, or a REAL Braun model from the mid-80&#x27;s;</li>
            <li> Other Thoughts:  </li>
            <li> -It is also simple to wash by hand (rinse, dry, disassemble, brush clean, reassemble) and the manual isn&#x27;t worthless.  </li>
            <li> Every other electric razor I&#x27;ve owned (</li>
            <li> but I was never satisfied and always came back to Braun.</li>
            <li> I believe it gives me a closer shave than the other 2 Braun&#x27;s I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other electric shavers and they don&#x27;t come close to the shave that the Braun does.</li>
            <li> (Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on this product due to the alcohol reservoir</li>
            <li> Yea, it has the cleaner charger stand and other accessories that come with it -</li>
            <li> that was happening with the other brands and a close shave.</li>
            <li> The price seemed steep compared to all the other choices, but after having received and used it that doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> third change is that the body has fancy electronics to switch it on and off, something completely unnecessary and probably responsible for the slow motor.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my review would help anyone since this is the ONLY electric razor my husband has used.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to go with the 5 series-590cc to surprise my husband for his promotion at work.</li>
            <li> If I use the Braun every other day it pulls my hair on parts of my beard.</li>
            <li> The product eventually broke and their service center couldn&#x27;t repair it - so I bought this...definitely not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> written.)&lt;br /&gt;I believe this throws into sharp focus</li>
            <li> You always had to go up and down and back and forth until your skin was raw.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very poor shave, leaving highly visible hair even after going over the same area a half dozen times.</li>
            <li> I only got 3 cleanings out of it before the unit failed completely, 2 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to give a close enough shave, however,the base unit is cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li> This Braun 590cc is,in my experience, performs below average compared to various models of Panasonic shavers that I have used over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> The base unit makes recharge simple and provides an efficient way to keep the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> Other razors (both bladed and electric) can yank the odd hair</li>
            <li> It cut about the same, came with the base to self clean, and was half the price.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time, for me usually about 11 days before I have to charge it, so that is defiantly</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say thats negative about this razor and any electronic razor.....  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m smarter than the average bears around here.</li>
            <li> So, unfortunately, I had to return the 590 and spend twice as much to get another 7 series.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you are expecting to use the trimmer and have any sort of thick facial hair, it can&#x27;t even handle the mildest of beard trimming without getting caught up.  </li>
            <li> It may take a dozen or more attempts to seat the shaver in the base for it to recognize the shaver and do anything.  </li>
            <li> I like the cleaning system because after each shave I return the unit back to its base to recharge and self-clean and its ready to go the next time</li>
            <li> Under 21st century P&amp;G, it is now a text book example of ugly bad design, violating every single one of Ram&#x27;s 10 tenets of good design.</li>
            <li> I just think that Braun has it down.</li>
            <li> It never let me down....</li>
            <li> Only complaint was if you pushed it too hard, it might nick or burn occasionally, or if my beard was three-day growth, it could pull a little.</li>
            <li> It took less time to shave than with a non electric razor, and gave comparable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can be used plugged in with the cord, in case the battery gradually starts holding less and less of a charge.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought one at the store and it did not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I had brauns previously.</li>
            <li> Did not unpack it, could not care less.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it still takes a while, but much less time and abrasion</li>
            <li> Even after owning a Braun previously, my face would still burn in some spots after shaving (with the 590cc)...</li>
            <li> A razor less than a month shouldn&#x27;t need the cutter replaced just because the screen rips.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is there are the select few hairs that it just don&#x27;t seem to cut</li>
            <li> It never pulls my hair and gives a closer shave in less time.</li>
            <li> it’s just over half a quart</li>
            <li> Will a razor you can pick up at Sam’s Club for less than $2 (in quantity) shave your face?  </li>
            <li> I am wring this to help black men to know that they have a choice.</li>
            <li> I looked online and for black men</li>
            <li> The Opti-foil with larger openings lets my thick beard into the cutting head, while the active lift helps raise the beard out of those neck creases resulting in a close, and much quicker shave.  </li>
            <li> only negative comments, after owning the razor for about two weeks, is that the clean-and-renew system is a little gimmicky.</li>
            <li> The charging station is a little odd with the liquid.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave twice as hard and twice as long, often missing spots......</li>
            <li> Though the shaver continued to work, it would not clean.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I use wood grain alcohol (the type used for the little smokeless fireplaces) with a dab of McCormick orange or lemon extract.  </li>
            <li> I have had this one a little over a year.</li>
            <li> This means that unless you always remember to change out the water after 4-5 days, things start to get a little funky.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The difference in close-ness was negligible, but I think the Braun was a little closer.    </li>
            <li> ,it  could shave a little closer around the mouth if it did i would rate it five stars</li>
            <li> I have had two other  Braun Shavers in the past</li>
            <li> They actually made something that works a lot worse than the technology they used 20 years ago, and made the battery half the life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look forward to shaving because it hurts too much and because the result is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> I prefer a Braun over circular shavers, but have not owned a Remington for quite a few years to know if it is comparable to the Braun or not.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric shaver before and was told it would take a few weeks for my face to adapt.</li>
            <li> But I stuck with it after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Each time I shave it plucks a few hairs out by the root.  </li>
            <li> I RECENTLY BOUGHT A REMINGTON SHAVER AND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> - Cleaning base looks and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> Although the razor said it was fully charged, it ran out of power after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Holding up well after a few years.</li>
            <li> or they just sent the poor product back to me.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is essentially a really cheap looking injection-molded piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> To keep the cleaning fluid from evaporating, simply remove it from the base in between cleanings and put the lid it came with back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit a few weeks</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day/Birthday gift (he picked it out), he has no issues with it and uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I would have to pay $15 for shipping cost and have nothing but wasted time and disapointment to show for it.  </li>
            <li> The base looks and feels cheap, almost like it was an after thought.</li>
            <li> and this is the second worse shaver I have bought from them.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I wasted over $100 to find this out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The self cleaning base is really convenient, quiet and efficient.  </li>
            <li> The charging system suspends the razor upside down over a small container of what appears to be a dilute isopropyl solution.  </li>
            <li> Also, in order to make the clean function work, I have to unplug the base unit and then plug it in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed to stop shaving with a razor,my face was getting raw after 50 years of shavin w/a razor.</li>
            <li> The charging cord has also gotten shorter - If the battery is dead, it is difficult to shave with the thing plugged in, unless you hold your face next to the wall.  </li>
            <li> I am also unhappy that it takes so long for the shaver to dry after the cleaning.</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave with a little stubble or thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> , I can not find where to small piece came from.</li>
            <li> I usually have to adjust it a couple times to get the process started.</li>
            <li> I also agree with an earlier comment about the cleaning system being a rip-off!  </li>
            <li> I have a beard and only use it to shave my neck which has a lot of difficult hairs.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Series 5 590cc after careful review because I got tired of the cuts and scrapes that come with using a blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what to think about the cleaning solution that you need to buy.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get cut that close on the days I feel like being lazy and give my face a break from the blade.   </li>
            <li> (I have a goatee usually, so I want to get close to it with control and accuracy)  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to mention that I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic Arc IV shaver in the past, as well.  </li>
            <li> After initially using the norelco, I thought maybe I had made the wrong decision.</li>
            <li> No more buyers remorse</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the design or the perceived lack of quality.  </li>
            <li> but I bought this one this past January</li>
            <li> The sides of the cutting head are fixed so even though the foil flexes it does not flow well across the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the charge and cleaning stand is disappointing, compared with 8585 cleaning stand, which is by far the benchmark of all cleaning stand from Philips/Braun/Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 7680, this shaver gives a very poor shave, has horrible ergonomics, vibrates a ton more, and overall just does not get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Only other negative thing was replacement foil/cutter were expensive!    </li>
            <li> In addition to charging (which happens automatically upon depositing the razor in the stand) another button push starts a cleaning process which floods all the cutting heads with the solution and vibrates to get all the prickly little hairs out allowing you, potentially, to weigh them</li>
            <li> Upon only the second use of the \\&quot;base charging/cleansing unit\\&quot;, the button got stuck in and the charging and cleansing features do not work.  </li>
            <li> Now, to save space (I guess), they put the charging transformer in the cord, making it a clumsy POS, that&#x27;s expensive to buy if you want an extra for the car.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, I would guess the higher price for the Braun is based not on the razor, but on the gadgetry associated with the base.</li>
            <li> First the cleaning function in the base unit quit, then it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> As disappointed as I was in the performance of the stand, both Braun and Amazon were both extremely fast to offer a solution to the problem.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding between 4 or 5 stars</li>
            <li> No razor burn afterwards, but the razor just glides over my face, even the hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li> Its blades must have been dull, and when I used its trimmer, I ended up looking like I tried to hang myself.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s hard to beat the closeness of the old-fashioned manual shaver, this is as close as it gets.</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 weeks with it, maybe 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought at least 10 since 1990.</li>
            <li> My dad bought a Braun shaver sometime in the late 1970s (think it may have been called an Eltron then).</li>
            <li> At least now I know.</li>
            <li> At least now I know.</li>
            <li> With a complex switch it wore out and broke.  </li>
            <li> At least for me and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair growth by any stretch of the imagination.  </li>
            <li> The marketing con jobs will convince them they are losers with outdated shavers.</li>
            <li> It even works with a two to three day beard provided it is not to thick.</li>
            <li> The shaver sits head down in the base unit so the bottom of the shaver is 8 3/4\\&quot; above the counter.</li>
            <li> Another problem with the newer style cutter, is the cutter block is narrower than the foil down both sides, so the razor won&#x27;t cut out to the edges of the head - WTF, Braun??</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to read the fluid level</li>
            <li> I was having serious buyers remorse and thinking about returning it and getting something else.</li>
            <li> a little expensive</li>
            <li> I still think its a waste to have to buy the cleaning stand and expensive cleaning solution, when its not needed.  </li>
            <li> it can be charged directly without using the base when I travel.</li>
            <li> Things I didn&#x27;t like were that it was relatively expensive and the cleaning station base footprint was large.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Use this bad boy almost every single day</li>
            <li> Braun overall has been a very disappointing experience for me.</li>
            <li> You now have the option of using the shaver multiple times before cleaning in the base.  </li>
            <li> The power does nothing except perhaps internally short circuit the base.  </li>
            <li> Not great</li>
            <li> I thought the middle wiskar cutter was horse crap</li>
            <li> I really want to like this, but it has a horrible time shaving my neck.  </li>
            <li> with the base it does not matter at home, only when I travel.</li>
            <li> The button looked and felt like poor quality.</li>
            <li> It so poor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to a system without a self cleaning base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told this problem isn&#x27;t typical of the razor and that I just got a bad one.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of Norelco shavers and the expensive replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst Braun razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> It is bulkier than in the past and the design of the cutting head seems flawed to me .  </li>
            <li> Braun replaced the base unit, but the problems have begun all over again with the new base unit.  </li>
            <li> I have little or no issues with my shaver or the base unit.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but works well.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical of the pivoting head razors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they have not been good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was time to replace</li>
            <li> I am sorry...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wooed by hi tech gimmicks, flashy lights and garish designs.</li>
            <li> shaver didn&#x27;t cut, what else is there to say, oh yeh it was expensive.</li>
            <li> For being so freakin&#x27; expensive I was expecting quite a lot.</li>
            <li> Very poor cutting ability.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DIDN&#x27;T SHAVE EVERY DAY,  IT HAD PROBLEMS CUTTING LONGER HAIR.  </li>
            <li> Electrics would just glide over the face cutting some here and some there.</li>
            <li> I am afraid not.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating and often painful - I DREADED the Monday morning shave!</li>
            <li> Bad experience.</li>
            <li> This razor with 51S cutter block is awful - shave is not close and irritating.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked and amazed.</li>
            <li> And was immediately disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You want be disappointed if y purchase one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the performance of my series 5 shaver.  </li>
            <li> :-(.</li>
            <li> In all, I have to say my loyalty to Braun is gone :-(.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in the shaver.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this Braun product.</li>
            <li> No quessing when to re-charge put in the base</li>
            <li> - Base unit does automatic cleaning to keep the shave</li>
            <li> Now the charging base has stopped working.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind charging it with the A/C cord, you can put the base unit away for another day when cleaning is needed.     </li>
            <li> As fate would have it, my daughter knocked the shaver and base (</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers for 25 years and this was a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a horrible service!</li>
            <li> Never mind the fact that they ALL had awful, garish designs that would make Dieter Rams take a sledgehammer to them all.</li>
            <li> battery life is just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My last razor older 8000 the battery would last nearly seven days!  I take it to work with me. It would last all week!  The battery in the model barely lasts 3 days, and I don&#x27;t see God when I shave with it.  Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> My husband had a Braun shaver before that lasted for years, that is why we purchased this Braun.  After 3 days of use it quit working.  It is now back at Braun for a repair or refund.  This is not the quality of Braun shaver we have come to expect.</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun and turned to Braun when my old razor died.  I get clean comfortable shaves even if I don&#x27;t shave for 3 days.  I have had my 5-590cc for 8 months and found a very small metal strip on bathroom rug recently that is same width as shaver screen indicating that it should have come from the Braun shaver screen.  However, the quality of my shaves has not been affected and comparing it with my old Braun screen, I can not find where to small piece came from.</li>
            <li> This razor is acut above the electric razors that i have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It is smoother and i shave quicker.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It cuts all hairs, even the difficult ones on my neck, is small and compact and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Good shaving system. Results in a clean smooth shave. Probably somewhat over priced but all in all a good shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a closer shave than my old rotary shaver.  Also, the semi-auto clean is wonderful.  I like having a clean shaver every morning. The original blades lasted over two years. I just replaced them.</li>
            <li> While the Braun shaver is not the top of the line, it is quite an improvement from the Braun shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 6 or 7 years.  I like the shape of it and its ease with which to shave.    I only wish the head had another row or two for sensitive skin like mine.  I have to be quite careful in how I use this new shaver.  I can&#x27;t &#x27;rush&#x27; my shave time otherwise it will knick my skin now and then.    I prefer a Braun over circular shavers, but have not owned a Remington for quite a few years to know if it is comparable to the Braun or not.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best shaver ever. I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers before, but none of them come close to the shave I get with the Series 5. It is nearly equal to shaving with a blade. Yes, the base is large, and the refills for the cleaning solution are a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it. The cleaning routine keeps the shaver in tip top shape. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The device works very well.  I am very surprised that is seems to work better than a blade ( Mach 3).  It is important to set to the closest position to get this effect.  I did not experience any razor burn or skin chaffing.  The only negative is that it is expensive and for optimum performance needs supplies for the clean and renew system.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! He was using an old Norelco before and this was a huge upgrade for him! The self cleaning base is really convenient, quiet and efficient.  He has had it for a month so far and no problems or concerns have come up. He even has sensitive skin but the switch between razors wasn&#x27;t a problem and he had no razor burn or anything. It comes with a small travel case and is easy to shave on-the-go. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got tired of Norelco shavers and the expensive replacement blades.  I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and since Braun is a name I associate with quality, I bought this razor.    And was immediately disappointed.  You can eventually get a good shave with this razor, but you will go over and over and over the same spot.  It takes a really long time--much longer than my old Norelco.  Eventually I took to having a manual razor and shaving cream for days when I didn&#x27;t have much time.  Eventually, I used the disposable razor most days.    I mentioned this to a friend and he&#x27;d had the exact same experience switching from Norelco to Braun.     I have now retired this model in favor of a brand new Norelco--which has a similar self cleaning system.  I cannot recommend this razor--buy a Norelco</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave which my husband likes.  He is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an aging Remington Microscreen 2, and I had been eyeing the Braun 5-series for some time, mainly due to the &#x27;Power Comb&#x27; that&#x27;s supposed to lift up and trim hairs that are lying flat.  I have a few spots on my neck where my whiskers lay down, and with my last shaver, I had to use the pop-up trimmer to get them.  Now that I own this shaver, I am pleased to report that said power comb works.  It sometimes takes a few passes, but I no longer have to use the trimmer to get the really stubborn whiskers.  In addition, this shaver is much quieter and has gentler vibration than my last one, but still gets the job done easily.  Finally, the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; system leaves the shaver feeling like new for the next shave, which is really nice.  The only negative, really, is the price.  Over a hundred is a lot to pay for a shaver.  Thankfully, this is a really good shaver.  If it lasts, it&#x27;ll be worth the money.</li>
            <li> Age: 21  Complexion: Clear Skin  Facial Hair: Full  I recently purchased this on Amazon for a fraction of the price ($130 instead of $230) and I must say it has been worth every penny. I switched from Gillette Pro Fusion to the Braun 590cc and it has made a world of improvement. After the first use, my face felt soft and smooth instead of the sleek and smooth feeling I got from the Gillette. There was no skin irritation and the shave may be closer than the Gillette.  Pros:  -Quick and Easy (dry shave)  -Durable and Low Maintenance (18 months per blade change, self-cleaning, and solid/weighted feel)  -Very close shave (gets all those hard to reach hairs and more)  -Long battery life (great for camping)  -Sensitivity function is actually effective  Cons:  -Self-cleaning function is loud and could be problematic for light sleepers in a nearby room.  -Have to replace the self-cleaning trays every month if used daily (although that&#x27;s still less than paying for new razor blades)  Other Thoughts:  -It is also simple to wash by hand (rinse, dry, disassemble, brush clean, reassemble) and the manual isn&#x27;t worthless.  -If I wasn&#x27;t a student and had more time and money, I would spring for a straight razor kit (professional) or a safety razor kit (enthusiast) for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding between 4 or 5 stars but I went with 5 because the shaver is what I wanted and the shaver is awesome. The reason I debated giving it a lower rating was because I am not as happy with the charging/cleaning station. But that isn&#x27;t what made me buy the razor anyway so 5 stars it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shaver; This thing is awesome. I have not used an electric shaver before and was told it would take a few weeks for my face to adapt. After the first couple shaves I was skeptical as getting a good shave was not easy at all. But I stuck with it after a few weeks and I started getting very close shaves. Maybe not as close as with a real razor but close enough to make me happy and I am getting the results very quickly. I used to dread shaving and would not do it every day but this makes my life much easier. I have also always have had problems shaving my neck but I don&#x27;t have any issues with that using this shaver. I could not be happier than I am with the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station however is a different story. First I will admit that I have noticed that the cleaning does seem to make a difference. I went a week without cleaning the shaver in the station and I noticed that shaving became easier as soon as I used it again. The station itself is cheap plastic (as are so many things now) and the shaver must be in exactly the right position to activate the cleaning process. I usually have to adjust it a couple times to get the process started. I am also unhappy that it takes so long for the shaver to dry after the cleaning. I read some other reviews that said an older system had an active drying process and I wish this did as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the carrying case is nice but there is no room for the wall charger in it. The good news is that I have been able to go for a week without charging so on short trips the wall charger probably isn&#x27;t really needed anyway.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this shaver.  This shaver has no power whatsoever.  Each time I shave it plucks a few hairs out by the root.  I do not have thick hair growth by any stretch of the imagination.  I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers before and had no problem.  Go for the cheaper models, they seem to work better.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun self cleaning shaver.  This Series 5 razor is the best yet, great shave and it cleans itself to boot.  No quessing when to re-charge put in the base and it keeps it charged.  My only issue is the power cord plug is quite bulky and stick out from the outlet.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 5510 for many years and it always gave a very close shave so I decided to get this shaver because it was ranked 1st by a recent Consumer Reports that I have.  I also got the Remington MicroScreen MS2-390 for my girlfriend because it was ranked 2nd in the same report.  Every time I used the more expensive Braun Series 5 590cc, I would use the Remington after that to see if it would get anything else and it did.  The Remington gave a noticeably much closer shave. I want to hear the hairs going through the screen and you do with the Remington at only 1/3 the price.  I was stumped until I tried something.     I had some leftover replacement blades for my Braun 5510 and decided to replace one of those blades with the one that came with the Braun Series 5 590cc and the difference was totally amazing.  It shaved just as close as the Remington.  You can see the difference in the blades by looking at them on the ends, but they both fit perfectly.  Make the change and you&#x27;ll see the difference.     I also agree with an earlier comment about the cleaning system being a rip-off!  Just use the brush and a can of compressed air once in while and you&#x27;ll be fine.  I might try the cleaning system once a month or longer, but right now I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works best on dry beard.  Cleaning system makes maintenance easy.  More easily fits the hand than the older versions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for more than 10 years, this is my 3rd and always trying to upgrade the previous one, not for malfuntioning just because i wanted a new one :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than my previuos one (5000 serie). Quicker, smoothier. I&#x27;ll recommend Braun always and this one is an excellent example.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but works well. Easy to clean. New body style is easier to hold.  My last Braun worked fine for 15 years until it needed a new battery for the charge to last more than a few days.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for over two months, I have to say this is by far the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned. Over the years I&#x27;ve switched back and forth, from blades to electric and back again (and again), but this razor will probably keep me humming along for a long time. It not only gives a great shave, but it does so even after 2 or 3 days without shaving, when my whiskers are much longer than normal. My last electric was a Remington and would pull on long whiskers. It was very frustrating and often painful - I DREADED the Monday morning shave! And the Remington lasted barely more than a year (WITH a few blade &amp; screen changes along the way). It had a rubber seal that wore out and allowed beard clippings to accumulate in the body of the razor. That started interfering with the operation and it was all downhill from there. I took it apart end cleaned it out once, but it was clear that the end was near. The design of this Braun looks like it will not be susceptible to the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about the Braun, since I also shave my head, is the fact that it handles everything from the stiffest beard to the fine hairs on the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What might be the Braun&#x27;s BEST feature is that it&#x27;s the quietest electric I&#x27;ve ever used. Every other electric razor I&#x27;ve owned (a few each of Remington &amp; Norelco) were very noisy. I actually worried that they would damage my hearing (they might even be partly responsible for my tinnitus - who knows???). But this Braun doesn&#x27;t **BUZZ** like the others. It&#x27;s more like a dull hum. I don&#x27;t worry at all about using it near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the cleaning system seems to be OK. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost and expensive bathroom counter space, but it does make the razor smell good. I do NOT use it daily as suggested, but once a week seems to be OK. I figure a $6 refill every month or two won&#x27;t break the bank. I&#x27;m getting them through subscribe and save, so I catch a price break there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor. I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor. That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I&#x27;m glad I did. When it dies I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.razor. I know $200 is pretty steep for a razor. That&#x27;s the first thing I thought, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I&#x27;m glad I did. When it dies I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.</li>
            <li> I have owned three braun shavers and three norelco shavers in the last ten (10) years.  this is the very best.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you are expecting to use the trimmer and have any sort of thick facial hair, it can&#x27;t even handle the mildest of beard trimming without getting caught up.  It does a decent job at close shaving with the foil part, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor to replace my rotary Norelco that I can&#x27;t get blades for anymore. Cut OK on my face but never did very well on my neck. I have very sensitive skin and thick hair. This thing took me twice as long as my old razor to shave and never would cut as close. Made my skin so sensitive that when I shaved before going to bed my face was still hurting in the morning. I am taking this thing back and sticking with a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Does a fantastic job.  Feels smooth, none of the painful razor burns you get with cheap electric razors.  Close clean shave, the powerful but quiet motor works well.  I would have given Braun 5 stars except for the costs of the cleaning solution refills.  To save money I&#x27;m doing what others have suggested, wash the plastic tanks and refill with alcohol.  I use wood grain alcohol (the type used for the little smokeless fireplaces) with a dab of McCormick orange or lemon extract.  As a bonus my Braun came with the pocket razor for free, nice for traveling.</li>
            <li> working great!!! pouch exist but not exist blade protection cap.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun for many years. Twice I purchased a Norelco but I was never satisfied and always came back to Braun. The most serious competition came when my wife purchased a top of the line Panasonic. I used it for quite a while and it seemed very good but the more I used it, the more I wanted a Braun. I just think that Braun has it down. They last a long time; they&#x27;re really comfortable to shave with and they do a great job. The series 5 is a marked improvement over my last Braun and over the Panasonic. I probably will not try anything else again.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun Shaver that I have owned. Like always very easy to use and clean. The Series 5 is even better because you have a cleaning solution station built right in the charger holder. As long as Braun makes shavers I wouldn&#x27;t own any other.</li>
            <li> I have owned this shaver for two weeks now and does a fantastic job. I have little or no issues with my shaver or the base unit.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its okay. should have paid the extra $20 and gotten the better one</li>
            <li> it works pretty good,reliable and not bad for $60.00.i had the 7 series that i lost and that was great machine!!!  i bought this cause it was on sale and like i said its ok.</li>
            <li> Just a word of warning for this shaver kit.  Amazon does not accept it as a return because of the &#x27;hazardous material&#x27; it contains.  I guess that means the cleaning fluid it comes with.  So make sure you want it before you order it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad who is 70. It worked great for the first couple times but now it runs slow and makes an odd humming sound. I think this is because the self cleaning head/liquid has become clogged and I can&#x27;t seem to clean it well enough for him to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all the shaver is a terrific night light for the bathroom.  The cool blue glow from the LED that illuminates the cleaning solution level makes it easy to find the bathroom in the dark.  In addition to the night light, the series 5 gives a darn good shave.  The battery in my 10year-old Braun finally reached the point where it no longer held a charge.  I hope my replacement lasts as long.  It took a couple of weeks to get used to the new ergonomic streamlined handle and flex-head adjustment switch, but I am adapting well.  I miss the fluid level indicator in the cleaning reservoir, but that may still be available on the more expensive models.  I have not yet had to replace the cleaning cartridge, but the cartridge itself is the same as my former shaver, so I was able to use already purchased cartridges.  The new model has a head replacement indicator light which should be good feature if indeed it does come on 18 months from now. I am pleased with the Braun Series 5 shaver, because it gives me a good, clean, and quick shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a bit too early to give this a comprehensive &#x27;two thumbs up&#x27; review -- I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so -- but it seems to be at least the equal of the Braun shaver that it replaced.  Relatively quiet, it gives as good a shave as any electric (and I&#x27;ve had most of them over the years), I&#x27;ll be curious how it holds up to the tough treatment of my travel.  The case is the best I&#x27;ve seen -- attractive and offering good protection.  The cleaner is good.  (Tip: remove and re-seal the solution container between cleanings.  Because it is alcohol-based, you&#x27;ll avoid losing a lot to the atmosphere, thus saving money on solution purchases.)    The only reason that I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I&#x27;ve never seen any electric that gives a 5 star shave.  This, however, seems to be as good as could be reasonably expected.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd new Braun shaver and I am very pleased with the shave it gives me.  I believe it gives me a closer shave than the other 2 Braun&#x27;s I have owned.  I have tried other electric shavers and they don&#x27;t come close to the shave that the Braun does.</li>
            <li> This is the most $$ I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric shaver. I came from a relatively inexpensive Norelco to opt for this one hoping for really great shaves. I&#x27;ve had this for about 9 months now and just can&#x27;t get a close shave. I got a closer shave from the Norelco at about 1/4 the price. I followed the advise of those that said you need to acclimate your beard to a new shaver. After 9 months I can say I&#x27;ve done that.  The best shave I get is if I shave every day and even then it&#x27;s not as close as the Norelco. If you are the type that doesn&#x27;t shave every day then this razor is not for you as it does not handle longer hairs very well. Lots of pain as it pulls the longer hairs rather than shaving them.  I&#x27;m going back to the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers for 25 years and this was a real disappointment. I sent it back straight away and have been using my old Braun shaver. Lucky I kept it. What a shame. Seems like Braun has cheapened its shavers.    (Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on this product due to the alcohol reservoir so I had to send it to Braun - what a pain)</li>
            <li> Coming from a Norelco rotary shaver years ago, this was a huge improvement.  It gets close to the skin and you can pop the top off and rinse it when you&#x27;re done.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It is generally nice and I like the blue light in the self clean system. Shaving not as good as I expected. Feels good on face but I don&#x27;t really like braun&#x27;s vibration. Maybe I expect too much when transferred from Philips. In all, good product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver out of hopes that the Braun name would live up to their quality and price hype. I was very disappointed. My 3 year old Norelco rotary shaver does better on the neckline than this shaver. Nothing really stands out for this shaver. Yea, it has the cleaner charger stand and other accessories that come with it - but I want something that shaves. And honestly, compared to most men I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, so it should be easy for this shaver to take care of - but it fails. It does a good job above the neck, but that has never been the issue. The question at hand for any shaver is can it get the neckline below your chin? Braun series 5 fails at this which is why I give it only 2 stars - especially if my 3 year old Norelco rotary does a better job. Braun overall has been a very disappointing experience for me.</li>
            <li> Have had this shaver for a month now and it&#x27;s excellent; it cuts as close as a blade shave, at least for me, it is smooth and, with three swivel head settings, it shaves all areas of the face equally well. Cleanup is easy with the cleaning cartridges which I use due to the hard water we have - that causes buildup on the razor foil and cutters if you use our water. Had a 360 complete before this and it lasted over 8 years. Very satisfied with the series 5 razor.</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY BOUGHT A REMINGTON SHAVER AND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.  IF YOU DIDN&#x27;T SHAVE EVERY DAY,  IT HAD PROBLEMS CUTTING LONGER HAIR.  THE BRAUN HAD NO SUCH PROBLEMS AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use and gives a nice close shave.  The base unit makes recharge simple and provides an efficient way to keep the shaver clean.  Combine that with a great price makes this a Great Value.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Series 5; and, yes, it is smooth.  The reason why it is so smooth is you don&#x27;t get a close shave.  I had to go over the same area several times in order to get an acceptable shave.  I also have a Remington micro-screen and get a faster and much closer shave with fewer strokes with the older Remington.  In hindsight, I would guess the higher price for the Braun is based not on the razor, but on the gadgetry associated with the base.</li>
            <li> Well Ive been using this Braun shaver for about a week now, it is very good. Cuts easy, cleans nice. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my series 3985 fixed and Braun suggested this.  Got a price of $109. Which is great. Easy to use, on board indicators good. Cuts as good as older unit and quieter.  I leave it on medium setting. The more expensive one has many geek features. This one gets the job done. No need to go broke. The renew clean unit is quieter.  You can even use same cleaner cartridges as with older renew&#x27;/charge bases. If your face is used to this there is no breakin period!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new shaver, the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my old razor Norelco.</li>
            <li> After a few years of using another Braun foil shaver, it just didn&#x27;t have the power of its earlier days.  I decided to get their newer model and, while I&#x27;m not unhappy with it, I&#x27;m not thrilled for the price either.  I have a beard and only use it to shave my neck which has a lot of difficult hairs.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do expect it to cut 2-day growth for about [...] bucks.    Pros:      - Shaver is solid, ergonomic, and has good power.  - Base unit does automatic cleaning to keep the shave consistent and shaver in good working condition  - Shaver can be used while plugged in    Cons:     - Cleaning base looks and feels cheap.  They should have used stainless steel or something much cooler looking to match the shaver.    - Charge light blinks and is distracting.  Lights should have been more stylish    - For the price, doesn&#x27;t deliver on tougher beard hairs.    - Price    &#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;  On the whole, I like the shaver and I imagine most people will find it works really well.  For that price, though, I really should have just gotten my previous model which was:    Braun Syncro Smart Logic Shaving System, Model 7526 Sl    It cut about the same, came with the base to self clean, and was half the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor recently and it worked well for three weeks, then the problems began.  First the cleaning function in the base unit quit, then it stopped charging.  Braun replaced the base unit, but the problems have begun all over again with the new base unit.  Although the razor said it was fully charged, it ran out of power after a few seconds.  Also, in order to make the clean function work, I have to unplug the base unit and then plug it in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I will contact Braun again and hope for the best, but reliability is important and thus far I have not had that with this razor.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver. After years of using a rotary shaver, this was a pleasent surprize.  I like that you can rinse it off with hot water and only use the cleaning solution every other week or so.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very smooth on the face, does not irritate my skin and the cleaner is nice to have to keep the machine clean.</li>
            <li> When my old Braun electric shaver died after almost three years of faithful service, I began searching the net for its replacement.  I was very pleased to find the Series 5 and even more pleased when it arrived.  It is lighter and is slighty curved along the verticle axis, which makes it much easier to hold.  It provides a very comfortable shave.  A significant improvement has been made in the cleaning method.  You now have the option of using the shaver multiple times before cleaning in the base.  You can rinse it out under running water.  This extends the life of the cleaning cartridges and reduces the overall maintenance costs.  I was very impressed with the fast delivery.  My item arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My old Braun (I think it was the 6552) died after *14* years.  The battery had not been holding the charge as well, so I would shave with it plugged in, and one day it stopped.  A great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours on Amazon looking at diffeent shavers, reading the reviews, looking for problems, before settling on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/17/11&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;First shave - Amazingly close on the face, I could have spent more time under the chin to  get it smoother, but it was still ok.  Very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  It took less time to shave than with a non electric razor, and gave comparable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is fine for sideburns, neck har.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice Ergonomic feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used plugged in with the cord, in case the battery gradually starts holding less and less of a charge.  Thus extending the useful life of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;No plastic cover for the head, which means it may get dented/nicked and that could render the foil unusable.  My old Braun had a snap over plasic cover.  It would have added 10 cents to the cost to include such a plastic cover, and I&#x27;d much rather have it than some bulky box with air, or a color brochure that I throw away.&lt;br /&gt;I tried my old plastic cover, but its around 2 millimeters too short on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont need the cleaning sysytem. The only reason I bought this model, instead of one $24 cheaper, is it seemed like it was better.  The cleaning system is big and bulky.  It&#x27;s one more thing to stow somewhere, or take up precious counter top space. To make teh cleaning fluid last longer I only use it when recharging, then I recap the plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems fragile - if you drop it, it could be the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is listed as 45 minutes while my older Braun had a supposed life of 60 minutes.  Not that big a deal, just recharge it more frequently.  I get at least 3 weeks with it, maybe 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is a bit high.  Giveme similar quality, but keep the recharging stand, and cleaner and knock of $20 from the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am quite satisfied.  The width is about the same as the old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Is it a bit louder tahn my old Braun?  Maybe, but with the bathroom door closed, its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/28/2011&lt;br /&gt;I very much like this razor.  Maybe I should rate it a 5 instead of a 4.  I still think its a waste to have to buy the cleaning stand and expensive cleaning solution, when its not needed.  Keep that and drop the price by $20 and its 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is not at par, it is not completly useful.i didn&#x27;t use the item as per defined in the instrunction.  overall there is no any return policy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been checking reviews, etc to try and determine the best shaver to replace my current one.  After seeing the tour of the Braun factory on the History channel, I decided to purchase the Braun.  I must say I am not disappointed, for I have found it far superior to any of the previously owned electric shavers.  You want be disappointed if y purchase one.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these earlier this year. The shaver was fine -- what you&#x27;d expect from an electric. I cleaned it several times without a problem... and then!  Though the shaver continued to work, it would not clean. No matter how many times I tried... nothing.  So I called the repair number. Well, most important, the designated repairer is not a Braun entity, they farm it out, and the person had only a passing familiarity with the product. AND, the nearest location to me was in Columbia, SC. I live in western NC--about as far away as you can get and still be in the Carolinas.  I described the problem but they had no answer. I persuaded them to send me a new cleaning element which they finally did. Still nothing. I called back again but they were no help.    So, now I  have a shaver that works pretty well and several bottles of unusable cleaning liquid.  As I wrote in the headline: DON&#x27;T!</li>
            <li> I have had this Shaver for a month now and I must say it is the best one yet of the 2 that I previously owned prior to this one. My last Braun one was a 9595 pulsonic model and it was great compared to the Norelco I had prior to it. However after 2 years the trimmer on it broke and then a year later the shaver simply quit. Norelco Shavers irritate my face, so I never considered another Norelco, but did another Braun because of the close shave they give plus they don&#x27;t irritate my face.     Of the so many models that Braun offers (in fact too many models) it took me a few days to decide which one to get and I finally decided on the 590cc series one. Meanwhile I had to shave with a blade razor and of coarse it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model even though my old 9595 pulsonic model gave a really close shave.     Well, to my surprise, my new Braun 590cc model isn&#x27;t even pulsonic and it gave me a closer shave than my old 9595 pulsonic model did. Here is the unbelievable part about my new Braun 590cc shaver .... it gives me as close if not closer shave than my Gillette 5 Blade Razor did. I am overly happy with my new Braun 590cc shaver and really glad I picked this model.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED MANY ELECTRIC SHAVERS , BUT WAS NEVER HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS . I WOULD GO BACK SHAVING WITH A BLADE TO GET THE CLOSE SHAVE I WANTED , BUT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND WOULD GET CUTS EVERY SHAVE . I HAVE READ A LOT ABOUT THE BRAUN ELECTRIC SHAVERS SO I GOT ONE . I SHAVE DAILY AND LIKE A CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE . WELL SINCE DAY ONE I AM 100% HAPPY WITH MY BRAUN SERIES 5 590CC ELECTRIC SHAVER . IT SHAVES CLOSE AND NEVER IRRITATES MY SKIN . SHAVING IS KNOW A JOY AND THE SELF CLEANER IS WONDERFUL . I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITH THE BEST RATING 5 STARS . AMAZON THANKS FOR MAKING IT EASY TO GET THE PRODUCTS I WANT . COULDN&#x27;T FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE ,BUT YOU HAD IT , IN STOCK . IT WAS DELIVERED IN 2 DAYS TO MY FRONT DOOR . THANK YOU AMAZON !!</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.  I replaced a Norelco Arcitec 1060 (I returned that unit under their 45-day money back guarantee) with this unit and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The shaver works quickly, does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  The only negative I have is that the shaver could do a better job on neck hairs, but does as good a job as any other electric I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s operation is also quite quiet for an electric.      Compared to the Norelco Arcitec, it shaves much faster and does a better job on the neck.      The cleaner/charging unit works great as well.  I only use about once a week and just empty the head manually after the other shaves.</li>
            <li> Ended up getting this for $129.99.  To me it is well worth the price.  I love the portability of taking the shaver when I travel on business.  I travel for 4 days and have it fully charged and the charge lasts the entire trip.  Gives me a very close shave.  I love the idea of the cleaning feature, place it in the charger and press the cleaning button and walk away.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the performance of my series 5 shaver.  It works OK, but for the money and the good reviews, I expected better than OK.  My old Panasonic did at least as good a job and is presently considerably cheaper.  The push up trimmer does not work well.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He likes it.  It charges quickly and shaves as close as you could expect for an electric shaver.  The charging station is a little odd with the liquid.  The shaver is very well made, which is a breath of fresh air these days.</li>
            <li> I have tried others like the Norelco and braun is the best.  gentle on the face with no razor burn that was happening with the other brands and a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst Braun razor I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have bought at least 10 since 1990. The worst thing about it is the clean and charge unit takes four hours to clean, charge and dry this razor. Braun needs to come up with a razor to replace the 8995. This razor is a piece of junk compared to the older razors. I want buy another Braun until they do so. The only thing they got right is the trimmer and it really doesn&#x27;t compare to the 8995. Guess I&#x27;ll have to have the batteries and read out screen replaced and look for a replacement when it dies.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shaving products for the last 15 years and I am very happy with the quality, durability and function.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they might be little bit pricey, but they last for many years, if you take care of them. I just retired my Braun, I bought in 1999!&lt;br /&gt;Technology has improved, so did some features, like self cleaning, battery durability, etc.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE AND A VERY CLOSE SHAVE, WENT BACK AN ORDERED A SECOND ONE TO KEEP IN MY OTHER HOUSE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you go to Braun&#x27;s website, this model is promoted with the optifoil. I tried one of these shavers with the optifoil and I liked it, so I bought one from Amazon. But the one Amazon sent me does not have the optifoil head. This one does not give a shave even close to the one with optifoil. Beware of what you buy.</li>
            <li> Because110V cord, I cannot use cormfotable</li>
            <li> Provides a quick, smooth shave.  Light and dependable.  I bought one for my son too and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Renew station for the Series 5 is of exceptionally low quality construction and reliability.  The power does nothing except perhaps internally short circuit the base.  It may take a dozen or more attempts to seat the shaver in the base for it to recognize the shaver and do anything.  I only got 3 cleanings out of it before the unit failed completely, 2 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> Holding up well after a few years.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to give a close enough shave, however,the base unit is cheaply constructed.  Upon only the second use of the \\&quot;base charging/cleansing unit\\&quot;, the button got stuck in and the charging and cleansing features do not work.  You cannot return this item as it contains hazardous materials (cleansing solution) so you actually just end up with the shaver and cord.  Purchased package of three cleansing solution at the same time I purchased the shaver and, of course,  they are now uselss. Very unhappy with this Braun product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the greatest thing I bought with my overtime money, and best of all... It&#x27;s not made in China!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he tried his brother&#x27;s it is a great razor at a great price!! Was alot more expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I had been using another Braun shaver (~$80 in 2001), and I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement blades anymore.  Researched shavers and decided to stick with Braun and get this 5 Series model.  Runs much quieter and seems to cut better at a lower RPM than my old shaver.  The self-cleaning is pretty nice, but it stills leaves some droppings inside the blade assembly that should be removed every week or so.  I also am curious if the cleaning solution causes my skin to break out, but hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem.  Overall, very happy with this shaver!</li>
            <li> I have used Braun Electric Shavers for most of my life. I really like the form, fit and feel of this new shaver however, despite using the clean and lubricate system daily, the shaver started pulling wiskers out instead on cutting them after 5 months.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great. I had previously bought one at the store and it did not give a close shave. This one is easy to use and gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> My dad bought a Braun shaver sometime in the late 1970s (think it may have been called an Eltron then). He had great luck with it, so he gave me one for Christmas in the late 1980s. Great razor, especially if you let your beard go too many days, you could pop up the trimmer, and lay the razor at the right angle to let it cut the long hairs, afterwhich the foil part would shave the stubble. All in all, I always got a good, fast shave.    In the early 1990s, they came out with the cordless models, so bought one. Again, same great, close, fast shave, but with convenience of cordless. Battery would go a couple weeks of every other day use without a recharge, AND I could plug it in and keep shaving if the battery ran down :-). Only complaint was if you pushed it too hard, it might nick or burn occasionally, or if my beard was three-day growth, it could pull a little. Only other negative thing was replacement foil/cutter were expensive!    I kept that old razor until a couple years ago when it became impossible to find good replacement foil/cutters - Braun discontinued them, and Chinese knockoffs were hit and miss. Final straw was the battery stopped holding/taking a charge. I needed a replacement.    I wanted to stay with Braun out of my 20 plus years of good shaves. I chose the 5 Series because it came with the charger/cleaner, had a cool, high tech, quality look, but wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the 7 Series.    It seems to be a nicely made razor, and feels good in my hand, though perhaps a little long. The charging station cleaner does a decent job, but I usually manually clean it out semi-regularly with a brush as well.    How does it shave? Not great :-(. Coming from my old, single head cutter to the new, twin \\&quot;head\\&quot; design, it&#x27;s a major disappointment. The old Braun would shave my two day stubble like a gas mower, but the new Braun needs at least twice the time, twice the pressure, and is a lot more difficult to shave as close, or get into tight spots. Another problem with the newer style cutter, is the cutter block is narrower than the foil down both sides, so the razor won&#x27;t cut out to the edges of the head - WTF, Braun?? Who designed THAT? Going up the side of my ear requires all kinds of maneuvers to get the hair next to my earlobe (or maybe it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t cut very well period). Oh, and the battery life is HALF the old one. Seriously? My old razor&#x27;s battery technology was BETTER? The other thing was the old razor took a simple cord. Now, to save space (I guess), they put the charging transformer in the cord, making it a clumsy POS, that&#x27;s expensive to buy if you want an extra for the car. I will say, it is less likely to leave a burn, or bite, but my old Braun was twice the shaver.    In all, I have to say my loyalty to Braun is gone :-(. The razor FEELS like a high quality device, but the design is not. They actually made something that works a lot worse than the technology they used 20 years ago, and made the battery half the life. What has happened to German Engineering?? BTW, I&#x27;ve had the razor for almost a year, and my face should be \\&quot;used to it\\&quot; by now.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun Razor, the first one latex over 8 years. I have had this one a little over a year. I bought a new replacement head, and some of the foil strips came off after a month. Now the charging base has stopped working. This razor didn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as the first one and there have been numerous complaints about the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 30 years and this is the best one yet.  My last razor was a Noreleco.  I read many reviews on the Braun shavers and was a little concerned about the inital price and the cost of the cleaning fluid.  I think with the rebate it makes the intial cost reasonable and you shouldn&#x27;t worry about the cleaning fluid.  I charge and clean my shaver once a week.  I reseal the cleaning fluid after each use and after month I&#x27;ve only used about 10% of the solution.  The shaver gives me a good shave.  My wife thinks it&#x27;s not as noisy as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I would have to say with out hesitation that my Braun 7540 is the best piece of electronic machinery that I have ever owned....The battery lasted nearly 14 years! I only had to change the blade 4 or 5 times over the life of the shaver..It never let me down....but sadly it will no longer hold a charge and the clean and renew system no longer works. Solution was to buy the new series 7 and wife opted for series 5 for Xmas present. NOT even close in fit or function. I feels like a cheap plastic toy you would find in a happy meal compared to my old 7540. I have to shave twice as hard and twice as long, often missing spots......going back asap! I hope and pray the new 7 series performs as well or better than the old. I will post review of new 7 series.</li>
            <li> Sounds a little big, should follow the direction with the beard, slightly less convenient, overall is good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers for 35 years, about 5 of them. Due to battery issues and droppage, time to get a new shaver.  I wanted to try out a foil type. I did not want to settle for the bottom of the line nor pay for top of the line, so I chose the 550cc. The price is steep, more than double the entry Norelco or Braun. I have used it every day for about 2 weeks. It works very well. I am getting a good shave. The clean station works well. The cleaning solution has a light pleasant smell.  My only complaint so far is the power cord. I do not have a lot of counter space in my bathroom. The cord sticks out of the back right area about half way up about 2 inches. If I put it in the corner of the counter, it is sort of ok. The end that plugs into the wall sticks straight out from the wall more than 3 inches. The wall adapter for my Norelco is a right angle arrangement that is only 3/4 inch tall when plugged in. Braun needs to go back to the CAD package on this one.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Series 5 590cc after careful review because I got tired of the cuts and scrapes that come with using a blade. For me, the razor works well, but still not quick enough to replace my standard blade. What I mean is as far as an electric razor, I think it is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I can get a very close, smooth shave, it just takes longer to achieve that than with shave cream and a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to think about the cleaning solution that you need to buy. I&#x27;ve used it twice and when I run out, I don&#x27;t think I will replace it. For me, I think it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s way of just making more money off the solution. When I am done shaving, I run the head under hot water as the instructions say, and I find that it is just as clean as using the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time, for me usually about 11 days before I have to charge it, so that is defiantly a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is well built, extremely comfortable to use and does an excellent job of shaving. I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey though and that is the reason for the 4 star rating instead of a 5 star. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> I *LOVE* this razor ! The price seemed steep compared to all the other choices, but after having received and used it that doesn&#x27;t matter.  The package was delivered on time.  Set up was easy and straightforward.  I was not used to having a cleaning system with a charger, but I love it.  Fast and efficient!  But the best part is the smooth, comfortable shave.  No razor burn afterwards, but the razor just glides over my face, even the hard to shave areas.  The trimmer works equally well.  I give this shaver 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Gives a good close shave with no irritation. I like the self-cleaning capability.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model to replace an older Braun shaver. Was happy with my old Braun, but finally got to a point where the unit wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the motor was straining when cutting a heavier beard.    The new shaver has given me close clean shaves comparable to a multi-blade saftey razor.  Highly recommned!</li>
            <li> I bought it at a great price.The shaver itself is awesome.It gives a very close shave.It is very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> love the ways it shaves - much closer than older braun shavers - pivoting head is good - I only use the fancy cleaning system every couple of weeks - keep the fluid container covered the rest of the time and just recharge with the cord</li>
            <li> Very poor cutting ability. I had brauns previously. Coming from an older model Braun now. If I have a 2 day beard, it pulls, tugs and leaves alot of stubbles on my face. going over it just iritates the skin. I&#x27;m a 50 year old. NOT a newbie in the shaving scene. NOT recommended, there is better available for less $$.</li>
            <li> My Braun 7505 died after many good years of service.  It delivered a close shave, but the Series 5 is definitely a closer shave.  The charging base is too big, but it sure is convenient to just pull the shaver out and not worry about the charging cord.  If your bathroom door opens directly to your bedroom, be aware that the LED light on the charging base is obnoxiously bright at night.</li>
            <li> I would give 0 star if there is a choice. After 1 and half years usage, the battery started falling apart, it only can hold up one time of use, leas than 4 minutes after whole day fully charge. I called their service for repair, and they told me that they can replace the battery for free. First I thought well at least their service was good disregard the poor quality, however, after one month of waiting after mailing the product back to them on my own money, they told me that it needs $80 for replacing the battery on my second following call. (the first follow-up call they still said it needed to take 2-3 weeks to send it back to me). With $80, I can 100% certain that I can buy a much better shaver than this one. Finally they told me either I pay the $80 or they just sent the poor product back to me. What a horrible service!</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Series 5-590cc Razor for my husband for Christmas.  He loves the three blade across, says it gives a much closer shave, and works great for his tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 53 years.I have used every method of shaving known to man;every new type of blade, &amp; hundreds of $&#x27;s worth of all brands of electric shavers. I have problems with multi directional growth and severe ingrown hairs.Some shavers are better to me than others. This Braun 590cc is,in my experience, performs below average compared to various models of Panasonic shavers that I have used over the past 10 years. Panasonic will be my next shaver, real soon.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much but not as much as my old Braun because the old one charging/cleaning stand has lights indicating when and how much the cleaning is needed as well as how much cleaning fluid is left where as the 5-590cc&#x27;s charging/cleaning only has a light that lights up the bottom to manually see how much solution is left.  All cleaning indicators are on the shaver. The trimmer is not as wide and close to shaver as the 590cc but does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun guy since I started shaving, so this is my 4th or 5th one. After my last one, which was a low-end disappointment, this one is great -- as smooth of a shave as I believe you can get from an electric. Another plus is that this shaver is made in Germany, not China like their low-end ones, and although a little pricey, after a $50 promo certificate, it essentially put the price within reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comments, after owning the razor for about two weeks, is that the clean-and-renew system is a little gimmicky. Not the system itself so much, which works great, but two things about the system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The cleaning base is essentially a really cheap looking injection-molded piece of plastic. It gets the job done, but I think the designers could have done a better job of fabricating a base that was a little more in fitting with the price/look of the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* As others have said, the clean and renew fluid is kind of a ripoff -- if you use it as much as the manufacturer suggests (every day, all the time), that&#x27;s about an extra $75 a year; one more expense I really don&#x27;t need. Although I haven&#x27;t owned the razor very long, I think it&#x27;s probably fine to manually clean it most of the time and use the cleaning system once a week or so. To keep the cleaning fluid from evaporating, simply remove it from the base in between cleanings and put the lid it came with back on. As others have also mentioned, you could probably go one step further and replenish the cleaning fluid with its stated ingredient, denatured alcohol (i.e., Sea Breeze), but don&#x27;t blame me if that messes up your razor for some reason. I figure if I cut my usage by using the cleaning fluid only about once a week, that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with those two things mentioned, I really like my new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 112409:&lt;br /&gt;My curiosity got the better of me about a month ago - I tried replenishing the cleaning cartridge with Sea Breeze, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the Braun fluid; the Sea Breeze contains water whereas I don&#x27;t believe the Braun fluid does. Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy. At least now I know.; the Sea Breeze contains water whereas I don&#x27;t believe the Braun fluid does. Although it didn&#x27;t hurt my razor, it did leave it kind of grungy. At least now I know.</li>
            <li> Ordered for birthday gift.  Item was factory sealed, new and exactly as described.  Sent well packaged, super fast, and was an excellent transaction! THANKS !!!</li>
            <li> After researching and taking my time carefully considering all options I decided to purchase this razor. I was very hesitant because the picture shows the older version (gen. 1) and recently many people said they received the old version but others mentioned they received the newest version (gen 4). Paid $99 for it after the $30 off by signing up for an Amazon charge card. Very glad I pulled the trigger, because I also received the newest version. VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, especially since the new version MSRPs for a lot more than 100 bucks.   I must say I was also very hesitant to spend so much because I had 3 Remington foil MS3 electric razors that retailed at maybe $50 max. and had great results. But I will give Braun all the credit in the world. The shaver feels so much better than any Remington, even when it had 3 blades and the Braun has 2 with the middle long wiskar cutter. I thought the middle wiskar cutter was horse crap but it really does work. I&#x27;ve never taken an electric razor go from ear to ear and not have any pulling or the motor bogs down because of too much hair.   I was also skeptical of the pivoting head razors. I thought it was a cheap gimmick and just made the razor less solid and well built. I actually like the feature now, I primarily leave the sensitivity high or medium. Only for the tough and stubborn areas do I go full lock.  The base/cleaning station was also a cheap gimmick, or so I thought. I will repeat what one reviewer had to say about braun&#x27;s cleaning station. After cleaning the razor, it feels like a brand new razor. It really is amazing. It smells good, its clean and looks brand new. I only put it through the cleaner once a week and I use the brush included to clean up during the week. I have cleaned it 4 times and the canister is about 1/2 \\&quot;gone\\&quot;.  (somehow i plan on making my own blend of this or filtering and reusing the original blend)  The only thing I will say thats negative about this razor and any electronic razor.....  Thereis no substitute for good old barbersol and a straight mach 3 or quattro, etc etc.  It just doesn&#x27;t get cut that close on the days I feel like being lazy and give my face a break from the blade.   Overall, very happy with the purchase and for 100 bucks, whats not to love!</li>
            <li> Back in the day Braun was a company that used great design to produce great products. Then it was bought by P&amp;G. I have used a 5 series shaver for ten years and I loved it. After 10 years the battery was starting to fail and I needed a new one. Because the old one was so good I bought this one. There have been some changes between then and now. Unfortunately, they have not been good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first change is that the body is longer and narrower. I have big hands so the old one fit more comfortably in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The second change is that the motor does not run as fast as the old one did. This means that there is more pinching and pulling of long whiskers, a very painful experience that the old one did not have.&lt;br /&gt;The third change is that the body has fancy electronics to switch it on and off, something completely unnecessary and probably responsible for the slow motor. The battery capacity is also smaller.&lt;br /&gt;The fourth change is the cleaning station, which is much noisier than the old one and much more inconvenient. The shaver does not go in and out as easily as the last one did. Also, the cleaning fluid level is no longer a set of LEDs but a light shining on the internal plastic tank. It is almost impossible to read the fluid level and I would not know what is a good level and what is not since it is not marked on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took off one star for each of the four changes that did not result in any improvement in my shaving experience. Since there were no changes that resulted in improvements there were no stars to add.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, like this brand</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to decide on this Braun after all I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a shaver. However, I had a problem getting parts for my old Remington so decided to bite the bullet. The unit arrived nicely boxed with a semi-hard black zippered travel case which is not mentioned in the literature. It uses the same power cord for rechargeable and corded operation. The shaver feels comfortable and solid in the hand and looks nice. I like the trimmer and flexible head. I find setting the sensitivity of the head to medium works best especially in the neck area.  When not in use, the shaver sits in the cleaning station which also acts as a charger. At night, the cleaning station gives off a small blue light which is nice should you have to find the unit without turning on the lights. I&#x27;ve had the unit a few weeks and so far, I love it.     Why? Because it&#x27;s quiet (compared to my old Remington), and gives me smooth, dry close shaves. For my face and skin, it&#x27;s pretty close to a razor. The head and cutter is washable under running water and if that&#x27;s not enough, you can use the Clean &amp; Renew System. Since I&#x27;ve only had my unit for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see the need to give it a bath so soon. I&#x27;ll do what others suggest and do it periodically. Besides, I didn&#x27;t want to open the sealed cartridge filled with cleaning solution for fear I would spill it and have to buy more refill cartridges.      Things I didn&#x27;t like were that it was relatively expensive and the cleaning station base footprint was large. The shaver sits head down in the base unit so the bottom of the shaver is 8 3/4\\&quot; above the counter. But if you don&#x27;t mind charging it with the A/C cord, you can put the base unit away for another day when cleaning is needed.     I decided against the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic because I didn&#x27;t see how 10,000 micro vibrations would help with a smoother closer shave. Besides, my Sonicare toothbrush vibrates and I can see the logic there.  I&#x27;ll just hold the shaver looser and let itvibrate by itself. I picked this unit over the Series 5 570 because as far as I could tell, the only difference were the LED lights. The cost between both units was minimal so I opted for extra LED lights. I&#x27;m sure I would be just as happy with the other unit.    SEPT 2009 UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve had this unit now for about 6 months and I am still very satisfied with it. I love the flexible shaver head and the ability to adjust the sensitivity. It makes for a comfortable shave in all the right places.     One of the early concerns I had before purchasing the unit was the added cost of cleaning the unit using the Clean&amp;Renew Station and cleaning solution as often as Braun recommends. This is what I&#x27;ve discovered.     The User Guide recommends cleaning the unit after each shave or when the yellow LED light comes on. I physically clean the shaver foil and cutter block once a week, sometimes every other week when lazy. Very easy. The yellow \\&quot;time to clean\\&quot; light never came on so after a month, I cleaned the shaver anyway. So far, I&#x27;ve only cleaned the unit 3 times and only because I thought it was time to clean. Now to prevent the cleaning solution from evaporating or spilling, I remove the cleaning cartridge after each use and replace the plastic cover and store the cartridge under the counter. So far for me, purchasing more cleaning kits has not been costly since I&#x27;m still using the original cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li> Had this about a year and my husband loves it! No problems with it at all. We have always had good luck with Braun products.</li>
            <li> This razor with 51S cutter block is awful - shave is not close and irritating.  Replace 51S with 30B cutter assembly - wonderful close, smooth shave.  30B fits perfectly, colors are different.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun Shavers in the past and have been very pleased with them.  My new Braun Series 5-590cc is a fantastic electric shaver to.  It provides a close quick shave, it is smooth not irritating my skin and it has great battery life.</li>
            <li> I had a prior 8995 that broke after several years.  The on-off switch, shaving head tilt adjustment and trimmer  were integrated.  With a complex switch it wore out and broke.  However, it did a great job shaving.  I did not really want a new shaver but it was easier to get a new one that get the old one fixed.  I got the new one and have been extremely pleased.  The shave is actually better and the various functions are no longer in one switch.  A better configuration.  The head is the same as the old one so that is great.</li>
            <li> Gives me a really close shave,very easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Very flexible for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;What else can you ask for.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun shaver for YEARS... loved it.  But I had dropped it a few times, the battery was not holding a charge much anymore, and it was just older Braun technology.  It was similar to this but was the VERY first generation &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; system.  Needless to say, it was time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I bought a competitors three-circle-wheel style razor.  And I wanted to love it-- but the shave wasn&#x27;t as close even after using it 3-4 weeks.  I couldn&#x27;t control the three wheels as accurately as my Braun prior, and overall felt the quality of the shave just wasn&#x27;t as good.  I had to go over sections over and over, and it took me 2x as long as it should have.  Overall I realized I wanted a foil style, and Braun seemed the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came back to Braun, got this unit, and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  I love the foil style for accuracy (I have a goatee usually, so I want to get close to it with control and accuracy)  The unit runs cooler than my prior unit, so that is nice.  The battery holds a great charge.  And right from the start it got a nice, close shave without irritating my skin.  I would definitely buy this unit again-- and would recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> good quality, well design, comfortable to use, better than  my philips. powerful enough and never worry about your shaving problem.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for a year now, yes it is still working.  It was a replacement for another Braun razor that i had which finally wore out (the trimmer part).  This razor LOVES to Yank your hair out of your face.  I just needed to post to help others.  If you use it daily then this razor won&#x27;t be a problem, but if you go more than a day....I am sorry...  With that said, now after 10yrs I can&#x27;t take it anymore and now i find myself shopping for a new razor...</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, way better than my old Norelco. Gives a close professional shave. I use the cleaning system that comes with it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver awhile back after I saw how well my roommate&#x27;s worked for him. It has been great. No complaints. I highly recommend it. And no, I don&#x27;t work for Braun.</li>
            <li> If you have not used an electric foil shaver before or used a rotary shaver then it will take some getting used to this one. At first your skin might turn reddish and become irritated but this will subside as your skin adapts to it. It can provide a reasonably close shave comparable to a razor blade but you often have to target specific areas over and over to get the desired shave. The cleaning solution is a great way to store and charge your shaver and it seems to do an excellent job of cleaning the shaver too. You can also clean the shaver manually and instructions are included to show you how to do this so using the cleaning stand is not mandatory but I would recommend you do so every now and then.    Overall a great shaver, certainly better than the Philips Coolskin I owned several years back. You could save yourself a few bucks if you get the 570 over this one as the only difference seems to be the cleaning LED on the shaver. Better yet go for the 550 or 560 if you don&#x27;t think you need the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> I am over seventy years of age and have done a lot of shaving with a full face of hair. I had to shave every day for my employment, and that was a chore I really dreaded. The only razor that really got the job done in a timely manner was a razor blade. Electrics would just glide over the face cutting some here and some there. Over and over I would have to go, and then I would still miss some (which would show up at the next shave.)   The Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc is like mowing a lawn. I have never seen anything like it. I have had it for three months now and am not sorry that I bought it. In fact, I bought one for a son for his birthday and am going to buy another one for another son on his birthday. I normally would not have considered paying as much for a razor, burt at my age, I felt I had finally deserved a chance to try a highly rated shaver. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Does not shave Cole&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> Shaver does an excellent job at shaving short hairs on face. Does not do as well with longer growth hairs, will pull hairs and will require multiple passes to get a good shave. Self cleaning station/charger works very well. Overall very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars but my old 3 series head gives a closer shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a rotary guy for over 20 years. Always liked my Philips shavers, never fussed with them, and they did the job on my fine (not coarse) facial hair, without bother. But I recently tried foil shavers when on a whim, I picked up an old Braun 5561, from a Goodwill store. I fell in love with the Dieter Rams era post-modernist design, and the amazing heavy solid build quality of this precision machine that was the Classic Braun 5561. But I just didn&#x27;t like the way the 5561 shaved. Its blades must have been dull, and when I used its trimmer, I ended up looking like I tried to hang myself. A red line appeared right across my throat, followed by a burny sensation. Safe to say I have sensitive skin, and this trimmer was not kind to it, when I used it to mow my months of beard growth (against the grain). So I bought the Braun 590cc to see how the new crop of shavers compared to my old classic Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot; IN NAME ONLY: When I went to the store to see nearly all of the current shavers on the market - models from Remington to Philips to Braun to weird names I&#x27;d not heard of.... I was shocked and amazed. With my recent experience with the Braun 5561 as a reference point, EVERY single one of the new crop of shavers,  looked and felt like pieces of plastic dog doody warmed over. Except I would expect plastic dog doody to fare better if dropped over a hard bathroom tile floor than any of these thin cheap brittle plastic hi-tech pieces of disposable trash. Never mind the fact that they ALL had awful, garish designs that would make Dieter Rams take a sledgehammer to them all. But absolutely none of them had the weight, solid feel or materials and build quality of my classic Braun shaver. This includes the models supposedly made in Germany that they are charging upwards of $400 for! Well if they are, \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; certainly doesn&#x27;t mean what it did in Braun&#x27;s heyday. It should be noted that Braun is not the company today they once were. They were sold to Gillette and then P&amp;G, to profit off of the good reputation that was created in the 20th century by Braun&#x27;s top world class engineers. Today&#x27;s Braun shavers might as well be branded \\&quot;Proctor &amp; Gamble\\&quot;. People judge the Braun company of today by the reputation that was built when they really were Braun. And then they wonder why the legendary Braun quality, design, longevity, service, or even the warranty period is vastly inferior to what it used to be. Well don&#x27;t do that. Would you associate such quality with the \\&quot;Proctor &amp; Gamble\\&quot; name? I didn&#x27;t think so. That&#x27;s why they bought the \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; name. (And shame on Braun for selling out their legacy like this!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Despite my disappointment with today&#x27;s cheap China-quality construction standards, I was determined to find out if I should go with one of the newer P&amp;G derived fake Brauns, or a REAL Braun model from the mid-80&#x27;s; ie. the 3525. So I took the 590cc home. First inspections show it comes with a good travel case, but I was dismayed that the removable blade housing is made of flimsy, thin plastic. A far cry from the solid steel and acrylic housing that covers the blade on my 5561. At least the grip and balance of the shaver is not bad. I started with my chin and throat, and noticed the shaver was not rough on my sensitive skin face. I was even able to gently go over the still sore area on my throat where I developed razor burn the day before. Eventually, I was able to get some areas of my face smooth enough that no stubble was felt when brushing upward against my face with the back of my hand. But to achieve that I had to do many passes over the same area, and this was over several shaving sessions that evening. I concluded that some short-stubble roughness will remain, no matter how many times you repeat areas with the 590cc. But I&#x27;m guessing it will probably be able to deal with all stray hairs, if you take the time necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER: I liked the trimmer on this shaver. It cut much faster and more precisely than the old 5561, without giving me razor burn. I was able to sculpt my mustache with it, so it can be used for precision work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANER: Yeah, it comes with a fancy cleaning stand with solution. Did not unpack it, could not care less. The thing can be cleaned under running water. Surgeons use that stuff to clean their hands after all. So why fuss with paying Braun about $25 for cleaning refills every 2 months? I&#x27;m not convinced that having your shaver sit in a bath of dirty denatured alcohol that&#x27;s been stagnating in your bathroom for 2 months, is somehow better than cleaning it under fresh running water. Not to mention the extra pollution and cost created by the electrical energy required to run this cleaning process for hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSIONS: In considering all points, the 590cc lost a point with me for its inferior build quality, reflected by its 2 year warranty (The real Braun company used to offer 3 years on their shavers!). Overall, I left my experience with the 590cc underwhelmed. I&#x27;d done research for 2 solid days on these things, and I read all the good reviews. While I can agree to the positive reviews to some extent, its not what I was expecting. From the hype, I was expecting an effortless shave that came close to a manual razor, and gave a smooth finish. But just to get a close shave, I had to go over areas many times, and often press hard against my skin (which you&#x27;re not supposed to do). And that all promotes razor rash. The 590cc can do a passable job, but for me it left something to be desired, shave-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy the 1987 Braun 3525 model (new in box), then see how that compares. If it does even a comparable job, then I&#x27;ll go with the older model and return this one. Because I&#x27;m smarter than the average bears around here. I&#x27;m not wooed by hi tech gimmicks, flashy lights and garish designs. And i know for a fact the old Brauns will last much much longer, and are actually worth investing expensive cutter heads for. For most people, by the time they need a new cutter head in two years, they&#x27;ll be convinced by the latest P&amp;G marketing that they have to have the latest bells &amp; whistles gadgets or shiny colours in the new line of shavers. The marketing con jobs will convince them they are losers with outdated shavers. And their friends and associates will reinforce the notion that newer is always better, as this is the way people condition themselves to think. Under Dieter Rams, the Braun name used to be synonymous with elegant and good design. Under 21st century P&amp;G, it is now a text book example of ugly bad design, violating every single one of Ram&#x27;s 10 tenets of good design. Truly a shame.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day/Birthday gift (he picked it out), he has no issues with it and uses it everyday.  He&#x27;s very picky, so that&#x27;s high praise!  Plus, we got a great deal on it!</li>
            <li> Smoother, quieter and faster. Charges fast. Haven&#x27;t tried in shower or set up the wet cleaning system. Impressive; thought I was going to have to go back to blades when I couldn&#x27;t reorder parts for my 5-year old 3612!</li>
            <li> very good,my first braun shaver</li>
            <li> Works great! Reviews were very accurate.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would do a better job but it&#x27;s much better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> My brother in law recommed it. I needed to stop shaving with a razor,my face was getting raw after 50 years of shavin w/a razor. So I got this Braun, &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave and the side burn trimer works much better than the trimmer on my old Braun.The fact that you can rinse the shaver head clean after you use it is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li> It is overall a good electric shaver.  However, if you have more than about three days of growth it tends to pull some of you hairs rather than cut them.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Braun shavers, including most recently a 7680.  All of my past shavers have performed beautifully, and have given me a great shave.  As my 7680 was getting a little old, I decided to buy the 590.  Boy was this a huge mistake.  I have used it for a year now, and I hate it more and more every day.  Compared to the 7680, this shaver gives a very poor shave, has horrible ergonomics, vibrates a ton more, and overall just does not get the job done.  The only improvement I can see they made was in the pop up trimmer.  I think they tried to improve the clean and charge station, which no longer has the arm that can break.  However, there is no way to clean the shaver without charging it at the same time.  By charging it every day, it reduces the battery life, as the batteries are only good for so many charges.  Braun, I don&#x27;t know what you were thinking when you developed this shaver.  If this is the direction you are heading in, consider this my last purchase of your products.</li>
            <li> I was using an old Braun series 1 and rather than buy a new head and cutters I decided to go with a new razor. This Series 5 gives a much closer shave and even does a great job on the neck! The cleaner also allows for a much faster and better clean-up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price tag--this is a below average shaver.  After about a year, the cleaner/charger stopped working, which provided my final motivation to throw it away.  Bad experience.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered this shaver. I would finally have a really nice electric shaver. It finally arrived and I imediatly opened it up read all the instructions and plugged it in to charge. The next morning I tried to use the shaver and nothing,so I called BRAUN&#x27;S customer service. The only options given was to ship it to their company to rebuild it, I would have to pay shipping both ways. This option made no since, why would I pay the price of a new item and get a refurbished item plus pay shipping three times. My other option was to ship it back and get a refund for the purchase price, they would not pay for the price of the original shipping or for me to ship the faulty shaver to them. This as you can imagine did not make me happy here I would have to pay $15 for shipping cost and have nothing but wasted time and disapointment to show for it.  So I decided to send a very pointed email to Braun to give them a written form of my disgust in their lack of customer service and how I felt about how they should have to put out the money for shipping since it was their lack of quality control that caused this situation. I received a email back saying they would send me a $15 check in the mail to pay for the shipping so they finally decided to do the right thing, too bad it took me calling them out to get them to be ethical in their business transactions. This goes to show you now days if you want to be treated fair you have to stand your ground and speak up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a 7 series for a long time, and it recently died on me.  In an effort to save some money, I picked up a 590cc.  I didn&#x27;t really need the features of the 7 series, as compared to the 590, but I was surprised how different the two shavers performed.  The 590 did fine on my face, but did seem to require more passes than the 7 series for the same closeness of shave.  However, I am also bald (partially by choice), so I use the shaver on my head as well.  That&#x27;s where the differences really became evident.  The 5 series&#x27; foils are recessed into the head, and this makes it very ineffective on a hard surface, like my bony head.  When the skin can&#x27;t press in against the foils, it really doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  It would take me 2-3 times longer to shave my head with the 590, and it never got as close as the 7 series (in which the foils protrude from the head).  So, unfortunately, I had to return the 590 and spend twice as much to get another 7 series.  But I think if you shave your head, you will appreciate the difference between the two shavers.    I also wanted to mention that I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic Arc IV shaver in the past, as well.  While I think the panasonic may offer a slightly closer shave overall, the braun shavers do the job in half the time.  The cleaning system on the brauns are also far superior.  The panasonic uses water (not an alcohol-based cleaner) to cleanse the shaver.  This means that unless you always remember to change out the water after 4-5 days, things start to get a little funky.  And because the panasonic uses a blower to dry the shaver, it spreads that funkiness all around the bathroom.  :)  The alcohol-based cleaner of the brauns always makes the shaver smell fresh and new, each day.  A huge plus over the panasonic.</li>
            <li> shaver didn&#x27;t cut, what else is there to say, oh yeh it was expensive. norelco is less expensive and gives a great close shave. thank goodness amazon has a great return policy</li>
            <li> excellent item @ fair price</li>
            <li> I brought two of these for my sons, but of course I had to try it out. I have a somewhat thick growth of facial hair, and this shaver gave me a nice and close shave.</li>
            <li> After my old Braun shaver finally wore out, I knew I wanted another Braun.  I looked at all the current models and chose the 5-590 because it was made in Germany, not China.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in the self cleaning feature but all of the better models have it so there&#x27;s no choice there.  I certainly wont be cleaning it every day.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it twice now in about a month, then I just cap the cleaning solution and save it for the next time.  This shaver does give the closest shave of any any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I thought it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with other Braun models not giving a close shave because the foil wasn&#x27;t open enough.  You always had to go up and down and back and forth until your skin was raw.  The Opti-foil with larger openings lets my thick beard into the cutting head, while the active lift helps raise the beard out of those neck creases resulting in a close, and much quicker shave.  Yeah, it still takes a while, but much less time and abrasion that ever before.  I just hope they get the opti-foil replacement head issues resolved before I need one.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I really liked my Braun, at first...  When I use it daily it works pretty well.  However if my thick beard gets more than a day long, this shaver really takes a lot longer to get the long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheap 10 year old norelco with an aging original blade can shave a multi-day growth as fast as it will shave a 1 day growth.  But the Braun really only wants to shave a one day growth...  At least for me and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two years... now I&#x27;m switching to a new norelco 3d.  The 3d is smooth as silk, and will shave a 4 day beard faster than the braun will shave a 1 day beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is just the particulars of my beard, but for me rotary is a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for years and they are great shavers.  This is the best shave yet and I like the cleaning  process. However I have a light beard if that is helpful.</li>
            <li> It has been remarkable experience since I had Braun Series 5-590cc. Shaving with Braun Series 5-590cc is the motivation that I get up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Upgrading from a tiny mobile shaver to something more advanced. No more issue trying to get to certain spots.   Another reason I picked this model is because of the auto cleaning, get everything done and let the station do it&#x27;s job while I move on to do whatever needs my attention. And I can trust the machine doing it right.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a braun syncro for ~ 8-10 years (i dont remember exactly how long) before the button started to fail so I started my quest to find a new one.     Im the type who does alot of research before any major purchase, and I figured the time would be well spent on the razor since its something I use every day. If you&#x27;re in the same position, here is the synopsis of my experience.    So for the razor, I did my research and ended up purchasing the 590cc and also tried my dads razor for about a week which is a higher end norelco. Both of them worked well, and depending on your facial hair, you will probably be happy with either. The difference in close-ness was negligible, but I think the Braun was a little closer.    After initially using the norelco, I thought maybe I had made the wrong decision. Even after owning a Braun previously, my face would still burn in some spots after shaving (with the 590cc)...this did not happen with the norelco.    However, after getting used to the braun (~1.5 months or so), i would not trade for the norelco. While the end result is similar, the Braun is much faster so thats a plus.    Braun does offer a pretty decent trial period so that might be worth taking advantage of if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> Use this bad boy almost every single day and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an older and lesser model from Braun before and it died...pretty sure the battery just gave out. But so far, after almost 3 years of almost daily use this things is going just like the first day that I got it and was shaving. Does a good job at giving me a pretty close and clean shave. Love that it comes with the cleaning station, keeps things supper fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no real cons that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is nice. I actually use it to trim my hairline often times because it is a bit more gentle than my hair clippers on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy this again. If and when my current one dies.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present to my husband. He told me it is the best razor he has ever used to include two other Braun razors. No skin irritation, close shave, flexible head is great! As with all electric razors, works best with pre-shave, but also works well without pre-shave.</li>
            <li> So coming from another Braun, the difference is very clear.    After using Braun for the past 5-6 years, this Series 5 590c is a significant difference, for the better.  The feel on the skin is much smoother, unit feels very good and solid in your hand, its not missing much of the hair when cutting.    Very well done!  Only caveat are buying the cleaning fluid refills...</li>
            <li> We bought the Braun series 5 for our mentally challanged son in June and have had to replace the screen and cutter twice already.  They only sell the replacement with cutter and screen at $43.99 .  A razor less than a month shouldn&#x27;t need the cutter replaced just because the screen rips.  Why can&#x27;t we just purchase a foil screen when needed at a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun Shaver and once again I am very pleased with the product. It provides a very close shave and the cleaning system is a great way to keep the razor clean and operating at its best. Great product and no regrets!!!</li>
            <li> I was wrongly mislead by the good reviews posted on this item. I absolutely regret purchasing this shaver. Every time i shaved with it, I was left with prickles allover. It feels like it is doing the job and its very easy on sensitive skin, but the shave just isn&#x27;t close enough. Overall, I am highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I love shaving with a razor but my face doesn&#x27;t love being shaved with a razor. After 20+ years of trying every type of shaving cream/gel, razor, aftershave creams/balms, etc...I&#x27;m relegated to electric shavers. I, like many of the other reviewers, have tried various brands and style of electric shavers over the years but I&#x27;ve been exclusively using straight foil-type shavers for the last 8-10 years. My observations:  *The 590cc shaver feels comfortable and secure in my hand.  *Well built.  *The head swivels but not as much as I hoped.  *I can get a week on a single charge. That for me is about 7-10 shaves/week.  *Quality of the shave is great (I&#x27;ll add more on this at the end).  *The base looks and feels cheap, almost like it was an after thought. I only use it to clean/recharge the shaver and the rest of the time use the carrying case to store the unit.  Setting everything else aside, ultimately one buys a shaver for the shaving (as I state the obvious). I was not at all satisfied by the shaves I was getting. I have very course and thick facial hair. I had to use my old Braun 1775 to finish areas on my chin and neck this shaver wasn&#x27;t shaving properly. I was having serious buyers remorse and thinking about returning it and getting something else. As fate would have it, my daughter knocked the shaver and base (as someone else stated, it takes up a lot of counter space) off of the bathroom counter. The fall cracked the foil head and I went to Target for a replacement. After I replaced the head, I noticed I was getting a very good shave!?! I noticed that the original head had finer/smaller openings and the replacement foil head had \\&quot;larger\\&quot; openings. That made all the difference for me. No more buyers remorse and I&#x27;m getting great shaves!</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> have had this for about a month no complaintss. I read other reviews before buying. Now i just brush it off after using instead of leaving the open cleaner in it, and when I do use it I will close it after so it doesnt evporavate</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user (over 20 years) so when it came time to replace my electric razor, I decided to try another brand. I have had this Braun razor for about 2 weeks and while it is okay, it does not shave as close as the Norelco brands that I have owned. I suppose if you have never owned a Norelco, the Braun would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but this thing is amazing. I got it as a deal of the day and Amazon screwed the pooch on shipping it, but the razor itself is amazing. I never thought I would get such a good shave from an electric.</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I have ever purchased at an affordable price.It gives me a clean shave everytime I use it,cleaning after usage is very simple.Very glad I settled on this one after much research.</li>
            <li> Really great, easy to use shaver.  Very happy with the design and weight of the shaver.  It does a great job of getting hairs the first time as apposed to my previous razor that took multiple passes.</li>
            <li> after trying many types of electric razors, finally one that I can use daily and without irritation. provides a close comfortable shave, as well as sleek styling and solid feel. may not make financial sense over blades, but considering I saved $50 on amazon, made enough sense. overall very happy with product and far exceeds my expectations of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good shaver but I thought it would have guards/attachments for $140.  Guess I have to stick with the cheap (and effective trimmers for that).  And watch out because you cannot return these things!  Here&#x27;s why:  For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.  So beware.</li>
            <li> I paid $60 for this on 7/31/2011 and I would not pay full price for this because I&#x27;m not sure what the cleaning mode does, and I like the triple headed shaver (seems to cover more area). This shaver has 3 \\&quot;sensitivity\\&quot; levels and I started with the closest and regretted it for a week. My face was so irritated that I started getting red bumps. So, after 1 use, I changed it to 3 and I haven&#x27;t had many issues since, but for 2-3 weeks after, the area under my chin near my throat started getting severely irritated, dry and it was itchy. Now, I am not having any issues. I&#x27;m using the middle sensitivity level and it seems to be producing good results. Women around me seem to be interested in me, I am experiencing heightened level of sex drive, and I am more confident at work. But seriously, This razor isn&#x27;t worth over $100. If you&#x27;re looking for something that does the job, you should be able to get one at $50, they are all the same. I used a plug in norelco for 6 years and retired it in summer of 2011, I could have replaced the head and kept using it but I wanted a rechargeable one for travel.  Pro:  rechargeable battery lasted 4 days  there is a cleaner, although I don&#x27;t know what it does  convenient stand for charge/clean  adjustable sensitivity  cons:  doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much face as a triple head  the cleaning fluid is used up fast (i heard you can mitigate by not doing it every week, and getting denatured alcohol)</li>
            <li> perfect packing and very easy to use! I love it! a little expensive but I still love it! very good!</li>
            <li> I really want to like this, but it has a horrible time shaving my neck.  I have to shave every other day or its too long for this thing and I have medium to low facial hair I&#x27;d say.  For some reason though it just can&#x27;t shave my neck consistently.  It ends up looking like a 10 year old on a mower - patches everywhere.  Other than that, I have no real problems or praises.</li>
            <li> Braun just needs to go back to making quality products that are worth the price they charge for them.  I have been a Loyal Braun user for 20 years and this is the second worse shaver I have bought from them.  It will be the last.</li>
            <li> It did what I expected it to do. It was OK.The shaver did what I expected it to do. I liked it.</li>
            <li> Best shave you&#x27;re going to get with an electric shaver Period!! Not even comparable to the 3 head Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li> It looks so cool! Although I only saw the packaging! (I was helping my colleagues to buy.)</li>
            <li> The complete fittings quality is great with very convenient handle is also very good charging time very quickly After use feeling very smooth face almost feel the presence of beard</li>
            <li> Had not tried electric shaver for 50 years.  This was recommend to me and it works great.  No skin burn nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2-years now and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the 5 series shaver. First off, don&#x27;t expect manual razor blade results, but the shaves are pretty close. Close enough to make you grin at the results. I like the cleaning system because after each shave I return the unit back to its base to recharge and self-clean and its ready to go the next time I need it! Shaving my lower jaw/upper neck area takes awhile with several passes over to thoroughly shave, but it sure beats getting cuts. Of course, the  cleaning solution does cost quite a bit of money, but I&#x27;d rather spend extra money to keep my unit clean with their alcohol solution than just rinsing my unit under tap water.</li>
            <li> Bought new razor to replace previous Braun that I had for 6 years. The new one is easy to use with a close shave. It is also easier to clean. Highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li> I have needed to replace my old electric razor (rotary) for some time. I was reluctant to do so because of price and the mixed reviews (on Amazon for this razor). I finally decided to make the commitment and ordered the Series-5. As always, it arrived on time (using Prime to order). It did take a week of shaving with the new razor for the face to get used to the new shaving technique (rotary blades shave differently). But after a week it is the best shave: smooth and effortless. Be sure to follow the recommended shaving instructions. It even works with a two to three day beard provided it is not to thick. Anyway I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Purchasing Experience! Exactly What my brother wanted! I had a Braun older 5 Series, &amp; I explained how Great these razors are. He Loves it,</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my review would help anyone since this is the ONLY electric razor my husband has used. After reading other reviews, I decided to go with the 5 series-590cc to surprise my husband for his promotion at work. Turns out my husband really likes it, he uses it everyday before work, heading to work and sometimes at work. He took it, in the case it came with, to work with him for a whole week before he brought it home to charge. My husbands face feels so smooth now and there are NO MORE cut marks or stubby bumps caused by those dern blades. I would definitely recommend this product to those who have thick facial hair and is tired of having to quickly shave in the bathroom (causing multiple cuts and stubs on the face) because your razor needs water. This electric razor does dry shave like a child eating eating ice cream, clean and gone in seconds.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected, Very pleased with thlis purchase. The cleaning tank is a nice accessory, as is the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Takes time to get used to but GREAT shave</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and the product performs like a Braun!It has a very  close shave and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I found this electric razor to be much more effective on my beard as I don&#x27;t shave everyday.  This razor handles a 2-3 day growth much more effectively than my Series 3 Braun.  For folk who have the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; of not having to shave everyday, this razor does a great job with minimal effort.  No electric razor is perfect, but this one comes closer to perfection for me than any other Braun or Norelco I have used over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because my love in my life didn&#x27;t like my facial hair. The shaver is very nice built and seems to shave very good. The only complaint that I have is there are the select few hairs that it just don&#x27;t seem to cut but it&#x27;s something I can deal with. The cleaning solution seems to keep the shaver clean but you have to make sure you change the solution on time monthly unlike I did my first month owning it. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> good basic electric shaver, get it at bed,bath,and beyond to get a discount.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, optional system works well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Xmas. he loves it! easy to use and maintain. this shipped in time. we&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years now and it still works perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in June 2014 after had great luck with my last 2 Braun razors which lasted 5 and 7 years respectively.  This model never had the battery life of my 7 year old model 8585.  From June to November the battery life deteriorated to the point where it will not hold a charge long enough to complete 1 complete shave - it only functions as a corded razor at this point, but I was well past my 60-day Amazon return so I&#x27;ll have to see what the manufacturer can do.  In hind sight I should have returned it immediately, but in the beginning it was lasting long enough for a weeks worth of shaves (my 7 year old 8585 model still holds its charge for 2 weeks at a time). I expect much better from a $150 razor and this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edit* After reaching out to Amazon support - they&#x27;re replacing the entire package.  I&#x27;m told this problem isn&#x27;t typical of the razor and that I just got a bad one.  I&#x27;ll update this review again later based on how the new razor performs, but at least Amazon handled the issue quickly.</li>
            <li> There is a reason they give you 30 days to return this razor.  It takes time to get used to it.  Give it 2 weeks and they decide if you like it.  It took me the full 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cleaning system takes up a bunch of counter room and it seems to always want to be cleaned.  Then again that is the way they tell you to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just clean it every weekend, the cleaning cartridge lasts longer and I do not need to leave all of that on the counter.  I fyou are going to do that, do shake out the shavings on a daily basis..</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard. The description sounded great. If I use the Braun every other day it pulls my hair on parts of my beard. I would return it if I could, however I threw away the packaging. I am going back to Panasonic for my new shaver. It never pulls my hair and gives a closer shave in less time. The Panasonic 3 blade system has a lower price.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I ever owned.  End of discussion.</li>
            <li> This hygiene cleaner for personal care is a close shaver, like a safety razor.  The trimmer is great for sideburns and mustache and even the nose.  A must have for the man of house.</li>
            <li> This shaving product is very smooth, dont feel dry after shave. It can be use with shaver cream or without. Excellent Product</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It shaves really well, easy to clean, the cleaning station is really good, luckily I can close the cleaning capsule after use so it&#x27;s not evaporate. The new desing is better but this one is still okay. The long hair trimmer can pull your hair if it is too long, so needs some pre-shave with the beard cutter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Panasoinc</li>
            <li> I love it. I haven&#x27;t had a better shave with an electric razor. It is easy to clean and keep ready for use with the charger/cleaner base. I love the it can be charged directly without using the base when I travel. It doesn&#x27;t have as long of a time between charges as my old razor but with the base it does not matter at home, only when I travel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any better</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I had a promotional certificate to use on Amazon and needed a new shaver. It was a bit on the expensive side compared to other shavers, but the promotional certificate made it more reasonable.  My Panasonic foil-top was older than I remember, so I needed to buy a new one.  Rotary razors scratch my face too much, so I wanted to stick with a foil-top.  I think this shaver is new to the Braun line-up.  It feels very nice in my hand when shaving as it&#x27;s handle is more ergonomic than the previous geneation.  It shaves nice and close with almost no irritation.  The pivoting head is a bit of a gimmick, I think.  I locked mine in place and it works fine that way.</li>
            <li> My first self cleaning Braun razor lasted 20 years and the series 5 razor gives an even better, closer shave. The razor concept is the same but the series 5 made improvements in several areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this,&lt;br /&gt;Assuming it was German made.&lt;br /&gt;Not so, made in China!&lt;br /&gt;I would not have spent my money, had I known that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and I&#x27;ve had a bunch of shavers. This is one of the best and certainly the easiest to take care of. It has a nice trimmer and some how it manages to get those stray wiskers that can elude other shavers. I cheat and only clean it every other day and thus make the cleaning fluid last longer. If you can shop around for the most reasonable price on the cleaner that helps also. I think shaving with a blade gives me a closer shave but then as I said I&#x27;m old and shake and then there are the wrinkles that somehow cause cuts. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The first Braun Series 5 worked beautifully for 4 years and then stopped functioning.  I ordered a new one from Amazon and was pleased with the ease of ordering process and shipping.  The shaver and the stand had both changed designs significantly.  The shaver is sleeker and works well, but the stand, is a far \\&quot;cheaper and simpler\\&quot; design than the previous unit.  I am not pleased with the design or the perceived lack of quality.  The new stand is very light and no longer provides the options for power savings and in depth cleaning of the previous shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 weeks after I had received the shaving unit, the stand stopped functioning.  It would not power up when the shaver was replaced and the start button pushed.  As disappointed as I was in the performance of the stand, both Braun and Amazon were both extremely fast to offer a solution to the problem.  Braun offered to refund my money, or I could call Amazon and get a replacement.  I chose to get a replacement from Amazon.  The support person, took the information, located the sales data, and said the new shaving unit would arrive 5 days later.  It ended up arriving in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the service and support I have received from Braun and particularly Amazon, I will not hesitate to buy Braun products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> To be received as a gift in 1 week, thus no impression yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. I just upgraded from another parallel shaver of this type and had a rotary one before that. While it&#x27;s hard to beat the closeness of the old-fashioned manual shaver, this is as close as it gets. Unlike my rotary and my last (cheaper) shaver of this type, this gets a close and nearly perfect shave with only a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest hesitation before purchasing was whether the extra money really does translate into any better performance. Answer: it does. This works better and cut my shaving time in half. The cleaner also works very well, although it can be a little noisy (you select when it runs manually, so it won&#x27;t wake you up or anything). The trimmer accessory works significantly better than on cheaper versions too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the charger has a function that stops charging once it&#x27;s full for an hour, so essentially you can leave it on the charger (which doubles as the cleaner) when it&#x27;s not in use without worrying about the battery losing its memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy!</li>
            <li> No doubt this is the best shaver out there. I will never use a blade again. All my daily shaves are extremely close.</li>
            <li> Really good shaver does not quite get me totally smooth but I did not expect as it usualy takes a barbar and straight razor for that,&lt;br /&gt;that and I must have some super tough facial hair as I haft to replace the head and foil about every forty-five days even though I clean it welllk after ever shave popping the foil and head of giving them a nice rinse and pat down and dusting out the razor chamber then re-assembling and running through the cleaning cycle. Though my facial hair will kil a $12 dollar disposable in 2 shaves so it is overall more economical for old Iron beard here, MWS Barbar trips and disposables. very reliable has not broken down on me yet and charges well.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself did a fine job. However, the cleaning unit start button broke after 2 days. So now it doesn&#x27;t charge or clean the shaver. The button looked and felt like poor quality. Called for return authorization and will not buy this model again.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I had the best braun shaver (whichever the highest series was back in 2001).  The product eventually broke and their service center couldn&#x27;t repair it - so I bought this...definitely not worth the money.  The motor is not strong enough - if you miss a day of shaving and you go at it with this it will grab a hair and pull it rather than cut it...pathetic for the price.  Unbelievable that a more expensive product 10 years down the road is inferior to a predecessor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very well. Not a close shave at all. The holder is huge and glows a blue light.  Not getting another one.</li>
            <li> For being so freakin&#x27; expensive I was expecting quite a lot. And this product landed incredibly short. It gives a very poor shave, leaving highly visible hair even after going over the same area a half dozen times. It so poor you can shave with a disposable razor afterward and it&#x27;ll get what the Braun has missed.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use it to shave ,worth the price under 100 dollars.Good product to recommend to men to buy!</li>
            <li> Not clean enough after use. Still see clear roots of beards. I am not sure whether 7 series will be better.</li>
            <li> The Braun 5 590cc shaver has worked as advertised.  It shaves close and smooth, keeps it charge longer and cleans up well and quickly.  A great deal for the price. I have used Braun shavers since I purchased my first one in 1967, and have never used any other.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it takes me twice as long to get my shaving done. The shaver just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective and it takes a lot of effort to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is just awful. I need to re-charge after every 4-5 shaves - I had to resort to recharging the shaver after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, after just 6 months of use, the foil is torn. I&#x27;ve had enough and chucked it into the bin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like it very much. I decided to wait for the price to buy one for my father</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of other brands of razors that I don&#x27;t use because Braun by far, is the best! I upgraded to the series 5-590cc from a series 3 primarily for the charging/cleaning station but the superb shave was also great!  I like it so much, I bought another one for traveling in my 5th wheel trailer!</li>
            <li> Braun seems to be going downhill.  I have had nothing but Braun&#x27;s for 20+ years.  They have all been great and lasted almost forever.  After leaving the last one on a trip, bought a 3-series that pulled the hair on my face every time I shaved - never has happened with a Braun before.  I then bought this more expensive one, and it did as well, although not nearly as often (and it seems to be getting better).  The charging cord has also gotten shorter - If the battery is dead, it is difficult to shave with the thing plugged in, unless you hold your face next to the wall.  Still not awful, but disappointing compared to what these used to be and considering what they cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary shavers for years.  As long as I shaved every day, they were great.  But if I let things go for 3 or 4 days, the rotary wouldn&#x27;t cut the long whiskers.  So after a lot of research (and seeing Braun featured on \\&quot;How It&#x27;s Made\\&quot;) decided to switch brands.  Well, Braun did slightly better with the long whiskers.  But it does not shave as close as my Norelco.  Even after shaving, there&#x27;s stubble.  And at the end of the day, it feels like two day&#x27;s growth.  This shaver does not meet my expectations because it does not shave as close as my older products.  I wasted over $100 to find this out.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does NOT give a close shave, and 8 hours after shaving it feels like two days of growth.  My old Norelco rotary did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I dislike this shaver more every time I use it.  Not only is it noisy and vibrate too much (far more than the clippers used by my hair stylist) but it grabs and pulls the whiskers, which really hurts.  I don&#x27;t look forward to shaving because it hurts too much and because the result is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> overall i like the razor,it  could shave a little closer around the mouth if it did i would rate it five stars&lt;br /&gt;  EARL D. COCHENOUR</li>
            <li> My third Braun and lives up to my expectations.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have had two other  Braun Shavers in the past but I bought this one this past January and it is a complete waste of money.  It quite simply does not cut  and you can spend forever trying to shave and it will still miss spots.  I waited patiently thinking maybe it was just an adjustment to this razor but hope was lost  in the end.  It is bulkier than in the past and the design of the cutting head seems flawed to me .  The sides of the cutting head are fixed so even though the foil flexes it does not flow well across the skin.</li>
            <li> I consider my skin to be sensitive.  As a young teen, I was never able to go more than 2 consecutive days when attempting to shave with razor and cream; without serious skin irritation. I have favored electric razors for the last 24 years and have owned a handful of models. I usually purchased the mid to high-end models and had good results. The same goes for the Braun 7 series!  It is more affordable than comparable high-end models from other manufactures and provides excellent features and most importantly a very smooth and irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li> The razor under analysis is the Braun 5-series 590cc (I assume that the “cc”, in this case, stands for cubic centimeters so I’ll convert for those of you that are unfamiliar with the metric system – it’s just over half a quart or, if you prefer, 0.157638696351589e-14 cubic miles.  Hope this helps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per Amazon’s Product Features section:&lt;br /&gt;Contour Hugging Head Shaver head automatically adjusts with every facial contour for maximum closeness and comfort&lt;br /&gt;3-stage Cutting System Twin Foils and integrated cutter shave long hairs and stubble progressively close.&lt;br /&gt;Washable under running water for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Contour hugging head and shaver head automatically adjusts with every facial contour for maximum closeness and comfort&lt;br /&gt;This item is not for sale in Catalina Island&lt;br /&gt;(Note - the description has been updated since this review was written.)&lt;br /&gt;I believe this throws into sharp focus Amazon’s lack of copywriting skills.  Is “Contour Hugging Head Shaver” worthy of capitalization?  If so, why is it only worthy once?  Is “not for sale in Catalina Island” really a product feature?  In checking the Catalina Island Chamber’s website, I found that Catalina Island is an “Island of Romance” and that “Adventurers [are] Wanted!”  I also discovered that a Catalina fisherman invented the glass-bottomed boat tour in 1896.  Personally, I would have said that the fisherman either started the first tours or invented the first glass-bottomed boat since the statement as-is implies that prior to 1896, tours didn’t exist which I’m almost positive that they did.  The Catalina Island website also has, under the “Media &amp; Filming” section, a sub-section of “Story Ideas” just in case, as a budding filmmaker, you have the budget and equipment to film on Catalina, but no thoughts on what to film.  10/31/2011 was the 1st annual Zombie Walk on Catalina Island if you’re going to be in the area around All Hallow&#x27;s Eve.This (free!) event is held from 5:00 to 6:00 PM.  Walkers will be unshaven, one would presume.  But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the razor (or shaver, if you prefer) works.  It holds a charge for a long time – long enough for me to shave my face, at least, and reportedly long enough to shave my face for an entire hour.  I don’t know when I’d have the need or even the urge to shave my face for an hour (or, indeed, to share my razor with others in an hour-long shave-a-thon) but it’s nice to know that the option is there.  It works better than the old Panasonic particularly in those areas where, if your growth is at all like mine, you have hairs sprouting in different directions.  It does not work in areas where you neglect to actually run the razor over your face, as apparently I did this morning on a little patch on the right side of my chin.  It’s comfortable to use with finger notches in the side like you might find on the grip of a handgun or some other manly object with finger notches.  Technically, it’s quite simple with a single button (push to turn on, push to turn off.  See?  Simple.)  There is a button on top that adjusts the tightness of the pivot on top but I haven’t found that it reacts much differently in either position.  I was hoping that if I set it for super-sensitive it would react like a high-end car with a “sport” suspension setting so I could kick out the back and do donuts or something.  No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any electric razor I’ve ever used, it’s not quite as close as shaving with a new, sharp blade (except in the ‘stache area where it’s closer for some odd reason)  but I would say it’s more comfortable.  Other razors (both bladed and electric) can yank the odd hair but I haven’t found that this one does.  It’s also made more comfortable by the cleaning system which, though I thought to be a scam initially, actually seems to work quite well.  The charging system suspends the razor upside down over a small container of what appears to be a dilute isopropyl solution.  In addition to charging (which happens automatically upon depositing the razor in the stand) another button push starts a cleaning process which floods all the cutting heads with the solution and vibrates to get all the prickly little hairs out allowing you, potentially, to weigh them (What do you say?  Shout out to my friends from college that listened to waaaay too much Phish.  Or rather made ME listen to waaaay too much Phish.)  There is purported to be something of a lubricant in the solution as well, according to the manufacturer and I have no reason to doubt this.  One customer review claimed that it “felt like a new razor every time!” and I’d say that were accurate if I had noted how it felt the first time and attempted to tally any differences in the feel.  I did not do that.  Though I am writing a review so it’s possible I should have.  It does feel clean every time, I’ll say that much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does one judge the value of an electric razor?  Usability?  They’re all pretty similar.  Comfort?  I’ll give some points there.  Convenience?  I’m not sure it’s THAT much more convenient for me to drop this razor into a charging cradle than it is to plug in a cord.  Sanitation?  Ok, well the alcohol dip is a nice feature but at the same time I’m not aware of electric razors being a breeding zone for Ebola or the Hanta virus.  So is it better than electric razors costing $75 less?  Probably.  Is it as good as razors costing over $100 more?  Probably.  Will a razor you can pick up at Sam’s Club for less than $2 (in quantity) shave your face?  Yes.  Yes it will.  Do I recommend it?  Sure.  It feels like a well-engineered machine that’s made to cut hair off your face.  It’s nice to use and works as advertised.  I don’t think it will mow through the facial hair of a Neander-lithic, two-weeks-of-deer-camp, grows- a-full-beard-by-4:30-anyway gentlemen with a full sprout but that’s not really what it’s made for, now is it?  For most of us, I’d give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It works well.  The cleaning station is great.  I&#x27;m never going back to a system without a self cleaning base.</li>
            <li> oh,it&#x27;s very good!!! it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Well made.  Runs smoothly.  Not too noisy.  Cleaning system works well and imparts a pleasant lemon aroma to the shaver.  The cleaning solution cartridges are easier and neater to use than similar shaver cleaning systems made by other companies.  Good shave, wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the ease and effectiveness of the Braun Series 5-590cc.  It gives me a close shave with a little stubble or thick stubble.  Plus I shopped it and this was the best price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the shaver long enough to tell if it was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.  Easy cleaning....</li>
            <li> I have long been a rotary shaver user, but I bought this shaver around 2 years ago to see if it is any better than the previous norelco&#x27;s I have used. It is far better. Closer shave, shorter time to remove hair, especially on the sensitive neck area. Too boot, when it broke recently, amazon replaced it free of charge. Great shaver, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted a shaver with a cleaning system at first, but now that I have it I really like it.  It makes a huge difference in how well it shaves from one time to the next and extends the time when I think I may need to get a new shaving head for it.  I had an older Braun and I&#x27;m sure I replaced the heads many times, simply because they were not clean or lubricated.</li>
            <li> Great German quality, shaves great and the cleaner and charger works super!</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in the shaver. expected a much closer shave</li>
            <li> My friend kindly bought this as gift from Amazon, so I review it under my account after a week use. I thought the new opti-foil shaver head is so far so good compared with old 8585, I still need more time to tell the on-going performance and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed at the sleek handle design, which is more fashionable, away from Braun clean-cut design for 30 years, I have to adapt my taste to accept. Overall quality and workmanship are the same as old Braun, it is manufactured by those who commit themselves and love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the charge and cleaning stand is disappointing, compared with 8585 cleaning stand, which is by far the benchmark of all cleaning stand from Philips/Braun/Panasonic. This one has no menu setting except start button, even lock button is omitted. Does it make everything simple and better? I am afraid not. After one-week use, I came to conclude can neither clean to my satisfaction nor dry the shaver within 2 hours. I had to wash it under water then insert to clean, finally remove foil to dry. Guess 7 series is different league...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Browsing Braun web site (international instead of states), I could see new 5 series (cassette head design) was launched in Europe and replaced this 5 series. Its arrival time might be scheduled after dealers run out of old inventory. It seems inevitable Braun quits their old cutter/foil design.</li>
            <li> this was a christmas present as well. it serves its purpose and the gentleman bought for loves it. thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have had two different rotary shavers and this is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  the cleaning system seemed an overkill but it works great.  I use the cleaning system about once per week and it makes the inside look brand new.</li>
            <li> The instructions said to wait a couple weeks to let your skin to get use to the shave and I have never used a shaver before so i was willing to try because i was tired of buying blades a high prices. My first shave was exellent and have had it a week and I love it , have great shaves from the first time i used it. My skin feels great , a lot better than scraping my face with baldes. I am wring this to help black men to know that they have a choice. I looked online and for black men the only shaver was the Wahl foil shaver so thats why i decided to try the Braun foil shave and glad i did.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun razors for years. I have had many different models. This Braun 5-590 is OK but not great.</li>
