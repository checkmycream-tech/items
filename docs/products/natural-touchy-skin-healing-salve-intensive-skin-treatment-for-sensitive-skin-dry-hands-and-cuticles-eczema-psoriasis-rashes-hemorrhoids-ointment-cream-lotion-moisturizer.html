            <li> i have a dry skin</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry and this helps to keep them moist.</li>
            <li> I even broke down and used Aquaphor (I dislike smearing petroleum on my baby), but that only provided temporary relief.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying the bigger jar when I run out, but I assume that this small jar will last about two months.</li>
            <li> red ans hos itching is cut in half.</li>
            <li> my kids would get red bottoms every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried lots of other brands of creams, salves, etc.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I will be writing reviews on products, but when a credit is due...</li>
            <li> And The Other For The Wife...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a little canvas sack.</li>
            <li> It protected their little bottoms and  gave them a chance to heal.  </li>
            <li> My oldest gets dry skin on his t-zone and lower body terribly and my youngest gets mild eczema on his cheeks and legs during the winter.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what caused it.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable while wearing clothes.</li>
            <li> and i hate summer and winter for that..</li>

            <li> Give you skin exactly what it needs! This is the perfect salve for sensitive skin. My girlfriend is sensitive to scents so I purchased this unscented salve and my girlfriend absolutely loves it! She loved it so much she ordered more products for her besties new born. Ora has great products and I stand by the products.</li>
            <li> I met a really nice man while grabbing a coffee NY and he told me to try this product. Funny thing is that he did not know that I had eczema problems growing up. After trying so many different products I have found a natural way to soothe dry skin. I am sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels great and has a nice oil finish to it, which is great for dry spots on your skin. It also doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable while wearing clothes. I highly recommend this salve. The unscented options are also a plus. If you want an all natural way to treat skin problems, this combination of ingredients is a great solution.</li>
            <li> finally i found what i was looking for a long time..beside its being at reasonable price, cream works like a magic...i have a dry skin and i hate summer and winter for that..i tried mostly all cream..tried them all..none of them ,well ok some of them worked little bit..my friend told me about this product..i said &#x27;&#x27;its 8-9 dollar&#x27;&#x27;worth to try..im glad i did:)i  would recommend everyone who has problems with their skin...:)</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry flaky skin near my ankle that would not go away. I tried one lotion after another and eczema creams, but it didn&#x27;t respond to anything.  I saw this salve on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.  After 3 days of using Ora&#x27;s Salve, I see and feel marked improvement!  I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome - Bought it for treating eczema but ended up using it also as a replacement for conventional diaper creams, since it&#x27;s more natural and works better and is safe with cloth diapers!</li>
            <li> works great for burns,rashes,dry skin and just about everything!</li>
            <li> Great product, I usually have some areas the remain ashy everyone lotion for some body parts but that&#x27;s where Ora herbal salve comes handy. Another thing I like about it is that it&#x27;s organic,natural and doesn&#x27;t have any scent. Therefore it could be used aby time for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have two young boys ages 3 and 1 year old. My oldest gets dry skin on his t-zone and lower body terribly and my youngest gets mild eczema on his cheeks and legs during the winter. I applied the salve all over his body after his bath and when he woke up the next morning, his skin was still smooth and I didn&#x27;t need to apply more. I definitely see a difference in the quality of this product and overpriced drug store lotions. This salve does the trick and I appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. I use it as a barrier on my lips before applying lipstick and it keeps my lips moisturized throughout the day. The great thing I enjoy about this product is that it&#x27;s highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Also, the fact that it&#x27;s unscented makes it easier to use and my kids and I love it. I plan on buying the bigger jar when I run out, but I assume that this small jar will last about two months. Definitely would recommend to people dealing with severe dry skin, eczema, and looking for an all natural and healthier alternative to moisturizing their skin.</li>
            <li> I love this salve. It is  not heavy and greasy like a lot of salves are. I use this on face and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hands with staying soft and healthy tremendouslythrough this rough winter. Would recommend and I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a yoga teacher which means I am always in search of the perfect product to keep my hands and feeling great. After the first application I could feel a difference. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily afterwards. I definitely would look into other products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a little canvas sack. I really loved that extra touch.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. I cannot say enough good things. My sons skin is so much better after using this product. I am amazed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product &amp; am so glad I did.  It was just what I needed. Fast shipment as well!!</li>
            <li> Omg my son has hoorrbly severe eczema and his skin stays ren amd flaky this stuff goes on at might and in the morning hes not red ans hos itching is cut in half. He looks totally dofferent his legs no longer red. So grateful for this stuff actually have a bogger jar in my cart as i type. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> For someone with sensitive skin and eczema this was the perfect solution for moistening and soothing my inflammation without agitating my skin. There&#x27;s practically no place on my body I wouldn&#x27;t put this stuff!</li>
            <li> My 6 month old son was getting dry skin.  I&#x27;ve only ever used natural products on him so I&#x27;m not sure what caused it.  Anyway, I tried lots of other brands of creams, salves, etc.  I even broke down and used Aquaphor (I dislike smearing petroleum on my baby), but that only provided temporary relief.  After one week of using Ora&#x27;s Skin Salve my son&#x27;s skin is back to normal.  No chapping, no little bumps, etc.  I&#x27;m ordering it in the larger size now!  It&#x27;s going to be great in the winter too!</li>
            <li> Great product works great on my sons skin and I even use it for his lips</li>
            <li> Seemed to be nicely emollient but not sure about the healing properties. I like the way my skin feels after using.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing! I never thought I will be writing reviews on products, but when a credit is due...&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift, but after using this couple of time, I purchased my own. Will recommend those to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Being a hairstylist for 20+ years and a mom my hands are always in water.The Skin Salve is the only product I found to keep my hands feeling soft and young looking. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. Will forever purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;All of Ora&#x27;s Amazing Herbal products are wonderful and safe for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. Cuticals, cuts, bites, I could go on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is super soft, great texture. My lips are always dry and this helps to keep them moist. I also use this on my hands, and under my eyes, is not greasy at all. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Even with only breastfeeding and mostly cloth diapers  my kids would get red bottoms every few weeks. I always used  this sensitive skin salve first.  It protected their little bottoms and  gave them a chance to heal.  Since it was all natural and designed for sensitive skin I  even used it on my newborn!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Great To Have...Nice And Soothing On Skin, Brought 2 One For Me And The Other For The Wife...Simply A Must Have!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! works great on every little hangnail, dry cuticles, and even dry itchy skin patches. All natural, lasts a long time, and no &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; fragrance. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone to give it  try. And made locally in NJ, by a MOM and is an independent family owned business - the BEST kind of business to support, They put quality and craftsmanship above all else. No big national corporation is going t put the kind of love and care into their products like Ora&#x27;s does. They have a customer for life :)</li>
