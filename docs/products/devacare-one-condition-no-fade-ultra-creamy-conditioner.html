            <li>LOVE this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 8 months and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>No-Poo and One Condition, and the difference was astounding.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so nice</li>
            <li>I have been using this for three weeks, and it does a nice job of conditioning my curly hair.</li>
            <li>My curls are better than ever, and my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for curls, does not leave residue of any kind, keeps your hair soft and frizz-safe, it does not have a strong smell so it won&#x27;t give you headaches</li>
            <li>The product is free of sulfates and &#x27;cones, very important for Curly Girls!</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked 100% better.  </li>
            <li>I even got compliments on my hair and asked what I was using to make it look better.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels better with just the Cleanser</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how bouncy it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the devacare line of products.  </li>
            <li>My hair just reacts better to it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>ut has also  improved the  damaged part on top as well.</li>
            <li>great product at a much better price than any local retailer...</li>
            <li>Light for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that issue with the salon version of this which leads me to think this is a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>It does nothing to help detangle my curls or smooth out my frizz.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product from Devacare</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t condition the hair well or clean it.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, not even looking for curly hair, and love the Deva products.  </li>
            <li>My color stays true longer with this line of product.</li>
            <li>Excellent for thick hair -  my hair is shiny and controlled when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you wash your hair more frequent, but you will still need to shampoo in between for build up.</li>
            <li>I received this super quickly and it was really well packaged.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner had made a huge improvement on the  looks of  my hair - mostly on the other areas</li>
            <li>I would highly recoment this product to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li>I tested this by stopping the products then restarting, and sure enough they are the culprit.</li>
            <li>Overall, love the whole line of these products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>This conditioner came in a Deva bottle but the odor is remarkably strong and malodorous and is a different color.</li>
            <li>I have also tried DevaCurl, but I much prefer the smell and results I get from DevaCare.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like it since I am a curly girl.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually very neutral,</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product was much thinner than when I purchased it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>and it really did help.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.</li>
            <li>I have recently  gotten a perm on top of my already natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my hair looks and feels even better than when I was using the no-poo with other brand conditioners.</li>
            <li>I now get tons of compliments on my hair when it is down, and I love the smell of my hair after I wash and condition it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had what I thought was a cold all summer - turns out - sadly - I&#x27;m allergic to one or more of the great, highly effective Deva products.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to be ALOT more moisturizing then the other, One Condition, but it feels the same to me..</li>
            <li>I had to use much more than usual.</li>
            <li>I am African-American and have been natural (3b - 4a) for almost 3 years now.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>it revitalizes my locks and changes the texture into soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair from it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesnt contain the harsh chemicals that regular hair products contain.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is DevaCARE in the white bottle for fine/thinner wavy or curly hair, and the DevaCurl (green bottle) for thicker more course hair.</li>
            <li>I struggled for a long time with my daughters intense curls until I discovered The Curly Girl book which is written by the woman who developed these products.</li>
            <li>The DevaCurl seems to leave a little more residue after rinsing but doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li>Ive only used this twice so far and my hair has been softer and curlier than ever!</li>
            <li>Also, I get the Brazilian Blowout, but it has been wearing off lately and this has left all the frizzy spots smooth, shiny and ultra soft.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in for my naturally curly hair following a cowash (cleansing with a conditioner).  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain this is a some generic product transferred to an empty Deva bottle, or they slapped a Deva label on an empty bottle.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I have color threated my hair for a long time and this has been the only one product that has helped me restore them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if the no fade claim works.</li>
            <li> Parts of my hair that normally do not curl or wave up, no matter what products I use, all of a sudden had definition.</li>
            <li> I can actually hear my hair squeak when I comb it wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to say how much of a difference the conditioner makes (my gray hair is still dry and sometimes frizzy) but it is helpful to have one line of hair products designed to work together for curly hair...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also had a few highlights put in before the perm and it left the top of my hair  extremely dry, straighter and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Dried my nautral thin fine 4A hair out.</li>
            <li> Like my other review of Deva Care No Poo, these products are not DEVA CURL, the color is different, as is the consistency and odor.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to my sister, and also anyone that I see with dry looking curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked ugly,and dry.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one with curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser cuts my curly hair while it&#x27;s dry and uses all Deva products.  </li>
            <li> , it leaves my hair feeling dry and course.</li>
            <li> Will not strip and dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I was going through a period when my hair was extremely dry and dull; and after one use of this product my new and improved hair was here.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I cheap out and use other less expensive products, but I always end up running back to DevaCare Curl conditioner, no poo cleaners and gel.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was a mess with the regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Choose carefully between Deva Curl &amp; Deva Care.</li>
            <li> One Condition seemed to bring my hair back from the dead and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It actually helps to prolong my color, I uses a semi-permanent color on my hair, permanent color is too harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for years because I was so tired of the commercial shampoos and conditioners that strip natural goodness from hair with all the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> and I only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair.</li>
            <li> The down side of this color is that it fades quicker.  </li>
            <li> Before I used Deva Concepts products I could not wear my hair down at all, without it looking a mess.  </li>
            <li> They also produce an odd smoky smell that lingers in my sinus tract for a day even after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo takes a little getting used to because there&#x27;s no suds which we all grew up with.</li>
            <li> and I have a few little bumps on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Both shampoo &amp; conditioner looked like thick gooey pink cream.</li>
            <li> I prefer the one in the green pacakge</li>
            <li> If anything, it actually dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> it takes us about 5 months to use the conditioner which goes faster than the shampoo (as we don&#x27;t shampoo everyday).</li>
            <li> I even use a small amount as a leave in and dont rinse.</li>
            <li> I actually ran out of it recently, made my order late :(</li>
            <li> There is only a hint of citrus but the other ingredients overpower it making this conditioner smell awful!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same :(</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will return to purchasing it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a pump though as it is dreadfully difficult to use as is.</li>

            <li> Before I used Deva Concepts products I could not wear my hair down at all, without it looking a mess.  I have type 3b curls, and was always teased for having puffy untamed frizz.  I started using DevaCare No-Poo and One Condition, and the difference was astounding.  I now get tons of compliments on my hair when it is down, and I love the smell of my hair after I wash and condition it.  I have also tried DevaCurl, but I much prefer the smell and results I get from DevaCare.  I have recommended it to my sister, and also anyone that I see with dry looking curls.  I guarantee that if you have curly hair like mine, and no sensitivity to scents, that you will fall in love with these wonderful products.  I sure did!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be ALOT more moisturizing then the other, One Condition, but it feels the same to me..</li>
            <li> I only use DEVA products and have been for close to 3 years now!! I have even started to use them on my children! I love how it doesnt contain the harsh chemicals that regular hair products contain. I would highly recoment this product to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> Like my other review of Deva Care No Poo, these products are not DEVA CURL, the color is different, as is the consistency and odor. Both shampoo &amp; conditioner looked like thick gooey pink cream. I won&#x27;t even consider trying them. They are going back tomorrow and I&#x27;ll purchase Deva CURL!!!  Did some research after initially doing review...Not imposter...Had to find out- This is item suggested for color treated hair.  I prefer Deva Curl, lighter consistancy and different fragrance. Would be helpful if differentiation was in descriptions! Choose carefully between Deva Curl &amp; Deva Care.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the shampoo [[ASIN:B000TKF15A DevaCare Cleanser, No-Poo, 32-Ounce Bottle]] that goes along with it are great for curly hair.  You can also use it as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had what I thought was a cold all summer - turns out - sadly - I&#x27;m allergic to one or more of the great, highly effective Deva products. They also produce an odd smoky smell that lingers in my sinus tract for a day even after washing my hair. I tested this by stopping the products then restarting, and sure enough they are the culprit. What a shame because they&#x27;re the best performers I&#x27;ve found for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and have been natural (3b - 4a) for almost 3 years now. I have been searching for the perfect hair regimen throughout the years, and have found the perfect conditioner for MY HAIR. Deva CARE (not Deva Curl) One Condition seemed to bring my hair back from the dead and lifeless. I was going through a period when my hair was extremely dry and dull; and after one use of this product my new and improved hair was here. Parts of my hair that normally do not curl or wave up, no matter what products I use, all of a sudden had definition. I mean from the root to tip!!!! One Condition helps to define my curls, provides lots of moisture, and makes my hair happy!</li>
            <li> I received this super quickly and it was really well packaged. It was protected and wrapped so there wasn&#x27;t anyleaking. In perfect \\&quot;condition\\&quot; ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking the Low Poo, but this conditioner does not detangle my hair.  Smells okay.  Not worth the price.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing.  It seems to be making my scalp itch and I have a few little bumps on my scalp.  I didn&#x27;t have that issue with the salon version of this which leads me to think this is a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hair dresser told her that it would be good for her to use devacare on her hair.  She did and loved it, and told me about it.  My hair looked ugly,and dry.  I have tried different over the counter stuff before but it did nothing for my hair.  I tried devacare and I noticed a difference right away.  My hair looked 100% better.  I even got compliments on my hair and asked what I was using to make it look better.  I would recommend this product to any one with curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser cuts my curly hair while it&#x27;s dry and uses all Deva products.  It is hard to say how much of a difference the conditioner makes (my gray hair is still dry and sometimes frizzy) but it is helpful to have one line of hair products designed to work together for curly hair...rather than wading through the aisles of product lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this product.  I was really hoping to like it since I am a curly girl.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel very good at all.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
            <li> This conditioner came in a Deva bottle but the odor is remarkably strong and malodorous and is a different color. I&#x27;m fairly certain this is a some generic product transferred to an empty Deva bottle, or they slapped a Deva label on an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.  My hair feels better with just the Cleanser, maybe I need to use for longer period of time</li>
            <li> Best product ever for curls, does not leave residue of any kind, keeps your hair soft and frizz-safe, it does not have a strong smell so it won&#x27;t give you headaches it&#x27;s actually very neutral,</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was much thinner than when I purchased it elsewhere. I had to use much more than usual. Needless to say, I will return to purchasing it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after using the Devacurl One Condition because of the smell hoping this would work the same but smell like citrus as advertised. There is only a hint of citrus but the other ingredients overpower it making this conditioner smell awful! Not only do I not like the smell, it leaves my hair feeling dry and course. It does nothing to help detangle my curls or smooth out my frizz. I can actually hear my hair squeak when I comb it wet. I will be going back to both the Devacurl No-Poo and Devacurl One Condition.</li>
            <li> Hated the orange scent. Dried my nautral thin fine 4A hair out. I prefer the one in the green pacakge</li>
            <li> Deva Care is an awesome line, I am so glad it was recommended to me. My curls are better than ever, and my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DevaCare One Condition for years... nothing leaves my hair and scalp this moisturized. I even take a dab in my palm after showering and use it as a leave-in. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner. Light for fine hair. Works well and doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair.</li>
            <li> I did not feel or see any moisturizing effects of this conditioner. If anything, it actually dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> have used this product for a year now... this is not the same product as I purchased before.  It&#x27;s consistency and smell are different.  Have used it and my hair ihas not responded to this product as it did my last bottle.  Something is not the same.  Counterfeit product in a Deva Curl bottle....... so sick of being ripped off!</li>
            <li> It actually helps to prolong my color, I uses a semi-permanent color on my hair, permanent color is too harsh and drying.  The down side of this color is that it fades quicker.  I gave no-fade a try and it really did help.</li>
            <li> The DevaCurl Conditioner works better for me than the DevaCare Conditioner, but this is still a great product.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this twice so far and my hair has been softer and curlier than ever! I love the smell and how bouncy it makes my hair. definitely a great hydrator!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly. I have been using this product for over 8 months and works amazingly. I have color threated my hair for a long time and this has been the only one product that has helped me restore them. I actually ran out of it recently, made my order late :( so I had to use another conditioner until my DevaCare One Condtioner gets here and my hair was a mess with the regular conditioner. You can really see the difference. Its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Before I discovered Deva Curls products I was hopeless, now I don&#x27;t even think to go back to regular shampoos and conditioners. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> If you have curls like my curls you want DevaCare.  great product at a much better price than any local retailer...and once you use the DevaCare One Conditioner you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> From the house of Devachan, this conditioner is perfect for color-treated or over-40 hair.  I use it as a leave in for my naturally curly hair following a cowash (cleansing with a conditioner).  The product is free of sulfates and &#x27;cones, very important for Curly Girls!</li>
            <li> This with the Deva Care No Poo is a must for all cury hair.  It truly will change the way you see your hair and yourself.  You will love your curls with this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I started with the coordinating no-poo shampoo. Anyhow, with great results I decided to try this conditioner. I have not been disappointed. In fact, my hair looks and feels even better than when I was using the no-poo with other brand conditioners. Also, I get the Brazilian Blowout, but it has been wearing off lately and this has left all the frizzy spots smooth, shiny and ultra soft. I wish it came with a pump though as it is dreadfully difficult to use as is.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for curly hair!  I love the devacare line of products.  Sometimes I cheap out and use other less expensive products, but I always end up running back to DevaCare Curl conditioner, no poo cleaners and gel.  My hair just reacts better to it.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the regular One Condition. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if the no fade claim works.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, not even looking for curly hair, and love the Deva products.  Good for my hair!  I&#x27;ve used these products for years because I was so tired of the commercial shampoos and conditioners that strip natural goodness from hair with all the harsh chemicals.  Money, yes!  But a little goes a long way!  Buy the big bottle, it lasts for months and months!  The shampoo takes a little getting used to because there&#x27;s no suds which we all grew up with.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using the DevaConcepts products for close to a year now and we love them!  My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s been in a long time.  I struggled for a long time with my daughters intense curls until I discovered The Curly Girl book which is written by the woman who developed these products. Now, my daughter&#x27;s cork screw curls are shiny and beautiful.  I would highly recommend this.  I buy this in the 32 oz bottle and between my daughter and myself it takes us about 5 months to use the conditioner which goes faster than the shampoo (as we don&#x27;t shampoo everyday).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s conditioner.  What do you want me to say.  YAY! YAY! YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!  YAY!YAY! YAY! YAY!YAY! YAY! YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!  YAY! YAY! YAY!</li>
            <li> Good. Will use again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The smell is so nice and it leaves my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this along with devacare no poo. Works great and I only need a small amount.  I even use a small amount as a leave in and dont rinse. A 12 oz bottle of this lasts through almost 2 32 oz bottles of no poo cleanser.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t condition the hair well or clean it. I haven&#x27;t bought another bottle or plan too.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product from Devacare&lt;br /&gt;I comb it through my hair and let it sit for several hours.&lt;br /&gt; it revitalizes my locks and changes the texture into soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the regular deva curl one condition... It doesn&#x27;t smell the same :(</li>
            <li> Great product I love it!</li>
            <li> The only conditioner for the curly</li>
            <li> This is the best line for girls with any type of curl. Will not strip and dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and this has been great! My color stays true longer with this line of product. I would recommend if you wash your hair more frequent, but you will still need to shampoo in between for build up. Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair from it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Works wonders!  I have recently  gotten a perm on top of my already natural curly hair.  Unfortunately, I also had a few highlights put in before the perm and it left the top of my hair  extremely dry, straighter and frizzy.  This conditioner had made a huge improvement on the  looks of  my hair - mostly on the other areas ut has also  improved the  damaged part on top as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three weeks, and it does a nice job of conditioning my curly hair. I don&#x27;t even need to use product in it after washing the curl stays so well.</li>
            <li> Excellent for thick hair -  my hair is shiny and controlled when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Good product for curly hair. I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.</li>
            <li> I have tried the DevaCurl and DevaCare One Condition. The DevaCurl seems to leave a little more residue after rinsing but doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or make it frizzy. Perhaps this formula is just a deeper conditioner. My recommendation is DevaCARE in the white bottle for fine/thinner wavy or curly hair, and the DevaCurl (green bottle) for thicker more course hair. Overall, love the whole line of these products and will continue to use them. Go Curls!</li>
