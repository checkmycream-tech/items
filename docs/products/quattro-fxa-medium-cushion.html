            <li>Quality outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this mask for almost four years, and I can&#x27;t imagine another mask working any better for me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works great.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a better one.</li>
            <li>It turns out that it works better on the mask for my CPAP machine. &#x3D;\</li>
            <li>Great fast and</li>
            <li>The company is not to blame, but the USPS delayed the item for many days after the estimated date of arrival.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad the Amazon carries all this items for peoples</li>
            <li>and he is satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly well with the compatible mask, and seems to basically be the same cushion that the mask originally came with.  </li>
            <li>This was great for everything, right size, right price,fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Came in a authentic resmed packaging, fit rights.</li>
            <li>fit my mask fine and price is okay</li>
            <li>It was very clean and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to clean your mask and keep your retaining clip.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old one, makes it easy to swap and clean.</li>
            <li>Fits and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Typical ResMed , outstanding !!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how they expect you to fit the mask without opening</li>
            <li>Fit like it was made for it LOL&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable.  </li>
            <li>As a result, it does not always fit snug.</li>
            <li>If you are a CPAP user and you&#x27;re looking for a comfortable mask, I recommend this</li>
            <li>The company I used however was VERY fast and helpful, but I need some personal more to the point help on what others have experienced.</li>
            <li>Just like the original one and packaged in sealed ResMed packaging.</li>
            <li>Works to replace original equipment.</li>
            <li>Replaces the original without any problems.</li>
            <li>The cushion I received was an original ResMed replacement cushion for the Quattro Fx medium mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have fit had it been made to fit my particular mask.  </li>
            <li>I wash mine twice in Dawn liquid every morning until it is squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I originally would purchase the full face mask with head gear from Resmed or any of 3 (Googled) CPAP sites costing $185 (ResMed Quattro FX</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the price is good compared to other suppliers</li>
            <li>Full Face Mask - size Medium Ref #</li>
            <li>ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask silicon cushion Medium&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that was also full face</li>
            <li>Since you have to get a Rx to buy the whole mask, this is a creative way to purchase the parts separately.</li>
            <li>Works great and came sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>Just wears out rather quickly and needs to replaced often.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered and fit my existing mask correctly.</li>
            <li>The price for this cushion was excellent - MUCH less than our local supplier charges - and it was shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely look in to purchasing more of our CPAP supplies this way!</li>
            <li>This cushion is great, and I think it is the best full faced mask out there, especially if you are tired of the middle forehead dimples from those with forehead supports.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask more from a vendor than giving you what you expect to be buying at a decent price and without a hassle.</li>
            <li>Works but not quite right.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite right.</li>
            <li>LOved paying less for this.</li>
            <li>I really like this cushion, it is as good if not better than the original cushion that came with the mask.</li>
            <li>the exact part I needed at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>I will also use mild soap (antibacterial dish soap with no scent) and cool water to clean the cushion and hard shell of the face mask about once a week mostly for sterilization and appearance.</li>
            <li>Only when I threatned the Better Buisness Beruo did Amazon itself step in to make this right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was an exact replacement and have had zero issues with it.</li>
            <li>It is not a knock-off or generic brand, it is a ResMed product in ResMed packaging, it is exactly the same as the original cushion that came with my mask and the two other replacement cushions I have gone through, and it fits the mask perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My wife and myself attempted to get it onto the mask for HOURS, Original was designed deliberately much thinner than the Cushions on older masks so that they MUST be replaced every year or</li>
            <li>This also works well with my facial hair - I don&#x27;t notice much (if any) leaking and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to shave just because I&#x27;m a CPAP user.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that certain spices will impart their smell to the equipment.</li>
            <li>fits better and stays in place better than any other mask and headgear I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li>Garlic and Oregano are particularly strong smelling and can be noticed the following night!</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>They work very well for the cost compaired to purchasing  them thru insurance.</li>
            <li>Not much to say this is a authentic replacement for the quattro</li>
            <li>This makes replacements much easier</li>
            <li>Always read the print of your old mask cushion for the right manufacture.</li>
            <li>RESMED is a good source for this item and I will reorder from them due to their really low price.</li>
            <li>The larger mask is my original Resmed mask size small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this at such a discounted Price.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about a replacement cushion for a CPAP mask, but I will say that I love my Quattro Fx mask, and getting a new cushion makes it work the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>These last for a good bit, but since I never clean them, I have to replace them about every 5 months.</li>
            <li>would suggest purchasing this particular mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>We had to get new supplies for the machine.</li>
            <li>The mask is comfortable enough and works well when seated properly.</li>
            <li>This saves quite a bit of money AND the customer service from the seller was outstanding - above and beyond what I could have expected.  </li>
            <li>My copay from the local medical supply was more than the total cost from Amazon.</li>
            <li>the full face mask (minus the cushion) lasts well over a year before the elasticity of the head gear wears out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, a small cushion is not going to fit properly on a large frame...or vice versa.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leak as long as its on right.  </li>
            <li>Local supply shops only carried the full mask+head gear, for a tune of 150.</li>
            <li>Early on I found toothpaste far too abrasive and scared the inside of the mask!</li>
            <li>The fit was spot on and made my mask have a tight seal once again.</li>
            <li>I realized that the clear silicon cushion is what really needs to be replaced at regular intervals and is available for 20% less at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The sizing for the frame can be found on the clear plastic where the headgear buckles in to the mask, on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IE: When you take the mask off, frequently the cushion detaches from the faceplate.</li>
            <li>It fits very well, and provides a big improvement in mask performance.</li>
            <li>My insurance only covers a purchase of a new mask every year.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my old Fx, that was about 16 months old and starting to tear.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the cushion itself is too easy to fall out of the plastic faceplate.</li>
            <li>No more need to spend $300 locally for a full mask.</li>
            <li>The rubber is VERY thin on the edges, and although this mask works for me better than the old forehead pounding one I had</li>
            <li>I believe because I now live in a very dry climate, a cushion lasts up to 3 or 4 months.</li>

            <li> I really like this cushion, it is as good if not better than the original cushion that came with the mask.</li>
            <li> the exact part I needed at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I will also use mild soap (antibacterial dish soap with no scent) and cool water to clean the cushion and hard shell of the face mask about once a week mostly for sterilization and appearance.</li>
            <li> Only when I threatned the Better Buisness Beruo did Amazon itself step in to make this right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Was an exact replacement and have had zero issues with it.</li>
            <li> It is not a knock-off or generic brand, it is a ResMed product in ResMed packaging, it is exactly the same as the original cushion that came with my mask and the two other replacement cushions I have gone through, and it fits the mask perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife and myself attempted to get it onto the mask for HOURS, Original was designed deliberately much thinner than the Cushions on older masks so that they MUST be replaced every year or</li>
            <li> This also works well with my facial hair - I don&#x27;t notice much (if any) leaking and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to shave just because I&#x27;m a CPAP user.</li>
            <li> Also be aware that certain spices will impart their smell to the equipment.</li>
            <li> fits better and stays in place better than any other mask and headgear I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> Garlic and Oregano are particularly strong smelling and can be noticed the following night!</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> They work very well for the cost compaired to purchasing  them thru insurance.</li>
            <li> Not much to say this is a authentic replacement for the quattro</li>
            <li> This makes replacements much easier</li>
            <li> Always read the print of your old mask cushion for the right manufacture.</li>
            <li> RESMED is a good source for this item and I will reorder from them due to their really low price.</li>
            <li> The larger mask is my original Resmed mask size small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this at such a discounted Price.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about a replacement cushion for a CPAP mask, but I will say that I love my Quattro Fx mask, and getting a new cushion makes it work the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> These last for a good bit, but since I never clean them, I have to replace them about every 5 months.</li>
            <li> would suggest purchasing this particular mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> We had to get new supplies for the machine.</li>
            <li> The mask is comfortable enough and works well when seated properly.</li>
            <li> This saves quite a bit of money AND the customer service from the seller was outstanding - above and beyond what I could have expected.  </li>
            <li> My copay from the local medical supply was more than the total cost from Amazon.</li>
            <li> the full face mask (minus the cushion) lasts well over a year before the elasticity of the head gear wears out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, a small cushion is not going to fit properly on a large frame...or vice versa.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak as long as its on right.  </li>
            <li> Local supply shops only carried the full mask+head gear, for a tune of 150.</li>
            <li> Early on I found toothpaste far too abrasive and scared the inside of the mask!</li>
            <li> The fit was spot on and made my mask have a tight seal once again.</li>
            <li> I realized that the clear silicon cushion is what really needs to be replaced at regular intervals and is available for 20% less at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The sizing for the frame can be found on the clear plastic where the headgear buckles in to the mask, on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IE: When you take the mask off, frequently the cushion detaches from the faceplate.</li>
            <li> It fits very well, and provides a big improvement in mask performance.</li>
            <li> My insurance only covers a purchase of a new mask every year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Fx, that was about 16 months old and starting to tear.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cushion itself is too easy to fall out of the plastic faceplate.</li>
            <li> No more need to spend $300 locally for a full mask.</li>
            <li> The rubber is VERY thin on the edges, and although this mask works for me better than the old forehead pounding one I had</li>
            <li> I believe because I now live in a very dry climate, a cushion lasts up to 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> Works as expected although the price is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to pay.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small cushion for a small frame and it was just a little too large to fit.</li>
            <li> Just buy these and some new headgear and less than half the price of a new mask.</li>
            <li> The frame comes in Small, Medium, and Large and so do the cushions.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat durable, it didn&#x27;t last long against my puppy. .</li>
            <li> So the new one you send to me did not fit.</li>
            <li> My old cushion was really bad and this one made my nights better.</li>
            <li> I do recommend washing the cushion every single day in something that cuts through oil, something like dish soap, to help it to last longer.  </li>
            <li> The one star is not for the quality of the product, which seems to be fine, but rather for the inadequate information - this cushion ALSO needs the thin little inner frame, and needs to be fitted to that in order for the sub-assembly to be fitted into the mask.  </li>
            <li> Wrong fit, but my problem.  </li>
            <li> I can wear mine twice as long as he can.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends old cushion was well past the point of needing replaced.</li>
            <li> I think it may have something to do with facial whiskers breaking it down sooner than one would expect.  </li>
            <li> I could not wrestle the cushion onto the existing frame, and so had to visit the pharmacy to buy another cushion, which came fitted with the little inner frame.      </li>
            <li> Just as expected</li>
            <li> This product is just as I expected.</li>
            <li> have found no difference (except price) between the cushions ordered from Amazon.com and the other sites I have previously mentioned.</li>
            <li> If this was molded to go under your chin to help hold the mask down and your mouth shut, there would never need to be another design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> These last for about 2-3 months then turn white from your skin oil and they fail.</li>
            <li> because I feel its a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I know it has to be sterile, but it&#x27;s a little hunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> Just did not fit well.</li>
            <li> Then to find it to small was unable to return it because it was open.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this thing now.</li>
            <li> I can usually get about a year out of a cushion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately on the mask I had, the size written  in the mask was different</li>
            <li> Oil from skin seems to cause it to break down faster, which results in a poor seal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hard shell of the face mask should be thoroughly cleaned about once a week or when spots begin to appear on the inside.</li>
            <li> Quattro FX frame (hard plastic parts) is not standardized.  </li>
            <li> The USPS sucks and they have used up all the excuses known to women.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT MASK!!  </li>
            <li> To bad they do not last longer, about 2 months is all I get.</li>
            <li> Was unable check size untill I opened pkg.</li>
            <li> it is expensive</li>
            <li> Sadly, the mask comes with inferior headgear, but that&#x27;s the fault of Resmed, not any supplier.</li>
            <li> instead of 5 stars is because I think this product is too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> One side of cushion was twisted.</li>
            <li> Is very thin and flimsy and will not stay on.</li>
            <li> The plastic was not the usual quality and it is leaking terribly.</li>
            <li> the chin strap I had to use with a nasal mask was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t really ask more from a vendor than giving you what you expect to be buying at a decent price and without a hassle.</li>
            <li> Wrong fit, but my problem.  I&#x27;m sure it would have fit had it been made to fit my particular mask.  Always read the print of your old mask cushion for the right manufacture.</li>
            <li> Just like the one he had!</li>
            <li> Worked very well. Fit perfect in the mask. No issues with the quality. Recommended for those who have the compatible mask. Good shipping time.</li>
            <li> The one star is not for the quality of the product, which seems to be fine, but rather for the inadequate information - this cushion ALSO needs the thin little inner frame, and needs to be fitted to that in order for the sub-assembly to be fitted into the mask.  I could not wrestle the cushion onto the existing frame, and so had to visit the pharmacy to buy another cushion, which came fitted with the little inner frame.      If this cushion was supposed to come fitted to its necessary frame - and without it this is not usable -- that didn&#x27;t happen.    If I missed something in the ad, I apologize to the seller.</li>
            <li> Is very thin and flimsy and will not stay on. This size Med is smaller than my Resmed small.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest purchasing this particular mask.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how they expect you to fit the mask without opening package.&lt;br /&gt;I have a side by side comparison below. The larger mask is my original Resmed mask size small.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller one in the Quattro Fx Medium.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for about a year and a half. The mask is comfortable enough and works well when seated properly. My only complaint is that the cushion itself is too easy to fall out of the plastic faceplate. IE: When you take the mask off, frequently the cushion detaches from the faceplate.</li>
            <li> It came folded up. Was unable check size untill I opened pkg. Then to find it to small was unable to return it because it was open.</li>
            <li> Have order these replacements cushion every three months, just as good as the OEMs at a reduced price. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Works great and stays in place. Very comfortable.  Well made product.</li>
            <li> Same as my current one.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT MASK!!  My wife and myself attempted to get it onto the mask for HOURS, Original was designed deliberately much thinner than the Cushions on older masks so that they MUST be replaced every year or so.&lt;br /&gt;The seller refused to refund our $$$ saying that it was no longer sterile. Only when I threatned the Better Buisness Beruo did Amazon itself step in to make this right.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Amazon but NOT Quattro or the seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never but another Quattro product</li>
            <li> This has been the only mask I can use without it leaving sores on the bridge of my nose. 4 stat because I feel its a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This mask worked perfect with my husbands cpap. Fits great and is comfortable to wear. I would definitely purchase one again.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old one, makes it easy to swap and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small cushion for a small frame and it was just a little too large to fit. I struggled with it several times before giving up and sending it back. I don&#x27;t know if this was an aberration or a broader problem but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper than $80 mask and found this, excellent quality good price what more could I ask for</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits very well, and provides a big improvement in mask performance.</li>
            <li> Fit like it was made for it LOL&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Have to have this for medical reasons. They work very well for the cost compaired to purchasing  them thru insurance.</li>
            <li> My old cushion was really bad and this one made my nights better. Ir worked perfectly and this brand is really good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this at such a discounted Price. My boyfriends old cushion was well past the point of needing replaced. I will definitely look in to purchasing more of our CPAP supplies this way!</li>
            <li> I saved a fortune buying this from here.I bought it for my wife&#x27;s machine. It fits perfect. When you go through the company  they make you buy hoses, mask, and everything. Big rip off. I will use this seller for all cpap needs. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> August 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no expert and have only two years of experience and observations. I have been using my BiPAP machine since November 2011. I originally would purchase the full face mask with head gear from Resmed or any of 3 (Googled) CPAP sites costing $185 (ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask - size Medium Ref # 61701).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon I realized that the clear silicon cushion is what really needs to be replaced at regular intervals and is available for 20% less at Amazon.com. To get the correct silicon cushion, you must have the correct part number, in my case 61722 or search phrase:&lt;br /&gt;  ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask silicon cushion Medium&lt;br /&gt;I have found no difference (except price) between the cushions ordered from Amazon.com and the other sites I have previously mentioned. They all seem to have the same life expectancy and function as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard shell of the face mask should be thoroughly cleaned about once a week or when spots begin to appear on the inside. I believe because I now live in a very dry climate, a cushion lasts up to 3 or 4 months. If my cats don&#x27;t get hold of my head gear the full face mask (minus the cushion) lasts well over a year before the elasticity of the head gear wears out. (A short time in the clothes dryer can rejuvenate the elastic!) I will also use mild soap (antibacterial dish soap with no scent) and cool water to clean the cushion and hard shell of the face mask about once a week mostly for sterilization and appearance. Early on I found toothpaste far too abrasive and scared the inside of the mask! Also be aware that certain spices will impart their smell to the equipment. Garlic and Oregano are particularly strong smelling and can be noticed the following night!</li>
            <li> Just like the original one and packaged in sealed ResMed packaging.</li>
            <li> LOved paying less for this. Works great.  Would definately purchase this item again. That&#x27;s about all I have to say.</li>
            <li> very happy will definitely will order again</li>
            <li> I really like this cushion, it is as good if not better than the original cushion that came with the mask.</li>
            <li> Works to replace original equipment. No problem determining which model to order. Does the job to seal the CPAP air pressure on face.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described, fits the mask perfectly and works great to get a good seasl that stays regardless of head position on pillow.</li>
            <li> Ordered as replacement for CPAP machine.  Came on time.  Quality outstanding.  Works beautifully.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works but not quite right.  Not as comfortable.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite right. Not sure about this thing now.</li>
            <li> they fit the housing good have no problem with it still getting leaks.and it is expensive</li>
            <li> Absolutely Wonderful!!!! fits better and stays in place better than any other mask and headgear I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on schedule and was a perfect match to the mask that I had.  It was very clean and comfortable.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews for this product, and it seems as though there are a lot of people buying the wrong size cushion for the type of mask they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quattro FX frame (hard plastic parts) is not standardized.  The frame comes in Small, Medium, and Large and so do the cushions.  The sizing for the frame can be found on the clear plastic where the headgear buckles in to the mask, on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushion sizing is found on the bottom of the cushion next to the RES MED logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, a small cushion is not going to fit properly on a large frame...or vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;Please check the size of your frame before ordering a replacement cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Res Med Quattro FX is a very good mask, and easily one of the more popular full face masks available.</li>
            <li> My insurance only covers CPAP stuff after $500 out of my pocket. the cushion is a recomended replacement every 90 days. Local supply shops only carried the full mask+head gear, for a tune of 150. This might not be the cheepest, but it got here faster than the stuff i ordered from amazon. Came in a authentic resmed packaging, fit rights. great over all value.</li>
            <li> Replaces the original without any problems.</li>
            <li> Not much to say this is a authentic replacement for the quattro and I found it to be the same quality as the one I was given.</li>
            <li> I bought this because someone said in another review that the cushion was not included with the mask I purchased but it was so now I have a extra one .It&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li> Typical ResMed , outstanding !!!</li>
            <li> perfect product, excellent fit for headgear</li>
            <li> was the thing I was looking for and it´s work perfec for the model that I have and in chile is a non usefull product</li>
            <li> No more need to spend $300 locally for a full mask. Just buy these and some new headgear and less than half the price of a new mask. Love it!</li>
            <li> Was an exact replacement and have had zero issues with it. To bad they do not last longer, about 2 months is all I get.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit and the best price that I have found&lt;br /&gt;I wear my machine every night and wouldn&#x27;t sleep without it</li>
            <li> Not much to say about a replacement cushion for a CPAP mask, but I will say that I love my Quattro Fx mask, and getting a new cushion makes it work the way it is supposed to.  I&#x27;ve had this mask for almost four years, and I can&#x27;t imagine another mask working any better for me.  The price for this cushion was excellent - MUCH less than our local supplier charges - and it was shipped very quickly.  04/22/2015:  The cushion I received was an original ResMed replacement cushion for the Quattro Fx medium mask.  It is not a knock-off or generic brand, it is a ResMed product in ResMed packaging, it is exactly the same as the original cushion that came with my mask and the two other replacement cushions I have gone through, and it fits the mask perfectly.  I do recommend washing the cushion every single day in something that cuts through oil, something like dish soap, to help it to last longer.  Oil from skin seems to cause it to break down faster, which results in a poor seal.  I wash mine twice in Dawn liquid every morning until it is squeaky clean.  I can usually get about a year out of a cushion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great.</li>
            <li> These last for a good bit, but since I never clean them, I have to replace them about every 5 months. My insurance only covers a purchase of a new mask every year.</li>
            <li> This is a super comfortable cushion that fits a great mask. Sadly, the mask comes with inferior headgear, but that&#x27;s the fault of Resmed, not any supplier. The only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think this product is too expensive for what it is. I know it has to be sterile, but it&#x27;s a little hunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> These last for about 2-3 months then turn white from your skin oil and they fail. The rubber is VERY thin on the edges, and although this mask works for me better than the old forehead pounding one I had that was also full face I am looking for a better one. If you have ideas please email me over this or put a comment. The company I used however was VERY fast and helpful, but I need some personal more to the point help on what others have experienced.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just as expected</li>
            <li> perfect just what i needed.  Fit my mask perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fits and works fine.  My copay from the local medical supply was more than the total cost from Amazon.</li>
            <li> fit my mask fine and price is okay</li>
            <li> Works perfectly well with the compatible mask, and seems to basically be the same cushion that the mask originally came with.  I used it for about 5 months before the rubber on the bottom began tearing and leaking air, forcing me to buy another replacement.  I&#x27;m sure the price is good compared to other suppliers, I just wish it would last longer before needing to be replaced again.</li>
            <li> Its comfy.  Doesn&#x27;t leak as long as its on right.  Somewhat durable, it didn&#x27;t last long against my puppy. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I can purchase the expendable parts of my cpap mask.  This saves quite a bit of money AND the customer service from the seller was outstanding - above and beyond what I could have expected.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works as expected although the price is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to pay.</li>
            <li> This product is just as I expected. Good fit for my husbands machine. Have ordered before, and will order again!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered and fit my existing mask correctly. So blah blah blah makes up the rest of this review.</li>
            <li> the exact part I needed at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Everything was great except for the Quattro Fx Med Cushion and that was not the fault of the cushion. Just did not fit well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to spice up my alone time! It turns out that it works better on the mask for my CPAP machine. &#x3D;\</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly as it is designed to do.  Be sure to clean your mask and keep your retaining clip.  You can tell when they start to wear out when you can no longer get a good seal.</li>
            <li> This cushion is great, and I think it is the best full faced mask out there, especially if you are tired of the middle forehead dimples from those with forehead supports.  What I did wish this mask would do, which would make it the ultimate mask, is go under the chin.  If this was molded to go under your chin to help hold the mask down and your mouth shut, there would never need to be another design.  I know this review is for the cushion, and not the mask, so this is a great cushion, but if you care about the mask or the manufacturer reads this, it&#x27;s a very good mask that could be great.</li>
            <li> Great fast and the package was also really good !!!!! Will order from them again !!!! My husband has to have this mask in order to get the sleep he need&#x27;s , and I just loved how fast they sent it !!!!</li>
            <li> If you deductible has not been met and or you have to pay out of pocket this is a great solution.  Replace the cushion not the entire mask!</li>
            <li> The item was advertized correctly and was what I needed. The company is not to blame, but the USPS delayed the item for many days after the estimated date of arrival. The USPS sucks and they have used up all the excuses known to women. RESMED is a good source for this item and I will reorder from them due to their really low price.</li>
            <li> If you use a Quattro FX you must have a backup of this cushion because this mask is the best mask in the market.</li>
            <li> I purchase all of my cpap supplies from amazion</li>
            <li> We had to get new supplies for the machine. Shopped a lot and found this. What can I say? Perfection! This was great for everything, right size, right price,fast shipping. We will definitely continue to shop here.</li>
            <li> Good fit, and good price.... I purchased this mask to replace the one provided by my health provider and I am happy that I did so.  Perfect fit for my cpap mask</li>
            <li> Fits great! Good price too!</li>
            <li> Product as list and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad the Amazon carries all this items for peoples needs and that we can make a good choice on our purchase.</li>
            <li> The plastic was not the usual quality and it is leaking terribly.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. This makes replacements much easier</li>
            <li> This was a perfect replacement. The fit was spot on and made my mask have a tight seal once again.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for his CPAP machine.  It does keep coming off the mask during the night.  He is trying to figure out why.  But product is as decribed and he is satisfied.</li>
            <li> This item was a perfect factory replacement cushion in a sealed plastic bag.  It fit the mask perfectly.  It just presses into a groove in the mask.</li>
            <li> Since you have to get a Rx to buy the whole mask, this is a creative way to purchase the parts separately.</li>
            <li> If you have a quattro Fx cpap mask, then this is a good priced replacement cushion!&lt;br /&gt;good buy for the price</li>
            <li> The size was not correct. I couldn&#x27;t used. Unfortunately on the mask I had, the size written  in the mask was different that the one on the ribbon. So the new one you send to me did not fit.</li>
            <li> works well, with the CPAP. especially if you change them regularly.</li>
            <li> Works great and came sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Dear husband uses it nightly with his mask and c-pap equipment.  The sleep clinic chose this mask for him and it has worked out well.  Just wears out rather quickly and needs to replaced often.  I think it may have something to do with facial whiskers breaking it down sooner than one would expect.  I can wear mine twice as long as he can.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and well made.</li>
            <li> One side of cushion was twisted. As a result, it does not always fit snug.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Fx, that was about 16 months old and starting to tear. Since my insurance deductible hadn&#x27;t been met yet for the year, it was actually cheaper for me to buy it here.  If you are a CPAP user and you&#x27;re looking for a comfortable mask, I recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mouth breather and the chin strap I had to use with a nasal mask was very uncomfortable. This is a full-face mask, but it doesn&#x27;t have the extra bracket that goes on your forehead, so it doesn&#x27;t seem quite so &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;.  This also works well with my facial hair - I don&#x27;t notice much (if any) leaking and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to shave just because I&#x27;m a CPAP user.</li>
