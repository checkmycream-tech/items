            <li>Best tongue cleaner</li>
            <li>Excellent item</li>
            <li>I really love this product!!</li>
            <li>It just insures that I have nice smelling breath as well!</li>
            <li>I purchased a tongue scraper from the store that didn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li>so i bought the two pack and at first t is superb</li>
            <li>Nice product, would recommend.</li>
            <li>I consider dental hygine to be very important</li>
            <li>Simply the best tongue cleaner on the market.  </li>
            <li>I get the same great results at a fraction of the cost in 1/3rd the time!</li>
            <li>great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve come to find that most toothbrushes have tongue scrubbers on them already</li>
            <li>The handle in the design, however, makes it a lot more pleasant/intuitive to use...  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more ergonomic, and is way easier to store (stores like a toothbrush).</li>
            <li>These tongue cleaners are stupendous, they work much better than a toothbrush and actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, great product!</li>
            <li>Love the orabrush.</li>
            <li>, I bought more for all the family</li>
            <li>I love how clean my tongue looks and feels!</li>
            <li>It is a practical and cheap solution.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, so I was happy to buy a 2-pack to stock up for future use.  </li>
            <li>Also very useful to get coffee or soda stains on your tongue off.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find the brush to be completely effective with morning breath, in particular</li>
            <li>My mouth feels truly clean after using the orabrush as a part of my oral hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft yet effective.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to see how much gunk I scrape off of my tongue every night.</li>
            <li>] mouthwash to your routine for fresh breath all day.</li>
            <li>Get what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a useful product, as I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fun tool, does make your tongue feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I just got this item and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the multi-pack, Orabrush!</li>
            <li>But this has fine soft bristles that are not irritating to the tongue, yet get the job done.</li>
            <li>Gives mouth a whole different feeling iof clean!</li>
            <li>As for my first use I don&#x27;t really see much of it that would make me</li>
            <li>thanks you too.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve missed so much with my toothbrush, and the Orabrush went in as post-recon and handled it.</li>
            <li>Who would ever thought there was so much goo on a tongue!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks you.</li>
            <li>but if you really want a clean and dry tongue this thing works very well</li>
            <li>and I do think my morning breath is much gentler to live with.  </li>
            <li>Also I was expecting for it&#x27;s bristle to be soft and gentle to scrub my tongue</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without the ora brush.</li>
            <li>Orabrush is better than a toothbrush because it is flat and can go further back on your tongue without gagging.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work like I&#x27;m used to, the bristles are too soft.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>… unfortunately, I think that this needs to be paired also with a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>When my local Big Box store stopped carrying these I turned right to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Okay, these are seriously a miracle....</li>
            <li>My son his, left mine on the counter and threw away the package otherwise I would&#x27;ve returned these in one hot second.  </li>
            <li>I wondered when I saw how different it was from my old brush but thought maybe it was a new model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to see how much murk comes off a simple little tongue, especially after an evening of feasting and debauchery.  </li>
            <li>The little spikes really don&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>used something similar to this as a kid, so this isn&#x27;t a *new* concept.</li>
            <li>Thanks Orabrush for a fast, easy and very affordable solution to chronic bad breath and my wife</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple concept and very practical.</li>
            <li>I found out about these a few years ago thru YouTube, and have been a loyal customer ever since.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the head are soft enough to not damage the tissues of the tongue, but also get the cleaning done.  </li>
            <li>Not much one can say about a tongue scraper, although I really haven&#x27;t tried any others.</li>
            <li>Works even better than a regular tongue scraper without irritating.  </li>
            <li>Although the sipping was bad the orabrush is good</li>

            <li> Have tried many things for chronic bad breath and the specialty mouth washes like profresh and breath appeal systems work great but are very expensive.  </li>

            <li> Be careful not to scrape too hard, it warns against it, and they&#x27;re right.  </li>
            <li> this is either a fake or a really old maybe first gen of this product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the entire tongue, and it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> But cvs and other stores</li>
            <li> No more white residue!!</li>
            <li> but instead to my suprised it is made og hard material that kind of hurt and leaves a bad texture into my tongue.</li>
            <li> Not worth the two seconds</li>
            <li> Since starting to use the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic change in the way my mouth feels and even the color of my tongue.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence that this little guy will keep your breath fresher for longer!</li>
            <li> I never liked the taste of toothpaste, and I felt like brushing my tongue didn&#x27;t really help with bad breath anyway.</li>
            <li> I always suffered from bad breath and had tried anything so far.  </li>
            <li> With this I would be using it at least once a day instead of twice.</li>
            <li> Just because you scrape the bacteria off, doesn&#x27;t mean the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; goes away.</li>
            <li> I noticed my morning breath isn&#x27;t so bad anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cant imagine my life without this product!! Gives mouth a whole different feeling iof clean!</li>
            <li> I purchased a tongue scraper from the store that didn&#x27;t work that good. The Orabrush does the job every time.</li>
            <li> I found out about these a few years ago thru YouTube, and have been a loyal customer ever since.  Simply the best tongue cleaner on the market.  The bristles on the head are soft enough to not damage the tissues of the tongue, but also get the cleaning done.  And the scraper at the back makes removing all that gunk simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace it as often as you replace your toothbrush and you&#x27;re golden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re viewing this product page, then you probably need an Orabrush in your life.  Get it!  And also add [[ASIN:B001ET76AI Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] mouthwash to your routine for fresh breath all day.</li>
            <li> Although the sipping was bad the orabrush is good the orabrush is a cheaper price online you get two. But cvs and other stores it&#x27;s like 12 dollars</li>
            <li> Have tried many things for chronic bad breath and the specialty mouth washes like profresh and breath appeal systems work great but are very expensive.  After using Orabrush and their tongue foam I get the same great results at a fraction of the cost in 1/3rd the time! Best tongue cleaner I have ever used and I have tried them all.  Thanks Orabrush for a fast, easy and very affordable solution to chronic bad breath and my wife thanks you too.</li>
            <li> Works even better than a regular tongue scraper without irritating.  great product at a reasonable price.  Would definitely buy again,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such things come off of my tongue before. I used to just brush my tongue with my toothbrush, but with this thing... I feel like I&#x27;ve missed so much with my toothbrush, and the Orabrush went in as post-recon and handled it. Buy with confidence that this little guy will keep your breath fresher for longer!</li>
            <li> I consider dental hygine to be very important so i bought the two pack and at first t is superb but I&#x27;ve come to find that most toothbrushes have tongue scrubbers on them already so i never used it but if you really want a clean and dry tongue this thing works very well</li>
            <li> I bought the Orabrush for myself and my boyfriend… we were entertained by the marketing, of course. However, I didn&#x27;t find the brush to be completely effective with morning breath, in particular… unfortunately, I think that this needs to be paired also with a good mouthwash. Just because you scrape the bacteria off, doesn&#x27;t mean the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; goes away. Get what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a useful product, as I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I used something similar to this as a kid, so this isn&#x27;t a *new* concept.</li>
            <li> Who would ever thought there was so much goo on a tongue!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Orabrush is better than a toothbrush because it is flat and can go further back on your tongue without gagging.</li>
            <li> Once you start using the Orabrush, you will never go back. I never liked the taste of toothpaste, and I felt like brushing my tongue didn&#x27;t really help with bad breath anyway. Since starting to use the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic change in the way my mouth feels and even the color of my tongue. I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore! Everyone should have an Orabrush!</li>
            <li> Not much one can say about a tongue scraper, although I really haven&#x27;t tried any others. But this has fine soft bristles that are not irritating to the tongue, yet get the job done. Nice product, would recommend. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried this, I don&#x27;t use it anymore. It doesn&#x27;t get the entire tongue, and it&#x27;s pretty much useless. The little spikes really don&#x27;t help much. Use a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Performance-wise, this item works well, though not as well as one of my &#x27;serrated strip&#x27; scrapers I got from my dentist.  The handle in the design, however, makes it a lot more pleasant/intuitive to use...  it&#x27;s more ergonomic, and is way easier to store (stores like a toothbrush).</li>
            <li> These tongue cleaners are stupendous, they work much better than a toothbrush and actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, great product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fun tool, does make your tongue feel cleaner and I do think my morning breath is much gentler to live with.  It&#x27;s cool to see how much murk comes off a simple little tongue, especially after an evening of feasting and debauchery.  Be careful not to scrape too hard, it warns against it, and they&#x27;re right.  but with normal regular use it&#x27;s a nifty little gadget and your mouth thanks you.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have already used an orabrush this is either a fake or a really old maybe first gen of this product.  When my local Big Box store stopped carrying these I turned right to Amazon.  My son his, left mine on the counter and threw away the package otherwise I would&#x27;ve returned these in one hot second.  They don&#x27;t work like I&#x27;m used to, the bristles are too soft.  I wondered when I saw how different it was from my old brush but thought maybe it was a new model.  Not worth the two seconds it took me to do the one click order.  DON&#x27;T BUY THESE!</li>
            <li> I use this every day! I love how clean my tongue looks and feels! No more white residue!! I like to be able to see how much gunk I scrape off of my tongue every night. I noticed my morning breath isn&#x27;t so bad anymore. Also very useful to get coffee or soda stains on your tongue off. I really love this product!!</li>
            <li> I always suffered from bad breath and had tried anything so far.  Orabrush was the only way OUT. I recommend it to everyone who has this problem.  It is a practical and cheap solution.</li>
            <li> I just got this item and tried it right away. As for my first use I don&#x27;t really see much of it that would make me wow. Also I was expecting for it&#x27;s bristle to be soft and gentle to scrub my tongue but instead to my suprised it is made og hard material that kind of hurt and leaves a bad texture into my tongue. With this I would be using it at least once a day instead of twice.</li>
            <li> Love the orabrush. It&#x27;s such a simple concept and very practical. The bristles are very soft yet effective. My mouth feels truly clean after using the orabrush as a part of my oral hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> Okay, these are seriously a miracle.... they cured my husbands halitosis. No lie... after being on medication for acid reflux, and on allergy medication... which neither worked to cure the smell... he tried this... and it WORKED!!! I can&#x27;t live without the ora brush. It just insures that I have nice smelling breath as well!</li>
            <li> This stuff works, so I was happy to buy a 2-pack to stock up for future use.  Thanks for the multi-pack, Orabrush!</li>
            <li> Excellent item, I bought more for all the family</li>
