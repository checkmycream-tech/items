    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>one of the best!  </li>
            <li>Received a sample of Celazome with a sun hat I purchased and was impressed.</li>
            <li>travel size&lt;br /&gt;Compared to sunscreens NOT the best SUN Blocks</li>
            <li>Delighted to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>The best suntan lotion on the market.</li>
            <li>Just awesome!</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen ever!</li>
            <li>very nice product and at a very good price.</li>
            <li>It great for all water sports.</li>
            <li>great product non greasy</li>
            <li>Beautipedia says it&#x27;s  a great ingredient.</li>
            <li>received as promised, great price.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>The protection lasts up to 6-8 hours (not a zinc product but is great for not burning).  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>At night I use Neutrogena Combination Skin lotion and the pair work great together as a day-night combination.</li>
            <li>I love this product as a great mosturizer as well as sunscreen!!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Ive used this sunscreen for 15 years - still love it!</li>
            <li>It has a patented sort of time release thing so that it will keep working all day, and I&#x27;ve put this to the test just by my own behavior--I never used to remember to reapply sunscreen through the day and kept getting burned, now with this stuff I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommend it for me, really nice</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen for its durabilty (1 application lasts all day) &amp; moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I gladly order a bottle of this every year or two &amp; don&#x27;t care about the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s twice the cost of drugstore sunblock but 10X better than those.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the size too.</li>
            <li>However, the researchers need to test it more.</li>
            <li>If you can get a more researched ingredient at a lower safety rating.</li>
            <li>The best part is, it is also a sunscreen product, so one gets the double deal of a moisturizer and sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the sunscreen&#x27;s moisturizing effect until the temp went up</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on top easily.  </li>
            <li>We love it because it goes on  smoothly, is odor-free and doesn&#x27;t cause any stinging or irritation.  </li>
            <li>My skin burns easily before it starts to tan &amp;</li>
            <li>One application for over 9 hrs in and out of the water in Aruba with no sun burn and I burn easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how fast I received this as well.</li>
            <li>case.&lt;br /&gt;Not the most quickly absorbed&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not leave my face feeling greasy or cause my eyes to itch and no break outs.</li>
            <li>However, if it wasn&#x27;t free, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sound farmiliar?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for well over a decade and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for a trip to Miami and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Has alcohol not making it sensory friendly for some.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Homosalate - 5.0 provides mostly UVB  ray protection, not UVA much.</li>
            <li>I use a small-er than dime-sized amount each morning after showering (I have a full beard</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Not\\&quot; is in bold so his \\&quot;Skin Cancer and Skin Aging Alert\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very quick absorbing</li>
            <li>It provides Great moisturizing but not too heavy not oily not shiny.</li>
            <li>By far the most amazing facial cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great for face - these days my facial skin is drier &amp; more delicate, &amp; this lotion gives it a moisturizing boost.</li>
            <li>It should be, if needed, in more sensitive skin sunscreens and sun blocks.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>If Paula&#x27;s completely right.</li>
            <li>is right as well.  </li>
            <li>I brought it with me to reapply to my face because I was panicked about getting burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li>Since then I  have tried many different kinds to find one that would not cause skin break outs.</li>
            <li>sunscreen made me a believer that moisturizing and water resistant is possible in a fairly well absorbed formula that doesn&#x27;t make you as white as a ghost.</li>
            <li>The preservatives are famous last ingredients off course,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its in the bathroom next to many bottles of &#x27;eh&#x27; face products.</li>
            <li>When I first bought my first bottle of Celazome</li>
            <li>I am now on my second bottle and love it.</li>
            <li>In certain product types or quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I can spend all day at the beach without burning, even in the intense Caribbean sun on vacation.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply all over &amp; there&#x27;s no need to reapply (unless you choose to</li>
            <li>The finish is a bit dewy, so if you want a matte look you should blot gently with a tissue or apply some powder.    </li>
            <li>, she charges too much, I buy it off Amzaon.com.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist sells and recommended this product, but it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li>After using it for 18 months I can say that this really works for me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need as much as sum).</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>We are able to use other brands of sunscreen without any problems.</li>
            <li>and it feels like a really high quality moisturizer that I&#x27;d have to pay 50 bucks for.  </li>
            <li>If I have any left over after 2 yrs I tend to discard the remainder &amp; purchase a fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>(This is a sun block feature normally. )  </li>
            <li>I live in Miami and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smoothly and does not fight with your other makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I literally put it on first thing in the morning, went power walking, then to the beach for several hours and swimming in a pool.</li>
            <li>I find it not greasy and easy to use everyday under makeup</li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s back labeling thanks too the Lymphazome technology which is unique.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li>Because of most, if not all of the following ingredients- cetyl alcohol,  aloe ( only if allergic or you have oily skin skip this) or the last two preservatives that are known to have toxic additives possibly, / irritants,  unlisted- off course!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Or the last two main ingredients.)</li>
            <li>Guess we will just have to go back to the normal stuff and keep reapplying every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging this product has been shown only prevent sunburn not skin cancer or early skin aging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put a little more on my nose if I&#x27;m going to be outside for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>claims to not be be broad spectrum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safety at 4 but, has no other info on it.</li>
            <li>I started using it on a daily basis after my morning shower and know that the cream clearly has helped my sundried skin.  </li>
            <li>Not expected.  </li>
            <li>We have normal skin too, not sensitive.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and just takes very little so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen was first recommended to me by my facialist/esthetician a few years ago</li>
            <li>So, in conclusion, due to possible toxins, known irritants, price, not a great brand especially for the most sensitive skin, sneaky labeling/ marketing ( you could have said in the description it wasn&#x27;t for people with Roscia) .</li>

            <li> Use exclusively for my face , which is sensitive to other lotions.</li>
            <li> Why not because I think skin cancer and trying to get rid of wrinkles later is way more expensive!</li>
            <li> I was not out in the sun so long either.  </li>
            <li> Was never one to wear sunscreen much in the past due to skin breakouts from the oils but paid a price for not wearing it with skin cancer.</li>
            <li> So, here are the possibly problematic in active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The drugstore brands (which I&#x27;ve tried most of) either wash off, wear away, smell bad, or otherwise feel like I&#x27;ve film-wrapped my skin...</li>
            <li> I am careful to keep it away from my eyes</li>
            <li> It makes a nice moisturizing base for my makeup also.  </li>
            <li> Took me a while to figure out through process of elimation with my usual skin care routine and thought it was just me, but then applied it to my children and they too ended up in the same rash.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Celazome has no odor, applies like a (thick) lotion but spreads easily enough, moisturizes my skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or tight, protects all day, &amp; a small 4oz bottle lasts all summer or two (depending on how frequently I sunbathe).</li>
            <li> I know the cancer part is true :(.  </li>
            <li> my first few outings in summer sun because of bad sunburns in the past.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started to use this cream, I have NEVER experienced a single breakout, rash or problem after using this cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s unnecessary).     </li>
            <li> (a friend in Palm Springs calls it a DRUG because he&#x27;s so addicted).   </li>
            <li> Expensive like sun block</li>
            <li> /&gt; unfortunately! :(.</li>
            <li> I would break out in an awful, itchy,  rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen for its durabilty (1 application lasts all day) &amp; moisturizing properties. I apply this sunblock once &amp; I can spend all day at the beach without burning, even in the intense Caribbean sun on vacation.    I gladly order a bottle of this every year or two &amp; don&#x27;t care about the price. It&#x27;s twice the cost of drugstore sunblock but 10X better than those. The drugstore brands (which I&#x27;ve tried most of) either wash off, wear away, smell bad, or otherwise feel like I&#x27;ve film-wrapped my skin...it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling.    Celazome has no odor, applies like a (thick) lotion but spreads easily enough, moisturizes my skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or tight, protects all day, &amp; a small 4oz bottle lasts all summer or two (depending on how frequently I sunbathe). If I have any left over after 2 yrs I tend to discard the remainder &amp; purchase a fresh bottle. It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply all over &amp; there&#x27;s no need to reapply (unless you choose to but it&#x27;s unnecessary).     It&#x27;s especially great for face - these days my facial skin is drier &amp; more delicate, &amp; this lotion gives it a moisturizing boost. When I used to have oily greasy skin, this lotion also didn&#x27;t break out my face (I used to suffer with acne, so this was a worry for me). The finish is a bit dewy, so if you want a matte look you should blot gently with a tissue or apply some powder.    My skin burns easily before it starts to tan &amp; I&#x27;m always nervous my first few outings in summer sun because of bad sunburns in the past. But with Celazome I found that I never have to worry about burning, because I know it won&#x27;t happen. And I depend on this stuff after I get facial peels - reliable sunscreen is a definite must!    Love this stuff! It used to be called Lyphazome, now called Celazome, but whatever name it goes by it&#x27;s an A+ product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to Miami and was not disappointed. I literally put it on first thing in the morning, went power walking, then to the beach for several hours and swimming in a pool. This sunscreen stayed on the entire time. I brought it with me to reapply to my face because I was panicked about getting burnt to a crisp. I didn&#x27;t need to at all. I ordered 2 because I don&#x27;t want to be without it. On the weekends, I do bicycle rides that last all day and need a sunscreen that I can apply once and not have to worry about it. This is it! I&#x27;m very pleased with how fast I received this as well.</li>
            <li> It great for all water sports. One application for over 9 hrs in and out of the water in Aruba with no sun burn and I burn easy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen.  Product goes on smoothly and does not fight with your other makeup.  Is not greasy and stays on.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was first recommended to me by my facialist/esthetician a few years ago and I&#x27;m a huge fan!  I&#x27;ve shared it with several friends and we&#x27;re all in agreement --  one of the best!  (a friend in Palm Springs calls it a DRUG because he&#x27;s so addicted).   We love it because it goes on  smoothly, is odor-free and doesn&#x27;t cause any stinging or irritation.  And it works!   Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great product non greasy</li>
            <li> I love this product as a great mosturizer as well as sunscreen!!  My makeup goes on top easily.  I would never leave the house without this!!</li>
            <li> My mother asked me to order it for her since she had tried it via gift.  She uses it daily as a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> Recently had to have surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma on my chin.  Was never one to wear sunscreen much in the past due to skin breakouts from the oils but paid a price for not wearing it with skin cancer. Since then I  have tried many different kinds to find one that would not cause skin break outs. Received a sample of Celazome with a sun hat I purchased and was impressed. Goes on smooth and does not leave my face feeling greasy or cause my eyes to itch and no break outs. Wear it every day.</li>
            <li> The cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claims to not be be broad spectrum. It ingrediants list says otherwise.  Under the warnings section however, the FDA requires it to say,  the following. Atleast I know the cancer part is true :(.  Skin Cancer/ Skin Aging Alert spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging this product has been shown only prevent sunburn not skin cancer or early skin aging. \\&quot;Not\\&quot; is in bold so his \\&quot;Skin Cancer and Skin Aging Alert\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Expensive like sun block ( Although FDA now requires it to be called  Sunblock) but, wears like sunscreen except in 1 area see it in the pro section&lt;br /&gt;Has possible carcinogens that are preservatives&lt;br /&gt;Has alcohol not making it sensory friendly for some.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has no ingredient labeling.  Just it&#x27;s case.&lt;br /&gt;Not the most quickly absorbed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;AND water resistant&lt;br /&gt;Lasts ALL DAY (This is a sun block feature normally. )  unless your under water for over 80 minutes in it.  Despite it&#x27;s back labeling thanks too the Lymphazome technology which is unique.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome travel size&lt;br /&gt;Compared to sunscreens NOT the best SUN Blocks, it&#x27;s very quick absorbing This is a sun block feature normally.&lt;br /&gt;No white look after applying! This is a sun block feature normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen made me a believer that moisturizing and water resistant is possible in a fairly well absorbed formula that doesn&#x27;t make you as white as a ghost. I love the size too. However, if it wasn&#x27;t free, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Here are the ingrediants-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active  Ingrediants-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;benzophenone 3.5% otherwise known as (very similar too oxybenzone, in the same family) but, it&#x27;s safer .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethyl heck methoxycinnamate 7.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethlhexl Salicylate 5.  The EWG rates this as a 3 in safety and this can be an irritant and has fragrance along with it&#x27;s UV absorption features. This ing. also is not allowed/ restricted in Japan and canada. In certain product types or quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate - 5.0 provides mostly UVB  ray protection, not UVA much. Ewg rates it&#x27;s safety at 4 but, has no other info on it. Beautipedia says it&#x27;s  a great ingredient. It&#x27;s allowed only in amounts under . 15% concentration.  My take is this. If Paula&#x27;s completely right. It should be, if needed, in more sensitive skin sunscreens and sun blocks. However, the researchers need to test it more. If you can get a more researched ingredient at a lower safety rating. That be wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to define all the ingredients for you. However, I&#x27;m a sensory solutions expert. So, here are the possibly problematic in active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol ( third ingrediant, if you have roscia defiantly skip this product. If u have A Processing Sensory Disorder&#x3D; PSD you May want to skip this product because of this ing. Or the last two main ingredients.) why? Because of most, if not all of the following ingredients- cetyl alcohol,  aloe ( only if allergic or you have oily skin skip this) or the last two preservatives that are known to have toxic additives possibly, / irritants,  unlisted- off course! The preservatives are famous last ingredients off course,&lt;br /&gt; unfortunately! :(. Propylparaben  and metylparaben. Sound farmiliar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, in conclusion, due to possible toxins, known irritants, price, not a great brand especially for the most sensitive skin, sneaky labeling/ marketing ( you could have said in the description it wasn&#x27;t for people with Roscia) . I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for well over a decade and really enjoy it.  The Celazome is the only product needed on face and arms.  Not greasy or drying.  Allows skin to breathe while protecting and moisturizing.  Delighted to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> received as promised, great price.</li>
            <li> Ive used this sunscreen for 15 years - still love it!</li>
            <li> I am a regular beach-goer, spending a lot of time in the sun. I discovered Celazome Moisturizing Sunscreen/cream after my wife and I had gift facials and the woman who gave me my facial recommended it.  I started using it on a daily basis after my morning shower and know that the cream clearly has helped my sundried skin.  The best part is, it is also a sunscreen product, so one gets the double deal of a moisturizer and sunscreen protection. Great product. I don&#x27;t buy it anymore from the woman, she charges too much, I buy it off Amzaon.com.</li>
            <li> I know its a sun blocker.  But it helped give me an even tan on my face.  Not expected.  I did not burn.  I was not out in the sun so long either.  Its in the bathroom next to many bottles of &#x27;eh&#x27; face products.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Use exclusively for my face , which is sensitive to other lotions. I&#x27;ve used this for years and recommended to family/friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now recommended from my Dermatologist.  I find it not greasy and easy to use everyday under makeup will buy again  when I run out</li>
            <li> Celazome is the only sunblock I&#x27;ve used on my face for years.  I have very sensitive skin and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that didn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  It makes a nice moisturizing base for my makeup also.  A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Everytime I applied this to my skin I would break out in an awful, itchy,  rash. Took me a while to figure out through process of elimation with my usual skin care routine and thought it was just me, but then applied it to my children and they too ended up in the same rash. We have normal skin too, not sensitive. We are able to use other brands of sunscreen without any problems. Was looking so forward to an all day, one application sunscreen. Guess we will just have to go back to the normal stuff and keep reapplying every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and just takes very little so the bottle lasts a long time.  The protection lasts up to 6-8 hours (not a zinc product but is great for not burning).  My dermatologist sells and recommended this product, but it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over 15+yrs and it works great.</li>
            <li> When I first bought my first bottle of Celazome I was a bit skeptical, but after using it I found that my skin was much more moisturized.  I use it every morning after my cleansing routine and it does not leave my skin oily.  Just a little goes a long way!  I initially bought it because I wanted something that moisturized my face and had sunscreen.  I am now on my second bottle and love it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by skin doctor, goes on without the zinc look. Also moisturizing in windy conditions.</li>
            <li> The best suntan lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price is right as well.  I received a sample in an order I had placed and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> It provides Great moisturizing but not too heavy not oily not shiny. I live in Miami and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it works both as a moisturizer and as a sunscreen.  Wish it came in travel-sized containers for flights so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep decanting it.</li>
            <li> After a year of my girlfriend encouraging me to try this product I finally did. I was worried that it would exacerbate a problem I have with oily/combination skin and acne. After using it for 18 months I can say that this really works for me. I use a small-er than dime-sized amount each morning after showering (I have a full beard so I don&#x27;t need as much as sum). I am careful to keep it away from my eyes and I try to keep my hands away from my eyes as the product will sting if it get rubbed into them. I&#x27;ll put a little more on my nose if I&#x27;m going to be outside for a long period of time. At night I use Neutrogena Combination Skin lotion and the pair work great together as a day-night combination.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money. It has a patented sort of time release thing so that it will keep working all day, and I&#x27;ve put this to the test just by my own behavior--I never used to remember to reapply sunscreen through the day and kept getting burned, now with this stuff I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. Plus I can use it on my face and I don&#x27;t break out (everthing makes me break out!) and it feels like a really high quality moisturizer that I&#x27;d have to pay 50 bucks for.  I even use it in wintertime to protect any exposed skin.  Why not because I think skin cancer and trying to get rid of wrinkles later is way more expensive!</li>
            <li> very nice product and at a very good price. My dermatologist recommend it for me, really nice and you don´t feel your face oily</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the sunscreen&#x27;s moisturizing effect until the temp went up and I began to perspire.  It blinded me when it ran into my eyes and I couldn&#x27;t blink it away.  I had to call for someone to pick me up because I couldn&#x27;t see to run home.</li>
            <li> By far the most amazing facial cream I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy and lasts all day. I have extremely sensitive skin and this was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Ever since I started to use this cream, I have NEVER experienced a single breakout, rash or problem after using this cream. Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just awesome! The best sunscreen ever!</li>
