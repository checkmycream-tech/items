            <li>I needed a hairdryer with a diffuser for traveling and thought this looked ideal.</li>
            <li>And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li>Good buy!</li>
            <li>Has worked perfectly in the US an all over Europe; easy to change the voltage and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>How great can a hair dryer be?  </li>
            <li>So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  </li>
            <li>It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage</li>
            <li>This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues.</li>
            <li>hairdryer works great on 220 V in Europe-</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great because it has the ceramic technology</li>
            <li>is a great product for me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Great dryer and worked here and overseas without add-ons.</li>
            <li>It worked great for about 8 months both on 110 and 220v.</li>
            <li>The diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot/cold air options.</li>
            <li>Also the dual voltage is great.</li>
            <li>Works very nice on both voltages</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time.</li>
            <li>Just what we wanted/needed at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I knew it didn&#x27;t have all of those settings when I bought it.</li>
            <li>Folds up perfectly, good heat and power.</li>
            <li>Also good for use at home.</li>
            <li>In fact, it probably makes a good every day hair dryer too.</li>
            <li>Great value and easy to use!</li>
            <li>This product is way better than the hotel driers, and having curly hair, the fact that a travel size diffuser was included was a great benefit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and it was handy to take on my cruise.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size for travel</li>
            <li>The store send the item just in time, and the equipment looks and works nicely.</li>
            <li>The dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It folds up completely and is the best travel dryer ever.  </li>
            <li>Located on the handle is a dual voltage selector to easily switch from 125V to 250V using a credit card!  </li>
            <li>until it burned out, it worked great, but be aware that there might be some issues with the selector.</li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good.</li>
            <li>I like everything about the product- sufficient heat for getting the curl out of my hair, good cool shot, dual voltage for international travel, excellent attachments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I took this drier with me on a recent trip to India and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to get a haircut. :)</li>
            <li>Size is slightly bigger than I had hoped, but I bought it because it was the best looking diffuser to come w. a travel dryer that I could find.  </li>
            <li>Does not produce static.</li>
            <li>This travel hairdryer is surprisingly lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li>so it should help keep her hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than the one I have.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had 6 settings through low/med/high and cool/warm/hot; that would make it better.</li>
            <li>Then I would love it.</li>
            <li>I had tons of power and dual voltage allowed me to take it on my many business trips.</li>
            <li>Love the travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It had everything that she wanted and more.</li>
            <li>My work&#x27;s locker room has the full sized dryer and I really liked it</li>
            <li>So far so great.  </li>
            <li>The handle folds up easily.</li>
            <li>It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack</li>
            <li>I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  </li>
            <li>If you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine.</li>
            <li>Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  </li>
            <li>Aside from its worldwide operability which is the primary reason for purchasing this product in the first place, I found the product to be a sound and effective hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Best little Travel Dryer ever.  </li>
            <li>This thing is huge for travel size.</li>
            <li>It worked great, just turn the dial on the back of the handle to 210 volts.  </li>
            <li>(so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing.</li>
            <li>it has both &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting available.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent all round dryer,  My one comment would be, this is a travel hairdryer and there is no case,</li>
            <li>Great travel hairdryer, the only thing is the place that it folds isn&#x27;t as sturdy as one that doesn&#x27;t which isn&#x27;t a problem if this is your travel dryer.</li>
            <li>I rarely use my straightener any more.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is just the right size, has plenty of power and the diffuser is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Super happy with it and definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy.</li>
            <li>travelling, it&#x27;s the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!</li>
            <li>Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!</li>
            <li>I would have liked this to be a little lighter, but it has a good amount of power for a travel dryer</li>
            <li>Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design.</li>
            <li>and I think it was a good investment for a travel dryer only-</li>
            <li>This one saves me so much time and my hair turns out looking healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Our second one.&lt;br /&gt;The first one began to cut out occasionally due to something in the cord, but we liked it enough to get another.&lt;br /&gt;Folds nicely for traveling and it puts out a good blow with good heat.</li>
            <li>I had the larger version of this hairdryer and it was a great dryer just too bulky and large.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer&#x27;s built in voltage selection worked wonderfully with just a simple plug adapter and the folding handle made it extremely simple to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  </li>
            <li>I owned this blow dryer before (exact model) and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fit the bill exactly for overseas travel.  </li>
            <li>It folds down and is great for travel.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular travel blower because I already own a regular sized \\&quot;Pro Beauty\\&quot; Hair Dryer that I love.  </li>
            <li>Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly, and has my short hair dry in no time.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of hair dryers from inexpensive to professional.  </li>
            <li>It worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li>Very Powerful, very compact.</li>
            <li>Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li>The air flow is so strong that it doesn&#x27;t really diffuse very well</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair, which while not being color treated,</li>
            <li>Dries my short, fine hair faster than the full size dryer I had been using.  </li>
            <li>The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>I switched the voltage to the higher setting.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it went up in smoke.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they made them in more colors.</li>
            <li>I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason.</li>
            <li>used it when I got to my first night in Ukraine.</li>
            <li>I find this to be an excellent product and am on my 3rd dryer over the last several years.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Got this yesterday and used it first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>but I like for my products to last more than a year.</li>
            <li>I loved this blower dryer until it burned out after owning for LESS THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li>Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; at either voltage setting.  </li>
            <li>The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won&#x27;t do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require).</li>
            <li>And it does the job of much more expensive units at a good price.</li>
            <li>Has strong air flow and gets hot enough.</li>
            <li>Not only did I use it but 4 other women used it and it did great.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite blow dryer because it had enough power to really straighten out my hair and make it really shiny.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer folds up small and was surprisingly good at drying my hair.</li>
            <li>If you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you.</li>
            <li>They are a nice little hair dryer when they work</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East.</li>
            <li>Very unreliable.</li>
            <li>Took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long&lt;br /&gt;blond</li>
            <li>much space.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed.</li>
            <li>The handle heats up so much that you can scorch your hand.</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to lend me one to use for free, but don&#x27;t waste money on this thing.</li>
            <li>The diffuser option works very well when leaving hair curly.</li>
            <li>Not only is it light weight &amp; compact, it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as my regular sized one!  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot for work and my normal hair dryer just takes up too much space in my carry-on luggage</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering buying your first travel sized blower, not happy with the one you currently own, or need to replace an older one; this is the one!  </li>
            <li>Also, the diffuser is high quality with</li>
            <li>Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  </li>
            <li>Pay a little more money and try something else.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and does not leave it flat.</li>
            <li>I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>And it is so small and easy to pack!</li>
            <li>Size was fine, wish it was a bit smaller, but it looks to be one of the smaller, realistically priced, travel hair dryers on  the market.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, this dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I live in the US</li>
            <li>Very light to hold, folds up small to store and travel with.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire.</li>
            <li>Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady.</li>
            <li>It folds in half for traveling, is lightweight and my hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon</li>
            <li>Fabulous little blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping &amp; handling fee.</li>
            <li>I waited a pretty long time to get this hair dryer</li>
            <li>My concern is the loud &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when folding the handle.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great and fits perfectly in my narrow drawer, along with my large round brush.</li>
            <li>It dried it as quickly and well (including styling with the nozzle) as my normal hair dryer does.</li>
            <li>And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.</li>
            <li>but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Barely adds any weight to your luggage</li>
            <li>Apparently, this is just a defect in the travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Revlon 1875 watt (finally through out my 12 year old one) which does have that cooler setting for daily use and reserve this one for travel only.</li>
            <li>both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages.</li>
            <li>While this drier cuts down my drying time, I think by nature of it not having a low heat setting for cooler continuous heating, I&#x27;ve found my hair much frizzier and drier after 1.5 months use (even with a haircut occurring about midway between).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I took this drier with me on a recent trip to India and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to get a haircut. :)</li>
            <li> Size is slightly bigger than I had hoped, but I bought it because it was the best looking diffuser to come w. a travel dryer that I could find.  </li>
            <li> Does not produce static.</li>
            <li> This travel hairdryer is surprisingly lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> so it should help keep her hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I like it more than the one I have.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had 6 settings through low/med/high and cool/warm/hot; that would make it better.</li>
            <li> Then I would love it.</li>
            <li> I had tons of power and dual voltage allowed me to take it on my many business trips.</li>
            <li> Love the travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It had everything that she wanted and more.</li>
            <li> My work&#x27;s locker room has the full sized dryer and I really liked it</li>
            <li> So far so great.  </li>
            <li> The handle folds up easily.</li>
            <li> It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack</li>
            <li> I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  </li>
            <li> If you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine.</li>
            <li> Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  </li>
            <li> Aside from its worldwide operability which is the primary reason for purchasing this product in the first place, I found the product to be a sound and effective hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Best little Travel Dryer ever.  </li>
            <li> This thing is huge for travel size.</li>
            <li> It worked great, just turn the dial on the back of the handle to 210 volts.  </li>
            <li> (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing.</li>
            <li> it has both &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting available.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent all round dryer,  My one comment would be, this is a travel hairdryer and there is no case,</li>
            <li> Great travel hairdryer, the only thing is the place that it folds isn&#x27;t as sturdy as one that doesn&#x27;t which isn&#x27;t a problem if this is your travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I rarely use my straightener any more.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is just the right size, has plenty of power and the diffuser is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Super happy with it and definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy.</li>
            <li> travelling, it&#x27;s the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!</li>
            <li> Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!</li>
            <li> I would have liked this to be a little lighter, but it has a good amount of power for a travel dryer</li>
            <li> Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design.</li>
            <li> and I think it was a good investment for a travel dryer only-</li>
            <li> This one saves me so much time and my hair turns out looking healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Our second one.&lt;br /&gt;The first one began to cut out occasionally due to something in the cord, but we liked it enough to get another.&lt;br /&gt;Folds nicely for traveling and it puts out a good blow with good heat.</li>
            <li> I had the larger version of this hairdryer and it was a great dryer just too bulky and large.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer&#x27;s built in voltage selection worked wonderfully with just a simple plug adapter and the folding handle made it extremely simple to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  </li>
            <li> I owned this blow dryer before (exact model) and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fit the bill exactly for overseas travel.  </li>
            <li> It folds down and is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular travel blower because I already own a regular sized \\&quot;Pro Beauty\\&quot; Hair Dryer that I love.  </li>
            <li> Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, and has my short hair dry in no time.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of hair dryers from inexpensive to professional.  </li>
            <li> It worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li> Very Powerful, very compact.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> Price was right</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li> The air flow is so strong that it doesn&#x27;t really diffuse very well</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair, which while not being color treated,</li>
            <li> Dries my short, fine hair faster than the full size dryer I had been using.  </li>
            <li> The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> I switched the voltage to the higher setting.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it went up in smoke.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they made them in more colors.</li>
            <li> I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason.</li>
            <li> used it when I got to my first night in Ukraine.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an excellent product and am on my 3rd dryer over the last several years.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and used it first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> but I like for my products to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I loved this blower dryer until it burned out after owning for LESS THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li> Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; at either voltage setting.  </li>
            <li> The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won&#x27;t do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require).</li>
            <li> And it does the job of much more expensive units at a good price.</li>
            <li> Has strong air flow and gets hot enough.</li>
            <li> Not only did I use it but 4 other women used it and it did great.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite blow dryer because it had enough power to really straighten out my hair and make it really shiny.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer folds up small and was surprisingly good at drying my hair.</li>
            <li> If you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you.</li>
            <li> They are a nice little hair dryer when they work</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East.</li>
            <li> Very unreliable.</li>
            <li> Took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long&lt;br /&gt;blond</li>
            <li> much space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed.</li>
            <li> The handle heats up so much that you can scorch your hand.</li>
            <li> They were nice enough to lend me one to use for free, but don&#x27;t waste money on this thing.</li>
            <li> The diffuser option works very well when leaving hair curly.</li>
            <li> Not only is it light weight &amp; compact, it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as my regular sized one!  </li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work and my normal hair dryer just takes up too much space in my carry-on luggage</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering buying your first travel sized blower, not happy with the one you currently own, or need to replace an older one; this is the one!  </li>
            <li> Also, the diffuser is high quality with</li>
            <li> Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  </li>
            <li> Pay a little more money and try something else.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and does not leave it flat.</li>
            <li> I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> And it is so small and easy to pack!</li>
            <li> Size was fine, wish it was a bit smaller, but it looks to be one of the smaller, realistically priced, travel hair dryers on  the market.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, this dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I live in the US</li>
            <li> Very light to hold, folds up small to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire.</li>
            <li> Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady.</li>
            <li> It folds in half for traveling, is lightweight and my hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon</li>
            <li> Fabulous little blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping &amp; handling fee.</li>
            <li> I waited a pretty long time to get this hair dryer</li>
            <li> My concern is the loud &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when folding the handle.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great and fits perfectly in my narrow drawer, along with my large round brush.</li>
            <li> It dried it as quickly and well (including styling with the nozzle) as my normal hair dryer does.</li>
            <li> And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.</li>
            <li> but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Barely adds any weight to your luggage</li>
            <li> Apparently, this is just a defect in the travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Revlon 1875 watt (finally through out my 12 year old one) which does have that cooler setting for daily use and reserve this one for travel only.</li>
            <li> both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages.</li>
            <li> While this drier cuts down my drying time, I think by nature of it not having a low heat setting for cooler continuous heating, I&#x27;ve found my hair much frizzier and drier after 1.5 months use (even with a haircut occurring about midway between).  </li>
            <li> It was unclear exactly what caused the motor to burn out like that, but my guess would be that the voltage selection was done by turning a small plastic screw like selector on the bottom of the dryer and that potentially, the screw deformed and did not completely switch from 110V to 220V.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it in the States and there have been no problems.. except my long hair occasionally sucked into the back, which KILLS... and is a problem I&#x27;ve never encountered before with driers.</li>
            <li> The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected, but as the other comments say, it DOES dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> : in my experience they don&#x27;t last that long, so this time I bought 2.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I&#x27;ve been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one, not because the previous two were faulty, but because I lost one and the other finally wore out.</li>
            <li> I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry.</li>
            <li> Air velocity and the temps were exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> the money spent.  </li>
            <li> It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50</li>
            <li> It was too big, too heavy, and too noisy.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  </li>
            <li> Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it&#x27;s now September).</li>
            <li> I need the room in my luggage for other items.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about my hair dryers and usually don&#x27;t like ionic because they leave my hair flat.</li>
            <li> And that is my only complaint</li>
            <li> still seems to dry out and frizz with very little coaxing.</li>
            <li> It does fold down, which is something I was looking for, but it seems to fold down while I am using it.for the price, size, and dis functionality</li>
            <li> It folds down to take up less place.</li>
            <li> , all previous ones have come with one.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 8 months</li>
            <li> and it was not silver and black.  </li>
            <li> I have long medium thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s started making a weird buzzing sound after about 8 months and smells like burning.</li>
            <li> Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  </li>
            <li> In order to reduce the weight something had to be left behind and I chose to forgo the dryer.</li>
            <li> I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is shoddy workmanship and not worth</li>
            <li> We bought this for a trip internationally in order to avoid having to purchase and carry around an expensive and heavy voltage converter.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the US (you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on) because it&#x27;s awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand.</li>
            <li> While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.  </li>
            <li> Each one has lasted less than a year before they just burned up and stopped working randomly.</li>
            <li> Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how big it turned out to be.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately that is not an option.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after looking at it and feeling it&#x27;s weight I decided to return it.  </li>
            <li> Too dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to try again</li>
            <li> I received one where the straightening cone (aka concentrator) spun around on the dryer, making it impossible to blow out your hair.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, halfway through our trip, the motor burned out, rendering the hair dryer useless and filling our hotel room with a horrible burnt smell.</li>
            <li> All you need is a $3.00 plug adapter (sold here on Amazon: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I turned it off, vacuumed the lint that wasn&#x27;t very bad.  </li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this daily for 2 weeks in Shanghai and China.  It worked great, just turn the dial on the back of the handle to 210 volts.  Air velocity and the temps were exactly as expected.  Size was fine, wish it was a bit smaller, but it looks to be one of the smaller, realistically priced, travel hair dryers on  the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I was disappointed in how big it turned out to be.  I was hoping it would be closer to a travel size.  The diffuser is too big for me....but I decided to keep it regardless.</li>
            <li> I had the larger version of this hairdryer and it was a great dryer just too bulky and large.  This version is perfect.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  Great product, excellent delivery.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight as promised.  The handle folds up easily.</li>
            <li> How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren&#x27;t they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I&#x27;ve been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &amp;#34;dual voltage&amp;#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you&#x27;re looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won&#x27;t do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It&#x27;s great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Just what we wanted/needed at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our trip to Europe this year.  It worked like a charm and insured that I was not going to blow up another hair dryer on our annual international sojourn.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to a friend. I love it!</li>
            <li> This item died after maybe the 10th time i used it. Good thing it is inexpensive. Save your money and dont buy this, keep looking.</li>
            <li> It folds in half for traveling, is lightweight and my hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues. The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment. After that it just stopped blowing unless the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button was pressed. Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady. Very unreliable.</li>
            <li> I took this drier with me on a recent trip to India and it worked great! It&#x27;s powerful and dries hair fast. I&#x27;ve also been using it in the States and there have been no problems.. except my long hair occasionally sucked into the back, which KILLS... and is a problem I&#x27;ve never encountered before with driers. Am I the only one having this prob? Maybe I just need to get a haircut. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this drier is perfect for traveling or using at home.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! Very light to hold, folds up small to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer works great on 220 V in Europe- it has both &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting available.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal! I looked everywhere for a dryer that included a diffuser, and ta-da! I recommend this dryer</li>
            <li> I needed a hairdryer with a diffuser for traveling and thought this looked ideal. I took it on my recent trip to China. I switched the voltage to the higher setting. The first time I used it, it went up in smoke.  I dumped it.  No point carrying a burnt-out dryer with me for two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is way better than the hotel driers, and having curly hair, the fact that a travel size diffuser was included was a great benefit. However, I don&#x27;t think it works for my hair for daily use. I have fine, naturally curly hair, which while not being color treated, still seems to dry out and frizz with very little coaxing. While this drier cuts down my drying time, I think by nature of it not having a low heat setting for cooler continuous heating, I&#x27;ve found my hair much frizzier and drier after 1.5 months use (even with a haircut occurring about midway between).  I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Revlon 1875 watt (finally through out my 12 year old one) which does have that cooler setting for daily use and reserve this one for travel only.</li>
            <li> Used once on vacation so I can not comment on the longevity of this product. Size is slightly bigger than I had hoped, but I bought it because it was the best looking diffuser to come w. a travel dryer that I could find.  Price was right and I think it was a good investment for a travel dryer only- I would not use this for regular at home use.</li>
            <li> Best little Travel Dryer ever.  Very Powerful, very compact. Lasts forever. Does not produce static. I&#x27;m on my 3rd one, not because the previous two were faulty, but because I lost one and the other finally wore out. I only wish they made them in more colors. Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a trip internationally in order to avoid having to purchase and carry around an expensive and heavy voltage converter. The hair dryer&#x27;s built in voltage selection worked wonderfully with just a simple plug adapter and the folding handle made it extremely simple to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, halfway through our trip, the motor burned out, rendering the hair dryer useless and filling our hotel room with a horrible burnt smell. It was unclear exactly what caused the motor to burn out like that, but my guess would be that the voltage selection was done by turning a small plastic screw like selector on the bottom of the dryer and that potentially, the screw deformed and did not completely switch from 110V to 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until it burned out, it worked great, but be aware that there might be some issues with the selector.</li>
            <li> Has worked perfectly in the US an all over Europe; easy to change the voltage and works perfectly. Great value and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This travel hairdryer is surprisingly lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent all round dryer,  My one comment would be, this is a travel hairdryer and there is no case, why?, all previous ones have come with one.</li>
            <li> Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design. This is a great product. I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason. Amazon replaced it right away. Excellent service!</li>
            <li> While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.  In my opinion, this is shoddy workmanship and not worth the money spent.  So, I would recommend finding another hair dryer to purchase rather than this model.</li>
            <li> Took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long&lt;br /&gt;blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking&lt;br /&gt;too much space.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular travel blower because I already own a regular sized \\&quot;Pro Beauty\\&quot; Hair Dryer that I love.  Well, let me tell you.... the travel size did not disappoint!  Not only is it light weight &amp; compact, it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as my regular sized one!  Located on the handle is a dual voltage selector to easily switch from 125V to 250V using a credit card!  All you need is a $3.00 plug adapter (sold here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B000YN01X4 eForCity COTHPLUGUN01 Universal Charger Adapter]]  If you&#x27;re considering buying your first travel sized blower, not happy with the one you currently own, or need to replace an older one; this is the one!  I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom as a Christmas Gift and she loves it.  It&#x27;s lightweight and compact when folded up for storage.  It&#x27;s also great because it has the ceramic technology so it should help keep her hair healthy.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor. It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for me, I don&#x27;t like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the US (you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on) because it&#x27;s awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand. Also, the diffuser is high quality with twelve prongs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly tiny in size once it&#x27;s open, but is slightly smaller than my regular blower, and it&#x27;s great the handle folds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When travelling, it&#x27;s the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!</li>
            <li> I take this hair dryer to the gym with me in my gym bag.  It fits perfectly, and has my short hair dry in no time.  It also gives my hair some volume (I use the diffuser).  It&#x27;s sturdy, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside. I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there&#x27;s no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else.</li>
            <li> So far so great.  It dries my hair in a jiffy. I like the looks of it too, and the accessories. It is a 1875 watt hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I loved this blower dryer until it burned out after owning for LESS THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li> used it when I got to my first night in Ukraine. Sparked and smoked out, couldn&#x27;t even use it. Left it in the trash at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;WORST TRAVEL DRYER EVER. I wish I had kept it so I would get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whomever made this product should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a fraud of a product</li>
            <li> I like it more than the one I have.  I wish it had 6 settings through low/med/high and cool/warm/hot; that would make it better. Then I would love it. To be fair, I knew it didn&#x27;t have all of those settings when I bought it. I have not gone to Europe with it yet, I&#x27;ll see if the electricity conversion truly works then.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer because I use the diffuser and there diffuser was much smaller than the one I use at home. This diffuser worked well for me and it was handy to take on my cruise. You can also change the voltage. Great travel hairdryer, the only thing is the place that it folds isn&#x27;t as sturdy as one that doesn&#x27;t which isn&#x27;t a problem if this is your travel dryer.</li>
            <li> it only lasted about 6 months and then burnt out.</li>
            <li> The dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with.  This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  Suddenly smoke came out.  I turned it off, vacuumed the lint that wasn&#x27;t very bad.  Flipped the red safety switch.  Nothing worked.  I&#x27;m really bummed.</li>
            <li> Quality above all!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great dryer and worked here and overseas without add-ons.</li>
            <li> I took this dryer to Ireland and it worked out perfectly.  It folds up completely and is the best travel dryer ever.  Lots of power.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an excellent product and am on my 3rd dryer over the last several years. And that is my only complaint: in my experience they don&#x27;t last that long, so this time I bought 2. I like everything about the product- sufficient heat for getting the curl out of my hair, good cool shot, dual voltage for international travel, excellent attachments. And it does the job of much more expensive units at a good price.</li>
            <li> My work&#x27;s locker room has the full sized dryer and I really liked it so I bought the travel version to take on a work trip.  I received one where the straightening cone (aka concentrator) spun around on the dryer, making it impossible to blow out your hair.  I returned it and got another one with the same issue.  Apparently, this is just a defect in the travel dryer.  It is a nice size for travel but I would give up the extra space in my bag for a dryer that worked for what I wanted.  If you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about 8 months both on 110 and 220v. Unfortunately it&#x27;s started making a weird buzzing sound after about 8 months and smells like burning. Dang.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of hair dryers from inexpensive to professional.  I have long medium thick hair.  This one saves me so much time and my hair turns out looking healthy and shiny.  I rarely use my straightener any more.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 8 months</li>
            <li> Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it&#x27;s now September). Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping &amp; handling fee. And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.</li>
            <li> The store send the item just in time, and the equipment looks and works nicely. It worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li> Our second one.&lt;br /&gt;The first one began to cut out occasionally due to something in the cord, but we liked it enough to get another.&lt;br /&gt;Folds nicely for traveling and it puts out a good blow with good heat.</li>
            <li> I waited a pretty long time to get this hair dryer and it was not silver and black.  Now I have to wait again to return the item and get one that fits the description.</li>
            <li> Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50+!!</li>
            <li> Boo! This thing is huge for travel size. It does fold down, which is something I was looking for, but it seems to fold down while I am using it.for the price, size, and dis functionality, I give it one star. Choose another blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Aside from its worldwide operability which is the primary reason for purchasing this product in the first place, I found the product to be a sound and effective hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The only reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it had a retractable cord. Other than that, it works great and fits perfectly in my narrow drawer, along with my large round brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip I was taking to Mexico.  It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Unfortunately after looking at it and feeling it&#x27;s weight I decided to return it.  As you know the airlines have strict weight limits on luggage. Given I was traveling for two weeks out of the country I need the room in my luggage for other items.  In order to reduce the weight something had to be left behind and I chose to forgo the dryer.</li>
            <li> Folds up perfectly, good heat and power.</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon I was using for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I owned this blow dryer before (exact model) and it was fantastic. I had tons of power and dual voltage allowed me to take it on my many business trips. It finally died (no complaints). Of course, I repurchased the same drier. This one is definitely defective. The handle heats up so much that you can scorch your hand. I recently noticed that the plastic handle was melting around the &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34;. Had to throw the dryer away. Too dangerous.  I was afraid to try again so I&#x27;m trying another brand. Too bad. This was my favorite blow dryer because it had enough power to really straighten out my hair and make it really shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and I needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to Europe. It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its durability. At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than i expected. hair still frizzy after blow drying even with ion technology as advertised.  k j k</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad!! It stopped working from the 1st use </li>
            <li> Love the travel hair dryer. It folds down to take up less place. The diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot/cold air options.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for a trip to Uruguay. I had friends that had been and said every dryer they took always blew when they were there. Not only did I use it but 4 other women used it and it did great. We did use an additional 220volt adapter. I would recommend this dryer for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected, but as the other comments say, it DOES dry hair quickly.  I do like the collapsible handle when packing it in a suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the diffuser for traveling.  The air flow is so strong that it doesn&#x27;t really diffuse very well and my hair ends up being blown all over.  If you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and used it first time this morning.  Dries my short, fine hair faster than the full size dryer I had been using.  My concern is the loud &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when folding the handle.  Sounds like it&#x27;s going to break.  Anyone else have this issue?  Is this normal?</li>
            <li> I am not the one who is using the item, but my wife likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> It was too big, too heavy, and too noisy.</li>
            <li> perfect for air travel as is compact and fits in my cloth bag-love that it has the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is just the right size, has plenty of power and the diffuser is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The Icelandic desk clerk thought I was an idiot...until he looked at the hair dryer and saw that it was supposed to be dual voltage. They were nice enough to lend me one to use for free, but don&#x27;t waste money on this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these hairdryers now. Each one has lasted less than a year before they just burned up and stopped working randomly. They are a nice little hair dryer when they work but I like for my products to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about my hair dryers and usually don&#x27;t like ionic because they leave my hair flat. As other reviewers said, this dryer is fantastic. Has strong air flow and gets hot enough. Dries hair quickly and does not leave it flat. Also the dual voltage is great. The diffuser option works very well when leaving hair curly. And it is so small and easy to pack!</li>
            <li> I would have liked this to be a little lighter, but it has a good amount of power for a travel dryer</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  It was just what she wanted.  It had everything that she wanted and more.</li>
            <li> drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy.</li>
            <li> Fit the bill exactly for overseas travel.  Also good for use at home.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very nice on both voltages</li>
            <li> Not the best but perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work and my normal hair dryer just takes up too much space in my carry-on luggage (since I never check a bag) and of course, I don&#x27;t trust crappy hotel hair dryers. This hair dryer folds up small and was surprisingly good at drying my hair. It dried it as quickly and well (including styling with the nozzle) as my normal hair dryer does. Super happy with it and definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a travel hair dryer. In fact, it probably makes a good every day hair dryer too.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little blow dryer. Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!</li>
