            <li>I am so appreciative that we can still get good, pure, unrefined products on the market.</li>
            <li>HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>Also enjoying the recipe book.</li>
            <li>but I know it has helped so many people out there :)</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this to make my homemade body butters, scrubs, deodorants and lotions.</li>
            <li>At a glance this product is smoother, creamier and more appealing.</li>
            <li>my lotion turned out better too.</li>
            <li>I love using it in my homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it comes with a e-book, the company sends emails of DIY</li>
            <li>I just love it all together.</li>
            <li>I have used it for my lotion and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a bit more creamy, but instead it was crumbly.</li>
            <li>Love this butter...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and will buy again</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and the fact that it comes with a manual is also helpful.</li>
            <li>This is a grainy product, but I love it because as you rub it together it just heats up in your hands</li>
            <li>I love it for my feet, keeps them softer in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I decided to give this one a try as it is so much better.</li>
            <li>I have used Shea Butter for many year, I just bought the Ivory one from this seller and I have to say I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I do love the packaging - it does not look like food for once:)</li>
            <li>I have used most of it, but I am storing the rest in their resealable bag.</li>
            <li>the cheaper stuff where you get more, they include a container.</li>
            <li>Able to make cleansers and moisturizers and sunscreen (with Zinc Oxide) at a FRACTION of what they cost in the store.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Then I got more creative and ordered Mango Butter.</li>

            <li>I will be buying more...</li>

            <li>It was  packaged beautifully and is soft.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly amazed at the high quality for such a great price!  </li>
            <li>so smooth and easy to work with!</li>
            <li>Then I put the remainder in a Quart size Ziplock bag and inserted that in the original paper package!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and goes a long way!</li>
            <li>stuff is worth a try!!</li>
            <li>Excited to put this into use!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it in more cool body butter recipes!</li>
            <li>It is so rich!</li>
            <li>Smells rich and earthy and it&#x27;s so creamy!</li>
            <li>A new great product for me, that I will continue using.</li>
            <li>The product is absolutely fresh smelling but most amazing is the texture-soft &amp; silky,</li>
            <li>I made some of my own lotion using this product for my tummy (9 months pregnant).</li>
            <li>It was easy and I am enjoying them.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own &amp;#34;belly butter&amp;#34; for my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>Love this Shea Butter, doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like others I&#x27;ve used have.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product to help heal dry skin</li>
            <li>Awesome for my dry frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Easily one of the better Shea butter products I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had skin that could easily break out with most moisturizers, including jojoba oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but it arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>It was especially great during the winter when my skin is usually really dry.</li>
            <li>I can deal with the mild organic type odor for this kind of relief.</li>
            <li>Strong unnatural (almost anise-like) smell and a bit of mold on the top (yes, mold, not &#x27;nut skins&#x27; or whathaveyou) have turned me off of using this product.</li>
            <li>Seller checked in to make sure the product was up to par and was extremely easy to get in contact with.</li>
            <li>so I could use it more easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying how versatile and easy to use this product is.  </li>
            <li>Received the shea butter rather quickly and the product is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>butter arrived on time and I was able to download the recipe book easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with, and has so many uses.</li>
            <li>Love how I can easily mix it with coconut oil to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li>one of the best products i have ever purchased, I have spent many months in Africa</li>

            <li>but shea butter is too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is very oily as most products of its kind so if you dont like oily products this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Smokey nutty smell but its strong.</li>
            <li>Had strong &amp;#34;clay-like&amp;#34; &amp;#34;old-oil&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>I bought it in order to make my own body butter, foot cream, and hand cream with it (all-natural, and without alcohol, which ironically, has a drying effect, though you will likely find it in many of your moisturizers!)</li>
            <li>I use this for my eczema, it&#x27;s amazing quality and pure.</li>
            <li>used this as a pure moisturizer throughout, it has worked nicely, still never causes any breakouts either.</li>

            <li>Plus, the seller provides a link with many useful recipes, and seems to genuinely care about the product.</li>
            <li>After two days of applying the shea butter, I have seen a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with how smooth my hands are after using the product, and I will definitely buy it again, and would recommend it to anyone as a hand cream over Dior, Ahava, Mary Kay, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder.</li>

            <li>very clean &amp; fresh...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about trying out the free e-book as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good stuff and close to being more natural than chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell delicious, but the shea butter itself was high quality.</li>

            <li>see some complaints about the smell, but I got to say, its mild and not bad!</li>
            <li>And the seller is super sweet!</li>
            <li>Other brands in screw top containers have arrived fine with a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The seller is very attentive and interested in assuring my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Excellent raw ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li>- awesome lip balm/hand lotion in raw form on the go.  </li>
            <li>This RAW SHEA BUTTER is perfect!</li>
            <li>I like best about this RAW SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>The best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li>This is the best raw shea butter I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I was searching for the perfect raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s all around the best raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best raw, unrefined shea butter I have found anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Will most certainly buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and it&#x27;s easy to break apart for measuring.  </li>
            <li>It does have a smell, however, and this is normal for undefined shea butter, which retains more of its healthy healing vitamins and nutritional value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Minimal packaging and supporting women in Africa just makes this the perfect shea.  </li>
            <li>She no longer has those rough spots and my skin has never looked to smooth and beautiful, well perhaps as a baby.</li>
            <li>It melts quickly,  and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The smell of pure shea butter is a bit strong for me, so i combined it with some coconut oil and almond extract and whipped it into a fabulous body butter!  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend that oil if you are looking for another amazing product to include in your skin care routine.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is high quality and an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant and it melts and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased and used another brand of unrefined Shea Butter from Amazon, with which I was not disappointed, enjoyed very much and used every scrap of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product comes well packaged and the butter is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This was amazing soft and smoothe!!</li>
            <li>Super smooth, fantastic product, customer service and recipe ebook.</li>
            <li>Really helps with our dry winter skin and smells delicious --- chocolatey.  </li>
            <li>i love my skin now very very clear and healthy looking...</li>
            <li>I make an eczema cream out of this (with cedarwood, geranium, and lavender essential oils) and it&#x27;s amazing at clearing up my eczema!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been about a week or so, but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase from Better Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I am so impressed I am giving small tubs of it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Cannot wait to use it for more projects, especially those in the ebook of recipes provided by Better Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li>Definitely fresh!</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, the shea butter was sooooo fresh!  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, I&#x27;m in LOVE with the packaging, unique and easily accessible with the re-seal lid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I made lotion with it this past weekend and it turned out great!!</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of Shea Butter, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and goes  a looooong way.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for :-)</li>
            <li>I added a star to my review because I&#x27;m pretty satisfied now but not 5 stars because of the shenanigans.</li>
            <li>Lovely, lovely block of shea butter - will definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>Friendly company.</li>
            <li>(pretty sure it was)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought enough to try more products!  </li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>I was thankful for all the information given to me by the company, although was too excited to stop and read any of their recipes.</li>
            <li>Swear, it was that fresh!  </li>
            <li>I keep coming back for more and telling everyone how much I love it!</li>
            <li>and I like how it is so rich to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>Really, I&#x27;m SO excited I found this</li>
            <li>I ordered this rich moisturizer (Shea Butter--organic) to use in my homemade soap bars.  </li>
            <li>The ebook is full of fantastic recipes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making more for my whole family!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and my EO never disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li>However, this shea butter has significantly reduced the problem with just two applications</li>
            <li>However, this shea butter has significantly reduced the problem with just two applications</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now bought this butter three times in the past year and the quality is still superb!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looked exactly like it showed It was packaged in the brown bag which was a zip lock top</li>
            <li>used cetephil first to soak in and then covered him with this lovely Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>
            <li>I have used this Shea Butter several times now and am loving it!  </li>
            <li>It significantly reduces redness and rawness within a day.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and feel better using natural products!</li>
            <li>I was pleased since this was my first time purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I am able to do many different things with it and helped me avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li>I use this in my original shea butter hair moisturizer recipes exclusively.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s feels rich.  </li>
            <li>PLUS, I love love love how my skin is feeling after only a day.</li>
            <li>Got it super quick too!</li>
            <li>So rare these days!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea Butter and so many people have told me that I Shea butter comes &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and have to melt before blending with my coconut oil and vegetable glycerin.  </li>
            <li>It has a rich creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>It is not hard and crumbly, as many are; it is not grainy, as most are; it is not pre-whipped and full of air, as some are.</li>
            <li>Love that this is pure &amp; genuinely works.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this product and it was just as great as the first!</li>
            <li>I have very curly 3c/4a afro-american hair that is very fine</li>
            <li>Made my own deodorant last weekend and will make body lotion today :)</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, it melts easily</li>
            <li>My skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on my hands that worsens in the winter and after using this product for a day my skin was smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING product, especially in the winter where it provides a soothing, smooth texture to every inch of skin!</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky, perfect for my Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled for so many years with sensitivity to commercial soaps and lotions that I decided to try my hand at making my own.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is a clean ivory with no residue.  </li>
            <li>The stuff from Mountain Rose Herbs smelled better and was more yellow and kind of gritty.  </li>
            <li>I had to clean the bits off with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Overall - really loving this and plan to order more.  </li>
            <li>, I melt some in my palm and tried on my face, my skin absorbs quickly and felt smooth.</li>
            <li>I want to get more and more to natural products.</li>
            <li>The product looks clean, and has a nutty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the most amazingly smooth shea butter ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from three different vendors on Amazon and this is by far the very best shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>It is unrefined but it is clean, no straining.</li>
            <li>Creamy and clean.  </li>
            <li>I started looking for more natural alternatives to store bought beauty products and came across Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>So I add it into many of my creams-such as calendula cream and jewelweed cream, gives it a nice extra umph!</li>
            <li>but it was manageable to clean.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several brands of shea butter, but so far this has been the best.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy feeling if your like me and used to squeaky clean and lightweight lotions.</li>
            <li>I am not as young as I want to be but after a couple of days my face and neck have shown a more healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Love it, amazing instant results!</li>
            <li>It is great shea butter for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; so far has worked really well in the recipes I&#x27;ve used it in.</li>
            <li>butter does not smell like a nice perfume, but neither is it supposed to; it has a light smell of natural plant butter.</li>
            <li>So far I have made several and think I like the ones using the Shea Butter the best.</li>
            <li>After purchasing shea butter from another seller I was not impressed and had it refunded, this product is amazing and the costumer sevice was great!</li>
            <li>I am thinking of adding some Zinc next time to start making my own sunblock :)</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my dry skin and this works great.</li>
            <li>I use Shea butter to use as a sort of diaper rash cream, but my own mix, as it is not only cheaper but better quality.</li>
            <li>I have bought this brand several times and it is by far the best Shea Butter out there.</li>
            <li>I tried several Shea butters and this brand is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my dry heels too.</li>
            <li>Great product and super quick delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Mild smell, very smooth, no lumps, super hydrating, very pure.</li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive and non-sensitive people alike, because it has a very nice earthy pleasant smell, not strong at all (not like the yellow Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is a little more than I normally spend for unrefined shea butter, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency and made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>and so far I really love it!</li>
            <li>I like that this is completely natural and healthy for my skin, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so greasy!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, supple and even toned when I use this cream, it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>made shea-coconut body lotion and am loving it so far!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about how beautiful my skin is as well as how smooth and delicate my face it.</li>
            <li>Great product...very happy with how it melted down and mixed.</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter, you&#x27;re clean, pure, and just what my hair and skin needs..</li>
            <li>It makes shaving very smooth and she puts some lavender and mint in it to make it smell really</li>
            <li>Use it to make moisturizer and it works great in the dry AZ weather!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and eczema!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time to use this product and absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Used in a recipe for natural deodorant and so far so good!</li>
            <li>and they are so much cheaper compared with other organic shea butter you can find anywhere, with excellent quality too!</li>
            <li>will have to try other brands and get more experience to know what&#x27;s  good</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying more.  </li>
            <li>I have tried making lotion with this, but have found I like the pure shea butter much better.</li>
            <li>The scent is nothing special, but mix with a drop of coconut oil</li>
            <li>I use it as a massage cream with some special ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love this product pure.</li>
            <li>and It right away soothes any itching I have!</li>
            <li>It also came right on time!</li>
            <li>Buy this right away!  </li>
            <li>Great for my children&#x27;s very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but we love that it is raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li>good quality, nice raw color and smell.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this raw shea butter, it&#x27;s organic and just what I needed!</li>
            <li>The shea butter is clean and smooth, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes.</li>
            <li>This company is not skimpy on what they give and the product is super rich and melts with touch.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!!!</li>
            <li>If your a high end product consumer like myself, don&#x27;t let the price fool you - this is an amazing product that&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Nice texture, no weird smell and was shipped in a decent time period!</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m back for more of this high quality, remarkable product.</li>
            <li>The product arrived soft and was easy to use; it melted well; it combined well with other ingredients and was especially nice to use when whipped.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, and is easy to blend with other ingredients to make a fabulous body butter.</li>
            <li>Clean and pure moisture!!</li>
            <li>plus it was delivered sooner than i expected the customer service was great as well</li>
            <li>The product is as expected and works great in my homemade body butter</li>
            <li>I use this as my daily moisturizer and after the first week of using it I noticed great changes it my skin.</li>
            <li>I am happy I made this choice, it was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li>Moisturizers my skin amazingly while still being all natural.</li>
            <li>Although this is certainly a great butter, as I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that much better to justify the price.</li>
            <li>Have made acne cream and lotion so far that works and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have made 4 lotions so far &amp; my skin smells &amp; feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The shea butter arrived just as expected and works great.</li>
            <li>I made a natural shave cream with it and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Exactly as expected, great packaging.</li>
            <li>The smell is earthy and somewhat full bodied.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The recipes book is very helpful, they have more than 10 recipes using Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Now, I would say dime size works well for just my hands and maybe half-dollar if I am doing a full body slather.  </li>
            <li>but now I am a true believer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try the sweet recipes.</li>
            <li>A true gift from Africa.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for those looking for a good quality Shea, or for those who need a deep moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t done this, but I know some people use it on their hair as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the free recipe ebook!</li>
            <li>I loved how this came packaged in a &amp;#34;zipper type&amp;#34; on both the outside and the inside package as well.  </li>

            <li>I bought some at a craft fair last year for</li>
            <li>Nice natural scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li>I put the contents of the bag in my kitchen aide mixer,  with a cap full of olive oil and 5 to 10 drops of lavender.</li>
            <li>seemed really fresh...already planning to buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this as a face and body moisturizer.</li>

            <li>It firmed back up &amp; was good to go.</li>
            <li>for full legs  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually edible, but my guess is it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it</li>
            <li>The reviews are absolutely true.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and is absorbed on contact.</li>
            <li>The ebook that comes with your purchase is chocked full of helpful hints and recipes.</li>

            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Mixed with coconut oil to make a whipped body butter and rubbed on grandsons eczema , he loved it.</li>
            <li>I miss the sweet baby smell but</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Thanks better Shea 😀</li>
            <li>The shea butter was the appropriate color and consistency, so that was very reassuring.</li>
            <li>After purchasing Shea butter from a different seller and it not being of good quality</li>
            <li>Better then lotion,  very nourishing to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably natural to this kind of Shea Butter,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixing it with cocoa butter and sweet almond oil and using it to (hopefully) prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>many thanks.</li>
            <li>love it , got it fast</li>
            <li>The company was good about following up with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good butter</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>UNTIL NOW,This ivory shea butter,is much lighter and softer,and absorbs better into my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this shea butter because I am making my own natural cosmetics</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have prior experience with Shea butter, so I have to assume this is good quality.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this butter.  </li>
            <li>it firms up again, then when cool whip with hand blender.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m going through it so fast</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make my own lotion for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My recipe includes natural beeswax, shea butter, zinc oxide and rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly in the summer time because it is a great long lasting moisturizing although it would make more sense to use this in the winter.</li>
            <li>The packing is a nice touch with the natural look.</li>
            <li>I also used it in lip balm with coconut oil, beeswax, and a touch of sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>I made a whipped butter with cocoa butter, coconut oil, and sweet almond oil...</li>
            <li>only is the product superior</li>
            <li>It is also good for clearing skin blemishes such as pimples.</li>
            <li>I made my own natural lotion</li>
            <li>I can see the brown spots on my skin even out tone wise, my skin feels softer and smoother at the same time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li>Just dont like the smell really not bad but not flower either</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $16.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>And just to be sure the good review goes to the right vendor and not some general feedback on a general product, this came from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>and it seems very pure and fine.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I was impressed by the substantial feel and weight; I could tell right away that I have a lot of shea butter here, especially since I plan to use it straight as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came very nicely packaged, and upon opening it was clear that this was a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much because the texture is easy to apply</li>
            <li>It feels good, and it&#x27;s vacuum sealed for freshness.</li>
            <li>They have free eBook which is very informative with easy instructions.</li>
            <li>Ordered unrefined shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs, and the smell is similar, although not quite as strong.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and the product is soft and easy to put on...</li>
            <li>It was delivered in two days and was super fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;ve used on its own on my face - take care here as it pulls on the skin a bit when applying, but once on, feels super.</li>
            <li>It comes soft and fresh to my door!!!</li>
            <li>I recently made the most awesome sunscreen lotion bars with the Shea butter, And am thrilled with the results - these lotion bars came out firm, but soft and smooth and moisturizing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am finally hip to how great raw shea butter is, and all the great things you do with it.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully, and it costs so much less than the fancy schmancy brands in &amp;#34;skin care&amp;#34; shops and departments.  </li>
            <li>I used this to make body butter for the first time, it was was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I am still trying some of the recipes from the free ebook, but I love how soft my skin is!</li>
            <li>This shea butter arrived promptly, was easy to work with and in less than a week we have seen remarkable improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li>Such a great pure product.</li>
            <li>mixes great with other oils to make lotion.</li>
            <li>Works great alone and in other homemade body products-</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great shea butter.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, the smell is nutty and quite distinct, so I think it&#x27;s an original product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, it does not have that rancid smell other Shea butters do and it is not oily.</li>
            <li>it melts great on your skin with and without mixing with other oils,  </li>
            <li>This one is so much more creamy and soft  that I was able to rub it into my skin without heating it first.</li>
            <li>That turned out great and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with, good color...not too odoriferous...mixed with all the other oils I blend in......</li>
            <li>It is hard to find good quality shea now that it has become popular.</li>
            <li>It is a rich, easy to use body butter that is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>just pure shea butter goodness all wrapped up in a package!!  </li>
            <li>This is quality Shea -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after you rub it in, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>This is a tremendous amount of shea butter for the price.</li>
            <li>and it will start to crack and bleed quickly.</li>
            <li>The recipe book that comes with it is super helpful, and the owner emailed me to answer questions immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mild nutty scent, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a great product.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and they email you a link to a shea butter recipe book after arrival.</li>

            <li>and it seems to go away fairly quickly.  </li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Shea butters but this was the best by far!</li>
            <li>but it quickly absorbs in and is not a stain-hazard to clothing or bedding.</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and when I opened the packet</li>
            <li>quickly used the Shea butter</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly and I used to make a whipped body butter that I&#x27;ve been using every day since.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having a high quality product:)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Isabella and The Better Shea Butter Team.</li>
            <li>I love it and give it an A (trust me, my stamp of approval should be highly regarded after all the $$$$ I spend here), that said check it out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, I used this for making body butter and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>Lovely, high quality Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I plan on making my own health and beauty items and it was important to me to have a high quality product from a high quality supplier.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great, and some dry areas are healing quickly after consistent use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to make, the directions are very clear, and I have a wonderful jar of rich, creamy completely natural body butter that is working wonders on my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>Melts well and is not gritty at all, very clean and it makes a really great whipped body butter that is nearly a true white color.  </li>
            <li>I used this in a couple of different whipped body butter recipes and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure is normal.</li>
            <li>First of all this smells light and nutty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product, just wish it came in a bigger amount, but I will just have to order more next time.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and plan to keep this purchase regular for my family.&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li>Love this Shea Butter will not buy any other kind.</li>
            <li>I tried other shea butter and this is one of the best shea butter I tried so far.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate that very much!  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is smooth, consistent and melts with hand temperature (as it should).</li>
            <li>I, recently, purchased this product and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It was nice and fluffy soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I just made my very first homemade beauty product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of the old school French cuisine theory where even the lowliest ingredient can be elevated by good technique, or something.</li>
            <li>(The smell by the way is not entirely unpleasant, just not fragranced like processed shea butter).  </li>
            <li>Has a very mild scent, is super soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>but I appreciated the raw quality (which is awesome</li>
            <li>it was not hard at all which made it better for me to cut the portion that I needed for my peppermint body</li>
            <li>and not to mention super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I melt it down and mix it with my fav oils, then I let it harden and whip it with my hand mixer and it makes a great cream that I use as soon as I step out the shower.  </li>
            <li>Raw Shea Butter - Good quality product!</li>
            <li>and they provide a great ebook for other recipes that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li>First of all, I love how pure it looks and smells when it arrives.</li>
            <li>This is the best raw shea butter I have ever purchased!!</li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to try new formulas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the &#x27;shea butter&#x27; world so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>sure to use essential oils because Raw Shea Butter does not have the best smell.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like whipped butter almost good enough to eat ;)</li>
            <li>product arrived very quickly, and was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>The ivory shea butter does have distinct smell, but it is a mild one.  </li>
            <li>I use the shea butter only on my face - no breakouts, face is beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I warm a small amount in my hand to warm it up</li>
            <li>Very nice....creamy and easy to use</li>
            <li>one now.&lt;br /&gt;The block is a pretty good size, and seems like it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was in an actual large bullion cube shape.  </li>
            <li>This shea is so pure, my skin did not react, in fact i use it all over my body after a shower and feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this is a much better alternative than petroleum based lotions that clog pores.</li>
            <li>It melts down perfectly and whips up soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li>I love the soft creamy consistence of BSB!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>

            <li>It smells lovely &amp; leaves our skin soft &amp; moisturized!</li>
            <li>They are definitely concerned with their customers&#x27; satisfaction, and I am SATISFIED!</li>
            <li>I have been doing very extensive research on Shea butter and there are so many imposters out there!</li>
            <li>twice the price!The delivery was fast!!</li>
            <li>My skin loves it so much!!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping this first pregnancy a zero stretch mark one!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed to make my body butter!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again and recommend them highly!!!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think of making my soap without this--and the fact that it&#x27;s totally organic makes it that much better!  </li>
            <li>What better endorsement than having men compliment you on your soft skin!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever purchasing shea butter!</li>
            <li>This product was rich and creamy, exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Made my first batch with this shea butter!</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands of shea butter before and this is so far my favorite-- simply wonderful smooth buttery goodness that melts immediately when applied; none of the grittiness that I sometimes get in previously-tried brands.</li>
            <li>On my third order, and still love it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Only wish I could give more stars than 5!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>First, kudos to the vendor on the speediness of my order...less than a week!</li>
            <li>Item arrived exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Oh boy did it start to heal fast!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy from Better Shea Butter again!</li>
            <li>If this is the first time buying or the millionth, you would want to try this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistently high-quality, order after order!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted!  </li>

            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>and this really help!!</li>
            <li>I found that warming it briefly between my hands allowed it to melt a bit and spread more easily on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been making changes from my chemical saturated skin care products to more natural skin care; once I read about the healing properties, vitamin A, and the fact that Shea Butter melts into the skin quickly (oils that sit on my skin tend to break me out)</li>
            <li>So far, my skin is supple and never has itched (I hear many pregnant women get itchy skin on their bellies because the skin is stretching).</li>
            <li>So far, my skin is supple and never has itched (I hear many pregnant women get itchy skin on their bellies because the skin is stretching).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice not hearing my teenage daughter calling me super ashy.</li>
            <li>So smooth and soft and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick arrival, good quality, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the shea butter arrived well-packaged and in fine condition.</li>
            <li>It melts ridiculously fast when you rub it in between your fingertips, and it also absorbs into the skin quickly, without even clogging my pores up!</li>
            <li>When I told Isabel, the owner, about the natural way I cleanse my face, she was very interested and wanted to know more.  </li>
            <li>I had been combining w/ jojoba oil or coconut oil, but I just used the shea butter straight from the brick and it shampooed out fine.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t super excited about the packaging, but I transferred it to a large mason jar so no problems there!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>So smooth and pure.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect solution for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It took the oils very nicely and wiped up easily and ended up with the texture of a thick milk shake.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell as compared to other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This butter came in a double sealed bag (sealed plastic, then heat-sealed resealable organic-looking bag) and was a very nice, solid block that I could easily cut in 4oz doses to make my recipes.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!!</li>
            <li>not rock hard like many others, informative, good quality and texture</li>
            <li>The look, feel, and smell of the butter are high quality - clean, but rich.</li>
            <li>It felt very creamy, smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was amazing until I ran out and could not seem to find the same product again until now!!  </li>
            <li>It smells and works great, and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Made a few lotions with this shea butter for my daughter will eczema and they turned out great.</li>
            <li>I hope they enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>it has been amazing for me and the entire family</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough how amazing their customer service is, Isabella.</li>
            <li>I might have gotten it sooner if it wasn&#x27;t for the weekend, however, its still fast shipping compared to the almond oil I am still waiting on, the one I paid shipping on where as this came with free shipping and still got to me in under a week.</li>
            <li>This is third time I buy this amazing products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>This really makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>Initially purchased to make whip body butter for my family, but I found out that it makes an amazing diaper rash treatment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a few body butters and scrubs with this and all have turned out great.</li>
            <li>Came packaged as pictured, smells fantastic, and works really well.</li>
            <li>Have made several lotions already.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an amazing and affordable product.</li>
            <li>Finally, their customer service is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>A quality product, and the free recipes were very helpful to a novice like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have already made a few things with it and each are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product a few times and it works great for my body butter, soaps, and lip balm.</li>
            <li>A bit grainy when mixed to use as hair butter, but it works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair so far.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>You can clearly tell that it is of better quality.</li>
            <li>I make my own two ingredient lotion with this ( 6 tbsp olive oil and one order of this shea butter, melted over very low heat, refrigerated for about 45 minutes, the whipped with an electric mixer).</li>
            <li>and mine was sent to me fresh made on Dec 14th 2014.</li>
            <li>Comes sealed and fresh.</li>
            <li>I keep it wrapped and in a plastic covered tub to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own body butters mixing shea, coconut and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i have never felt my skin so soft and healthy</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is really so nice, I have just bought it for the second time.</li>
            <li>It is very easily absorbed in the skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery , great product, and the people behind the product are so nice.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and at a fair price</li>
            <li>It is oily but quickly is absorbed in skin.</li>
            <li>It has a great natural scent but mixes well with any essential oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was a nice surprise to get the ebook with different Shea butter recipes.</li>
            <li>Isabella, owner of Better Shea Butter, is awesome to work with, she is very customer orientated and stands behind her product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying from Mountain Rose Herbs in the future.</li>
            <li>....can&#x27;t find any better anywhere as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>The smell leaves a lot to be desired but the benefits are worth the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the natural smell of these shea butter and the way packaging</li>
            <li>I still kept it, thinking if I massaged it in my hand before use it might still be useful.</li>
            <li>I received recipes from the company so it was nice to see how to use the Shea butter in different ways.</li>
            <li>a wonderful product, perfect for blending with olive oil and making a base for my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I made face cream out of this shea butter with some jojoba, rose hip, and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter itself is fantastic quality and has worked lovely as an ingredient in some of the DIY body butters and lotions I&#x27;ve been making recently.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>but then his skin absorbed completely it and seemed to need more.</li>
            <li>smooths my skin and mixes with a variety of things to make even the roughest elbows soft :) I would buy this again.</li>
            <li>my husband keeps giving me compliments on how soft my skin is:-)</li>
            <li>Not only for selling this amazing product, but to their attentive customer service, you can really see that they care about their customers and the quality of the shea butter</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a bit of olive oil and some essential oils that smell nice to me.</li>
            <li>I think that is such a nice gesture.</li>
            <li>Now I know, you just cannot compare anything from a shelf  to something as fresh as this product.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own eczema cream with essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, has an exotic natural semi-sweet smell to it, and can be used as is from the package.  </li>
            <li>and I will be ordering my own next.</li>
            <li>so far, I already made a home skin product from the e-book with recipes and I love it.</li>
            <li>There is so much shea butter in the package that will probably last a good 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It does not go on like regular lotion: you need to warm it</li>
            <li>Enjoying the product so far.</li>
            <li>It was fresh and had the consistency that it should have.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t know how to use it or whether i was supposed to store it in the refrigerator or not but the owner Isabella was kind enough to assist me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made the facial moisturizer and my face is loving it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I make my own Shea body butter and will definitely be ordering with them again!  </li>
            <li>My skin is amazingly soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have started making my own beauty supplies and made a body butter out of Shea, vitamin e oil and lavender/vanilla essential oils.</li>
            <li>It blends well not grainy at all and holds the smell of the essential oils nicely.</li>
            <li>soft and spreadable out of the bag unlike many others we have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind of shea butter</li>
            <li>I make my own lotions using essential oils, (some unscented as well...</li>

            <li>So far petty satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this for a more natural skin care product.</li>
            <li>the yellow shea butter gives her skin a nice tan glow.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with coconut oil and vitamin E to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li>using this for pregnancy stretch-mark prevention, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I plan on whipping it up with a cocoa butter and that will improve the smell.</li>
            <li>Simply because, it was a good size for the prize and arrived very quickly (thanks, Prime).</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m going to throw out every store bought lotion I own because I&#x27;m not going back to store bought chemical lotions!!!</li>
            <li>Just got it to make my own facecream with some essential oils.</li>
            <li>I made hand cream using my Young Living Essential Oils and it turned out great.</li>
            <li>And the bonus recipe book is a fun add.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh nutty smell.</li>
            <li>love making DIY recipes with this Raw Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li>This company is apparently doing it right --- superior quality at a reasonable price ;)</li>
            <li>My e-book of recipes was available &amp; easy for me to download &amp; there appear to be some pretty useful &amp; natural recipes in there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and high quality.  </li>
            <li>so this is very nice to have I have a little container I carry in my purse for my hands and my lips.</li>
            <li>I can easily slice off exactly how much I need.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product for my dry hand.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that is going to last me a long time, and when I do run out, I will order more!</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter is so much more fresh &amp; creamy than any other brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>It will be a smidge less \\&quot;light\\&quot; when whipped up, but it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I plan to try some of their other products; I think the standard of quality will be great, based my the Shea butter experience!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any other type of Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others but it worked great and has helped re-motorize my skin without the added chemicals.</li>
            <li>After experience with several other brands, I must say that this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It smells better than many of the other brands of shea butter that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter is much better than other butters I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I wish they sold it in larger packages, but other than that, its a great product!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pregnant with our first baby (30 weeks - over 7 months) and</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to mention that I had some questions and concerns about this butter, which I spoke to the seller about, and she was quick to address my issue and very generous in her response!</li>
            <li>It came pretty quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Will be a return customer and a few more months!!</li>
            <li>Just a pure, clean smell and</li>
            <li>Delivered super quick &amp; high quality!</li>
            <li>but I wake up with much healthier, more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat, it&#x27;s maleable and easy to work with right out of the packaging, and the end product left my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It is rich,  blends well and leaves my skin very moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Other than the shipping not as promised (Prime) product was good.</li>
            <li>She was enthusiastically receptive to my ideas and it felt really good to know that I might be contributing to something that other people might appreciate or benefit from.</li>
            <li>While the quality of items I choose are all good it seems that the butters and other items</li>
            <li>really was rich</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the friendly email I received from the seller.  </li>
            <li>Have no experience with other shea butters but the good ratings of this brand sold me.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and rich, but I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li>how many different uses for Shea Butter, nor the variety of products it could be mixed with so am very pleased with the booklet of recipes.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and pleasant; the feel is a little oily when first applied, but just wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>Have used it right out of the package to rub on skin.  </li>
            <li>I had to put what I didn&#x27;t use right away into a ziplock baggie.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face at night right after washing.</li>
            <li>I made a face cream right away.</li>
            <li>If I were to guess, this butter came right from harvest.</li>
            <li>These people contact you right away and thank you for buying their product.</li>
            <li>, am I right?</li>

            <li>Super excited to get a &#x27;new&#x27;  butter, but when put on toast it was just the worse.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>We got exactly what we wanted and ordered exactly when we wanted it!</li>
            <li>I have irritated, red skin, but one layer of this at night, and my skin is soft, smooth, and healthy!</li>
            <li>It is soft, smells very mild (unlike other products I have used), melts smoothly and mixes well with other oils to make really wonderful skin creams/body butters etc...</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light scent which is hard to describe...</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer and I live where it&#x27;s hot and dry.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine in brick form and though it smells wonderful and is a very good product, it was extremely hard and therefore difficult tocut and measure.</li>
            <li>very pure.</li>
            <li>This really helps me moisture my face without break out specially that I am on accutane.</li>
            <li>Very pure quality Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Had a nice smooth texture and slight nutty smell.</li>
            <li>Best out there for dry aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>and it really keeps my dry skin in good condition.</li>
            <li>It comes in a wonderfully natural and easy to keep bag to keep it fresh</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because I really wanted the white, but that was my fault for not reading &amp;#34;ivory.&amp;#34;  Very good on everything else though.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, and melts in the hand almost instantly, making it easy to apply to the skin... just as easily as hand lotion actually.  </li>
            <li>Buttery smooth, easily mixes with other ingredients, and a light scent.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with coconut oil and a bit of olive oil to make an all over body lotion that feels so good on my skin leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li>Next time I need some, I am going to purchase it in that form as it will make handling and measuring much easier and much more accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive creams my wife buys, but by far, Shea Butter is the best product I&#x27;ve found - I&#x27;m sold on Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>; Lol But, I dont stink/reek of it when putting it on, just a small odor.</li>
            <li>It is evident that it is fresh</li>
            <li>Great to use small amount on hair too-</li>
            <li>and while I liked it, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the overwhelming white chocolate scent.  </li>
            <li>After about an hour its pretty much absorbed.</li>
            <li>then I expected it to and made a great natural deodorant out of it!</li>
            <li>Light, fluffy, I love it!</li>
            <li>When I went out to Better Shea Butter&#x27;s website I found out that they source their shea butter from \\&quot;fair local trading efforts in Africa\\&quot; and use \\&quot;minimal packaging material to lower environmental impact.\\</li>
            <li>Put on a nice pair of socks after a long day of walking at work and wala.</li>
            <li>This shea butter arrived quickly and is a large quantity.</li>
            <li>Super smart buy...</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine since my hands were very soft after I got everything together.  </li>
            <li>, it takes a little bit more time and work to apply it to all the areas you desire because of it&#x27;s butter form, but it is way better than any amount of lotion you could ever use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how</li>
            <li>I put the shea butter in a large glass measuring cup and then placed the cup in a pot of very hot water.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, melts easily and blends well with other butters and/or oils.</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter from other vendors, but this one is by far the smoothest &amp; most effective.</li>
            <li>While I like the other brand, I absolutely LOVE Better Shea Butter&#x27;s brand; it is not whipped (the Whole Foods brand was) and was soft, pliable, easy to apply to my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the pure shea butter from a chain store specializing in cosmetics for a much higher price and not such a user friendly product but because I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li>Luxurious, moisturizing, and pure heaven!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily right now</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily right now</li>
            <li>And the feel is also and moister too-not grainy and kind of dry like the</li>
            <li>It is wonderfully soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>One daughter liked it so much I bought a second order to give her.</li>
            <li>This shea butter, Estee Lauder Advance Night Serum, and CUCUMBER infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE EYE BRIGHTENING Gel make a great combination for a facial regimen.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to use</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and it was clear of particles and visible impurities.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the Better Shea Butter and would recommend it to anyone who wants to naturally moisturize their skin.</li>
            <li>Soft texture, easy to incorporate into my recipes.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few lotions and will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the extra money for sure.</li>
            <li>As a surfer and fisherman, I need a product that&#x27;s effective on my dry and sun baked skin.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this Shea butter was soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve been oil cleansing with Jamaican black castor oil and coconut oil (2:1 ratio) and my skin looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and really acceptable.  </li>
            <li>it became soft smooth and fresh just by days of use...</li>
            <li>I use this in a homeade body butter, mixes really well, and is so soft, love it.</li>
            <li>I have found it to be incredibly effective on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>its worth it for her to have soft smooth hair.</li>
            <li>so I feel that I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth through Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Because of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been making my own natural lotions for awhile now.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with different oils and feels great on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It was easy to work with and soft.</li>
            <li>and it turned out great, although it took a lot of essential oils to cover up the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34;, and odor is still present.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently experimenting with organic, nbatural recipes for &amp;#34;body lotion bars&amp;#34; and this product was a great addition to my Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, Organic Bees Wax, Vitamin E, and drops of an essential oil.</li>
            <li>I like this shea butter a lot because it is so soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>&quot; Using the product at night on my dry hands, I noticed that it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; onto your skin nicely with body temperature.</li>
            <li>is soft like soap, so easy to cut by knife.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick, the shea arrived packaged in a clear zip bag, inside of the brown zip bag.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and came packaged really well.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter has a fresh, natural smell and melts in your hand to a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>and I can tell the company is fabulous based on the aforementioned light beams.</li>
            <li>It was soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>, it looks nice, the bag is durable and it&#x27;s within another bag inside that one to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is soft and easy to break apart by hand.  </li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are natural and easy to get.  </li>
            <li>Its a soft butter and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>your hair will look more lively this a product that I highly recommend aND can&#x27;t wait to get my moving situation in order</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer, however it didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It was very hard to apply and messy.&lt;br /&gt;Part</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth without being oily.</li>
            <li>my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>after I measure the amount that the recipe calls for, I rub my hands and legs with the butter that gets stuck in my utensils, leaving my skin very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The Shea came packaged well and seems to be very pure - this is my first experience ever with Shea</li>
            <li>A very light natural scent that can easily compliment essential oils.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to cut and distributed into separate containers, mixes very well with other oils, melts easily over a steam bath while maintaining it&#x27;s rich Shea butter smell.  </li>
            <li>But after a few days of use, my skin is looking better than ever and has not broken out at all!!!!</li>
            <li>Rub briskly between hands to melt, then smooth over body, off to bed, and wake up with baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely no problems, love the product!</li>
            <li>Came as expected - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>After that take off and let cool on a hot pad, follow your recipe directions to water ever you are doing to know how far to let cool.  </li>

            <li>This shea butter is very smooth and not gritty.</li>
            <li>Very high quality!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a double broiler, so I used a pot and then a glass Pyrex round bowl that would fit on top of the pot nicely.</li>
            <li>The ointment is very thick, odorless and its very good quality.</li>
            <li>Once I started using your Raw Shea Butter the darkness of stretch marks &amp; scars start to disappear and my own complexion returned!</li>
            <li>My mother bought it first and made certain that I bought one as well!</li>
            <li>This company has been more attentive than any other company I&#x27;ve bought from on amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering this product - the first batch I ordered lasted for nearly one year and kept perfectly after opening in a sealed ziplock that it came in, kept in a dark, cool</li>
            <li>I had pored over the reviews for this shea butter as well as other brands and was satisfied that all the reviews were genuine.</li>
            <li>I had pored over the reviews for this shea butter as well as other brands and was satisfied that all the reviews were genuine.</li>
            <li>Plus for 16 dollars for a pound is a good deal when other companies sell lower quality for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a few days after making the leave in smell to change, it&#x27;s pretty pleasant now and the smell is less strong and more like the coconut oil and avocado oil used in my leave in.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s a large block, so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is pure, fresh and does not have any filler agents.  </li>
            <li>But now I am living somewhere very dry, and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Besides that minor issue, I&#x27;m looking forward to using the recipes in the ebook, which btw, was very easy to download and access--just have your order ID #.</li>
            <li>But I love mostly all Raw Shea Butter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast, the ebook is very helpful and the product is A 1 !!</li>
            <li>I then cover that nutty smell by applying a little bit of coconut oil on my face (which is also good for skin).</li>
            <li>I loved how this felt, but the smell was a little overpowering for my taste.</li>
            <li>Good ju-ju in this little package of butter.</li>
            <li>Makes a great gift for individuals with skin allergies, sensitivities and fashionistas who like raw product!</li>
            <li>I am really excited to try new recipes with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m still not very skilled at picking out good shea butter, but what I received from this company was nicer than what I got before.  </li>
            <li>So I searched high and low for the best natural alternative and kept coming back to Shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I can stretch it to make my favorite hair products to my liking when I mix with different organic oils</li>
            <li>I personally like the scent although I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying shea butter.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results I am seeing and will continue to use this product daily.</li>

            <li>this is exactly the product i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using Shea butter.</li>

            <li>The packaging was simple and sturdy, don&#x27;t need much more than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll mostly use it for hair moisturizer and facial lotion from Acne.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever bought shea butter, but</li>

            <li>so I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Love both the ivory and yellow Shea butters.  </li>

            <li>Shipped prompt, product exactly as described-easy to use.</li>
            <li>High quality product!!</li>
            <li>I thought that after I made the recipe and added the essential oils that the smell would be better</li>
            <li>Unlike the picture, as it melted it did not turn a pretty amber liquied but it was kinda of greenish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was recommended to me by a fellow essential oil user and I am so glad she recommended</li>
            <li>This was my  first time to order Shea butter.</li>
            <li>My husband thinks the finished product has a better scent than just the Shea butter without the essential oil added!</li>

            <li>The first time I ordered it, I added jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>At first I was leery about buying this product because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I end up giving this product a chance because it said exactly what I was looking for in a Shea Butter product.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering Shea butter online.</li>
            <li>But this is my first time using an ivory colored one.</li>
            <li>Mine was pretty green/brown in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is the first time I have ever bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>arrives exactly as pictured-</li>
            <li>First on myself then on my son</li>
            <li>This Shea butter wasn&#x27;t white, but more of an off-white or ivory color.</li>
            <li>FIRST, the Shea butter is heavenly to work with.</li>
            <li>Not only was I able to make a 1-2mo supply of body lotion, I was also able to make a 1-2mo supply of facial exfoliant and night cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My first night with it, I just slathered the shea butter in my hair and on my face &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; and went to bed.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on a product ever</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying the ivory</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer, brighter, and moist!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It arrived via Amazon boxed and in the packaging exactly as shown in its photo.</li>
            <li>Despite the steep price, I was highly satisfied and will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely order this product again.  </li>
            <li>Sorry to say I wasn&#x27;t very happy with this batch of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>i was able to get a response via email within a day.&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely purchase from them (and probably will)</li>
            <li>I love it on my face and feet especially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be melted in microwave if needed although I prefer not to to that as it condenses after cooling and gets more solid if you plan on using it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next morning I compare them, the finger skin on the hand which I put shea butter is obviously better.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>My skin is soooooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First time ever buying Shea butter</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>First time using unrefined.</li>
            <li>Only issue is if it was already diluted with oils because when it melted in my hands, it was more oily than shea I am used to getting.</li>
            <li>I liked the Shea Butter and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter like this</li>
            <li>I LOVE it as a facial moisturizer, because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I was a bit wary to use it on my face, but I can now say after use for a couple of weeks that I had no breakout at all, and my skin is looking wonderful</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured and has a nutty smell.</li>
            <li>This is the first time buying Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>made my first home made body butter with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recipe if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>It was pretty blocky at 1st</li>
            <li>It does not cause me to break out or become overly oily, just dewy, then I put regular moisturizer on top followed by my makeup.</li>
            <li>: argan oil goes on my skin first thing after a shower, then shea butter, then Kiehl&#x27;s body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a massive amount that I am sure will take me through the summer.</li>
            <li>and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses.</li>
            <li>and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses.</li>
            <li>The first purchase was made through a friend.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Isabel!</li>
            <li>When I opened it up, it was exactly like the description said it would be.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li>i dont know what exactly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Shea butter before, but my first attempt ( sunscreen) turned out well,</li>
            <li>First time buyer from this vendor</li>
            <li>Quality Product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The shipping is always fast too!</li>
            <li>I made my first batch of body butter with it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty miraculous considering I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a Shea butter expert but this seems pretty legit.</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time ordering shea butter</li>
            <li>I made some cream with essential oils and thought I did ok.  </li>
            <li>product is exactly as stated</li>
            <li>I chose ivory because I read that ivory shea butter is higher quality, which I can&#x27;t confirm.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure of the consistency only because it&#x27;s not what I remember trying years ago.</li>
            <li>, i was sent an e-copy of different recipes and persisted to know whether i was pleased with the product or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Well, since I was younger, duh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this shea butter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user.</li>
            <li>will definitely be making more of the recipes soon.</li>
            <li>These sunscreen bars are so pretty /</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it daily and LOVE it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>High quality Shea!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in Shea butter for a while now and have done quite a bit of reading about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time buyer and user of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this product</li>
            <li>I continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Awesome and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I love this product would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have finally discovered this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>So needless to say I wanted the best Icould use to minimize permanent scaring.</li>
            <li>Will day order more when we run low!</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing Shea Butter I wanted  to try making body lotion</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was packaged exactly how the picture looks.</li>
            <li>I no longer feel the need to but any more face products expect your standard face cleaner.</li>
            <li>Im actually pretty atractive and now that my face has cleared</li>
            <li>and I have a modeling agency interested in me.</li>
            <li>This seller ships exceptionally fast!</li>
            <li>The item itself, in my opinion is first rate.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li>so you aren&#x27;t having to keep it in the bag it was first sealed</li>
            <li>Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right).</li>
            <li>Delivery was timely, and had there been any issues I am confident they would have been handled professionally-i was given several ways to contact them if I had been unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Better than using regular creams.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>But I love the product overall.</li>
            <li>, I emailed them about the different ways I could use the product and they sent the lovely Ebook.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter came in exactly like the seller described it</li>
            <li>and it does make the overall texture better for the use.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li>So many options with different oils and scents.  </li>
            <li>I tried some of my favorite essential oils in hopes to disguise it...</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea butter</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see a free recipe book was included as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for my 1 year old, when it seemed like the coconut oil and lavender lotion I make for his eczema-prone skin was at times drying.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it immensely in even have my boyfriend hooked on it</li>
            <li>The product also came packaged exactly as it said in the description.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She will be ordering more shortly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort, and anyone can do it!  </li>
            <li>I even did an experiment to make sure it was the shea butter making the difference in my acne - it definitely was.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Used it to make lotion with my essential oils :)</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>I no longer buy commercial body moisturizers because that combination is better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time this past weekend to make some lotion bars and really loving this product!</li>
            <li>So MUCH!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing / using shea butter.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it were packaged in some type of solid container.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>my skin actually feels better hours</li>
            <li>First time user of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>I used to mix it with coconut oil first</li>
            <li>I like to ivocry shea a bit better than the yellow since it seems easier to melt and mix and its scent is not quite so overpowering.</li>
            <li>After the first use, her skin was so supple.</li>
            <li>the quality is exactly like the one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter</li>
            <li>With regular use, once every day to two days, my skin is noticeably softer and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite brand of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li>Just received this Shea butter in the mail and used it in my first balm recipe.  </li>
            <li>My Bug Bars did not melt, even in the hot car over summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing shea butter</li>
            <li>Take note that this butter is higher priced because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s not certified organic.  </li>
            <li>I used it already in my first batch ever of Shea body butter.</li>
            <li>and it was remarkably better, and a week or so later it was virtually healed.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Being my first shea butter purchase,I didnt know the difference,NOW I DO.</li>
            <li>Packaging is exactly what&#x27;s needed-</li>
            <li>First...</li>
            <li>First I had to soften the Shea Butter in a blinder</li>
            <li>I have already forwarded the link to my family and friends and I will most definitely be purchasing this Shea Butter again.</li>
            <li>Terrific ebook of recipes to download too:-)</li>
            <li>The absolute highest quality Shea butter I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li>This was my first time.</li>
            <li>But assuming it is packaged like this because most people use it to make a different end use product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for recipies to make a more &#x27;lotion&#x27; like cream that doesn&#x27;t have such a greasy look.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>i made my first batch of homemade lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I am sure I will order again when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li>I used this Shea butter to make my first batch of body butter and lotion bars.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this Shea butter to make body butter</li>
            <li>Used it to make chemical free, safe sunscreen using Young living essential oils!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I recently started purchasing it on amazon because it was more convenient.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it again, it had a funny smell too it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely buy it again!</li>

            <li>I ordered this based on other reviews and I am SO PLEASED!  </li>
            <li>and it was absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li>And i like my cream so much!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>hair looks healthier after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why the scope of &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>The Shea butter arrived exactly as shown in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my first try making a whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>It feels more greasy than regular lotion when you rub in.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Was packaged exactly like in the picture and was also sealed in a plastic ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter goes above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>I am a first time user.</li>
            <li>I got the product within 2 days and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will check in later and write more about the progress with her eczema as the time goes by .</li>
            <li>*not* clog my pores (like most commercial products</li>
            <li>Plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used the unrefined organic butter</li>
            <li>First time to order shea butter</li>
            <li>I am using it in combination with essential oils and it is absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>was my first attempt at making a whipped Shea butter peppermint cream and the results came out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We tried many different lotions and creams, even some recommended by pharmacists.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have used this first.</li>
            <li>So smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I will be using it to replace higher priced products purchased from a specialty store.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li>Its doing what it is supposed to do, only better.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s the consistency of packed brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The end result was exactly what I hoped.</li>
            <li>My first order was in August 2014.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - We love this product and will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and she wants me to make a batch for her!</li>
            <li>Was exactly as promised</li>
            <li>I just made my first whipped shea butter recipe</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>but I most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely  buy again!</li>
            <li>so there was a good amount of product missing.</li>
            <li>It is still in the package, but even through the wrap it smells so good compared with previous pure Shea butter I have used.</li>
            <li>Easily blends into products and is pure and natural.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the Better Shea Butter brand because the size is a bit more reasonable for someone looking to use the products themselves rather than to make other products to sell.</li>
            <li>The package shipped quickly ,weighed, and the product is exactly the high quality i was seeking.</li>
            <li>It is very good for wrinkles as I am told I look 10 years or less younger.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, arrived quickly, in the condition I expected, and has lasted a long time in my homemade EO recipes.  </li>
            <li>Even if some are old, I&#x27;m sure they still have &#x27;new&#x27; on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking into healthier more natural ways to moisturize my skin and being new to all of the options, I appreciate having the recipes.</li>
            <li>It creates such a great barrier on your skin to things that dry it out.</li>
            <li>so it is so easy to keep fresh and use daily.</li>
            <li>If you want an economical, all natural, vegetarian, super luxurious moisterizer this is it.</li>
            <li>I applied some on my skin as soon as I opened the package and upon first impression it smells good (not strong) and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be providing good moisturization for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>Can in a bag as a brick, soft , smells good, works wonders with dry skin</li>
            <li>This butter is VERY rich still but not as greasy and actually after about 15-20 minutes absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive before putting the butter on my face because my face is very sensitive to any facial products, but it liked the shea butter.</li>
            <li>100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter - Best Organic African Grade A Ivory - Pure and Natural for Use on Skin and Hair - Rich in Vitamins A &amp;</li>
            <li>I emailed them with a question and they responded right away and were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>chose this particular brand because of all the positive Amazon reviews that this was a superior product when compared to other shea butters.</li>
            <li>Very fine, so easy to rub on once it&#x27;s small amounts at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit up front that this is my first time using unrefined shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands or sellers, but this shea butter is so amazing I will not be purchasing from anyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made only one body butter so far but plan to make more!</li>
            <li>; - it&#x27;s too good to mess with!</li>
            <li>I opened it right away and scooped some out with my finger and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>is a light green, very, very light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - Keep in mind as much as I praise this product and will most likely buy more in the future.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m well aware that good raw shea butter should have a nutty smell (almost like roasted)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a staple in all my lotions; great for rejuvenating older, dried out skin!</li>
            <li>I ordered this brand for the first time because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>To Make Whipped Body Butter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and fitting a smaller bowl inside.</li>
            <li>Due to allergies, I create my own skin balm</li>
            <li>I make my own creams and other things with it.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, the butter was wrapped in plastic and came inside another bag so my other products didn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>And mixes well with the other oils.it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Allegedly shea is a natural UV inhibitor, which if true is a nice bonus, but I don&#x27;t know what sort of SPF it achieves</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use with some other organic ingredients to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use it, it does have an earthy natural smell...</li>
            <li>Melts nicely, and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li>I have liked the quality compared to other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I am just now getting into making my own lotions and other household items for cleaning etc.</li>
            <li>It melts really nicely when you are combining it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I get excited when I get a new product and tend to use too much, so I took it easier with this</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and I quickly took some and mixed it with coconut oil, and a little olive oil to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li>Makes a very good intense moisture for rough dry skin.</li>
            <li>After using this cocoa butter for a week, My hand and arm started to come back to its original tone!</li>
            <li>This product works great as an everyday moisturizer (I use it every night and every morning, but you may want to let it sit for a while before putting on makeup if you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>This is great Shea Butter, not real odoriferous, can be covered up with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my crazy dry face, on my hands, and I have used it on burns with great results.</li>
            <li>Although the butter was solid, I was able to cut through it easily with a butter knife in order to place the pieces in several containers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and will definitely order again when I need more</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really use it, especially if I&#x27;m going out (when I need it most).</li>
            <li>It blends nicely with anything that I&#x27;ve mixed it with so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li>I spent everyday in the pool and ocean and this was the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I made a salve and used coconut oil that is really smelly:) I will buy this product again definitely!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who wants something that looks and feels more like a commercial lotion, you might want to consider something that has already been whipped and packaged in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This butter is smooth and mixes well with all of my oils and conditioners resulting it a whipped edition that is fluffy and light like whipped cream!</li>
            <li>Not only is this priced really well for the amount you get but the customer service is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Shea butter with coconut oil on my skin for about two weeks now and you can really tell the difference I love it and will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li>They are very customer oriented and I will be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li>Soft enough to make my own skin and hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked it so far and will continue to come back here when I run out.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only made one kind</li>
            <li>Next day feet are relaxed and ready for more miles.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>The recipes that come with this via e-book are also awesome, I am so thankful to find such a high quality product, I will buy only from this seller in future!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It is my first time buying shea butter, and I&#x27;m happy to have it to try various natural recipes, such as lip balm.</li>
            <li>I chose this shea butter because from the pictures it looks really fresh and high quality.</li>
            <li>This is  clearly a high quality Shea butter, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I did a little research on how to treat dry skin naturally and found many great reviews about shea butter.  </li>
            <li>No strong smell at all, just good ol&#x27; Shea butter smell (mild, natural scent).  </li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>When I said I really didnt like it much they apologized and refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li>I received it way before expected, and was able to dowload the receipes right  </li>
            <li>It feels good to know I&#x27;m using one of God&#x27;s pure creations, raw, unrefined, and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick and the information and various recipes provided were very helpful!  </li>
            <li>However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day.  </li>
            <li>However, despite all the positive comments posted here, I have to say that I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to fall into the trap of ignoring the warnings in favor of positive news.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing positive results after one week of use.</li>
            <li>The reviews were positive which is why I ordered the item.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews, I ordered the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>but my experience has been nothing but positive.  </li>
            <li>A positive purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The first time i didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase &amp; will definitely come back when this very generous block of shea is gone!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I have tried other shea butters on amazon, but this one is smooth and melts into a non-gritty smooth oil.</li>
            <li>It blends really well after it&#x27;s softened in a hot water bath.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using straight Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>(more ingredients from Uranus) lotions or creams helped in the long haul nor did they start to HEAL my skin (I was hideous).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shea butter was reasonably priced and I revived exactly was was in the picture.</li>
            <li>For that, I pretty much douse my feet and put on socks before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shea butter came exactly as it was advertised, and all 3 products were packed very well in an Amazon cardboard box, so I had no issues with melting, damage, or anything else.  </li>
            <li>They LOVE it, and it has helped a couple of friends solve minor skin issues they&#x27;ve been battling for years.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it because I am very inspired with the results of my first days of shea butter usage.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell, but either way, it fades within the first hour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product alone or combined with other oils, and it keeps my body butters whipped and creamy, instead of allowing them to melt back into oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered some of their other products as well and expect the same great quality.</li>
            <li>This product is cost effective, because I am saving so much money on other products.</li>
            <li>I received it very promptly and it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thanks  so much!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, soft, and comfortable, and glows like it never has in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first received it, it smelled very smoky.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperoxidase (natural preservative), Jojoba Oil, Vegetable Squalene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Phospholipids (from soy lecithin), Potassium Sorbate, Vitamin A (as Retinyl Palmitate), D-Panthenol, Grapefruit Oil, Lime Oil, Natural Vanilla Extract and Natural Orange-Grapefruit Citrus</li>
            <li>Takes some experimentation with all the other ingredients I&#x27;m using but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The Butter is solid more or less at room temperature, but it melts very easily in your hand without heating.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Raw Shea Butter and the Free Body Butter Recipes eBook.  </li>
            <li>I was going to melt it down and make my own &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - the heck with that, I&#x27;m just using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I just started down the path of making my own lotion bars, needed some shea butter and found this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I am going to try cocoa butter next time to see if that suits my particular desires better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a great and affordable raw Shea butter!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this extraordinary product for its high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It melts so quickly and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>With most lotions my skin will be dry in an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin feels much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Super emollient and soft.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, softens my face, and temporary relieves my back pain.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my hands, and it&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>It was well packed and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fairly quickly and leaves your skin feeling so buttery soft.</li>
            <li>Make sure you store it in a dry place.</li>
            <li>I use this to make lotion and it is easy to use and the packaging is simple.</li>
            <li>The Shae Butter was exactly what I expected, the color the smell, all lovely.</li>
            <li>but it rubs in so easy and lasts through several hand washes.</li>
            <li>It melted quickly and was perfectly clear with no specks of residue in it.</li>
            <li>Plus, the entire bar fits easily inside.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin was super soft and seemed firmer.</li>
            <li>, I have to say that the attention in sending my order quickly, and the follow-up with my order informing me that I could receive a free-download of recipes, was quite unexpected.  </li>
            <li>and he has since been dry patch free!  </li>
            <li>then I put dry jammies over top of the cotton ones.</li>
            <li>I use Shea Butter on from head to toe and it keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>My skin was cracking and peeling, as I have dry skin in the winter that is aggravated even more with the acne medication creams I use.</li>
            <li>The scent is very, very mild and so you could easily add whatever essential oil you would like to and customize the fragrance of your final product.</li>
            <li>However, over the last 2 months, since using my whipped body butter with this shea butter, my skin has consistently felt silky smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin quickly and keeps skin soft.  </li>
            <li>It is solid, yet so creamy and warms up easily in your hands.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter comes in a plastic Ziploc bag that you can continue to use or you can easily remove the butter and store it somewhere different.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily cut into smaller sizes as needed.</li>
            <li>I think it is more moisturizing than coconut oil and has helped with my dry itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product is mild and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>Very decent for the price.  </li>
            <li>I tried melting it, and applying A LOT of essential oils and carrier oils to mask the strong rancid smell, but nope, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>It does have a sort of rubbery/nutty smell which needs a strong fragrance or essential oil to cover it.</li>
            <li>This product willl last a good long while.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell when I open the bag.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way, but because you have to warm it up, you tend to use more.</li>
            <li>Great for melting down and adding essential oils too.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and melted down nicely (with no residue at all) to make the body butter.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance and purchased Better Shea Butter&#x27;s 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter online and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb it through without one single tear from my daughter or myself.</li>
            <li>I have never used pure Shea Butter before</li>
            <li>Comes in large rectangular cube.  </li>
            <li>I have never used pure Shea Butter before...</li>
            <li>It feels like pure Shea butter.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple of times, and will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>So pure and creamy.</li>

            <li>Looks and smells pure.  </li>

            <li>I have certainly found my supplier for Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I just keep the block in a large ziplock and squeeze pull pieces off as needed</li>
            <li>It is pure.</li>
            <li>Pure Fractionated Coconut oil or&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is truly pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>I also have used pure unrefined shea butter on my face before</li>
            <li>Pure.</li>
            <li>Pure, Organic and unrefined just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I placed my order for this after reading many of the other positive reviews, and although I have not yet used the product (I intend too real soon!)</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and the winters are so hash on my skin!!</li>
            <li>I use it by itself and I have also mixed some with lavender oil to calm me after a nice long bath before bed.</li>
            <li>We are a natural chemical free family and this shea butter is now something we cannot live without.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying trying new recipes by mixing in essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and pliable and creates a very creamy product when used in your recipes.  </li>
            <li>depending on the ambient temperature where you live (it&#x27;s about 70 here right now)</li>
            <li>I mixed some olive oil and essential oils with it from a &amp;#34;recipe book&amp;#34; and it turned out fabulous!!</li>
            <li>Love the texture of the bars and the fact that there are only all natural ingredients in my bars!</li>
            <li>Also works just fine by itself as facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(I was worried my hair would be greasy afterward or that I would have to shampoo multiple times but it was fine.</li>
            <li>I already &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; up a body cream using avocado oil and lavender and can not emphasize how much better my dry skin feels!</li>

            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m still going to use it because it works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product from the seller.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like how much product it comes with.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a cream to moisturize my face and for the longest time did not have much luck.  </li>
            <li>I did use some shea butter on my husband&#x27;s knuckles which is very close to psoriasis and his knuckles have improved so much.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li>i would buy it again and really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really delivers.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to mix it up into whipped butter</li>
            <li>I applied the butter as direction; It really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks you.</li>
            <li>This butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>I plan to test some competitors before committing to paying this much.  </li>
            <li>I even used a whole bottle of 100% lemon oil and it still smelled.</li>
            <li>It had a much stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>Used essential oils to give it some scent &amp; it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Hahahaha when you Step out ..</li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>Once I opened it, ready to use, the smell was not the nutty aroma that I am use to, it had a rancid smell.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my 60</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and gently melted the shea butter.</li>
            <li>I think that really is just something I&#x27;ll need to get used to and adjust my recipes</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and was just as described.  </li>
            <li>the smell of this isn&#x27;t very pleasing either, but if it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s for people with intense skin issues, because it is /extremely/ moisturizing and oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this company and the product.</li>
            <li>but it is so much easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need to with this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I believe this company would be very helpful.</li>
            <li>It went the length of the whole block</li>
            <li>I bought it for making lip balms, but I&#x27;ve ended up just using it straight on my skin because it feels luxurious.</li>
            <li>It came very well packaged just as shown in the picture - the shea butter is in sealed plastic within another bag that zip locks.  </li>
            <li>The color and texture of the entire block is uniform and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first product where I see and feel a great difference in skin texture after using it (and it&#x27;s only been a few days!).</li>
            <li>emails were very helpful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, I find myself just pinching off a piece, warming it in my hands and using it straight from the container.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>The seller really cares about quality, and it shows.</li>
            <li>Very absorbant into the skin.</li>
            <li>It was very grainy and crumbly.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li>It does cost a bit more than others, but not much</li>
            <li>I really appreciate companies that take the time to ask customers about their opinions.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and healing.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it came well-sealed in a foil, re-sealable bag, soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Customer service really made up for the product failure.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be much</li>
            <li>Thanks to a friend who told me ab it.out</li>
            <li>reasonable price for quality product</li>
            <li>Being that Shea butter is naturally oily, this Ivory Shea has still left my skin oily from time to time, but I mostly blame that on myself for applying too much, or even not applying it evenly on my face.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though if you wanted to just use it for lotion straight out of the package, the packaging wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue.</li>
            <li>really impresses me is the customer service.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, she was very helpful</li>
            <li>My somewhat finicky kinky/curly/wavy hair drinks it up and shea butter keeps it very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>With this shea butter the end product was very calming to my skin and the feel is much softer.</li>
            <li>So much shea butter for the price.</li>
            <li>Very decadent</li>
            <li>however its very coating (I don&#x27;t want to say waxy, because it&#x27;s not that</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I received this shea butter the very next day after it had shipped, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped reduce how much my scar stands out.</li>
            <li>and that was after cleaning and having to really wash my hands.</li>
            <li>We use it at night mostly, I put a generous amount of shea butter all over my daughter, then put wet cotton scratch</li>
            <li>This really helps the shea butter to fully absorb into her skin.</li>
            <li>this product has been the only thing that works for me (keeping breakouts away, skin smooth and well nourished)</li>
            <li>The lotions absorb very well into my skin and have left it feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>The seller also reached out to me about my purchase, which was appreciated.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the 100% real stuff</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It really helps my dryness.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for a friend going through chemo as well.</li>
            <li>Way too much.</li>
            <li>It has performed very well</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have ordered twice.</li>
            <li>The scent is very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying the shea butter + jojoba oil (purchased from whole foods)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve heard and read that it can really help.</li>
            <li>After much reading and reviewing I decided to give it a go and ordered some.</li>
            <li>trying see if it really helps with acne on face.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Sweetest people as well and really care about their customers.</li>
            <li>I promise your skin will look very radiant</li>
            <li>it gets my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li>but the smell overpowered my whole recipe.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and really works.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Keeps me very mousturized.</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin much easier this way, too.  </li>
            <li>It is packaged very well and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, I would recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>they actually emailed to remind me of the free recipe e-book that comes with the purchase of this butter</li>
            <li>Really we&#x27;ll packed to protect freshness and prevent damage.</li>
            <li>I received my order very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>This has helped my skin out so much.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about Shea butter</li>
            <li>Definitely real Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>A one pound bag will carry my family through the whole winter.</li>
            <li>You can just tell by the light color and sometimes gritty texture (until you heat it in your hands).</li>
            <li>it can be used on your skin straight up as a lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Better than expected since it was Christmas eve.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>thanks again for the fast service.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use it straight on my skin after a shower.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Very luscious piece of shea butter.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter melts smoothly and incorporated well with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to have worked very well for making the body products I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a very helpful download to help you get started making creams to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>She is very responsive and helpful.  </li>
            <li>And I must agree that is is very creamy to the touch.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well (not in a plastic tub thank goodness) and very neatly done.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the product considering it was SO much cheaper than the organic Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It goes on skin very well.</li>
            <li>Always arrives fast too.</li>
            <li>And the butter seems to just soak up into your skin so fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He loves it so much that even takes it with him on overnight visits with his friends.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Product is well packaged and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>The sellers are really responsive to questions or emails.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, I&#x27;m not like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>thank you for this high quality product!</li>
            <li>Have used it on my heels that were very dry/cracked and what a difference.  </li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your speedy response and delivery.</li>
            <li>It is oily but absorbs fast</li>
            <li>its texture is much smoother and softer</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay a fortune for products that are 1% shea when you can get 100% shea at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>One final note, the vendor also provides a free shea butter recipe booklet....</li>
            <li>I have used Shea Butter from various sources for years primarily on my hands...</li>
            <li>This is the only shea butter I feel comfortable putting on my face, and I do believe the seller&#x27;s claim that it is non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packaged.</li>
            <li>In an uncharacteristic fit of excess I sprang for this one instead and ohhhh my gods above and below, it&#x27;s heavenly.</li>
            <li>you want a high quality Unrefined Organic Shea Butter, this is the one to buy!  </li>
            <li>but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li>Works really well in my lotion recipe or by itself.</li>
            <li>but this is a sign that it is a real one not processed.  </li>
            <li>Very neatly packaged, not messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After, skin is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my face has a very shiny look.  </li>
            <li>I had a crease on my cheek that was really bothersome to me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It helped me make a fantastic batch of chapsticks and will be going in my deodorant project next!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really describe the scene</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter worked very well, and I have plans on ordering from this supplier again when I run out.  </li>
            <li>It came packaged very well</li>
            <li>Buttery, non-greasy, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very please customer</li>
            <li>Packaged simply, but wrapped securely.</li>
            <li>Also, they followed up soon after to check on my level of satisfaction, appreciated that.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I am ready to make lotions, sunscreeen and balm now.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling fantastic</li>
            <li>which is why I don&#x27;t have to apply too much of it to get my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>This isnt the real shea butter that comes from my homeland, but it works for the time being.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the body butter e-book included.</li>
            <li>I already had which makes the shea butter go on smoother plus really hydrates.</li>
            <li>and it stayed very moist as it drys</li>
            <li>I did not need a detangler , I have very course hair after I put it on</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and each and every time I apply a cream/moisturizer to my face, I&#x27;d break out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this shea butter.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It works really well to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and just what my skin needed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, well packed and comes with a recipe book you can download.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>When I used it I didn&#x27;t notice it much, but I did notice it when my wife used it.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m feeling very optimistic about it.</li>
            <li>Google shea butter deodorant recipes and get yourself off the fast track to diseases caused by store-bought</li>
            <li>I really like this shea butter,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really help.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Mixed with some organic bees wax and coconut oil, it makes a killer petroleum free pomade.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>And the seller was very helpful.</li>
            <li>The book is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Very granular.</li>
            <li>This product went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>It melted smoothly and evenly in a double boiler.</li>
            <li>I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was also having problems with psoriasis, and putting this Shea butter on has made my skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>Very greasy going on (night time)</li>
            <li>but I will absolutely reorder from this vendor when I run out.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and spent alot of money to try to heal her skin.  </li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, I will be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny, my hands and face are deeply moisturized and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I made a nice whipped shea butter with it and use everyday on my hair, skin, and even as a diaper cream butter for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it mixed with extra virgin coconut oil and olive oil to make a nice whipped skin butter</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Love it, natural with multiple properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put mine in a tin (like Altoids) and let it sit in the sun for a few minutes to warm up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a few lotions with this so far and have loved the results.</li>
            <li>My skin is much better - soft and moisturized and I apply only every 2 day!</li>
            <li>The best dark spot ever it doesn&#x27;t reduce dark spot but remove completely all you need its patience because it takes time.</li>
            <li>I melt it to make my own facial night moisturizer adding essential oils to it.  </li>
            <li>I started making my own lotions and shaving creams and will never go back to using commercial moisturizers/shaving creams again.</li>
            <li>I have had a few questions about recipes and have gotten prompt, thorough, courteous responses every-time.</li>
            <li>This is such a soft shea butter, much better than what I have purchased elsewhere before.  </li>
            <li>Much better than anything I have bought at the stores, my skin feels soft and supple after using it, this definitely a daily thing I will use and I will continue ordering this when I run out.</li>
            <li>First use was smooth and super moisturizing but after it &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a bit it was a little grainy - could&#x27;ve been from the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It does smell buttery as true Shea Butter and feels soft and not hard like a brick.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>shea butter has a very smooth texture, but I found it to be a bit crumblier than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is such a high quality product and I will definitely be buying again when I need more!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>wow !!!</li>
            <li>The recipes all look worth a try, but for now I&#x27;m so enjoying the plain Shea butter that I&#x27;m a purist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m much happier using something natural like this Shea Butter, or mixing it with a few other ingredients to create a wonderful &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is creamy and looks very fresh, and unrefined is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>other reviewers say the seller is super friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li>it is soft and usable right from the package.  </li>
            <li>It is soft right out of the package.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known how easy it was to mix a long time ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to try several of them - lip balm, intense moisturizer, shave cream, mask...</li>
            <li>It turned out great, very creamy, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was very soft and no sign of dryness after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this particular one because it was a similar price of another I was considering, except that I would save with free shipping.</li>
            <li>The yellow butter is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>After I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair conditioner recipe with some other oils, it looked better.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make homemade body butter and it turned out better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>To use it, I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product was way better than I even expected!</li>
            <li>The seller has also been in contact with me about the product, and about whether or not the e-book downloaded properly, which I am not sure of because I lost the cute card the link came on. :-)</li>
            <li>The other ones were grainy and this is buttery smooth!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering from Better Shea Butter, and it will likely not be the last.</li>
            <li>Now when I put a lot more on my sons eczema spots and at first it was a little oily</li>
            <li>Much better than any other shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so Im susceptible to infection more so than other people.</li>
            <li>(  I first ordered the Better Shea Butter &amp;#34;100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter - African Grade A Ivory&amp;#34; back in Feb 2015.  </li>
            <li>When I received the package, I was excited to open it and begin using it.</li>
            <li>In only 2 days I could tell a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I love adding it in lotions, shampoos and other hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>Its smoother and more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love this Shea and all their other products they offer.</li>
            <li>I love that it mixes well with my other oils</li>
            <li>I use just a small amount on my face each day and my skin is looking so much better!</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell you this is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This worked on the skin better than all the other medicated creams that we tried...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I spent a little bit more for a pure product I could trust</li>
            <li>I never had raw shea butter before and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I use raw unrefined shea butter to make my own whipped shea butter cream, which I use for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I make my own body butter with raw shea butter and oils.</li>
            <li>I really liked that this product was raw, unrefined and organic.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it for too long yet, but so far it works better than any cream</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use for my natural african american hair, i love it and will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, too, keeping my skin soft most of the day.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the way the Shea is packaged-plastic wrapped carefully to keep it super fresh and then in a manilla padded envelope.</li>
            <li>Great, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The butter was clean, solid and smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Left him with a clean shaved  and moisturized face.</li>
            <li>I started making my own organic body butter and the smell of the shea butter is so strong that although my body butter turned out good the smell is awful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 although I bought in mainly for the scars on my feet, I&#x27;m using it on my forearms to help with old scaring from playing with my cat and miscellaneous other scars, I&#x27;m also using it for my skin care on my face, the two products have made remarkable difference and is really working well on a wrinkle line and lines I had been getting on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, but shea butter, in combination with a few other products, helps keep her hair happy and healthy.</li>
            <li>I melt it down a little..personal preference but good overall.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve read some other reviews that say the older the more rancid it will smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as high of a quality as i was expecting for paying as much as i did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I will absolutely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>It was shipped promptly, arrived exactly as pictured (small brown bag with the Shea in it), and the actual butter itself is of great quality (as far as I can tell,</li>
            <li>The product came fast and is a high quality.</li>
            <li>My skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been since I&#x27;ve been using raw shea buttter soap to wash head to toe, grapeseed oil to moisturize, and this raw shea butter to seal in the moisture and add the softest texture to my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many Shea butters from different web sites and this one is definitely not 100% pure.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and leaves my skin soft!!</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter itself is soft enough to scoop out easily with a spoon, even a plastic one</li>
            <li>It is gentle, smells slightly nutty and makes my face feel and look much better.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this company enough for their super high quality shea!</li>
            <li>I really like the packaging that the product comes in and that it&#x27;s double bagged so everything isn&#x27;t super greasy from the shea.</li>
            <li>Works for great for extreme dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the Raw Shea Butter many times and this Raw Shea Butter is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  </li>
            <li>Most likely since it is raw &amp; organic, it is a tad grainy, and it has a fairly strong scent, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>new to using  pure shea butter  (trying to phase out chemically lotions in my life.)  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints whatsoever and will be a continued customer for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Beats the cheap store brands by a long shot</li>
            <li>I leaves the moist skin smooth long after application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this short, sweet and to the point.  </li>
            <li>I decided to take the natural route first</li>
            <li>my first time using Shea butter and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>So after some research on Shea Butter, the white Shea is true Shea.</li>
            <li>The yellow is actually from a completely different tree, but it&#x27;s still good stuff.</li>
            <li>The product also comes with an ebook that tells you what the various ways to use it which is cool.</li>
            <li>Second time I get this butter, because my mom pretty much stole the first one.</li>
            <li>i received a nice letter, I&#x27;m not sure if it was automatic</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve already used it to make a jar of whipped shea with coconut oil, jojoba oil (to increase the shelf life) and sweet orange essential oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin even better than the yellow and this brand better than the other white butter</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly and then add to cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture along with remaining jojoba/almond/olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;Place mixture in chilled bowl (which should still be resting above the ice bowl) and allow to cool for 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to deal with a small company that seems to care about their customers after the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I add 2 tsp of this to my deep conditioner, leave on with heat for 30 mins and then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how well the product holds up on its own.</li>
            <li>When partially cool, add 1 part extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vegetable glycerin and essential oils in my recipe.</li>
            <li>I had never used Shea butter, the first one I ordered was very grainy and it only works if I melted it first.</li>
            <li>and it was kind of like a hair pomade consistency because it melted but didn&#x27;t disappear or melt completely into an oily mess.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my raw unrefined shea butter!!!</li>
            <li>Raw is the way to go for sure, it gives me soft skin in 1/2 the time of the white, refined shea butters you find in most stores.</li>
            <li>I mixed in the raw Shea butter with olive oil and almond together and my hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li>Fresh, easy to use, no added additives just plain Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Without going into all the details, I was able to put down my RX cream that I have been using for a year.</li>
            <li>This shea leaves my hair so soft and shiny and not limp at all for DAYS!!!!</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is very creamy and easy to whip, the smell is nice and not stale - I had found that problem with other butters in the past and I am always nervous to open up a new package, but this shea butter smells fresh and sort of nutty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large amount, I&#x27;m sure I could use it for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t finish it.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about it was the smell - it has a strong smell, almost like wet clay or plaster in an old house.  </li>
            <li>this butter good but not as expected as it would soften and smoothen my skin ( I have normal to dry)</li>
            <li>Once it was cool, I whipped the Shea butter with a little coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and argon oil.</li>
            <li>Live this brand!</li>
            <li>I live by this product !  </li>
            <li>AND I live in Guam, so thank you for that!  </li>
            <li>I learn a new way to use it all the time!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Live this shea butter!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can make with this new shipment!</li>
            <li>, however I used a small amount on the back of my hand to feel it out and make sure my sensitive skin was ok with.</li>
            <li>Seemed really pure and natural to me!</li>
            <li>This shea butter gets absorbed quickly and does not leave that sticky feel as much other ones.</li>
            <li>As a first time user and an African American male with a complextion like Meagan Good that had issue with acne scars major hyperpigmentation blemishes and sum damage</li>
            <li>i really appreciated this and would recommend this company to anyone who is new to using shea butter.</li>
            <li>While I am new to straight shea butter</li>
            <li>As far as this product excuse me this amazing creation I have enjoyed how my skin has felt , no more itching!</li>
            <li>Trying to hydrate the skin enough that it isn&#x27;t so itchy so that the rashes have a chance to diminish is a process, however the fact I have a product I can now apply with no crying or discomfort whatsoever is huge.</li>
            <li>Previous brand had many pieces of debris throughout, so after it melted</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is used as a healthful product to smooth and hydrate dry and irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>And my dry skin was now moist and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>but this is even better that the stuff I had had previously.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a moisturizer that is toxic free but feeds my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, kudos for the quick ship.</li>
            <li>I have been able to whip it with essential oils for facial moisturizers and hand creams.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than all the money you spend on more expensive stuff that lasts a quarter of the time.</li>
            <li>Even when I wrote her back (3-4 times I think), she answered quickly.</li>
            <li>I need to use more essential oil next time</li>
            <li>use it as a moisturizer when my skin is particularly needy.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Once I explore more, I&#x27;m sure ill give 5 stars...</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this particular shea butter after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>It takes minimal effort to warm it up well enough to apply.</li>
            <li>I refuse to waste good essential oil just trying to mask the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I will use it with many essential oils for various uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>We process all of them the same way, and even if some look more grainy, we sell them because the end result is, in our opinion, the same.</li>
            <li>This last batch seems even more creamy than the last.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for lightening some scars that I have</li>
            <li>the only downside is I wish I was able to buy larger quantity in bulk-</li>
            <li>Such an outstanding moisturizer in every way possible.</li>
            <li>This was the main ingredient in a homemade lotion</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more of this shea butter for future recipes.</li>
            <li>My favorite is a facial cream recipe that I use and it definitely has messed wrinkles and dryness.</li>
            <li>I love Shea Butter and have ordered from several different sites over the years, but I will never from them again!  </li>
            <li>(  I tried this mixture and was pleased to see after several months it did start to diminish my deep marks.  </li>
            <li>I love that my bar came marbleized with yellow &amp; white shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I am just using it to make soap mainly.</li>
            <li>This product was soft, smooth only had a lite plsasent smell.</li>
            <li>The only way I was able to relieve the dryness has been constant application of oils and moisturizer and to limit handwashing and wearing rubber gloves.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff particularly because you can keep it in the resealable bag</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing although a bit gritty.</li>
            <li>i used this shea butter as a main component</li>
            <li>I go back and rub it in because my body warms it quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in such a simple package.</li>
            <li>but this is a must have if you have very dry skin or just want a long lasting moisturizer for a great price.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use, use a little or use the whole chunk for a large batch, the choice is yours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my dry skin (mainly my hands and elbows which get very dry during the winter/Spring) and it&#x27;s so much more effective than other lotions.</li>
            <li>that hardly ever happens, right :-).  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent and has made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really creamy and keeps my natural 3C hair moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft, and works well in sunblock too!</li>
            <li>I am very interested in looking for the recipes on the Ebook because I like to make my familys personal care products.</li>
            <li>It was a whole week early!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant to me, however I suppose that can be a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought a very large plastic container to put the she butter in it, with raw unrefined organic coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, aura cacia tea tree oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oils and mix it in my blender until it was nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>I received my package right on time in a very neat simple packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had desperately dry skin for years and nothing much has helped except an ammonium lactate lotion that I realized is full of undesireable chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It took me a few days to get used to the smell (not offensive, just pretty strong and unfamiliar), but I&#x27;ve adjusted over the course of a week and now use shea butter on my hair, face, and body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I can easily get at least ten more body butters and deodorant sticks out of this,</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but this is by far my favorite company</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try some of your other products, like the rose hip oil and lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more in the very near future.  </li>
            <li>I am completely awestruck at the change in my skin since I began using pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I have used raw shea butter before and loved it, could  not find it locally until I checked Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I received the raw shea butter yesterday and used it last night , I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good 100% raw organic shea butter, i would definitely recommend you to get this one</li>
            <li>I finally made my first batch of lotion!</li>
            <li>The product arrived a little melted but that is okay</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!!</li>
            <li>There are also many other similar competing products that are not atrociously expensive.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to have the consistency of something along the lines of play dough but a little bit softer and those two things is what I found when I ordered my butter from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It actually looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping with the super dry conditions here in Texas.</li>
            <li>Lately I have used this particular brand/source and bottled my own to share with family and friends...</li>
            <li>Shea butter melt easily using double boiler, and later on when it becomes cream, the mix of Shea butter and coconut extra virgin oil that I made can easily glide on my skin &amp; not grainy as long as you heat it right using double boiler until it melt right.</li>
            <li>I have used one other shea butter, also a high quality raw organic, and am very pleased with this brand!  </li>
            <li>So far my child with the more mild eczema has shown such improvement, the little dry patches are visible but I can&#x27;t feel them anymore, which is huge progress.</li>
            <li>But when I used it I found it easy to cut, melt and mix with other oils.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to work with compared to the other brands.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter mixes easily with other oils.</li>
            <li>Pliable and easy to use as a skin conditioner or melt with other ingredients to make homemade lotion bars.</li>
            <li>I thought making my own lotions would be too hard to do, and didn&#x27;t think I had the time...</li>
            <li>I think the high quality of the shea butter was a big factor in the the success of this sunscreen recipe.</li>
            <li>So far with now much luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to make a natural deodorant which really works.</li>
            <li>BTW I am using this for a deodorant recipe and so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li>I really like it one thing that it does that I was surprised about it</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>The product was smooth was no grainy or rough texture.  </li>
            <li>Well so far I&#x27;m using it straight out of the packaging ... for myself.</li>
            <li>So far it is working really well</li>
            <li>They gave a free booklet with lots of recipes to print out, followed up to see if the product was what I expected</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now and the shea butter cream really helps seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my chemical sensitive daughter, and the whole family ended up using it.</li>
            <li>So far, everyone loves it almost as much as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the testing process, but so far I really like.</li>
            <li>also whipped with Argan oil for my daughter&#x27;s hair , it makes it soft and straight with no even greasiness .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very organic and natural, you can tell by the smell.</li>
            <li>I am happy as I don&#x27;t have to expensive skin care products.</li>
            <li>I use it straight on my hands like lotion after washing them, it hydrates, is soft, and not sticky (after it soaks in a bit).  </li>
            <li>No over powering smell, very moist and soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is normal, but I didn&#x27;t like working with it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Shea Butter&#x27;s scent was a bit powerful</li>
            <li>With body butters I will get a few more hours.</li>
            <li>It does have a stronger smell, normal for Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is normal?</li>
            <li>Gave this company a few more stars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if all shea butters normally do though.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is more grey than yellow.  </li>
            <li>consistent, unfortunately real unrefined shea butter comes with a price, which is getting different batches depending on the harvest.</li>
            <li>My shipments always arrive within a few days and it is always top quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and I have to say that this is the only I&#x27;ve found thus far that rehydrates your skin and does not break you out.</li>
            <li>so the consistency would turn out more firm at the end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on myself a few times as well and love it.</li>
            <li>You can use it to make body butter, lip balm, salves, conditioner, and scrubs and more so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li>I liked that it came in a thick plastic bag that I could heat up</li>
            <li>butter was very well package, melts quickly, absorbs very good on skin however, the smell is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m new to the shea butter party, but it feels like high quality shea butter (comparing it to shea butter from Sprouts).</li>
            <li>I have also melted it down and used in a few of my body lotions this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and am looking forward to using a pure and natural product on my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  off white color and the texture of playdough, made it very easy to work with and add other products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic body butter for very dry skin in the colder months!</li>
            <li>I send the Better Shea Butter an email, if they could send me the link, I got the link in less then 24h!</li>
            <li>unlike others, it is not hard to scoop out desired amount.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this particular shea butter is that it needs little preparation and goes so smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li>but as it is handled or manipulated it morphs into a somewhat soft and at times liquid or oily form&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a super moisturizer/treatment for eczema without preservatives and found several recipes.</li>
            <li>Lasts and lasts, nice for just out of the shower or to mix with my African black soap.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is creamy and nice but it is way less than my last order.</li>
            <li>I needed something more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; than what I&#x27;ve been using for regular dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and the skin underneath is completely healed but he still has dry dead skin on top which I lightly rub off with a very soft wash cloth after his bath.</li>
            <li>I plan to gather a bunch of natural plant oils and mix them in with a few other things to see if I can get a really great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>We use a very small amount on our very curly hair and it leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Everything was still entirely useable, the grains dissolve and absorb right in, but the texture wasn&#x27;t as divine.</li>
            <li>I am a truck driver, and driving on the road for hours, my left arm and hand gets darker than my right arm and hand.</li>
            <li>I use it right before going to bed and in the morning I can tell a big difference.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found the right combinations and strength of essential oils to use that will cover the Shea smell.</li>
            <li>I keep it in a cool dry place in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>Seems to heal minor scrapes and insect bites quickly.  </li>
            <li>stuff is an ingredient in many, if not most of the quality moisturizers on the market, and I&#x27;m starting to think that there are only a few key ingredients in moisturizers that really do anything and could work just fine on their own, but moisturizers blend in a bunch of filler ingredients to make it easier to use and save on cost.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and smells exactly like any other ivory African shea butter I bought.</li>
            <li>butter doesn&#x27;t take too long to melt and smells natural and clean.</li>
            <li>so it weighs down easily.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but after adding some essential oils, it is fine.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using raw shea butter, but the way it absorbs into my skin, moisturizes and softens is superior to any type of oil/butter/lotion I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>very dry, sensitive skin and this butter goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and provides all day moisture.</li>
            <li>It was very soft and the scent was not strong or overwhelming at all like others have said.</li>
            <li>It also came with a free download with other recipes.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m normally extremely, well, cheap, with the ingredients I buy for my beauty product projects.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was combining it with cocoa butter and coconut oil to make whipped body butter, so the smell was masked by the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and not grainy like some other oils when it is applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>At first the smell seems odd, it&#x27;s kind of earthy, different from the synthetic scents you find in commercial products.</li>
            <li>I am new at using shea butter</li>
            <li>It is my new go to when m wholesaler is out.</li>
            <li>It may be my recipe that is the problem and haven&#x27;t tried a new one yet.  </li>
            <li>I live</li>
            <li>Looking forward to new recipes...</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I live in the States in the Midwest</li>
            <li>this is a new must have in my household.</li>
            <li>I have found my new go to place to order Shea butter.</li>
            <li>But I just put in a new plastic bag</li>
            <li>I live in California</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is getting colder where I live, so the shea does take a bit of working with, whether it be the brick or the face cream that I made, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li>This is our families new miracle cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at DIY moisturizers</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new to Shea butter</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic resealable bag, says it&#x27;s new packaging, I don&#x27;t know what it use to come in.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and my skin was suffering.</li>
            <li>The process of making it is naturally unpredictable and sometimes you will get a batch not as good as the other</li>
            <li>I loved the product entirely, except for it&#x27;s crumbly texture-- hard to use as is, except by picking up a crumb of it.  </li>
            <li>The butter is not as hard as I was expecting, which makes it very easy to take some off and melt in my hands while spreading it.  </li>
            <li>This is raw or unrefined shea butter which is better to make homemade body butter.</li>
            <li>And I love that the product is raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it raw, it does not melt easily as many have stated it does.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, just use the shea butter raw.</li>
            <li>both love the fact that this product is unrefined, raw and organic.</li>
            <li>this raw shea butter has diminished fine lines and dark spots better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The raw shea butter is great for really dry skin, and as a natural lip balm, because it&#x27;s more solid and less oily than if you whip it.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve been a huge Shea butter fan for years) for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>I go to bed with it on my face and wake up with such amazingly smooth skin the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t as smooth (feels like sand is in it) as the last time I made it but as soon as I put it on my skin it melted instantly so no worries!</li>
            <li>If you are making your own beauty products or sunscreen a few drops of essential oil will take care of it.</li>
            <li>I expect this batch to last a while, but I can&#x27;t go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I made my own shea body butter from this stuff, added a few essential oils and it was LUXURIOUS.  </li>
            <li>Finally, after watching a few Youtube videos I decided I would attempt to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li>company contacted me (not in an annoying way) to make sure that my customer experience was a good one.</li>
            <li>The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected it is such a rich product</li>
            <li>This shea butter smells pretty much like other shea butter, with the hint of nutty scent which I like, but my family didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>Made some lotion bars today with it today and it melted down just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and malleable like playdoh.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and buying lotion has always been a challenge for me.</li>
            <li>I like it, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>If your skin/hair type doesn&#x27;t absorb well, or you have very sensitive skin/hair, or skin/hair</li>
            <li>If your skin/hair type doesn&#x27;t absorb well, or you have very sensitive skin/hair, or skin/hair</li>
            <li>I use if for my toddler he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was very soft and not brick like some butters.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin, leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Very natural scent and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>My son is very, very sensitive to smells and he well tolerated it and was used to it after 3 applications.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Every night after a bath I slather it on after melting it in my hands and it has kept my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>found it very soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>It does keep my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, eczema and this works wonders.</li>
            <li>I may use a little more next time to have more lotion and less oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first and only experience with raw shea butter, but I already came back for more!  </li>
            <li>right mow, this chunk-o-butter arrived only soft, not melted though it had been on a carrier vehicle all day.</li>
            <li>Its thick but rubs into the skin pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It has a mild shea butter smell, (barely discernible), but if you don&#x27;t like the smell you could alway add an essential oil of your choice.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no negative reaction so far.  </li>
            <li>In about10 minutes, unless you used too much, it absorbs into the skin, leaving behind a slight sheen that is more matte than many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wild about the results!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used my body cream I made from this on my hair, my face, my body, my scalp and as a makeup remover!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>many small batches.</li>
            <li>The second order was nothing like the first.</li>
            <li>i could contact her directly if i had any questions or concerns!</li>
            <li>I added more drops than usual because the smell of this shea butter was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This butter is is completely smooth, and soft enough to mix in essential oil by hand.</li>
            <li>Its my first time ordering this specific brand and from this seller</li>
            <li>, so we have to essentially scrub the sink after shaving, but other than that it is really better than any store bought shaving cream</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>At last REAL Unrefined Organic Shea Butter!</li>
            <li>like I said, this is exactly what I want when making a basic whipped shea butter lotion for myself.</li>
            <li>and I have WICKED sensitive skin where EVERYTHING breaks me out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much better than what I&#x27;ve seen in local stores, which mainly only sell the yellow shea butter.</li>
            <li>I started using this shea butter and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I have been using shea butter on my skin consistently for 2 months now and see a big improvement!</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars based on my first order of this product back in Feb 2015.  </li>
            <li>I was going to write a review after finishing the first pack but then thought perhaps I should wait to see how my second experience is with this product.</li>
            <li>First off, the re-order product was not in a ziplock, but rather in a regular plastic that when opened could NOT be resealed.</li>
            <li>and wow!  </li>
            <li>so this was my first purchase in several months.</li>
            <li>Better Shea butter is not gritty like some other brands.</li>
            <li>Afterall, it&#x27;s natural and should come with some smell!  </li>
            <li>chunk of shea butter is pretty big</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a jar or something to store small amounts of shea, then just refill the jar as needed.</li>
            <li>I put the lotions on in the morning and my skin stays soft all day!</li>
            <li>I will usually not add any fragance, because of allergies, but I will probably try some of the butter recipes that are on the website.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty terrific too!)</li>
            <li>I like this much better than the heavier shea butter I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Feels gritty at first</li>
            <li>This is the first and only time I have purchased shea butter.</li>
            <li>The legs shined only for the first 20 minutes, then the gloss was gone and the skin felt velvety to the touch.</li>
            <li>was surprised at the smell, but I think that&#x27;s normal for shea butter.</li>
            <li>After my quest to search for a natural remedy and using all the organic/natural products that exist out there for eczema; I must say that this shea butter is a MIRACLE!</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Earlier this year, I started making my own skin lotion (for personal use) to combat skin dryness triggered by a rough winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on this!  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I purchased this only to find my mom using it all, haha!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I purchased a mango shea butter from a local store in my area and its more costly and the container is smaller but its the only thing that seems to work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare the Shea butter to anything else, since it&#x27;s my first purchase, but I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li>DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks!</li>
            <li>Even though I’ve only ordered twice now, the quality is consistent and high, which is valuable to me since I&#x27;ve spent the monay before and received low quality that is grainy and doesn&#x27;t melt easily in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While it is a little greasy, when it is applied to the skin it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit strong</li>
            <li>We recently moved to CO and needed a product that was safe for the entire family, natural, and very moisturizing for a dry climate.</li>
            <li>I have developed super dry cracking skin on my hands and spots on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It is a bit crumbly when raw, but blends perfectly when I melt it down with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is clean, w/o any foreign substances in it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to make a body butter that included coconut oil and almond oil, which I really like since the shea is kinda stiff and the oils are, well, oily.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted their Shea Butter beacause of the E-book and obviously the high rattings of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I like it very much, using it every day and my skin is soft, the only thing is on the package</li>
            <li>In less than 2 weeks, his skin is smooth, soft and the blemishes are clearing up!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and crumbly as opposed to a solid mass, but works just as well, maybe even better than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>Honestly wish It came in a larger amount and would last longer without mixing it with other products but without a doubt, I will be purchasing from this vendor from now on ☺️</li>
            <li>I always have problems with new skin care products, and have been trying to go natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oddly, at the bottom of the label, it also says &#x27;New&#x27; is if they expect some batches to be old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wild about the smell, but, I&#x27;m still expirementing with adding the right amount of oils to lessen the Shea smell.</li>
            <li>only downside is that is very oily and sticky, which makes the shaving very smooth but the clean up is a bit difficult.  </li>
            <li>I used the Shea Butter 3 different ways this past weekend and the result for all 3 ways was amazing.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic inside of a brown paper zip lock bag to help keep fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>I cut it in half and used double boiler to melt the shea butter with other oils and coconut oil to make wonderful lotion that is 75% shea and 25% other oil.</li>
            <li>I more or less coped with it over the past couple years, but I finally decided to buy this Ivory Shea to change it up a bit, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective this will be, le you know later.  </li>
            <li>I have even strarted to put a small amount into my all natural  homemade deodorant (just for moisturizing purposes) and it feels lovely.</li>
            <li>( hint 6 pack pick your own usually comes out cheaper than singles) back to this shea though..  </li>
            <li>Raw, clean, very high quality.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on trying some of Better Shea Butter&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it gets hard and crumbly and does not go on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have never had such a positive experience with a company before in all my experiences.</li>
            <li>After opening I thought it had a strong odd smell, not the nutty smell as expected and a more grayish color than expected.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve had to really work with the shea butters to get them to a consistency that could be applied directly and smoothly to my skin without clumping.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble with the natural smell though!</li>
            <li>which other true shea butters I&#x27;ve used do not do.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to buy twice the amount of shea butter for the same price with the previous brand I used.</li>
            <li>I had a several questions and the seller emailed back quickly each time.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned to use smaller portions and not half a block at a time and also to look at website before doing anything rather than looking at YouTube videos first.</li>
            <li>its taken me a long time to find such a premier, unadulterated shea butter experience at such an incredibly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 26 years old, so my body went through menopause at a very early age.  </li>
            <li>My hair is too fine to withstand heavy oils and butters</li>
            <li>My hair is too fine to withstand heavy oils and butters</li>
            <li>This will last me a long time, so I&#x27;m excited about that.</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that when I added my oils to it, such as wintergreen or citrus, the shea butter scent was strong and overpowered the essential oil scent a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, not bad or strong, but not really like anything I have smelled.</li>
            <li>So a little less than a week went by and I started to see that the skin underneath his dry eczema skin was healing beautifully.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter looked white and pure.</li>
            <li>So pure and smoothe when I blended it with essential oils and jojoba oil for face</li>
            <li>This might sound like an infomercial but in that little as a week of rubbing my feet with this cocoa butter</li>
            <li>You can just out a little in your hand and rub it in to make it smooth and apply on your body.</li>
            <li>I have only had it a few days, but love it so far!</li>
            <li>but this Shea butter is different so pure so natural.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and that I only need to use a little bit of it b/c of the richness.</li>
            <li>The mix isn&#x27;t quite as hard as most Shea butter mixes.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and not as hard as I expected for unrefined shae butter, but still amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just soft and easy to work with compared to other gritty brands of shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I have made my own moisturizer in the past using white shea butter from the health food store, but after reading about the high temperature used in the refining of the white shea butter</li>
            <li>This also means unlike the boiler method you have to be very careful of the amount of oils the Shea Butter gets mixed into because it can easily become borderline Shea &#x27;liquid&#x27;..</li>
            <li>This also means unlike the boiler method you have to be very careful of the amount of oils the Shea Butter gets mixed into because it can easily become borderline Shea &#x27;liquid&#x27;..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter to make cold process soap with great results.</li>
            <li>, I am hoping that with continued use, it will completely clear up.</li>
            <li>my toes started to clear up in my feet</li>
            <li>The skin looks clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It says &#x27;ncare&#x27; which is clearly supposed to say &#x27;skin care&#x27; but they chose to make themselves look sketchy instead of</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter in terms of its chemical properties, but I have been using various products that claim to be &amp;#34;100% natural organic shea&amp;#34; for years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it penetrates into my skin after a minute or two.</li>
            <li>also, makes my hair/skin soft</li>
            <li>Melted completely and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product for use in homemade lotions and body butters, and while I haven&#x27;t quite had time to use this in lotions/BB, I&#x27;ve put it straight on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It becomes slightly soft with the warmer Texas weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a couple of the recipes so far.</li>
            <li>I used this to make all natural lip balm with bees wax, coconut oil, and lavender oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made one lotion so far</li>
            <li>I literally apply it all over my body when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, all day.</li>
            <li>Soft and workable in your palm.</li>
            <li>I am using it on my 15 months old baby, she has eczema and pediatrician wanted to treat her with prescription creams and antibiotics.</li>
            <li>and so far I have been bathing her with colloidal oatmeal and</li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft &amp; silky in the recipe that I prepared for my son.  </li>
            <li>I notified the company; they were really prompt with getting back to me &amp; fixing the problem.  </li>
            <li>came very promptly double wrapped in a plastic bag and resealable organic paper bag.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after I used it.</li>
            <li>Used it to make some natural deodorant</li>
            <li>but I just use it at home, and then when I&#x27;m ready to go out, I wash it off, use a tiny bit of organic lotion under my makeup, and I can see how this shea butter has helped repair some damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the natural smell.</li>
            <li>but I like so far.</li>
            <li>Product was same as description and came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with.  </li>
            <li>Tried it as an intense facial night time moisturizer as I challenge my skin with Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it as I am trying to clear up my 13 year old daughters eczema-</li>
            <li>old grandbaby also.</li>
            <li>I use it for hair and body products...mainly to do my twist-outs on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I used this to make a body butter for my hyper sensitive (itchy) skin.  </li>
            <li>so I started doing my research and realized that was far from the truth.</li>
            <li>Just used some to make a soft deodorant for jars.</li>
            <li>Being that this shea butter is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have anything else in it, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Their hands are softer than soft.</li>
            <li>This block I am reviewing is a replacement block, directly from the Shea Butter Lady.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2, one for me and one for my daughter who has a 5 month old.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the packaging because I only use portions of it for the various recipes and by rewrapping it in the plastic, returning it to the sturdy bag it arrives in, and then storing it in a cool, dark place, it has stayed fresh since I opened</li>
            <li>I received a response very promptly (which also included a video on how to prepare Whipped Shea Butter) and in the process began an email dialogue with her (Isabella) about various things.</li>
            <li>I make all natural body products, I can&#x27;t use this in a customers order.</li>
            <li>I use this on my natural hair and body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I must say, I was surprised by the quality of the shea here.</li>
            <li>Soft consistancy.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s just what shea butter naturally smells like.</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>This product is working out well so far.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a bit early to give all the praise to the Shea Butter alone</li>
            <li>however thus far I am please.</li>
            <li>but this is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>she I am ready for my next batch.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft and is cheaper than the fancy brand.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless it was soft and pliable and the scent was not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Maybe my batch was old</li>
            <li>but it seems natural and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>Directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>This time I&#x27;m keeping it in the fridge too so it should last me a whole year.</li>
            <li>We have been using it for our whole family for several months now.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was packaged properly.  </li>
            <li>It made the sunscreen amazingly soft and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My daughter made up a natural hair and body cream of all natural products olive oil, avocado, coconut oil and Shea butter.</li>
            <li>The consistency was soft like playdough.</li>
            <li>It is silky and soft and skin just loves it.</li>
            <li>I have some experience with cocoa butter, coconut oils and the ever ready mix ins of essential oils and herbs from the garden</li>
            <li>So far I have used some of it to make homemade chapstick.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the Shea butter for making soap, and have now been using it directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>i probably won&#x27;t add as much coconut oil the next time because the shea is just so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And of course we give it to her directly as well to eat as a treat.</li>
            <li>I used it to make sunscreen and deodorant for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to use it as a cream, it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like Gold.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling after applying it directly to my face and skin after a shower..</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I cut off part of the brick and transferred it to an old jar to make it easier to access.  </li>
            <li>When applying the product to you skin, you have to just have to rub your had together a few time to the product would spreads smoothly on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish i had know about this early.</li>
            <li>all natural...</li>
            <li>This truly leaves the skin moisturized and soft, and I hope this seller never stops selling this Shea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The service I&#x27;ve gotten so far gives me a lot of confidence in the product and in buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>what I put on them was natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is absolutely my go-to shea butter for the future.</li>
            <li>my 4c natural hair</li>
            <li>I tried oils like avocado and almond oil, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much and only clogged my pores.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a totally natural shea butter product with integrity,  </li>
            <li>and I pulled it out and felt firmly soft (does that make sense?).</li>
            <li>I use lotion on my hands a lot and, with this, I only had to reapply lotion about 3 times the whole day</li>
            <li>By morning she is soft and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My final soap bars are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The quality is terrific and I have noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>But I completely respect you opinion and hope you find a supplier</li>
            <li>(Where to find cacao powder, where to find arrowroot powder, where to find non-GMO cornstarch)&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons naturally derived vitamin E, optional (Where to find naturally derived, non-GMO</li>
            <li>coconut oil and melt until completely liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
            <li>After years of using products like vitamin C serum and natural wrinkle products</li>
            <li>and I bought it twice so far THX</li>
            <li>I use a cotton cloth and natural soap to wash my face as a way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anyone seeking a quality topical moisturizer without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li>skin recovered in days.&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that Shea is sensitive to the temp in the room.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the shea butter so far is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I emailed the seller thru Amazon and received a download of the manual.</li>
            <li>It melts very easily, soft</li>
            <li>natural not perfumed.</li>
            <li>I know that this is not going to make it go away completely</li>
            <li>The jar stuff was hard-not soft like this is.</li>
            <li>she butter so far is as a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>The result is really soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i purchased this to use on my 2 month old baby girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Made one batch of lotion with it so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Because this is a natural product, though, it can spoil.</li>
            <li>Just a pinch leaves my face, neck and hands so soft, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I use DoTERRA essential oils and no matter how much I used, all I could smell was the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in two recipes so far, in a lotion and a body butter</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural and organic</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours, a rash that was on the brink of breaking the skin, was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have used it in Chapstick and deodorant so far</li>
            <li>It is so creamy and soft.</li>

            <li>I cant say enough how much this shea butter has changed my life.</li>
            <li>something hit me and told me I should go all natural.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this product/company to anyone looking for an all natural and organic way to moisturize their skin/face.</li>
            <li>Used the Shea butter after a shower and I wake up feeling uber soft.</li>
            <li>But the feel is soft when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m liking it so far, doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>There is an Oder that is natural but is covered up with scented oil and does not linger on skin.</li>
            <li>So far I like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>4 stars so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assured that I have a natural product..</li>

            <li>I used it as a detangling conditioner in my 4yr old daughters&#x27; hair.</li>

            <li>So far, I agree with everyone else.</li>
            <li>I use this product straight, blended with a bit of clove oil, as an all-over body moisturizer, and with no scent added as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my naturally coily hairs FRIZZ to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I have even been told that I look as if I am wearing make up while being au natural.</li>
            <li>Omg WOW.</li>
            <li>So far, this Shea Butter is relieving the dryness.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin feeling baby soft and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and like using a one-ingredient product.</li>
            <li>It is light and fluffy as well as odorless .  </li>
            <li>Soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Used it to make a natural sunscreen as well as some lavender body butter.  </li>
            <li>Naturally I then look on Amazon which is my go to place for research and found this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend the product as well as the company for its short shipping success.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few days and notice more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product, though quite expensive.</li>
            <li>smells good enough to eat, it is the base for hand and lip cream and my favorite deodorant recipe.</li>
            <li>The plastic bag can get kind of messy, so I transferred the shea butter to an empty container for easier accessibility.</li>
            <li>Well packaged in a thick bag with a resealable zip top.</li>
            <li>As a base, the Shea Butter absorbs wonderfully and the texture is silky.  </li>
            <li>I have recently bought my second batch of this raw shea butter, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Not real hard.....</li>
            <li>This shea butter is definitely super creamy and super thick!</li>
            <li>I read that if you melt it and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down, it would be &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later I bought shea butter from a different seller and got a batch that is a mild nutty smell, nicer color and is exactly what I expected shea butter to be.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper and better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used (and I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li>I like the whipped version better because it is a little creamier (and looks nicer for gifting) but both versions are somewhat soft even though my house is a little cool now in the middle of a Minnesota winter.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and made my skin smooth and moisturized during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So moisturizing and sinks right in.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but a little peppermint essential oil fixed that!</li>
            <li>Others I bought from other sellers smelled old and just didn&#x27;t look fresh.</li>
            <li>The dry skin on my feet went away after the first month.</li>
            <li>My testing of other shea butters, even those carried by my local upscale market, ended up that none were nearly as smooth and absorbable.</li>
            <li>I like this shea butter so much that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to purchase any other scented body lotions again.</li>
            <li>This melted smoothly and mixed well with the other ingrediants I used.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin and</li>
            <li>I whipped it up with coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, avacado oil, Jamaican black castor oil, sweet almond oil, and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea in it&#x27;s pure form, but it is very much like other consumers reported: creamy white in color, a very faint nutty odor (not a bad thing!), playdoh-like texture, and quick to melt.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this Raw Shea Butter in the future!</li>
            <li>(why is it that legs dry out more than arms even when less exposed to the elements?</li>
            <li>It has several easy recipes to follow that made getting started less</li>
            <li>Seeing as this is my first time using the product I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too, but it is as expected and has helped my skin in various ways.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the original smell, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only made a new face cream with it so far, but I&#x27;ve completely replaced my old online Paleo version and am saving a ton of $.</li>
            <li>A huge raw Shea butter(1LB) is inside the bag!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Those raw ones I used are light colored.</li>
            <li>It even came with instructions for downloading their free Manual &amp; Raw Shea Butter Recipes eBook.  </li>
            <li>I use this stuff on my skin every day, simply to keep it young,  tight, supple, smooth and moisturized well into old age.</li>
            <li>It does have a faint natural smell of its own, but I think I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I will also buy a more fragrant essential oil to add to the next half.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of shea butter from this particular company.</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter as my main facial moisturize for years.</li>
            <li>This particular brand comes in both ivory and yellow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use , not stiff and hard like others .</li>
            <li>The child who has severe eczema and has more rashy skin than dry patches is also showing improvement but a little slower which I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have very dry lips and made the lip balm recipe, and my lips are not flaking for the first time I can remember.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this several times and it&#x27;s always of high quality.  </li>
            <li>Smoother than the yellow, noticably high quality.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any experience with shea butter prior to this, but had done some research and knew what to expect from high- versus low-quality shea.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product, because it was highly recommended for use in essential oil body and face recipes.</li>
            <li>In the mean time I used a small portion and applied to my face before putting on foundation and it is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Shea Before, usually from the sweet street vendors in New York City.  </li>
            <li>I love it, i&#x27;m using it everyday as moisturiser for my dry skin</li>
            <li>Healed my split ends, had my hair looking glossy and super soft to the touch even during this rough winter weather, wool hats and the flat iron.</li>
            <li>When you make it yourself, you can control how solid or soft it is and how much fragrance (essential oils) to add.</li>
            <li>This is a solid, simple, real and untainted product from as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and silky; I have used it straight on my skin and also mixed it with Vitamin E, essential oils, vitamin C....</li>
            <li>I was not able to download the free recipe book, but the company said they would email it to me.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and moisturizes for a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought a tiny jar of the white butter at Whole Foods because I was completely out.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my nasty calloused feet and have noticed great softening, better than commercial foot care products.</li>
            <li>As someone who suffers from atopic dermatitis and eczema, I have spent an unreasonable amount of money on products over the course of many years - most of which did not work.  </li>
            <li>and it came out feeling very greasy and takes a long time to soak in.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they&#x27;ve all had a sand like texture (whether white or yellow) and they didn&#x27;t mix well with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>when you first put it on it seems a bit heavy and greasy especially if you dont heat it up first</li>
            <li>I only have one recipe to use the shae butter for a hand cream, so I am excited to down load your instruction booklet.</li>
            <li>will say that it hasn&#x27;t &#x27;fixed&#x27; the hard skin completely - (i keep forgetting to use the product) but as long as i can remember to moisturise every day with this butter, my feet look and feel better.</li>
            <li>Other butters have irritated my skin and scalp; this butter seems absolutely pure!</li>
            <li>(Find jojoba oil here)&lt;br /&gt;1-2 teaspoons peppermint essential oil, depending on preference (where to find peppermint essential oil)&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons pure cocoa or cacao powder.</li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s hair is also very fine but thin</li>
            <li>It feels different than slathering on chemical filled, store bought moisturizer and takes a little getting used to, if you haven&#x27;t used shea butter before.</li>
            <li>Smells a little like cheese, but it&#x27;s my first time using it, and someone said that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>My mixture did get hard again, so I melted it for easy application.</li>
            <li>I actually like the smell of this Shea butter whereas all others I&#x27;ve purchased (especially from large name suppliers) the smell was so overwhelming that I had a hard time using the product!</li>
            <li>This time it is so hard I have to use I knife to get any off, ok, no big deal.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a few of my other oils and it all came together nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase this product and create new lotions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying the extra versus other raw organic shea butters sold here because this one is definitely better quality!</li>
            <li>I read reviews of people applying this to their face, which left me totally aghast (lol).</li>
            <li>This really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs and leaves it so soft; my facial wrinkles are less noticeable, although I read somewhere that it can 46 weeks to see permanent wrinkle removal.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it for my dry face skin and hope to see improvements very soon.</li>
            <li>Very healing to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have chronic dry skin and this is helping so much.</li>
            <li>I reside in Alaska where it is extremely dry and no matter how much I would moisturize my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a flight attendant, so my skin is dry anyway.</li>
            <li>With the shea, I&#x27;ve noticed that much of the wrinkling and dry skin has gone away.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get results, using it on dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s legs are incredibly dry and get very ashy.  </li>
            <li>Just made a batch of face moisturizer with the Shea Butter and my face feels soft and not dry anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that I find that makes my naturally kinky curly hair soft.</li>
            <li>Plus one order last a long time for me... stay in business ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin is sooo soft and not dry and cracked as before.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter suffers from severe eczema, and finding a great quality all natural moisturizing product is difficult because so many things can cause stinging or burning.</li>
            <li>I mixed some with coconut oil and use it as my evening facial cream and works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I know that the characteristics of shea butter differ from batch to batch, but I really didn&#x27;t like the gritty, sandy feeling shea butter that I got the second time.</li>
            <li>It instantly made my skin soft and miusturized and my hair drank it up and was soft and stopped breaking.  </li>
            <li>This was my third purchase with this seller, and I am once again blown away by not only the product I received, but also the high level of customer service!</li>
            <li>I did equal parts shea butter and organic coconut oil, then whipped it until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>It really improves the skin around the eye area and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, unlike the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used, which did jack s</li>
            <li>Excellent as lip balm, body lotion base, hair conditioner (used sparingly), and a tiny bit inside the nostrils temporarily clears my spring-allergy-induced sinus congestion.</li>
            <li>I can order more and a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li>My skin is soft &amp; smooth &amp; a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used the butter for my acne-prone face as well, and next morning the skin was very soft and had that satin feel to it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely of higher quality than other shea butters I have tried.</li>
            <li>Dryness is gone, rosacea is vastly improving, my skin feels more supple, no more breakouts, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on my skin!</li>
            <li>Well I was so excited and anxious to receive my Organic Shea Butter</li>
            <li>also like how it doesn&#x27;t melt in higher heats, like other lotions and butters I&#x27;ve had with coconut oil in</li>
            <li>This is Shea butter like no other.  </li>
            <li>I had bought locally, but the quality actually seems to be better than the Shea Butter I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, she loves it, too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it head to toe after showering and have noticed a major difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use my shea butter in my body butters and find that this one is a little less dense, so I have to add larger amounts of the shea to get a better consistency.</li>
            <li>The company bugged the living crap out of me for a review but the product is pretty good as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way and , by all means, use the recipes that come with it to whip it up into a lighter consistency and add your favorite essential oils...</li>
            <li>This is 100% true raw Shea.</li>
            <li>refill a small dish that I keep in the shower and use it after everything is clean.</li>
            <li>I also love the recipe book that came along with the purchase and have ordered some other oils to make a few.</li>
            <li>I made a whipped body butter with this shea butter and 100% organic unrefined Cocoa Butter from &#x27;Better Shea Butter&#x27; along with a few other ingredients.</li>
            <li>But the latter is creamier and easier to apply especially in winter when plain shea butter became so solid and took more time to melt in my hands before I could apply them on my body.</li>
            <li>The packaging is sent as expected and the shea butter is pure and unrefined.</li>
            <li>I bought from a really expensive shop and found this online for much cheaper and since it had really good reviews decided I could make my own for a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li>One had the consistency of Barbasol shaving cream and didn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth and the other did a better job on my skin, but was like hard dried wax which made it difficult to dab on my skin withouy having to warm it up.</li>
            <li>34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; lightly with this shea butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the butter is smooth, but rather hard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their customer care is surpassing to say the least, as is the butter which leaves a greasy film on (my) skin but is surprisingly quickly absorbed leaving it very soft!</li>
            <li>Perhaps the yellow shea butter is different, but I definitely would not purchase the ivory butter again, and I am now reluctant to buy raw shea butter over the internet at all - I want to be able to smell it before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I melt the butter and pure extra virgin coconut oil, Jamaican castor oil, wheat germ oil, horsetail extract and extra virgin olive oil and mix together then put in fridge to return it to its solid form.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and will definitely be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li>Product overall is great however, the smell is unpleasant :</li>
            <li>I bought this shea butter specifically because I am pursuing a healthier lifestyle in general, and this shea butter is both organic and unrefined-</li>
            <li>They give you so much it should last you a long time.</li>
            <li>had some pesky dry skin flaking off my legs (why is it that legs dry out more than arms even when less exposed to the elements?</li>
            <li>But my skin feels so soft after I use it and it has definitely helped the itchiness on my skin.</li>
            <li>far as the shea butter itself, it&#x27;s definitely quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I used it to make face cream with my Young Living essential</li>
            <li>I just mixed mine with natural vitamin e to make a body butter and</li>
            <li>and I use it for soft tissue work in my holistic physical therapy and bodywork practice...</li>
            <li>I LOOOOVE the moisture as it keeps me soft and silky for the entire day.</li>
            <li>My toddler also has sensitive skin and eczema--I&#x27;m using this butter mixed with some lavender oil for him.  </li>
            <li>my skin became so soft, will come back in two months for an update</li>
            <li>We are using it for home made lotion and hair care products with coconut oil and Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used just a bit so far</li>
            <li>and when it got here it was just as the description stated it would be ivory white, soft in a plastic bag</li>
            <li>I used this along with cocnut oil and beeswax to make my mother homemade deodorant since she has developed an allergy to commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it in my natural hair.</li>
            <li>When I mixed it with the oils, it did not blend completely, and the body butter was chunky.</li>
            <li>her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing.</li>
            <li>old baby from her hair to her feet and with every diaper change for the last five months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The natural scent of the butter is obvious when you open the package, and it&#x27;s clear that the butter hasn&#x27;t been processed with chemicals or bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a resent natural, I&#x27;m trying to get my hair staples in order, my hair has been battling dryness since my big chop.</li>
            <li>His skin is no longer red and patchy, but soft like a baby&#x27;s skin should be.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is cream colored (not white) and has a smell that is not perfume-y, but natural smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the last couple of days and my skin is extremely soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It was still solid, and not even overly soft.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have natural hair.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it only once</li>
            <li>I barely notice it.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and was still plagued occasionally with acne...</li>
            <li>I purchased this to create a natural face lotion using essential oils.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s able to use a small amount on wet har.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hands so nice and soft, which is sometimes difficult because I am a nurse and constantly washing my hands/using hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>and there and some are better and worse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Very surprising, and disappointing.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, already used almost all of it making body butters, lip balm, sunscreen and bug repellent.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is somewhat thick, but once your skin absorbs it, your skin feels naturally smooth, not oily.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not great bit is not terrible either.</li>
            <li>It is messy to mix but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>shea butter was super moisturizing &amp; so I only have to use a little bit.</li>
            <li>I bought shea butter once before and this one seems more soft and wasn&#x27;t as hard to scoop like the other one.</li>
            <li>I used it on both old and new stretch marks and have not really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Strangely, one package was amazingly smooth and the other was a tiny bit gritty.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product because my skin was a mess - sun damaged, dry, rosacea, breakouts.</li>
            <li>This has a slightly grainy texture at first</li>
            <li>Now at first I found it odd because I was going to do that anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more creamy than other brands I have bought in the past .</li>
            <li>and I bought it knowing that I will not have the exact same experience as other people had.</li>
            <li>and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again;</li>
            <li>and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again;</li>
            <li>I have used other brands of Shea in the past, until I came across this one, Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time purchasing this produce, needless to say I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if pure shea butter actually does all it says it does.</li>
            <li>The inside bowl needs to be able to hold at least 4-5 cups of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Using a double boiler or a pot of boiling water with a smaller pot fitted inside, melt cocoa butter and mango butter over a low</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry right away, which is expected, so I just do my hair and make up while I let it soak in.</li>
            <li>This shea butter was very pliable even before mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li>It blends very well with the other ingredients for my lotion.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than I expected and very high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the other butter I bought BROUGHT mild eczema and dry skin back on the my chest and decolletage which immediately went away with this one.</li>
            <li>Both of my children have have rough hands from the cold winter we have experienced and nothing worked to soften them...</li>
            <li>Product is great and has helped all of our chapped hands here on the east coast during this bitter cold.  </li>
            <li>Shea is one of these, so I figure why not cut out all the filler and use the active ingredient straight?</li>
            <li>It blends very well with various essential oils and has worked wonders on my dry &#x27;winter skin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I understand that this natural product will have slightly different characteristics in different batches.</li>
            <li>I refuse to use steroid based creams &amp; have used several different natural creams &amp; emollients, up to this point.</li>
            <li>I have no issue with the natural smell but mixed it with essential oils and coco oil</li>
            <li>You have to work it in and be careful not to use too much, just enough so you can feel it on the skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li>The product arrived as a slab packed in a double zip-lock bag, so it survived rough handling very well.</li>
            <li>Instead of purchasing expensive products with shea butter, why not just cut out the middle man and make your own?</li>
            <li>I do not know alot about Shea butter or have experience with it enough to say it is better or worse than another brand of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I made a lavender rosemary whipped butter blend with a few different oils and the result was an ultra hydrating easily absorbed butter.</li>
            <li>I was a little thrown by the texture when I first bought this.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried at first after reading reviews about the freshness of the product</li>
            <li>I bought this shea butter due to the ratings that other buyers had left and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I have seen such a major difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I try to not use chemicals, but organic creams are expensive, so I&#x27;ll be making a face cream, using shea butter, coconut oil &amp; either avocado or almond oil, but am interested also in the many other uses.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I moved to high altitude and was suddenly waking up with terribly dry and cracked skin around my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li>Why buy expensive &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; stuff at the store that uses a small percentage of actual shea butter when you can just use it at 100%, and more cheaply?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any one looking for high quality raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>Ive suffered from dry skin nearly all my life, but this stuff has made my skin softer than ever before!</li>
            <li>i bought the ivory butter and use it all over my body and face everyday and in just a few days i have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin feels and looks, i highly recomend it isspecially if your prone to dry flaky legs like i am.</li>
            <li>I like to use the raw shea butter right on my skin as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m tempted to give some of these</li>
            <li>I use it in the raw form right after the shower.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered the Raw Shea Butter and made my first homemade lotion!  </li>
            <li>This butter is indeed the color of raw Shea Butter, more of a cream color, perhaps a little lighter than others I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>This is more like butter and clay then the other stuff which was harder, lighter colored and had less of a smell.</li>
            <li>With the two other oils I used this whipped up into a smooth fluffy consistancy.</li>
            <li>I really think an expiration date needs to be printed on the package as BetterSheaButter&#x27;s site says to use it within six months if mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li>however, both my kiddos, one being eight months old broke out in hives from this product, and my five year old was extremely itchy after using it.  </li>
            <li>Reading reviews from other shea butter products/sellers left me worried about obtaining the real and undiluted shea butter product.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinct, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I think it would be fun to use it as a base for making my own moisturizer, adding stuff like essential oil and food coloring maybe.</li>
            <li>;) it was messy when I got it</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate so it takes a toll on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Super supple and easy to work with...does have a weird, smoky/musty smell that&#x27;s hard to cover up even with high quality essential oils, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light, and the consistency is less grainy than the previous shea butter I tried from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle, the butter was soft and smooth (not grainy like some others).</li>
            <li>and it melts down very well.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much I am researching other homemade skin products to make with it!</li>
            <li>, my skin is very dry and very sensitive</li>
            <li>I finally got around to making my first batch of body butter and made a little mistake when it came to scenting.  </li>
            <li>(one prior purchase much smaller amount, much more expensive, far inferior in quality)</li>
            <li>I rub a little between my hands and then put on my hair to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>The texture was extremely grainy, color was more on the light brown and the smell was overpowering, to the point that the trial formulas I did for soaps and lotions could not eliminate the bad smell and the grainy feeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a fan of the scent, but I can live with it if it gives me these results.</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago and this winter has been rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>I usually put booties on right after.</li>
            <li>I havent had this young looking skin for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s due to this high quality Shea butter!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works to clear up my dry skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from extremely dry and sensitive skin were</li>
            <li>have dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have really dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Cuticles (mine were really dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how wonderfully soft it has made my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used heat to dry my daughters&#x27; naturally kinky curly hair in over 6 months.</li>
            <li>I use this directly on my skin in the winter to prevent that really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I let dry naturally to see if it got hard, it was still moist  and soft, and of course I use it on my body as well arizona is very hot  and dry</li>
            <li>I am a gardener, and often my legs and arms dry out from the season changes and frequent showering.  </li>
            <li>Made my first batch of lotion with the shea butter, avocado oil and a few drops of essential oils</li>
            <li>Liked it - was a little hard to measure out of the bag but no complaints and did its job!</li>
            <li>I would say; it felt a little light (less than 1 lb.).</li>
            <li>Rubbing just a little bit into your hands leaves them silky soft, and afterwards the skin does not get dry immediately after an exposure to water as it does after using even very high end hand</li>
            <li>I mean, I didn&#x27;t think that this was so different from other brands that it was worth paying twice as much for.&lt;br /&gt;Minus an additional star because both the batch of body butter and the batch of lip balm I made with this brand became grainy after being stored for a week.  </li>
            <li>I am currently applying it to my daughter&#x27;s stubborn dry skin patch; it has considerably helped.</li>
            <li>That is a lifesaver for me as a beginner, so I deal with heating the mixtures only half as much.  </li>
            <li>It really takes care of those rough, dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and the only problem is, I have to apply it, leave on for about half an hour and get it off because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is useful everyday to soothe dry skin and excema.</li>
            <li>There are less expensive Shea Butter sites, but I&#x27;m unsure of the quality, maybe they are just as good.</li>
            <li>hard to say if i will spend more for less in the future or not.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with raw shea butter, so I was unsure what to expect.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought raw Shea butter</li>
            <li>This is my first time using raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I just made my first batch of whipped Shea butter and coconut oil tonight with this raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is first time I purchased an unrefined raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using raw Shea butter</li>
            <li>This is the first time i have used raw shea butter</li>
            <li>My first time using raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>This was my first time getting raw unrefined Shea Butter</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with raw unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>This was my first order of Raw Shay Butter .  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of organic, raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than some of the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have had very dry skin on my body since my early childhood, and have always used moisturizers after I shower.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin so soft all day since I have very dry</li>
            <li>In the morning I rub it under my eyes only, this helps to keep the delicate area moist &#x3D; less likely to add more wrinkles and make-up adheres better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By itself, it was very moisturizing and takes a little while for it to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my body either straight (a dab in your palm and rub together to melt) or combined with a little jojoba or almond oil to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I used a knife to scrape a little bit off its surface, this way it was much easier for me to soften it</li>
            <li>So much shea butter for so little</li>
            <li>I tried the yellow and did not like it as much as the ivory because it left white under-clothing with a slight shade of yellow.  </li>
            <li>My 6 month old has suffered with eczema since he was a little over two months old</li>
            <li>All the money we recieve is destined to cancer patients that get their treatments in the towns public hospital and live in extreme poverty here in Guadalajara, Mexico.</li>
            <li>When trying to apply it directly to my skin, it is very slippery and it hard to turn into a gel or liquid state for spreading.</li>
            <li>The big difference between this and several other brands/types of Shea butter (which I have purchased and used) is that this is very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit to a rather complicated skin care routine as I am a product junkie, but here is what I do to keep my body smooth and soft</li>

            <li> best I have been able to find so far.  </li>
            <li> I love making my own hair and skin products and Better Shea Butter</li>

            <li> I love using it in my homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it comes with a e-book, the company sends emails of DIY</li>
            <li> I just love it all together.</li>
            <li> I have used it for my lotion and my skin feels so much better.</li>

            <li> I have used Shea Butter for many year, I just bought the Ivory one from this seller and I have to say I really love it.</li>
            <li> and I do love the packaging - it does not look like food for once:)</li>
            <li> I have used most of it, but I am storing the rest in their resealable bag.</li>
            <li> the cheaper stuff where you get more, they include a container.</li>

            <li> I am now hooked on making my own natural body lotions using this shea butter, and also my own sunscreens - no irritation to my skin -</li>
            <li> but shea butter is too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is very oily as most products of its kind so if you dont like oily products this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Smokey nutty smell but its strong.</li>
            <li> Had strong &amp;#34;clay-like&amp;#34; &amp;#34;old-oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too strong</li>

            <li> I use this for my eczema, it&#x27;s amazing quality and pure.</li>
            <li> used this as a pure moisturizer throughout, it has worked nicely, still never causes any breakouts either.</li>

            <li> The photos are accurate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how accurate my speculation is, but I do know that this stuff moisturizes skin, and does it well.</li>
            <li> It melts very well and make a nice smooth lotion.</li>
            <li> Plus, the seller provides a link with many useful recipes, and seems to genuinely care about the product.</li>
            <li> After two days of applying the shea butter, I have seen a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am happy with how smooth my hands are after using the product, and I will definitely buy it again, and would recommend it to anyone as a hand cream over Dior, Ahava, Mary Kay, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder.</li>

            <li> very clean &amp; fresh...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about trying out the free e-book as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good stuff and close to being more natural than chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So smooth and rich.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell delicious, but the shea butter itself was high quality.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is packaged very professionally, it has a fresh nut aroma, kind of earthy, and it is a lovely ivory color and creamy smooth.</li>
            <li> I responded to one of the emails to inform Isabella (the owner) that I never received the link and she replied quickly with an attachment full of recipes!</li>
            <li> see some complaints about the smell, but I got to say, its mild and not bad!</li>
            <li> And the seller is super sweet!</li>
            <li> Other brands in screw top containers have arrived fine with a light pleasant smell.</li>

            <li> I like best about this RAW SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> The best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li> This is the best raw shea butter I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I was searching for the perfect raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s all around the best raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best raw, unrefined shea butter I have found anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Will most certainly buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and it&#x27;s easy to break apart for measuring.  </li>
            <li> It does have a smell, however, and this is normal for undefined shea butter, which retains more of its healthy healing vitamins and nutritional value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal packaging and supporting women in Africa just makes this the perfect shea.  </li>
            <li> She no longer has those rough spots and my skin has never looked to smooth and beautiful, well perhaps as a baby.</li>
            <li> It melts quickly,  and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The smell of pure shea butter is a bit strong for me, so i combined it with some coconut oil and almond extract and whipped it into a fabulous body butter!  </li>
            <li> I also highly recommend that oil if you are looking for another amazing product to include in your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is high quality and an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant and it melts and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased and used another brand of unrefined Shea Butter from Amazon, with which I was not disappointed, enjoyed very much and used every scrap of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product comes well packaged and the butter is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This was amazing soft and smoothe!!</li>
            <li> Super smooth, fantastic product, customer service and recipe ebook.</li>
            <li> Really helps with our dry winter skin and smells delicious --- chocolatey.  </li>
            <li> i love my skin now very very clear and healthy looking...</li>
            <li> I make an eczema cream out of this (with cedarwood, geranium, and lavender essential oils) and it&#x27;s amazing at clearing up my eczema!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a week or so, but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from Better Shea Butter</li>

            <li> This is my first purchase of Shea Butter, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and goes  a looooong way.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for :-)</li>
            <li> I added a star to my review because I&#x27;m pretty satisfied now but not 5 stars because of the shenanigans.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so rich, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and my EO never disappointed in the quality.</li>

            <li> I was pleased since this was my first time purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I am able to do many different things with it and helped me avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I use this in my original shea butter hair moisturizer recipes exclusively.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s feels rich.  </li>
            <li> PLUS, I love love love how my skin is feeling after only a day.</li>
            <li> Got it super quick too!</li>
            <li> So rare these days!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter and so many people have told me that I Shea butter comes &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and have to melt before blending with my coconut oil and vegetable glycerin.  </li>
            <li> It has a rich creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> It is not hard and crumbly, as many are; it is not grainy, as most are; it is not pre-whipped and full of air, as some are.</li>
            <li> Love that this is pure &amp; genuinely works.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and it was just as great as the first!</li>
            <li> I have very curly 3c/4a afro-american hair that is very fine</li>
            <li> Made my own deodorant last weekend and will make body lotion today :)</li>
            <li> It smells fresh, it melts easily</li>
            <li> My skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands that worsens in the winter and after using this product for a day my skin was smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product, especially in the winter where it provides a soothing, smooth texture to every inch of skin!</li>
            <li> It is soft and silky, perfect for my Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for so many years with sensitivity to commercial soaps and lotions that I decided to try my hand at making my own.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is a clean ivory with no residue.  </li>
            <li> The stuff from Mountain Rose Herbs smelled better and was more yellow and kind of gritty.  </li>
            <li> I had to clean the bits off with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> Overall - really loving this and plan to order more.  </li>
            <li> , I melt some in my palm and tried on my face, my skin absorbs quickly and felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I want to get more and more to natural products.</li>
            <li> The product looks clean, and has a nutty fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the most amazingly smooth shea butter ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from three different vendors on Amazon and this is by far the very best shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> It is unrefined but it is clean, no straining.</li>
            <li> Creamy and clean.  </li>
            <li> I started looking for more natural alternatives to store bought beauty products and came across Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> So I add it into many of my creams-such as calendula cream and jewelweed cream, gives it a nice extra umph!</li>
            <li> but it was manageable to clean.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several brands of shea butter, but so far this has been the best.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy feeling if your like me and used to squeaky clean and lightweight lotions.</li>
            <li> I am not as young as I want to be but after a couple of days my face and neck have shown a more healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Love it, amazing instant results!</li>
            <li> It is great shea butter for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; so far has worked really well in the recipes I&#x27;ve used it in.</li>
            <li> butter does not smell like a nice perfume, but neither is it supposed to; it has a light smell of natural plant butter.</li>
            <li> So far I have made several and think I like the ones using the Shea Butter the best.</li>
            <li> After purchasing shea butter from another seller I was not impressed and had it refunded, this product is amazing and the costumer sevice was great!</li>
            <li> I am thinking of adding some Zinc next time to start making my own sunblock :)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dry skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter to use as a sort of diaper rash cream, but my own mix, as it is not only cheaper but better quality.</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand several times and it is by far the best Shea Butter out there.</li>
            <li> I tried several Shea butters and this brand is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry heels too.</li>
            <li> Great product and super quick delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Mild smell, very smooth, no lumps, super hydrating, very pure.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive and non-sensitive people alike, because it has a very nice earthy pleasant smell, not strong at all (not like the yellow Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is a little more than I normally spend for unrefined shea butter, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency and made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> and so far I really love it!</li>
            <li> I like that this is completely natural and healthy for my skin, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so greasy!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, supple and even toned when I use this cream, it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> made shea-coconut body lotion and am loving it so far!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about how beautiful my skin is as well as how smooth and delicate my face it.</li>
            <li> Great product...very happy with how it melted down and mixed.</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter, you&#x27;re clean, pure, and just what my hair and skin needs..</li>
            <li> It makes shaving very smooth and she puts some lavender and mint in it to make it smell really</li>
            <li> Use it to make moisturizer and it works great in the dry AZ weather!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and eczema!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time to use this product and absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Used in a recipe for natural deodorant and so far so good!</li>
            <li> and they are so much cheaper compared with other organic shea butter you can find anywhere, with excellent quality too!</li>
            <li> will have to try other brands and get more experience to know what&#x27;s  good</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I have tried making lotion with this, but have found I like the pure shea butter much better.</li>
            <li> The scent is nothing special, but mix with a drop of coconut oil</li>
            <li> I use it as a massage cream with some special ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love this product pure.</li>
            <li> and It right away soothes any itching I have!</li>
            <li> It also came right on time!</li>
            <li> Buy this right away!  </li>
            <li> Great for my children&#x27;s very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but we love that it is raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> good quality, nice raw color and smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this raw shea butter, it&#x27;s organic and just what I needed!</li>
            <li> The shea butter is clean and smooth, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes.</li>
            <li> This company is not skimpy on what they give and the product is super rich and melts with touch.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!!!</li>
            <li> If your a high end product consumer like myself, don&#x27;t let the price fool you - this is an amazing product that&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> Nice texture, no weird smell and was shipped in a decent time period!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m back for more of this high quality, remarkable product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived soft and was easy to use; it melted well; it combined well with other ingredients and was especially nice to use when whipped.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, and is easy to blend with other ingredients to make a fabulous body butter.</li>
            <li> Clean and pure moisture!!</li>
            <li> plus it was delivered sooner than i expected the customer service was great as well</li>
            <li> The product is as expected and works great in my homemade body butter</li>
            <li> I use this as my daily moisturizer and after the first week of using it I noticed great changes it my skin.</li>
            <li> I am happy I made this choice, it was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my skin amazingly while still being all natural.</li>
            <li> Although this is certainly a great butter, as I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that much better to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Have made acne cream and lotion so far that works and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have made 4 lotions so far &amp; my skin smells &amp; feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived just as expected and works great.</li>
            <li> I made a natural shave cream with it and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, great packaging.</li>
            <li> The smell is earthy and somewhat full bodied.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The recipes book is very helpful, they have more than 10 recipes using Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Now, I would say dime size works well for just my hands and maybe half-dollar if I am doing a full body slather.  </li>
            <li> but now I am a true believer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the sweet recipes.</li>
            <li> A true gift from Africa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for those looking for a good quality Shea, or for those who need a deep moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t done this, but I know some people use it on their hair as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the free recipe ebook!</li>
            <li> I loved how this came packaged in a &amp;#34;zipper type&amp;#34; on both the outside and the inside package as well.  </li>
            <li> It came fast and I love that I could download a recipe book.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s natural and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This bar arrived packaged nicely in a brown craft bag and sealed professionally.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes that it will make it go away altogether! :)</li>
            <li> The seller is very helpful and reputable.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own natural hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> I bought some at a craft fair last year for</li>
            <li> Nice natural scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li> I put the contents of the bag in my kitchen aide mixer,  with a cap full of olive oil and 5 to 10 drops of lavender.</li>
            <li> seemed really fresh...already planning to buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this as a face and body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> helps cool a rash I get on my hands.</li>
            <li> Yellow butter is still good</li>
            <li> but it was lovely anyhow to be noticed  as a customer and to know the company appreciated my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you do want a good Shea Butter product, definitely consider trying this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you do want a good Shea Butter product, definitely consider trying this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love knowing i am spending my money at a company who really appreciates my business.</li>
            <li> I went straight to work on my magic potion designed just for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO grateful to find it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I did NOT get one full pound.  </li>
            <li> This butter was much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word).</li>
            <li> I love my shea butter will be ordering again real soon.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer and smooth!</li>
            <li> She wants you to be happy with her product and gives you resources for you to enjoy the shea butter to its full potential.  </li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat and</li>
            <li> It firmed back up &amp; was good to go.</li>
            <li> for full legs  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually edible, but my guess is it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it</li>
            <li> The reviews are absolutely true.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and is absorbed on contact.</li>
            <li> The ebook that comes with your purchase is chocked full of helpful hints and recipes.</li>
            <li> but all i know is its good to have around when i finally do figure out how to make a soap or moisturizer out of it..</li>
            <li> i love it so much works miracle on my skin...</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Mixed with coconut oil to make a whipped body butter and rubbed on grandsons eczema , he loved it.</li>
            <li> I miss the sweet baby smell but</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks better Shea 😀</li>
            <li> The shea butter was the appropriate color and consistency, so that was very reassuring.</li>
            <li> After purchasing Shea butter from a different seller and it not being of good quality</li>
            <li> Better then lotion,  very nourishing to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably natural to this kind of Shea Butter,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixing it with cocoa butter and sweet almond oil and using it to (hopefully) prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> many thanks.</li>
            <li> love it , got it fast</li>
            <li> The company was good about following up with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good butter</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL NOW,This ivory shea butter,is much lighter and softer,and absorbs better into my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because I am making my own natural cosmetics</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have prior experience with Shea butter, so I have to assume this is good quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this butter.  </li>
            <li> it firms up again, then when cool whip with hand blender.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m going through it so fast</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own lotion for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My recipe includes natural beeswax, shea butter, zinc oxide and rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly in the summer time because it is a great long lasting moisturizing although it would make more sense to use this in the winter.</li>
            <li> The packing is a nice touch with the natural look.</li>
            <li> I also used it in lip balm with coconut oil, beeswax, and a touch of sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> I made a whipped butter with cocoa butter, coconut oil, and sweet almond oil...</li>
            <li> only is the product superior</li>
            <li> It is also good for clearing skin blemishes such as pimples.</li>
            <li> I made my own natural lotion</li>
            <li> I can see the brown spots on my skin even out tone wise, my skin feels softer and smoother at the same time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li> Just dont like the smell really not bad but not flower either</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $16.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> And just to be sure the good review goes to the right vendor and not some general feedback on a general product, this came from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> and it seems very pure and fine.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was impressed by the substantial feel and weight; I could tell right away that I have a lot of shea butter here, especially since I plan to use it straight as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came very nicely packaged, and upon opening it was clear that this was a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much because the texture is easy to apply</li>
            <li> It feels good, and it&#x27;s vacuum sealed for freshness.</li>
            <li> They have free eBook which is very informative with easy instructions.</li>
            <li> Ordered unrefined shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs, and the smell is similar, although not quite as strong.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and the product is soft and easy to put on...</li>
            <li> It was delivered in two days and was super fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;ve used on its own on my face - take care here as it pulls on the skin a bit when applying, but once on, feels super.</li>
            <li> It comes soft and fresh to my door!!!</li>
            <li> I recently made the most awesome sunscreen lotion bars with the Shea butter, And am thrilled with the results - these lotion bars came out firm, but soft and smooth and moisturizing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am finally hip to how great raw shea butter is, and all the great things you do with it.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, and it costs so much less than the fancy schmancy brands in &amp;#34;skin care&amp;#34; shops and departments.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make body butter for the first time, it was was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I am still trying some of the recipes from the free ebook, but I love how soft my skin is!</li>
            <li> This shea butter arrived promptly, was easy to work with and in less than a week we have seen remarkable improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li> Such a great pure product.</li>
            <li> mixes great with other oils to make lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great alone and in other homemade body products-</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great shea butter.</li>
            <li> But other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the smell is nutty and quite distinct, so I think it&#x27;s an original product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, it does not have that rancid smell other Shea butters do and it is not oily.</li>
            <li> it melts great on your skin with and without mixing with other oils,  </li>
            <li> This one is so much more creamy and soft  that I was able to rub it into my skin without heating it first.</li>
            <li> That turned out great and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, good color...not too odoriferous...mixed with all the other oils I blend in......</li>
            <li> It is hard to find good quality shea now that it has become popular.</li>
            <li> It is a rich, easy to use body butter that is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> just pure shea butter goodness all wrapped up in a package!!  </li>
            <li> This is quality Shea -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after you rub it in, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous amount of shea butter for the price.</li>
            <li> and it will start to crack and bleed quickly.</li>
            <li> The recipe book that comes with it is super helpful, and the owner emailed me to answer questions immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mild nutty scent, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a great product.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and they email you a link to a shea butter recipe book after arrival.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> Quick arrival and the recipes that came along with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly; arrived as promised and product weighed as sold (16 oz).</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> The texture quickly turns from putty to butter.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and it is 100% authnetic.</li>
            <li> So, I used this stuff fairly quickly after getting it</li>
            <li> It has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>

            <li> I was amazed by how quickly it melts</li>
            <li> Melted quickly for use in body cream recipe.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to go away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> excellent, because I can make homemade body butters without going through the traditional methods of a double boiler.</li>

            <li> It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Shea butters but this was the best by far!</li>
            <li> but it quickly absorbs in and is not a stain-hazard to clothing or bedding.</li>

            <li> product is moisturizing, but not greasy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> However whether you do it that way or warm it to soften, when applied to the skin it is silky smooth and instantly feels hydrating.</li>
            <li> My skin is super</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the smell went away and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it.</li>

            <li> It arrived quickly and when I opened the packet</li>
            <li> quickly used the Shea butter</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly and I used to make a whipped body butter that I&#x27;ve been using every day since.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having a high quality product:)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Isabella and The Better Shea Butter Team.</li>
            <li> I love it and give it an A (trust me, my stamp of approval should be highly regarded after all the $$$$ I spend here), that said check it out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, I used this for making body butter and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Lovely, high quality Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I plan on making my own health and beauty items and it was important to me to have a high quality product from a high quality supplier.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great, and some dry areas are healing quickly after consistent use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to make, the directions are very clear, and I have a wonderful jar of rich, creamy completely natural body butter that is working wonders on my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> Melts well and is not gritty at all, very clean and it makes a really great whipped body butter that is nearly a true white color.  </li>
            <li> I used this in a couple of different whipped body butter recipes and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure is normal.</li>
            <li> First of all this smells light and nutty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product, just wish it came in a bigger amount, but I will just have to order more next time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and plan to keep this purchase regular for my family.&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter will not buy any other kind.</li>
            <li> I tried other shea butter and this is one of the best shea butter I tried so far.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate that very much!  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is smooth, consistent and melts with hand temperature (as it should).</li>
            <li> I, recently, purchased this product and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was nice and fluffy soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I just made my very first homemade beauty product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of the old school French cuisine theory where even the lowliest ingredient can be elevated by good technique, or something.</li>
            <li> (The smell by the way is not entirely unpleasant, just not fragranced like processed shea butter).  </li>
            <li> Has a very mild scent, is super soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> but I appreciated the raw quality (which is awesome</li>
            <li> it was not hard at all which made it better for me to cut the portion that I needed for my peppermint body</li>
            <li> and not to mention super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I melt it down and mix it with my fav oils, then I let it harden and whip it with my hand mixer and it makes a great cream that I use as soon as I step out the shower.  </li>
            <li> Raw Shea Butter - Good quality product!</li>
            <li> and they provide a great ebook for other recipes that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love how pure it looks and smells when it arrives.</li>
            <li> This is the best raw shea butter I have ever purchased!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to try new formulas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &#x27;shea butter&#x27; world so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> sure to use essential oils because Raw Shea Butter does not have the best smell.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like whipped butter almost good enough to eat ;)</li>
            <li> product arrived very quickly, and was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> The ivory shea butter does have distinct smell, but it is a mild one.  </li>
            <li> I use the shea butter only on my face - no breakouts, face is beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I warm a small amount in my hand to warm it up</li>
            <li> Very nice....creamy and easy to use</li>
            <li> one now.&lt;br /&gt;The block is a pretty good size, and seems like it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was in an actual large bullion cube shape.  </li>
            <li> This shea is so pure, my skin did not react, in fact i use it all over my body after a shower and feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is a much better alternative than petroleum based lotions that clog pores.</li>
            <li> It melts down perfectly and whips up soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li> I love the soft creamy consistence of BSB!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>

            <li> Thanks!!  </li>
            <li> It smells lovely &amp; leaves our skin soft &amp; moisturized!</li>
            <li> They are definitely concerned with their customers&#x27; satisfaction, and I am SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> I have been doing very extensive research on Shea butter and there are so many imposters out there!</li>
            <li> twice the price!The delivery was fast!!</li>
            <li> My skin loves it so much!!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping this first pregnancy a zero stretch mark one!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed to make my body butter!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again and recommend them highly!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of making my soap without this--and the fact that it&#x27;s totally organic makes it that much better!  </li>
            <li> What better endorsement than having men compliment you on your soft skin!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever purchasing shea butter!</li>
            <li> This product was rich and creamy, exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Made my first batch with this shea butter!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of shea butter before and this is so far my favorite-- simply wonderful smooth buttery goodness that melts immediately when applied; none of the grittiness that I sometimes get in previously-tried brands.</li>
            <li> On my third order, and still love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Only wish I could give more stars than 5!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> First, kudos to the vendor on the speediness of my order...less than a week!</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Oh boy did it start to heal fast!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy from Better Shea Butter again!</li>
            <li> If this is the first time buying or the millionth, you would want to try this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistently high-quality, order after order!  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> and this really help!!</li>
            <li> I found that warming it briefly between my hands allowed it to melt a bit and spread more easily on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been making changes from my chemical saturated skin care products to more natural skin care; once I read about the healing properties, vitamin A, and the fact that Shea Butter melts into the skin quickly (oils that sit on my skin tend to break me out)</li>
            <li> So far, my skin is supple and never has itched (I hear many pregnant women get itchy skin on their bellies because the skin is stretching).</li>
            <li> So far, my skin is supple and never has itched (I hear many pregnant women get itchy skin on their bellies because the skin is stretching).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice not hearing my teenage daughter calling me super ashy.</li>
            <li> So smooth and soft and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick arrival, good quality, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the shea butter arrived well-packaged and in fine condition.</li>
            <li> It melts ridiculously fast when you rub it in between your fingertips, and it also absorbs into the skin quickly, without even clogging my pores up!</li>
            <li> When I told Isabel, the owner, about the natural way I cleanse my face, she was very interested and wanted to know more.  </li>
            <li> I had been combining w/ jojoba oil or coconut oil, but I just used the shea butter straight from the brick and it shampooed out fine.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t super excited about the packaging, but I transferred it to a large mason jar so no problems there!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> So smooth and pure.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect solution for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It took the oils very nicely and wiped up easily and ended up with the texture of a thick milk shake.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell as compared to other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This butter came in a double sealed bag (sealed plastic, then heat-sealed resealable organic-looking bag) and was a very nice, solid block that I could easily cut in 4oz doses to make my recipes.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!!</li>
            <li> not rock hard like many others, informative, good quality and texture</li>
            <li> The look, feel, and smell of the butter are high quality - clean, but rich.</li>
            <li> It felt very creamy, smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was amazing until I ran out and could not seem to find the same product again until now!!  </li>
            <li> It smells and works great, and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Made a few lotions with this shea butter for my daughter will eczema and they turned out great.</li>
            <li> I hope they enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> it has been amazing for me and the entire family</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough how amazing their customer service is, Isabella.</li>
            <li> I might have gotten it sooner if it wasn&#x27;t for the weekend, however, its still fast shipping compared to the almond oil I am still waiting on, the one I paid shipping on where as this came with free shipping and still got to me in under a week.</li>
            <li> This is third time I buy this amazing products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This really makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li> Initially purchased to make whip body butter for my family, but I found out that it makes an amazing diaper rash treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a few body butters and scrubs with this and all have turned out great.</li>
            <li> Came packaged as pictured, smells fantastic, and works really well.</li>
            <li> Have made several lotions already.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an amazing and affordable product.</li>
            <li> Finally, their customer service is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> A quality product, and the free recipes were very helpful to a novice like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have already made a few things with it and each are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product a few times and it works great for my body butter, soaps, and lip balm.</li>
            <li> A bit grainy when mixed to use as hair butter, but it works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair so far.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> You can clearly tell that it is of better quality.</li>
            <li> I make my own two ingredient lotion with this ( 6 tbsp olive oil and one order of this shea butter, melted over very low heat, refrigerated for about 45 minutes, the whipped with an electric mixer).</li>
            <li> and mine was sent to me fresh made on Dec 14th 2014.</li>
            <li> Comes sealed and fresh.</li>
            <li> I keep it wrapped and in a plastic covered tub to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own body butters mixing shea, coconut and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i have never felt my skin so soft and healthy</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is really so nice, I have just bought it for the second time.</li>
            <li> It is very easily absorbed in the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery , great product, and the people behind the product are so nice.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and at a fair price</li>
            <li> It is oily but quickly is absorbed in skin.</li>
            <li> It has a great natural scent but mixes well with any essential oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a nice surprise to get the ebook with different Shea butter recipes.</li>
            <li> Isabella, owner of Better Shea Butter, is awesome to work with, she is very customer orientated and stands behind her product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying from Mountain Rose Herbs in the future.</li>
            <li> ....can&#x27;t find any better anywhere as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The smell leaves a lot to be desired but the benefits are worth the scent.</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell of these shea butter and the way packaging</li>
            <li> I still kept it, thinking if I massaged it in my hand before use it might still be useful.</li>
            <li> I received recipes from the company so it was nice to see how to use the Shea butter in different ways.</li>
            <li> a wonderful product, perfect for blending with olive oil and making a base for my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I made face cream out of this shea butter with some jojoba, rose hip, and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter itself is fantastic quality and has worked lovely as an ingredient in some of the DIY body butters and lotions I&#x27;ve been making recently.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> but then his skin absorbed completely it and seemed to need more.</li>
            <li> smooths my skin and mixes with a variety of things to make even the roughest elbows soft :) I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> my husband keeps giving me compliments on how soft my skin is:-)</li>
            <li> Not only for selling this amazing product, but to their attentive customer service, you can really see that they care about their customers and the quality of the shea butter</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a bit of olive oil and some essential oils that smell nice to me.</li>
            <li> I think that is such a nice gesture.</li>
            <li> Now I know, you just cannot compare anything from a shelf  to something as fresh as this product.</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own eczema cream with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker, has an exotic natural semi-sweet smell to it, and can be used as is from the package.  </li>
            <li> and I will be ordering my own next.</li>
            <li> so far, I already made a home skin product from the e-book with recipes and I love it.</li>
            <li> There is so much shea butter in the package that will probably last a good 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It does not go on like regular lotion: you need to warm it</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product so far.</li>
            <li> It was fresh and had the consistency that it should have.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t know how to use it or whether i was supposed to store it in the refrigerator or not but the owner Isabella was kind enough to assist me</li>

            <li> It blends well not grainy at all and holds the smell of the essential oils nicely.</li>
            <li> soft and spreadable out of the bag unlike many others we have tried.</li>

            <li> So far petty satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this for a more natural skin care product.</li>
            <li> the yellow shea butter gives her skin a nice tan glow.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with coconut oil and vitamin E to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> using this for pregnancy stretch-mark prevention, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I plan on whipping it up with a cocoa butter and that will improve the smell.</li>
            <li> Simply because, it was a good size for the prize and arrived very quickly (thanks, Prime).</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m going to throw out every store bought lotion I own because I&#x27;m not going back to store bought chemical lotions!!!</li>
            <li> Just got it to make my own facecream with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> I made hand cream using my Young Living Essential Oils and it turned out great.</li>
            <li> And the bonus recipe book is a fun add.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh nutty smell.</li>
            <li> love making DIY recipes with this Raw Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> This company is apparently doing it right --- superior quality at a reasonable price ;)</li>
            <li> My e-book of recipes was available &amp; easy for me to download &amp; there appear to be some pretty useful &amp; natural recipes in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and high quality.  </li>
            <li> so this is very nice to have I have a little container I carry in my purse for my hands and my lips.</li>
            <li> I can easily slice off exactly how much I need.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product for my dry hand.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that is going to last me a long time, and when I do run out, I will order more!</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is so much more fresh &amp; creamy than any other brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It will be a smidge less \\&quot;light\\&quot; when whipped up, but it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I plan to try some of their other products; I think the standard of quality will be great, based my the Shea butter experience!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any other type of Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others but it worked great and has helped re-motorize my skin without the added chemicals.</li>
            <li> After experience with several other brands, I must say that this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It smells better than many of the other brands of shea butter that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is much better than other butters I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I wish they sold it in larger packages, but other than that, its a great product!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pregnant with our first baby (30 weeks - over 7 months) and</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to mention that I had some questions and concerns about this butter, which I spoke to the seller about, and she was quick to address my issue and very generous in her response!</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Will be a return customer and a few more months!!</li>
            <li> Just a pure, clean smell and</li>
            <li> Delivered super quick &amp; high quality!</li>
            <li> but I wake up with much healthier, more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat, it&#x27;s maleable and easy to work with right out of the packaging, and the end product left my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It is rich,  blends well and leaves my skin very moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Other than the shipping not as promised (Prime) product was good.</li>
            <li> She was enthusiastically receptive to my ideas and it felt really good to know that I might be contributing to something that other people might appreciate or benefit from.</li>
            <li> While the quality of items I choose are all good it seems that the butters and other items</li>
            <li> really was rich</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the friendly email I received from the seller.  </li>
            <li> Have no experience with other shea butters but the good ratings of this brand sold me.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and rich, but I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> how many different uses for Shea Butter, nor the variety of products it could be mixed with so am very pleased with the booklet of recipes.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and pleasant; the feel is a little oily when first applied, but just wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> Have used it right out of the package to rub on skin.  </li>
            <li> I had to put what I didn&#x27;t use right away into a ziplock baggie.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face at night right after washing.</li>
            <li> I made a face cream right away.</li>
            <li> If I were to guess, this butter came right from harvest.</li>
            <li> These people contact you right away and thank you for buying their product.</li>
            <li> , am I right?</li>
            <li> older(who knew right?</li>
            <li> Contacted the seller about the ebook and they responded right away.  </li>
            <li> Got the product right on time.</li>
            <li> smart, right)!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just continue to use it right before bed.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I right.</li>
            <li> No odor that I could smell and its consistency is just right.</li>
            <li> Priced right for quality and still getting a deal.  </li>
            <li> I decided to start making my own body butter and other lotions and most recipes have Shea Butter as its main ingredient.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have been using it in its raw form.</li>
            <li> Smells great and looks raw</li>
            <li> I read a lot of great things about raw shea butter</li>
            <li> Great price for raw unrefined organic shea.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re all getting positive remarks from friends!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft as can be and all at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I just bought it recently but wanted to share how soft it is and how amazing it smells!</li>
            <li> I mix it with a small amount of coconut oil and Young Living Lavendar oil for a truly wonderful lotion</li>
            <li> After using commercial shea butter products, I tried for the first time to make my own, and it was easier than I thought.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started with essential oils and decided to make my own wrinkle cream for the first time..</li>
            <li> Have used it in several recipes and find it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It was very soft and easy to break up.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter leaves my hair very soft &amp; easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This product was malleable an easy to mix with other oils at room temperature, the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and the packaging was simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> Super excited to get a &#x27;new&#x27;  butter, but when put on toast it was just the worse.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> We got exactly what we wanted and ordered exactly when we wanted it!</li>
            <li> I have irritated, red skin, but one layer of this at night, and my skin is soft, smooth, and healthy!</li>
            <li> It is soft, smells very mild (unlike other products I have used), melts smoothly and mixes well with other oils to make really wonderful skin creams/body butters etc...</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light scent which is hard to describe...</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and I live where it&#x27;s hot and dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine in brick form and though it smells wonderful and is a very good product, it was extremely hard and therefore difficult tocut and measure.</li>
            <li> very pure.</li>
            <li> This really helps me moisture my face without break out specially that I am on accutane.</li>
            <li> Very pure quality Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Had a nice smooth texture and slight nutty smell.</li>
            <li> Best out there for dry aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> and it really keeps my dry skin in good condition.</li>
            <li> It comes in a wonderfully natural and easy to keep bag to keep it fresh</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because I really wanted the white, but that was my fault for not reading &amp;#34;ivory.&amp;#34;  Very good on everything else though.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth, and melts in the hand almost instantly, making it easy to apply to the skin... just as easily as hand lotion actually.  </li>
            <li> Buttery smooth, easily mixes with other ingredients, and a light scent.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil and a bit of olive oil to make an all over body lotion that feels so good on my skin leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li> Next time I need some, I am going to purchase it in that form as it will make handling and measuring much easier and much more accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive creams my wife buys, but by far, Shea Butter is the best product I&#x27;ve found - I&#x27;m sold on Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> ; Lol But, I dont stink/reek of it when putting it on, just a small odor.</li>
            <li> It is evident that it is fresh</li>
            <li> Great to use small amount on hair too-</li>
            <li> and while I liked it, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the overwhelming white chocolate scent.  </li>
            <li> After about an hour its pretty much absorbed.</li>
            <li> then I expected it to and made a great natural deodorant out of it!</li>
            <li> Light, fluffy, I love it!</li>
            <li> When I went out to Better Shea Butter&#x27;s website I found out that they source their shea butter from \\&quot;fair local trading efforts in Africa\\&quot; and use \\&quot;minimal packaging material to lower environmental impact.\\</li>
            <li> Put on a nice pair of socks after a long day of walking at work and wala.</li>
            <li> This shea butter arrived quickly and is a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Super smart buy...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine since my hands were very soft after I got everything together.  </li>
            <li> , it takes a little bit more time and work to apply it to all the areas you desire because of it&#x27;s butter form, but it is way better than any amount of lotion you could ever use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how</li>
            <li> I put the shea butter in a large glass measuring cup and then placed the cup in a pot of very hot water.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, melts easily and blends well with other butters and/or oils.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter from other vendors, but this one is by far the smoothest &amp; most effective.</li>
            <li> While I like the other brand, I absolutely LOVE Better Shea Butter&#x27;s brand; it is not whipped (the Whole Foods brand was) and was soft, pliable, easy to apply to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the pure shea butter from a chain store specializing in cosmetics for a much higher price and not such a user friendly product but because I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li> Luxurious, moisturizing, and pure heaven!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily right now</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily right now</li>
            <li> And the feel is also and moister too-not grainy and kind of dry like the</li>
            <li> It is wonderfully soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> One daughter liked it so much I bought a second order to give her.</li>
            <li> This shea butter, Estee Lauder Advance Night Serum, and CUCUMBER infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE EYE BRIGHTENING Gel make a great combination for a facial regimen.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to use</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and it was clear of particles and visible impurities.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the Better Shea Butter and would recommend it to anyone who wants to naturally moisturize their skin.</li>
            <li> Soft texture, easy to incorporate into my recipes.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few lotions and will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the extra money for sure.</li>
            <li> As a surfer and fisherman, I need a product that&#x27;s effective on my dry and sun baked skin.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this Shea butter was soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve been oil cleansing with Jamaican black castor oil and coconut oil (2:1 ratio) and my skin looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and really acceptable.  </li>
            <li> it became soft smooth and fresh just by days of use...</li>
            <li> I use this in a homeade body butter, mixes really well, and is so soft, love it.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be incredibly effective on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> its worth it for her to have soft smooth hair.</li>
            <li> so I feel that I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth through Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Because of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been making my own natural lotions for awhile now.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with different oils and feels great on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with and soft.</li>
            <li> and it turned out great, although it took a lot of essential oils to cover up the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34;, and odor is still present.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently experimenting with organic, nbatural recipes for &amp;#34;body lotion bars&amp;#34; and this product was a great addition to my Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, Organic Bees Wax, Vitamin E, and drops of an essential oil.</li>
            <li> I like this shea butter a lot because it is so soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> &quot; Using the product at night on my dry hands, I noticed that it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; onto your skin nicely with body temperature.</li>
            <li> is soft like soap, so easy to cut by knife.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick, the shea arrived packaged in a clear zip bag, inside of the brown zip bag.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and came packaged really well.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter has a fresh, natural smell and melts in your hand to a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> and I can tell the company is fabulous based on the aforementioned light beams.</li>
            <li> It was soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> , it looks nice, the bag is durable and it&#x27;s within another bag inside that one to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is soft and easy to break apart by hand.  </li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are natural and easy to get.  </li>
            <li> Its a soft butter and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> your hair will look more lively this a product that I highly recommend aND can&#x27;t wait to get my moving situation in order</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer, however it didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It was very hard to apply and messy.&lt;br /&gt;Part</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth without being oily.</li>
            <li> my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> after I measure the amount that the recipe calls for, I rub my hands and legs with the butter that gets stuck in my utensils, leaving my skin very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Shea came packaged well and seems to be very pure - this is my first experience ever with Shea</li>
            <li> A very light natural scent that can easily compliment essential oils.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to cut and distributed into separate containers, mixes very well with other oils, melts easily over a steam bath while maintaining it&#x27;s rich Shea butter smell.  </li>
            <li> But after a few days of use, my skin is looking better than ever and has not broken out at all!!!!</li>
            <li> Rub briskly between hands to melt, then smooth over body, off to bed, and wake up with baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems, love the product!</li>
            <li> Came as expected - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> After that take off and let cool on a hot pad, follow your recipe directions to water ever you are doing to know how far to let cool.  </li>

            <li> The shea butter is the only ingredient I cant find in Mexico and  It is very important to me to bring it from the US.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Received this product very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is very smooth and not gritty.</li>
            <li> Very high quality!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a double broiler, so I used a pot and then a glass Pyrex round bowl that would fit on top of the pot nicely.</li>
            <li> The ointment is very thick, odorless and its very good quality.</li>
            <li> Once I started using your Raw Shea Butter the darkness of stretch marks &amp; scars start to disappear and my own complexion returned!</li>
            <li> My mother bought it first and made certain that I bought one as well!</li>
            <li> This company has been more attentive than any other company I&#x27;ve bought from on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product - the first batch I ordered lasted for nearly one year and kept perfectly after opening in a sealed ziplock that it came in, kept in a dark, cool</li>
            <li> I had pored over the reviews for this shea butter as well as other brands and was satisfied that all the reviews were genuine.</li>
            <li> I had pored over the reviews for this shea butter as well as other brands and was satisfied that all the reviews were genuine.</li>
            <li> Plus for 16 dollars for a pound is a good deal when other companies sell lower quality for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a few days after making the leave in smell to change, it&#x27;s pretty pleasant now and the smell is less strong and more like the coconut oil and avocado oil used in my leave in.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s a large block, so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is pure, fresh and does not have any filler agents.  </li>
            <li> But now I am living somewhere very dry, and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Besides that minor issue, I&#x27;m looking forward to using the recipes in the ebook, which btw, was very easy to download and access--just have your order ID #.</li>
            <li> But I love mostly all Raw Shea Butter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast, the ebook is very helpful and the product is A 1 !!</li>
            <li> I then cover that nutty smell by applying a little bit of coconut oil on my face (which is also good for skin).</li>
            <li> I loved how this felt, but the smell was a little overpowering for my taste.</li>
            <li> Good ju-ju in this little package of butter.</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift for individuals with skin allergies, sensitivities and fashionistas who like raw product!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to try new recipes with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m still not very skilled at picking out good shea butter, but what I received from this company was nicer than what I got before.  </li>
            <li> So I searched high and low for the best natural alternative and kept coming back to Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I can stretch it to make my favorite hair products to my liking when I mix with different organic oils</li>
            <li> I personally like the scent although I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results I am seeing and will continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> this is exactly the product i was looking for.  </li>

            <li> read so much about essential oils and homemade body lotion and soaps that I was ready to make my own.  </li>

            <li> exactly as it looks in the picture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter</li>

            <li> The product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make homemade whipped body butter for the first time.</li>

            <li> so I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Love both the ivory and yellow Shea butters.  </li>
            <li> The color is close to a light dirt, the smell has a smoky scent to it and the texture is rather soft.  </li>
            <li> I tried a lavender body butter at first, but the lavender was just overpowered by the shea.</li>
            <li> I look forward to making more purchases in the future!</li>

            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> I have a lot more left over</li>
            <li> , I know exactly what&#x27;s in it!&lt;br /&gt;Since my order did not come with the booklet,</li>
            <li> My initial concern was that I would not get authentic  Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Shipped prompt, product exactly as described-easy to use.</li>
            <li> High quality product!!</li>
            <li> I thought that after I made the recipe and added the essential oils that the smell would be better</li>
            <li> Unlike the picture, as it melted it did not turn a pretty amber liquied but it was kinda of greenish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was recommended to me by a fellow essential oil user and I am so glad she recommended</li>
            <li> This was my  first time to order Shea butter.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks the finished product has a better scent than just the Shea butter without the essential oil added!</li>
            <li> I will be making much more of body and face creams in the future!</li>
            <li> This was my first time handling Shea.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product!  :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as explained</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered it, I added jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> At first I was leery about buying this product because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I end up giving this product a chance because it said exactly what I was looking for in a Shea Butter product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering Shea butter online.</li>
            <li> But this is my first time using an ivory colored one.</li>
            <li> Mine was pretty green/brown in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this in my first DIY sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> arrives exactly as pictured-</li>
            <li> First on myself then on my son</li>
            <li> This Shea butter wasn&#x27;t white, but more of an off-white or ivory color.</li>
            <li> FIRST, the Shea butter is heavenly to work with.</li>
            <li> Not only was I able to make a 1-2mo supply of body lotion, I was also able to make a 1-2mo supply of facial exfoliant and night cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My first night with it, I just slathered the shea butter in my hair and on my face &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; and went to bed.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on a product ever</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the ivory</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer, brighter, and moist!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It arrived via Amazon boxed and in the packaging exactly as shown in its photo.</li>
            <li> Despite the steep price, I was highly satisfied and will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely order this product again.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say I wasn&#x27;t very happy with this batch of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> i was able to get a response via email within a day.&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely purchase from them (and probably will)</li>
            <li> I love it on my face and feet especially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be melted in microwave if needed although I prefer not to to that as it condenses after cooling and gets more solid if you plan on using it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning I compare them, the finger skin on the hand which I put shea butter is obviously better.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> My skin is soooooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First time ever buying Shea butter</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> First time using unrefined.</li>
            <li> Only issue is if it was already diluted with oils because when it melted in my hands, it was more oily than shea I am used to getting.</li>
            <li> I liked the Shea Butter and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter like this</li>
            <li> I LOVE it as a facial moisturizer, because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary to use it on my face, but I can now say after use for a couple of weeks that I had no breakout at all, and my skin is looking wonderful</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured and has a nutty smell.</li>
            <li> This is the first time buying Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> made my first home made body butter with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recipe if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> It was pretty blocky at 1st</li>
            <li> It does not cause me to break out or become overly oily, just dewy, then I put regular moisturizer on top followed by my makeup.</li>
            <li> : argan oil goes on my skin first thing after a shower, then shea butter, then Kiehl&#x27;s body lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a massive amount that I am sure will take me through the summer.</li>
            <li> and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses.</li>
            <li> and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses.</li>
            <li> The first purchase was made through a friend.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Isabel!</li>
            <li> When I opened it up, it was exactly like the description said it would be.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li> i dont know what exactly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Shea butter before, but my first attempt ( sunscreen) turned out well,</li>
            <li> First time buyer from this vendor</li>
            <li> Quality Product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The shipping is always fast too!</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of body butter with it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty miraculous considering I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Shea butter expert but this seems pretty legit.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time ordering shea butter</li>
            <li> I made some cream with essential oils and thought I did ok.  </li>
            <li> product is exactly as stated</li>
            <li> I chose ivory because I read that ivory shea butter is higher quality, which I can&#x27;t confirm.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure of the consistency only because it&#x27;s not what I remember trying years ago.</li>
            <li> , i was sent an e-copy of different recipes and persisted to know whether i was pleased with the product or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Well, since I was younger, duh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this shea butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user.</li>
            <li> will definitely be making more of the recipes soon.</li>
            <li> These sunscreen bars are so pretty /</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it daily and LOVE it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> High quality Shea!!  </li>

            <li> Product came on time and was packaged exactly how the picture looks.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to but any more face products expect your standard face cleaner.</li>
            <li> Im actually pretty atractive and now that my face has cleared</li>
            <li> and I have a modeling agency interested in me.</li>
            <li> This seller ships exceptionally fast!</li>
            <li> The item itself, in my opinion is first rate.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t having to keep it in the bag it was first sealed</li>
            <li> Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right).</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely, and had there been any issues I am confident they would have been handled professionally-i was given several ways to contact them if I had been unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Better than using regular creams.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> But I love the product overall.</li>
            <li> , I emailed them about the different ways I could use the product and they sent the lovely Ebook.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter came in exactly like the seller described it</li>
            <li> and it does make the overall texture better for the use.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> So many options with different oils and scents.  </li>
            <li> I tried some of my favorite essential oils in hopes to disguise it...</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea butter</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see a free recipe book was included as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for my 1 year old, when it seemed like the coconut oil and lavender lotion I make for his eczema-prone skin was at times drying.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it immensely in even have my boyfriend hooked on it</li>
            <li> The product also came packaged exactly as it said in the description.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> She will be ordering more shortly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort, and anyone can do it!  </li>
            <li> I even did an experiment to make sure it was the shea butter making the difference in my acne - it definitely was.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Used it to make lotion with my essential oils :)</li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> I no longer buy commercial body moisturizers because that combination is better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time this past weekend to make some lotion bars and really loving this product!</li>
            <li> So MUCH!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing / using shea butter.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it were packaged in some type of solid container.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> my skin actually feels better hours</li>
            <li> First time user of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> I used to mix it with coconut oil first</li>
            <li> I like to ivocry shea a bit better than the yellow since it seems easier to melt and mix and its scent is not quite so overpowering.</li>
            <li> After the first use, her skin was so supple.</li>
            <li> the quality is exactly like the one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter</li>
            <li> With regular use, once every day to two days, my skin is noticeably softer and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite brand of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li> Just received this Shea butter in the mail and used it in my first balm recipe.  </li>
            <li> My Bug Bars did not melt, even in the hot car over summer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing shea butter</li>
            <li> Take note that this butter is higher priced because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s not certified organic.  </li>
            <li> I used it already in my first batch ever of Shea body butter.</li>
            <li> and it was remarkably better, and a week or so later it was virtually healed.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Being my first shea butter purchase,I didnt know the difference,NOW I DO.</li>
            <li> Packaging is exactly what&#x27;s needed-</li>
            <li> First...</li>
            <li> First I had to soften the Shea Butter in a blinder</li>
            <li> I have already forwarded the link to my family and friends and I will most definitely be purchasing this Shea Butter again.</li>

            <li> hair looks healthier after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why the scope of &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> The Shea butter arrived exactly as shown in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the unrefined organic butter</li>
            <li> First time to order shea butter</li>
            <li> I am using it in combination with essential oils and it is absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li> was my first attempt at making a whipped Shea butter peppermint cream and the results came out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We tried many different lotions and creams, even some recommended by pharmacists.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have used this first.</li>
            <li> So smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I will be using it to replace higher priced products purchased from a specialty store.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li> Its doing what it is supposed to do, only better.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s the consistency of packed brown sugar.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The end result was exactly what I hoped.</li>
            <li> My first order was in August 2014.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - We love this product and will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and she wants me to make a batch for her!</li>
            <li> Was exactly as promised</li>
            <li> I just made my first whipped shea butter recipe</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> but I most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely  buy again!</li>
            <li> so there was a good amount of product missing.</li>
            <li> It is still in the package, but even through the wrap it smells so good compared with previous pure Shea butter I have used.</li>
            <li> Easily blends into products and is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the Better Shea Butter brand because the size is a bit more reasonable for someone looking to use the products themselves rather than to make other products to sell.</li>
            <li> The package shipped quickly ,weighed, and the product is exactly the high quality i was seeking.</li>
            <li> It is very good for wrinkles as I am told I look 10 years or less younger.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, arrived quickly, in the condition I expected, and has lasted a long time in my homemade EO recipes.  </li>
            <li> Even if some are old, I&#x27;m sure they still have &#x27;new&#x27; on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking into healthier more natural ways to moisturize my skin and being new to all of the options, I appreciate having the recipes.</li>
            <li> It creates such a great barrier on your skin to things that dry it out.</li>
            <li> so it is so easy to keep fresh and use daily.</li>
            <li> If you want an economical, all natural, vegetarian, super luxurious moisterizer this is it.</li>
            <li> I applied some on my skin as soon as I opened the package and upon first impression it smells good (not strong) and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be providing good moisturization for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> Can in a bag as a brick, soft , smells good, works wonders with dry skin</li>
            <li> This butter is VERY rich still but not as greasy and actually after about 15-20 minutes absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive before putting the butter on my face because my face is very sensitive to any facial products, but it liked the shea butter.</li>
            <li> 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter - Best Organic African Grade A Ivory - Pure and Natural for Use on Skin and Hair - Rich in Vitamins A &amp;</li>
            <li> I emailed them with a question and they responded right away and were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> chose this particular brand because of all the positive Amazon reviews that this was a superior product when compared to other shea butters.</li>
            <li> Very fine, so easy to rub on once it&#x27;s small amounts at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit up front that this is my first time using unrefined shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands or sellers, but this shea butter is so amazing I will not be purchasing from anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made only one body butter so far but plan to make more!</li>
            <li> ; - it&#x27;s too good to mess with!</li>
            <li> I opened it right away and scooped some out with my finger and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> is a light green, very, very light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - Keep in mind as much as I praise this product and will most likely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - Keep in mind as much as I praise this product and will most likely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m well aware that good raw shea butter should have a nutty smell (almost like roasted)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a staple in all my lotions; great for rejuvenating older, dried out skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand for the first time because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> To Make Whipped Body Butter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and fitting a smaller bowl inside.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, I create my own skin balm</li>
            <li> I make my own creams and other things with it.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was nice, the butter was wrapped in plastic and came inside another bag so my other products didn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li> And mixes well with the other oils.it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Allegedly shea is a natural UV inhibitor, which if true is a nice bonus, but I don&#x27;t know what sort of SPF it achieves</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with some other organic ingredients to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use it, it does have an earthy natural smell...</li>
            <li> Melts nicely, and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> I have liked the quality compared to other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I am just now getting into making my own lotions and other household items for cleaning etc.</li>
            <li> It melts really nicely when you are combining it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I get excited when I get a new product and tend to use too much, so I took it easier with this</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and I quickly took some and mixed it with coconut oil, and a little olive oil to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li> Makes a very good intense moisture for rough dry skin.</li>
            <li> After using this cocoa butter for a week, My hand and arm started to come back to its original tone!</li>
            <li> This product works great as an everyday moisturizer (I use it every night and every morning, but you may want to let it sit for a while before putting on makeup if you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> This is great Shea Butter, not real odoriferous, can be covered up with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my crazy dry face, on my hands, and I have used it on burns with great results.</li>
            <li> Although the butter was solid, I was able to cut through it easily with a butter knife in order to place the pieces in several containers.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and will definitely order again when I need more</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really use it, especially if I&#x27;m going out (when I need it most).</li>
            <li> It blends nicely with anything that I&#x27;ve mixed it with so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I spent everyday in the pool and ocean and this was the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I made a salve and used coconut oil that is really smelly:) I will buy this product again definitely!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person who wants something that looks and feels more like a commercial lotion, you might want to consider something that has already been whipped and packaged in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This butter is smooth and mixes well with all of my oils and conditioners resulting it a whipped edition that is fluffy and light like whipped cream!</li>
            <li> Not only is this priced really well for the amount you get but the customer service is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shea butter with coconut oil on my skin for about two weeks now and you can really tell the difference I love it and will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li> They are very customer oriented and I will be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> Soft enough to make my own skin and hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked it so far and will continue to come back here when I run out.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only made one kind</li>
            <li> Next day feet are relaxed and ready for more miles.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> The recipes that come with this via e-book are also awesome, I am so thankful to find such a high quality product, I will buy only from this seller in future!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It is my first time buying shea butter, and I&#x27;m happy to have it to try various natural recipes, such as lip balm.</li>
            <li> I chose this shea butter because from the pictures it looks really fresh and high quality.</li>
            <li> This is  clearly a high quality Shea butter, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on how to treat dry skin naturally and found many great reviews about shea butter.  </li>
            <li> No strong smell at all, just good ol&#x27; Shea butter smell (mild, natural scent).  </li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> When I said I really didnt like it much they apologized and refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li> I received it way before expected, and was able to dowload the receipes right  </li>
            <li> It feels good to know I&#x27;m using one of God&#x27;s pure creations, raw, unrefined, and non-toxic.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick and the information and various recipes provided were very helpful!  </li>
            <li> However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day.  </li>
            <li> However, despite all the positive comments posted here, I have to say that I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to fall into the trap of ignoring the warnings in favor of positive news.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing positive results after one week of use.</li>
            <li> The reviews were positive which is why I ordered the item.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews, I ordered the shea butter.  </li>
            <li> but my experience has been nothing but positive.  </li>
            <li> A positive purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The first time i didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase &amp; will definitely come back when this very generous block of shea is gone!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have tried other shea butters on amazon, but this one is smooth and melts into a non-gritty smooth oil.</li>
            <li> It blends really well after it&#x27;s softened in a hot water bath.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged and would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using straight Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> (more ingredients from Uranus) lotions or creams helped in the long haul nor did they start to HEAL my skin (I was hideous).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shea butter was reasonably priced and I revived exactly was was in the picture.</li>
            <li> For that, I pretty much douse my feet and put on socks before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shea butter came exactly as it was advertised, and all 3 products were packed very well in an Amazon cardboard box, so I had no issues with melting, damage, or anything else.  </li>
            <li> They LOVE it, and it has helped a couple of friends solve minor skin issues they&#x27;ve been battling for years.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because I am very inspired with the results of my first days of shea butter usage.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell, but either way, it fades within the first hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product alone or combined with other oils, and it keeps my body butters whipped and creamy, instead of allowing them to melt back into oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered some of their other products as well and expect the same great quality.</li>
            <li> This product is cost effective, because I am saving so much money on other products.</li>
            <li> I received it very promptly and it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thanks  so much!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, soft, and comfortable, and glows like it never has in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first received it, it smelled very smoky.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperoxidase (natural preservative), Jojoba Oil, Vegetable Squalene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Phospholipids (from soy lecithin), Potassium Sorbate, Vitamin A (as Retinyl Palmitate), D-Panthenol, Grapefruit Oil, Lime Oil, Natural Vanilla Extract and Natural Orange-Grapefruit Citrus</li>
            <li> Takes some experimentation with all the other ingredients I&#x27;m using but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The Butter is solid more or less at room temperature, but it melts very easily in your hand without heating.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Raw Shea Butter and the Free Body Butter Recipes eBook.  </li>
            <li> I was going to melt it down and make my own &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - the heck with that, I&#x27;m just using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I just started down the path of making my own lotion bars, needed some shea butter and found this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I am going to try cocoa butter next time to see if that suits my particular desires better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great and affordable raw Shea butter!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this extraordinary product for its high quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It melts so quickly and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> With most lotions my skin will be dry in an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin feels much more moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Super emollient and soft.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, softens my face, and temporary relieves my back pain.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands, and it&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> It was well packed and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly and leaves your skin feeling so buttery soft.</li>
            <li> Make sure you store it in a dry place.</li>
            <li> I use this to make lotion and it is easy to use and the packaging is simple.</li>
            <li> The Shae Butter was exactly what I expected, the color the smell, all lovely.</li>
            <li> but it rubs in so easy and lasts through several hand washes.</li>
            <li> It melted quickly and was perfectly clear with no specks of residue in it.</li>
            <li> Plus, the entire bar fits easily inside.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin was super soft and seemed firmer.</li>
            <li> , I have to say that the attention in sending my order quickly, and the follow-up with my order informing me that I could receive a free-download of recipes, was quite unexpected.  </li>
            <li> and he has since been dry patch free!  </li>
            <li> then I put dry jammies over top of the cotton ones.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Butter on from head to toe and it keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> My skin was cracking and peeling, as I have dry skin in the winter that is aggravated even more with the acne medication creams I use.</li>
            <li> The scent is very, very mild and so you could easily add whatever essential oil you would like to and customize the fragrance of your final product.</li>
            <li> However, over the last 2 months, since using my whipped body butter with this shea butter, my skin has consistently felt silky smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin quickly and keeps skin soft.  </li>
            <li> It is solid, yet so creamy and warms up easily in your hands.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter comes in a plastic Ziploc bag that you can continue to use or you can easily remove the butter and store it somewhere different.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily cut into smaller sizes as needed.</li>
            <li> I think it is more moisturizing than coconut oil and has helped with my dry itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product is mild and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> Very decent for the price.  </li>
            <li> I tried melting it, and applying A LOT of essential oils and carrier oils to mask the strong rancid smell, but nope, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> It does have a sort of rubbery/nutty smell which needs a strong fragrance or essential oil to cover it.</li>
            <li> This product willl last a good long while.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell when I open the bag.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, but because you have to warm it up, you tend to use more.</li>
            <li> Great for melting down and adding essential oils too.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well and melted down nicely (with no residue at all) to make the body butter.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance and purchased Better Shea Butter&#x27;s 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter online and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was able to comb it through without one single tear from my daughter or myself.</li>
            <li> I have never used pure Shea Butter before</li>
            <li> Comes in large rectangular cube.  </li>
            <li> I have never used pure Shea Butter before...</li>
            <li> It feels like pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li> is that its ORGANIC and PURE.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple of times, and will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple of times, and will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> So pure and creamy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago, along with some pure tea tree oil and some pure coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Beautifully pure product.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells pure.  </li>
            <li> Made 2 large batches with my recipe.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to soften it and put into a large glass jar.</li>
            <li> I have certainly found my supplier for Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I just keep the block in a large ziplock and squeeze pull pieces off as needed</li>
            <li> It is pure.</li>
            <li> Pure Fractionated Coconut oil or&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is truly pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I also have used pure unrefined shea butter on my face before</li>
            <li> Pure.</li>
            <li> Pure, Organic and unrefined just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I placed my order for this after reading many of the other positive reviews, and although I have not yet used the product (I intend too real soon!)</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and the winters are so hash on my skin!!</li>
            <li> I use it by itself and I have also mixed some with lavender oil to calm me after a nice long bath before bed.</li>
            <li> We are a natural chemical free family and this shea butter is now something we cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying trying new recipes by mixing in essential oils.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and pliable and creates a very creamy product when used in your recipes.  </li>
            <li> depending on the ambient temperature where you live (it&#x27;s about 70 here right now)</li>
            <li> I mixed some olive oil and essential oils with it from a &amp;#34;recipe book&amp;#34; and it turned out fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the bars and the fact that there are only all natural ingredients in my bars!</li>
            <li> Also works just fine by itself as facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (I was worried my hair would be greasy afterward or that I would have to shampoo multiple times but it was fine.</li>
            <li> I already &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; up a body cream using avocado oil and lavender and can not emphasize how much better my dry skin feels!</li>

            <li> I suffer from moderate psoriasis and have found that this Shea butter keeps my skin so soft and helps tremendously with the itching and inflammation!!</li>

            <li> and they sent it for free without the hassle of sending the item back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of chemical free.</li>
            <li> but this product is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Just 90 seconds in the microwave depending on how much you are using-I am using a lot each time since I cover my whole body in it.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a cream to moisturize my face and for the longest time did not have much luck.  </li>
            <li> I did use some shea butter on my husband&#x27;s knuckles which is very close to psoriasis and his knuckles have improved so much.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li> i would buy it again and really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really delivers.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to mix it up into whipped butter</li>
            <li> I applied the butter as direction; It really helps.</li>
            <li> Thanks you.</li>
            <li> This butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I plan to test some competitors before committing to paying this much.  </li>
            <li> I even used a whole bottle of 100% lemon oil and it still smelled.</li>
            <li> It had a much stronger scent.  </li>
            <li> Used essential oils to give it some scent &amp; it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> Hahahaha when you Step out ..</li>
            <li> I really like this product...</li>
            <li> Once I opened it, ready to use, the smell was not the nutty aroma that I am use to, it had a rancid smell.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps my 60</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and gently melted the shea butter.</li>
            <li> I think that really is just something I&#x27;ll need to get used to and adjust my recipes</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and was just as described.  </li>
            <li> the smell of this isn&#x27;t very pleasing either, but if it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s for people with intense skin issues, because it is /extremely/ moisturizing and oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this company and the product.</li>
            <li> but it is so much easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need to with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I believe this company would be very helpful.</li>
            <li> It went the length of the whole block</li>
            <li> I bought it for making lip balms, but I&#x27;ve ended up just using it straight on my skin because it feels luxurious.</li>
            <li> It came very well packaged just as shown in the picture - the shea butter is in sealed plastic within another bag that zip locks.  </li>
            <li> The color and texture of the entire block is uniform and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first product where I see and feel a great difference in skin texture after using it (and it&#x27;s only been a few days!).</li>
            <li> emails were very helpful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However, I find myself just pinching off a piece, warming it in my hands and using it straight from the container.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The seller really cares about quality, and it shows.</li>
            <li> Very absorbant into the skin.</li>
            <li> It was very grainy and crumbly.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li> It does cost a bit more than others, but not much</li>
            <li> I really appreciate companies that take the time to ask customers about their opinions.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and healing.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it came well-sealed in a foil, re-sealable bag, soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> Customer service really made up for the product failure.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be much</li>
            <li> Thanks to a friend who told me ab it.out</li>
            <li> reasonable price for quality product</li>
            <li> Being that Shea butter is naturally oily, this Ivory Shea has still left my skin oily from time to time, but I mostly blame that on myself for applying too much, or even not applying it evenly on my face.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though if you wanted to just use it for lotion straight out of the package, the packaging wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue.</li>
            <li> really impresses me is the customer service.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , she was very helpful</li>
            <li> My somewhat finicky kinky/curly/wavy hair drinks it up and shea butter keeps it very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> With this shea butter the end product was very calming to my skin and the feel is much softer.</li>
            <li> So much shea butter for the price.</li>
            <li> Very decadent</li>
            <li> however its very coating (I don&#x27;t want to say waxy, because it&#x27;s not that</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter the very next day after it had shipped, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and this has really helped reduce how much my scar stands out.</li>
            <li> and that was after cleaning and having to really wash my hands.</li>
            <li> We use it at night mostly, I put a generous amount of shea butter all over my daughter, then put wet cotton scratch</li>
            <li> This really helps the shea butter to fully absorb into her skin.</li>
            <li> this product has been the only thing that works for me (keeping breakouts away, skin smooth and well nourished)</li>
            <li> The lotions absorb very well into my skin and have left it feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> The seller also reached out to me about my purchase, which was appreciated.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the 100% real stuff</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> It really helps my dryness.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for a friend going through chemo as well.</li>
            <li> Way too much.</li>
            <li> It has performed very well</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have ordered twice.</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying the shea butter + jojoba oil (purchased from whole foods)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard and read that it can really help.</li>
            <li> After much reading and reviewing I decided to give it a go and ordered some.</li>
            <li> trying see if it really helps with acne on face.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Sweetest people as well and really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> I promise your skin will look very radiant</li>
            <li> it gets my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li> but the smell overpowered my whole recipe.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and really works.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Keeps me very mousturized.</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin much easier this way, too.  </li>
            <li> It is packaged very well and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, I would recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> they actually emailed to remind me of the free recipe e-book that comes with the purchase of this butter</li>
            <li> Really we&#x27;ll packed to protect freshness and prevent damage.</li>
            <li> I received my order very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my skin out so much.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about Shea butter</li>
            <li> Definitely real Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> A one pound bag will carry my family through the whole winter.</li>
            <li> You can just tell by the light color and sometimes gritty texture (until you heat it in your hands).</li>
            <li> it can be used on your skin straight up as a lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Better than expected since it was Christmas eve.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use it straight on my skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Very luscious piece of shea butter.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter melts smoothly and incorporated well with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>

            <li> and I really like it.</li>

            <li> However, it seems to have worked very well for making the body products I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a very helpful download to help you get started making creams to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> She is very responsive and helpful.  </li>
            <li> And I must agree that is is very creamy to the touch.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well (not in a plastic tub thank goodness) and very neatly done.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the product considering it was SO much cheaper than the organic Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It goes on skin very well.</li>
            <li> Always arrives fast too.</li>
            <li> And the butter seems to just soak up into your skin so fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> He loves it so much that even takes it with him on overnight visits with his friends.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Product is well packaged and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The sellers are really responsive to questions or emails.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, I&#x27;m not like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> thank you for this high quality product!</li>
            <li> Have used it on my heels that were very dry/cracked and what a difference.  </li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your speedy response and delivery.</li>
            <li> It is oily but absorbs fast</li>
            <li> its texture is much smoother and softer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay a fortune for products that are 1% shea when you can get 100% shea at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> One final note, the vendor also provides a free shea butter recipe booklet....</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Butter from various sources for years primarily on my hands...</li>
            <li> This is the only shea butter I feel comfortable putting on my face, and I do believe the seller&#x27;s claim that it is non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packaged.</li>
            <li> In an uncharacteristic fit of excess I sprang for this one instead and ohhhh my gods above and below, it&#x27;s heavenly.</li>
            <li> you want a high quality Unrefined Organic Shea Butter, this is the one to buy!  </li>
            <li> but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li> Works really well in my lotion recipe or by itself.</li>
            <li> but this is a sign that it is a real one not processed.  </li>
            <li> Very neatly packaged, not messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After, skin is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face has a very shiny look.  </li>
            <li> I had a crease on my cheek that was really bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It helped me make a fantastic batch of chapsticks and will be going in my deodorant project next!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t really describe the scene</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter worked very well, and I have plans on ordering from this supplier again when I run out.  </li>
            <li> It came packaged very well</li>
            <li> Buttery, non-greasy, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very please customer</li>
            <li> Packaged simply, but wrapped securely.</li>
            <li> Also, they followed up soon after to check on my level of satisfaction, appreciated that.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I am ready to make lotions, sunscreeen and balm now.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling fantastic</li>
            <li> which is why I don&#x27;t have to apply too much of it to get my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This isnt the real shea butter that comes from my homeland, but it works for the time being.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the body butter e-book included.</li>
            <li> I already had which makes the shea butter go on smoother plus really hydrates.</li>
            <li> and it stayed very moist as it drys</li>
            <li> I did not need a detangler , I have very course hair after I put it on</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and each and every time I apply a cream/moisturizer to my face, I&#x27;d break out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this shea butter.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It works really well to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and just what my skin needed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, well packed and comes with a recipe book you can download.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> When I used it I didn&#x27;t notice it much, but I did notice it when my wife used it.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling very optimistic about it.</li>
            <li> Google shea butter deodorant recipes and get yourself off the fast track to diseases caused by store-bought</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really help.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Mixed with some organic bees wax and coconut oil, it makes a killer petroleum free pomade.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> And the seller was very helpful.</li>
            <li> The book is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very granular.</li>
            <li> This product went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> It melted smoothly and evenly in a double boiler.</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was also having problems with psoriasis, and putting this Shea butter on has made my skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very greasy going on (night time)</li>
            <li> but I will absolutely reorder from this vendor when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and spent alot of money to try to heal her skin.  </li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, I will be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny, my hands and face are deeply moisturized and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I made a nice whipped shea butter with it and use everyday on my hair, skin, and even as a diaper cream butter for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it mixed with extra virgin coconut oil and olive oil to make a nice whipped skin butter</li>
            <li> Will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Love it, natural with multiple properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put mine in a tin (like Altoids) and let it sit in the sun for a few minutes to warm up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a few lotions with this so far and have loved the results.</li>
            <li> My skin is much better - soft and moisturized and I apply only every 2 day!</li>
            <li> The best dark spot ever it doesn&#x27;t reduce dark spot but remove completely all you need its patience because it takes time.</li>
            <li> I melt it to make my own facial night moisturizer adding essential oils to it.  </li>
            <li> I started making my own lotions and shaving creams and will never go back to using commercial moisturizers/shaving creams again.</li>
            <li> I have had a few questions about recipes and have gotten prompt, thorough, courteous responses every-time.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft shea butter, much better than what I have purchased elsewhere before.  </li>
            <li> Much better than anything I have bought at the stores, my skin feels soft and supple after using it, this definitely a daily thing I will use and I will continue ordering this when I run out.</li>
            <li> First use was smooth and super moisturizing but after it &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a bit it was a little grainy - could&#x27;ve been from the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It does smell buttery as true Shea Butter and feels soft and not hard like a brick.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> shea butter has a very smooth texture, but I found it to be a bit crumblier than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is such a high quality product and I will definitely be buying again when I need more!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> wow !!!</li>
            <li> The recipes all look worth a try, but for now I&#x27;m so enjoying the plain Shea butter that I&#x27;m a purist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m much happier using something natural like this Shea Butter, or mixing it with a few other ingredients to create a wonderful &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is creamy and looks very fresh, and unrefined is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> other reviewers say the seller is super friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li> it is soft and usable right from the package.  </li>
            <li> It is soft right out of the package.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known how easy it was to mix a long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to try several of them - lip balm, intense moisturizer, shave cream, mask...</li>
            <li> It turned out great, very creamy, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin was very soft and no sign of dryness after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this particular one because it was a similar price of another I was considering, except that I would save with free shipping.</li>
            <li> The yellow butter is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> After I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair conditioner recipe with some other oils, it looked better.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make homemade body butter and it turned out better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> To use it, I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than I even expected!</li>
            <li> The seller has also been in contact with me about the product, and about whether or not the e-book downloaded properly, which I am not sure of because I lost the cute card the link came on. :-)</li>
            <li> The other ones were grainy and this is buttery smooth!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from Better Shea Butter, and it will likely not be the last.</li>
            <li> Now when I put a lot more on my sons eczema spots and at first it was a little oily</li>
            <li> Much better than any other shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so Im susceptible to infection more so than other people.</li>
            <li> (  I first ordered the Better Shea Butter &amp;#34;100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter - African Grade A Ivory&amp;#34; back in Feb 2015.  </li>
            <li> When I received the package, I was excited to open it and begin using it.</li>
            <li> In only 2 days I could tell a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I love adding it in lotions, shampoos and other hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> Its smoother and more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love this Shea and all their other products they offer.</li>
            <li> I love that it mixes well with my other oils</li>
            <li> I use just a small amount on my face each day and my skin is looking so much better!</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell you this is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This worked on the skin better than all the other medicated creams that we tried...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I spent a little bit more for a pure product I could trust</li>
            <li> I never had raw shea butter before and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I use raw unrefined shea butter to make my own whipped shea butter cream, which I use for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with raw shea butter and oils.</li>
            <li> I really liked that this product was raw, unrefined and organic.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for too long yet, but so far it works better than any cream</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for my natural african american hair, i love it and will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too, keeping my skin soft most of the day.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the way the Shea is packaged-plastic wrapped carefully to keep it super fresh and then in a manilla padded envelope.</li>
            <li> Great, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The butter was clean, solid and smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Left him with a clean shaved  and moisturized face.</li>
            <li> I started making my own organic body butter and the smell of the shea butter is so strong that although my body butter turned out good the smell is awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 although I bought in mainly for the scars on my feet, I&#x27;m using it on my forearms to help with old scaring from playing with my cat and miscellaneous other scars, I&#x27;m also using it for my skin care on my face, the two products have made remarkable difference and is really working well on a wrinkle line and lines I had been getting on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, but shea butter, in combination with a few other products, helps keep her hair happy and healthy.</li>
            <li> I melt it down a little..personal preference but good overall.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve read some other reviews that say the older the more rancid it will smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as high of a quality as i was expecting for paying as much as i did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I will absolutely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly, arrived exactly as pictured (small brown bag with the Shea in it), and the actual butter itself is of great quality (as far as I can tell,</li>
            <li> The product came fast and is a high quality.</li>
            <li> My skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been since I&#x27;ve been using raw shea buttter soap to wash head to toe, grapeseed oil to moisturize, and this raw shea butter to seal in the moisture and add the softest texture to my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many Shea butters from different web sites and this one is definitely not 100% pure.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and leaves my skin soft!!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter itself is soft enough to scoop out easily with a spoon, even a plastic one</li>
            <li> It is gentle, smells slightly nutty and makes my face feel and look much better.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this company enough for their super high quality shea!</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging that the product comes in and that it&#x27;s double bagged so everything isn&#x27;t super greasy from the shea.</li>
            <li> Works for great for extreme dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Raw Shea Butter many times and this Raw Shea Butter is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  </li>
            <li> Most likely since it is raw &amp; organic, it is a tad grainy, and it has a fairly strong scent, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> new to using  pure shea butter  (trying to phase out chemically lotions in my life.)  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints whatsoever and will be a continued customer for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Beats the cheap store brands by a long shot</li>
            <li> I leaves the moist skin smooth long after application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short, sweet and to the point.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take the natural route first</li>
            <li> my first time using Shea butter and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> So after some research on Shea Butter, the white Shea is true Shea.</li>
            <li> The yellow is actually from a completely different tree, but it&#x27;s still good stuff.</li>
            <li> The product also comes with an ebook that tells you what the various ways to use it which is cool.</li>
            <li> Second time I get this butter, because my mom pretty much stole the first one.</li>
            <li> i received a nice letter, I&#x27;m not sure if it was automatic</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve already used it to make a jar of whipped shea with coconut oil, jojoba oil (to increase the shelf life) and sweet orange essential oil.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin even better than the yellow and this brand better than the other white butter</li>
            <li> Mix thoroughly and then add to cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture along with remaining jojoba/almond/olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;Place mixture in chilled bowl (which should still be resting above the ice bowl) and allow to cool for 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to deal with a small company that seems to care about their customers after the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I add 2 tsp of this to my deep conditioner, leave on with heat for 30 mins and then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well the product holds up on its own.</li>
            <li> When partially cool, add 1 part extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vegetable glycerin and essential oils in my recipe.</li>
            <li> I had never used Shea butter, the first one I ordered was very grainy and it only works if I melted it first.</li>
            <li> and it was kind of like a hair pomade consistency because it melted but didn&#x27;t disappear or melt completely into an oily mess.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my raw unrefined shea butter!!!</li>
            <li> Raw is the way to go for sure, it gives me soft skin in 1/2 the time of the white, refined shea butters you find in most stores.</li>
            <li> I mixed in the raw Shea butter with olive oil and almond together and my hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Fresh, easy to use, no added additives just plain Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Without going into all the details, I was able to put down my RX cream that I have been using for a year.</li>
            <li> This shea leaves my hair so soft and shiny and not limp at all for DAYS!!!!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is very creamy and easy to whip, the smell is nice and not stale - I had found that problem with other butters in the past and I am always nervous to open up a new package, but this shea butter smells fresh and sort of nutty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large amount, I&#x27;m sure I could use it for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t finish it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about it was the smell - it has a strong smell, almost like wet clay or plaster in an old house.  </li>
            <li> this butter good but not as expected as it would soften and smoothen my skin ( I have normal to dry)</li>
            <li> Once it was cool, I whipped the Shea butter with a little coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and argon oil.</li>
            <li> Live this brand!</li>
            <li> I live by this product !  </li>
            <li> AND I live in Guam, so thank you for that!  </li>
            <li> I learn a new way to use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Live this shea butter!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can make with this new shipment!</li>
            <li> , however I used a small amount on the back of my hand to feel it out and make sure my sensitive skin was ok with.</li>
            <li> Seemed really pure and natural to me!</li>
            <li> This shea butter gets absorbed quickly and does not leave that sticky feel as much other ones.</li>
            <li> As a first time user and an African American male with a complextion like Meagan Good that had issue with acne scars major hyperpigmentation blemishes and sum damage</li>
            <li> i really appreciated this and would recommend this company to anyone who is new to using shea butter.</li>
            <li> While I am new to straight shea butter</li>
            <li> As far as this product excuse me this amazing creation I have enjoyed how my skin has felt , no more itching!</li>
            <li> Trying to hydrate the skin enough that it isn&#x27;t so itchy so that the rashes have a chance to diminish is a process, however the fact I have a product I can now apply with no crying or discomfort whatsoever is huge.</li>
            <li> Previous brand had many pieces of debris throughout, so after it melted</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is used as a healthful product to smooth and hydrate dry and irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> And my dry skin was now moist and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> but this is even better that the stuff I had had previously.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a moisturizer that is toxic free but feeds my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, kudos for the quick ship.</li>
            <li> I have been able to whip it with essential oils for facial moisturizers and hand creams.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than all the money you spend on more expensive stuff that lasts a quarter of the time.</li>
            <li> Even when I wrote her back (3-4 times I think), she answered quickly.</li>
            <li> I need to use more essential oil next time</li>
            <li> use it as a moisturizer when my skin is particularly needy.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Once I explore more, I&#x27;m sure ill give 5 stars...</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this particular shea butter after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> It takes minimal effort to warm it up well enough to apply.</li>
            <li> I refuse to waste good essential oil just trying to mask the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I will use it with many essential oils for various uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> We process all of them the same way, and even if some look more grainy, we sell them because the end result is, in our opinion, the same.</li>
            <li> This last batch seems even more creamy than the last.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for lightening some scars that I have</li>
            <li> the only downside is I wish I was able to buy larger quantity in bulk-</li>
            <li> Such an outstanding moisturizer in every way possible.</li>
            <li> This was the main ingredient in a homemade lotion</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely order more of this shea butter for future recipes.</li>
            <li> My favorite is a facial cream recipe that I use and it definitely has messed wrinkles and dryness.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter and have ordered from several different sites over the years, but I will never from them again!  </li>
            <li> (  I tried this mixture and was pleased to see after several months it did start to diminish my deep marks.  </li>
            <li> I love that my bar came marbleized with yellow &amp; white shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I am just using it to make soap mainly.</li>
            <li> This product was soft, smooth only had a lite plsasent smell.</li>
            <li> The only way I was able to relieve the dryness has been constant application of oils and moisturizer and to limit handwashing and wearing rubber gloves.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff particularly because you can keep it in the resealable bag</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing although a bit gritty.</li>
            <li> i used this shea butter as a main component</li>
            <li> I go back and rub it in because my body warms it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in such a simple package.</li>
            <li> but this is a must have if you have very dry skin or just want a long lasting moisturizer for a great price.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to use, use a little or use the whole chunk for a large batch, the choice is yours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my dry skin (mainly my hands and elbows which get very dry during the winter/Spring) and it&#x27;s so much more effective than other lotions.</li>
            <li> that hardly ever happens, right :-).  </li>
            <li> Very absorbent and has made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really creamy and keeps my natural 3C hair moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft, and works well in sunblock too!</li>
            <li> I am very interested in looking for the recipes on the Ebook because I like to make my familys personal care products.</li>
            <li> It was a whole week early!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not unpleasant to me, however I suppose that can be a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought a very large plastic container to put the she butter in it, with raw unrefined organic coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, aura cacia tea tree oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oils and mix it in my blender until it was nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> I received my package right on time in a very neat simple packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had desperately dry skin for years and nothing much has helped except an ammonium lactate lotion that I realized is full of undesireable chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the smell (not offensive, just pretty strong and unfamiliar), but I&#x27;ve adjusted over the course of a week and now use shea butter on my hair, face, and body.</li>

            <li> And I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I can easily get at least ten more body butters and deodorant sticks out of this,</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but this is by far my favorite company</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of your other products, like the rose hip oil and lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more in the very near future.  </li>
            <li> I am completely awestruck at the change in my skin since I began using pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I have used raw shea butter before and loved it, could  not find it locally until I checked Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I received the raw shea butter yesterday and used it last night , I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good 100% raw organic shea butter, i would definitely recommend you to get this one</li>
            <li> I finally made my first batch of lotion!</li>
            <li> The product arrived a little melted but that is okay</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!!</li>
            <li> There are also many other similar competing products that are not atrociously expensive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to have the consistency of something along the lines of play dough but a little bit softer and those two things is what I found when I ordered my butter from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It actually looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping with the super dry conditions here in Texas.</li>
            <li> Lately I have used this particular brand/source and bottled my own to share with family and friends...</li>
            <li> Shea butter melt easily using double boiler, and later on when it becomes cream, the mix of Shea butter and coconut extra virgin oil that I made can easily glide on my skin &amp; not grainy as long as you heat it right using double boiler until it melt right.</li>
            <li> I have used one other shea butter, also a high quality raw organic, and am very pleased with this brand!  </li>
            <li> So far my child with the more mild eczema has shown such improvement, the little dry patches are visible but I can&#x27;t feel them anymore, which is huge progress.</li>
            <li> But when I used it I found it easy to cut, melt and mix with other oils.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to work with compared to the other brands.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter mixes easily with other oils.</li>
            <li> Pliable and easy to use as a skin conditioner or melt with other ingredients to make homemade lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I thought making my own lotions would be too hard to do, and didn&#x27;t think I had the time...</li>
            <li> I think the high quality of the shea butter was a big factor in the the success of this sunscreen recipe.</li>
            <li> So far with now much luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to make a natural deodorant which really works.</li>
            <li> BTW I am using this for a deodorant recipe and so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li> I really like it one thing that it does that I was surprised about it</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> The product was smooth was no grainy or rough texture.  </li>
            <li> Well so far I&#x27;m using it straight out of the packaging ... for myself.</li>
            <li> So far it is working really well</li>
            <li> They gave a free booklet with lots of recipes to print out, followed up to see if the product was what I expected</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now and the shea butter cream really helps seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my chemical sensitive daughter, and the whole family ended up using it.</li>
            <li> So far, everyone loves it almost as much as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the testing process, but so far I really like.</li>
            <li> also whipped with Argan oil for my daughter&#x27;s hair , it makes it soft and straight with no even greasiness .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very organic and natural, you can tell by the smell.</li>
            <li> I am happy as I don&#x27;t have to expensive skin care products.</li>
            <li> I use it straight on my hands like lotion after washing them, it hydrates, is soft, and not sticky (after it soaks in a bit).  </li>
            <li> No over powering smell, very moist and soft.</li>
            <li> Maybe that is normal, but I didn&#x27;t like working with it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Shea Butter&#x27;s scent was a bit powerful</li>
            <li> With body butters I will get a few more hours.</li>
            <li> It does have a stronger smell, normal for Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is normal?</li>
            <li> Gave this company a few more stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all shea butters normally do though.</li>
            <li> Also, the color is more grey than yellow.  </li>
            <li> consistent, unfortunately real unrefined shea butter comes with a price, which is getting different batches depending on the harvest.</li>
            <li> My shipments always arrive within a few days and it is always top quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and I have to say that this is the only I&#x27;ve found thus far that rehydrates your skin and does not break you out.</li>
            <li> so the consistency would turn out more firm at the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on myself a few times as well and love it.</li>
            <li> You can use it to make body butter, lip balm, salves, conditioner, and scrubs and more so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> I liked that it came in a thick plastic bag that I could heat up</li>
            <li> butter was very well package, melts quickly, absorbs very good on skin however, the smell is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to the shea butter party, but it feels like high quality shea butter (comparing it to shea butter from Sprouts).</li>
            <li> I have also melted it down and used in a few of my body lotions this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and am looking forward to using a pure and natural product on my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  off white color and the texture of playdough, made it very easy to work with and add other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic body butter for very dry skin in the colder months!</li>
            <li> I send the Better Shea Butter an email, if they could send me the link, I got the link in less then 24h!</li>
            <li> unlike others, it is not hard to scoop out desired amount.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this particular shea butter is that it needs little preparation and goes so smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li> but as it is handled or manipulated it morphs into a somewhat soft and at times liquid or oily form&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a super moisturizer/treatment for eczema without preservatives and found several recipes.</li>
            <li> Lasts and lasts, nice for just out of the shower or to mix with my African black soap.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is creamy and nice but it is way less than my last order.</li>
            <li> I needed something more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; than what I&#x27;ve been using for regular dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and the skin underneath is completely healed but he still has dry dead skin on top which I lightly rub off with a very soft wash cloth after his bath.</li>
            <li> I plan to gather a bunch of natural plant oils and mix them in with a few other things to see if I can get a really great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We use a very small amount on our very curly hair and it leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Everything was still entirely useable, the grains dissolve and absorb right in, but the texture wasn&#x27;t as divine.</li>
            <li> I am a truck driver, and driving on the road for hours, my left arm and hand gets darker than my right arm and hand.</li>
            <li> I use it right before going to bed and in the morning I can tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found the right combinations and strength of essential oils to use that will cover the Shea smell.</li>
            <li> I keep it in a cool dry place in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> Seems to heal minor scrapes and insect bites quickly.  </li>
            <li> stuff is an ingredient in many, if not most of the quality moisturizers on the market, and I&#x27;m starting to think that there are only a few key ingredients in moisturizers that really do anything and could work just fine on their own, but moisturizers blend in a bunch of filler ingredients to make it easier to use and save on cost.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and smells exactly like any other ivory African shea butter I bought.</li>
            <li> butter doesn&#x27;t take too long to melt and smells natural and clean.</li>
            <li> so it weighs down easily.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but after adding some essential oils, it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using raw shea butter, but the way it absorbs into my skin, moisturizes and softens is superior to any type of oil/butter/lotion I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> very dry, sensitive skin and this butter goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and provides all day moisture.</li>
            <li> It was very soft and the scent was not strong or overwhelming at all like others have said.</li>
            <li> It also came with a free download with other recipes.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m normally extremely, well, cheap, with the ingredients I buy for my beauty product projects.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was combining it with cocoa butter and coconut oil to make whipped body butter, so the smell was masked by the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not grainy like some other oils when it is applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> At first the smell seems odd, it&#x27;s kind of earthy, different from the synthetic scents you find in commercial products.</li>
            <li> I am new at using shea butter</li>
            <li> It is my new go to when m wholesaler is out.</li>
            <li> It may be my recipe that is the problem and haven&#x27;t tried a new one yet.  </li>
            <li> I live</li>
            <li> Looking forward to new recipes...</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I live in the States in the Midwest</li>
            <li> this is a new must have in my household.</li>
            <li> I have found my new go to place to order Shea butter.</li>
            <li> But I just put in a new plastic bag</li>
            <li> I live in California</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is getting colder where I live, so the shea does take a bit of working with, whether it be the brick or the face cream that I made, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> This is our families new miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at DIY moisturizers</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m new to Shea butter</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic resealable bag, says it&#x27;s new packaging, I don&#x27;t know what it use to come in.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my skin was suffering.</li>
            <li> The process of making it is naturally unpredictable and sometimes you will get a batch not as good as the other</li>
            <li> I loved the product entirely, except for it&#x27;s crumbly texture-- hard to use as is, except by picking up a crumb of it.  </li>
            <li> The butter is not as hard as I was expecting, which makes it very easy to take some off and melt in my hands while spreading it.  </li>
            <li> This is raw or unrefined shea butter which is better to make homemade body butter.</li>
            <li> And I love that the product is raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it raw, it does not melt easily as many have stated it does.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, just use the shea butter raw.</li>
            <li> both love the fact that this product is unrefined, raw and organic.</li>
            <li> this raw shea butter has diminished fine lines and dark spots better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The raw shea butter is great for really dry skin, and as a natural lip balm, because it&#x27;s more solid and less oily than if you whip it.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been a huge Shea butter fan for years) for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> I go to bed with it on my face and wake up with such amazingly smooth skin the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t as smooth (feels like sand is in it) as the last time I made it but as soon as I put it on my skin it melted instantly so no worries!</li>
            <li> If you are making your own beauty products or sunscreen a few drops of essential oil will take care of it.</li>
            <li> I expect this batch to last a while, but I can&#x27;t go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I made my own shea body butter from this stuff, added a few essential oils and it was LUXURIOUS.  </li>
            <li> Finally, after watching a few Youtube videos I decided I would attempt to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li> company contacted me (not in an annoying way) to make sure that my customer experience was a good one.</li>
            <li> The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected it is such a rich product</li>
            <li> This shea butter smells pretty much like other shea butter, with the hint of nutty scent which I like, but my family didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Made some lotion bars today with it today and it melted down just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and malleable like playdoh.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and buying lotion has always been a challenge for me.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> If your skin/hair type doesn&#x27;t absorb well, or you have very sensitive skin/hair, or skin/hair</li>
            <li> If your skin/hair type doesn&#x27;t absorb well, or you have very sensitive skin/hair, or skin/hair</li>
            <li> I use if for my toddler he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was very soft and not brick like some butters.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin, leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Very natural scent and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> My son is very, very sensitive to smells and he well tolerated it and was used to it after 3 applications.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Every night after a bath I slather it on after melting it in my hands and it has kept my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> found it very soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> It does keep my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, eczema and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> I may use a little more next time to have more lotion and less oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only experience with raw shea butter, but I already came back for more!  </li>
            <li> right mow, this chunk-o-butter arrived only soft, not melted though it had been on a carrier vehicle all day.</li>
            <li> Its thick but rubs into the skin pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It has a mild shea butter smell, (barely discernible), but if you don&#x27;t like the smell you could alway add an essential oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no negative reaction so far.  </li>
            <li> In about10 minutes, unless you used too much, it absorbs into the skin, leaving behind a slight sheen that is more matte than many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wild about the results!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used my body cream I made from this on my hair, my face, my body, my scalp and as a makeup remover!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> many small batches.</li>
            <li> The second order was nothing like the first.</li>
            <li> i could contact her directly if i had any questions or concerns!</li>
            <li> I added more drops than usual because the smell of this shea butter was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This butter is is completely smooth, and soft enough to mix in essential oil by hand.</li>
            <li> Its my first time ordering this specific brand and from this seller</li>
            <li> , so we have to essentially scrub the sink after shaving, but other than that it is really better than any store bought shaving cream</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> At last REAL Unrefined Organic Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> like I said, this is exactly what I want when making a basic whipped shea butter lotion for myself.</li>
            <li> and I have WICKED sensitive skin where EVERYTHING breaks me out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much better than what I&#x27;ve seen in local stores, which mainly only sell the yellow shea butter.</li>
            <li> I started using this shea butter and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter on my skin consistently for 2 months now and see a big improvement!</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars based on my first order of this product back in Feb 2015.  </li>
            <li> I was going to write a review after finishing the first pack but then thought perhaps I should wait to see how my second experience is with this product.</li>
            <li> First off, the re-order product was not in a ziplock, but rather in a regular plastic that when opened could NOT be resealed.</li>
            <li> and wow!  </li>
            <li> so this was my first purchase in several months.</li>
            <li> Better Shea butter is not gritty like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Afterall, it&#x27;s natural and should come with some smell!  </li>
            <li> chunk of shea butter is pretty big</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a jar or something to store small amounts of shea, then just refill the jar as needed.</li>
            <li> I put the lotions on in the morning and my skin stays soft all day!</li>
            <li> I will usually not add any fragance, because of allergies, but I will probably try some of the butter recipes that are on the website.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty terrific too!)</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the heavier shea butter I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Feels gritty at first</li>
            <li> This is the first and only time I have purchased shea butter.</li>
            <li> The legs shined only for the first 20 minutes, then the gloss was gone and the skin felt velvety to the touch.</li>
            <li> was surprised at the smell, but I think that&#x27;s normal for shea butter.</li>
            <li> After my quest to search for a natural remedy and using all the organic/natural products that exist out there for eczema; I must say that this shea butter is a MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Earlier this year, I started making my own skin lotion (for personal use) to combat skin dryness triggered by a rough winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on this!  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I purchased this only to find my mom using it all, haha!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I purchased a mango shea butter from a local store in my area and its more costly and the container is smaller but its the only thing that seems to work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare the Shea butter to anything else, since it&#x27;s my first purchase, but I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft!</li>

            <li> Even though I’ve only ordered twice now, the quality is consistent and high, which is valuable to me since I&#x27;ve spent the monay before and received low quality that is grainy and doesn&#x27;t melt easily in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While it is a little greasy, when it is applied to the skin it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strong</li>
            <li> We recently moved to CO and needed a product that was safe for the entire family, natural, and very moisturizing for a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I have developed super dry cracking skin on my hands and spots on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> It is a bit crumbly when raw, but blends perfectly when I melt it down with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is clean, w/o any foreign substances in it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to make a body butter that included coconut oil and almond oil, which I really like since the shea is kinda stiff and the oils are, well, oily.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted their Shea Butter beacause of the E-book and obviously the high rattings of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I like it very much, using it every day and my skin is soft, the only thing is on the package</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks, his skin is smooth, soft and the blemishes are clearing up!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and crumbly as opposed to a solid mass, but works just as well, maybe even better than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Honestly wish It came in a larger amount and would last longer without mixing it with other products but without a doubt, I will be purchasing from this vendor from now on ☺️</li>
            <li> I always have problems with new skin care products, and have been trying to go natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oddly, at the bottom of the label, it also says &#x27;New&#x27; is if they expect some batches to be old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the smell, but, I&#x27;m still expirementing with adding the right amount of oils to lessen the Shea smell.</li>
            <li> only downside is that is very oily and sticky, which makes the shaving very smooth but the clean up is a bit difficult.  </li>
            <li> I used the Shea Butter 3 different ways this past weekend and the result for all 3 ways was amazing.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic inside of a brown paper zip lock bag to help keep fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> I cut it in half and used double boiler to melt the shea butter with other oils and coconut oil to make wonderful lotion that is 75% shea and 25% other oil.</li>
            <li> I more or less coped with it over the past couple years, but I finally decided to buy this Ivory Shea to change it up a bit, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective this will be, le you know later.  </li>
            <li> I have even strarted to put a small amount into my all natural  homemade deodorant (just for moisturizing purposes) and it feels lovely.</li>
            <li> ( hint 6 pack pick your own usually comes out cheaper than singles) back to this shea though..  </li>
            <li> Raw, clean, very high quality.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on trying some of Better Shea Butter&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> Otherwise it gets hard and crumbly and does not go on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I have never had such a positive experience with a company before in all my experiences.</li>
            <li> After opening I thought it had a strong odd smell, not the nutty smell as expected and a more grayish color than expected.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had to really work with the shea butters to get them to a consistency that could be applied directly and smoothly to my skin without clumping.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble with the natural smell though!</li>
            <li> which other true shea butters I&#x27;ve used do not do.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to buy twice the amount of shea butter for the same price with the previous brand I used.</li>
            <li> I had a several questions and the seller emailed back quickly each time.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned to use smaller portions and not half a block at a time and also to look at website before doing anything rather than looking at YouTube videos first.</li>
            <li> its taken me a long time to find such a premier, unadulterated shea butter experience at such an incredibly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 26 years old, so my body went through menopause at a very early age.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too fine to withstand heavy oils and butters</li>
            <li> My hair is too fine to withstand heavy oils and butters</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time, so I&#x27;m excited about that.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that when I added my oils to it, such as wintergreen or citrus, the shea butter scent was strong and overpowered the essential oil scent a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, not bad or strong, but not really like anything I have smelled.</li>
            <li> So a little less than a week went by and I started to see that the skin underneath his dry eczema skin was healing beautifully.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter looked white and pure.</li>
            <li> So pure and smoothe when I blended it with essential oils and jojoba oil for face</li>
            <li> This might sound like an infomercial but in that little as a week of rubbing my feet with this cocoa butter</li>
            <li> You can just out a little in your hand and rub it in to make it smooth and apply on your body.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few days, but love it so far!</li>
            <li> but this Shea butter is different so pure so natural.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and that I only need to use a little bit of it b/c of the richness.</li>
            <li> The mix isn&#x27;t quite as hard as most Shea butter mixes.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and not as hard as I expected for unrefined shae butter, but still amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just soft and easy to work with compared to other gritty brands of shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I have made my own moisturizer in the past using white shea butter from the health food store, but after reading about the high temperature used in the refining of the white shea butter</li>
            <li> This also means unlike the boiler method you have to be very careful of the amount of oils the Shea Butter gets mixed into because it can easily become borderline Shea &#x27;liquid&#x27;..</li>
            <li> This also means unlike the boiler method you have to be very careful of the amount of oils the Shea Butter gets mixed into because it can easily become borderline Shea &#x27;liquid&#x27;..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter to make cold process soap with great results.</li>
            <li> , I am hoping that with continued use, it will completely clear up.</li>
            <li> my toes started to clear up in my feet</li>
            <li> The skin looks clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It says &#x27;ncare&#x27; which is clearly supposed to say &#x27;skin care&#x27; but they chose to make themselves look sketchy instead of</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter in terms of its chemical properties, but I have been using various products that claim to be &amp;#34;100% natural organic shea&amp;#34; for years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it penetrates into my skin after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> also, makes my hair/skin soft</li>
            <li> Melted completely and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for use in homemade lotions and body butters, and while I haven&#x27;t quite had time to use this in lotions/BB, I&#x27;ve put it straight on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It becomes slightly soft with the warmer Texas weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a couple of the recipes so far.</li>
            <li> I used this to make all natural lip balm with bees wax, coconut oil, and lavender oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made one lotion so far</li>
            <li> I literally apply it all over my body when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, all day.</li>
            <li> Soft and workable in your palm.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my 15 months old baby, she has eczema and pediatrician wanted to treat her with prescription creams and antibiotics.</li>
            <li> and so far I have been bathing her with colloidal oatmeal and</li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft &amp; silky in the recipe that I prepared for my son.  </li>
            <li> I notified the company; they were really prompt with getting back to me &amp; fixing the problem.  </li>
            <li> came very promptly double wrapped in a plastic bag and resealable organic paper bag.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft after I used it.</li>
            <li> Used it to make some natural deodorant</li>
            <li> but I just use it at home, and then when I&#x27;m ready to go out, I wash it off, use a tiny bit of organic lotion under my makeup, and I can see how this shea butter has helped repair some damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the natural smell.</li>
            <li> but I like so far.</li>
            <li> Product was same as description and came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with.  </li>
            <li> Tried it as an intense facial night time moisturizer as I challenge my skin with Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it as I am trying to clear up my 13 year old daughters eczema-</li>
            <li> old grandbaby also.</li>
            <li> I use it for hair and body products...mainly to do my twist-outs on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a body butter for my hyper sensitive (itchy) skin.  </li>
            <li> so I started doing my research and realized that was far from the truth.</li>
            <li> Just used some to make a soft deodorant for jars.</li>
            <li> Being that this shea butter is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have anything else in it, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Their hands are softer than soft.</li>
            <li> This block I am reviewing is a replacement block, directly from the Shea Butter Lady.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2, one for me and one for my daughter who has a 5 month old.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the packaging because I only use portions of it for the various recipes and by rewrapping it in the plastic, returning it to the sturdy bag it arrives in, and then storing it in a cool, dark place, it has stayed fresh since I opened</li>
            <li> I received a response very promptly (which also included a video on how to prepare Whipped Shea Butter) and in the process began an email dialogue with her (Isabella) about various things.</li>
            <li> I make all natural body products, I can&#x27;t use this in a customers order.</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair and body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was surprised by the quality of the shea here.</li>
            <li> Soft consistancy.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s just what shea butter naturally smells like.</li>
            <li> but I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> This product is working out well so far.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a bit early to give all the praise to the Shea Butter alone</li>
            <li> however thus far I am please.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> she I am ready for my next batch.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft and is cheaper than the fancy brand.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless it was soft and pliable and the scent was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Maybe my batch was old</li>
            <li> but it seems natural and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> Directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;m keeping it in the fridge too so it should last me a whole year.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for our whole family for several months now.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was packaged properly.  </li>
            <li> It made the sunscreen amazingly soft and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My daughter made up a natural hair and body cream of all natural products olive oil, avocado, coconut oil and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> The consistency was soft like playdough.</li>
            <li> It is silky and soft and skin just loves it.</li>
            <li> I have some experience with cocoa butter, coconut oils and the ever ready mix ins of essential oils and herbs from the garden</li>
            <li> So far I have used some of it to make homemade chapstick.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Shea butter for making soap, and have now been using it directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> i probably won&#x27;t add as much coconut oil the next time because the shea is just so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And of course we give it to her directly as well to eat as a treat.</li>
            <li> I used it to make sunscreen and deodorant for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use it as a cream, it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like Gold.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling after applying it directly to my face and skin after a shower..</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I cut off part of the brick and transferred it to an old jar to make it easier to access.  </li>
            <li> When applying the product to you skin, you have to just have to rub your had together a few time to the product would spreads smoothly on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish i had know about this early.</li>
            <li> all natural...</li>
            <li> This truly leaves the skin moisturized and soft, and I hope this seller never stops selling this Shea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The service I&#x27;ve gotten so far gives me a lot of confidence in the product and in buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> what I put on them was natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absolutely my go-to shea butter for the future.</li>
            <li> my 4c natural hair</li>
            <li> I tried oils like avocado and almond oil, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much and only clogged my pores.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a totally natural shea butter product with integrity,  </li>
            <li> and I pulled it out and felt firmly soft (does that make sense?).</li>
            <li> I use lotion on my hands a lot and, with this, I only had to reapply lotion about 3 times the whole day</li>
            <li> By morning she is soft and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My final soap bars are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The quality is terrific and I have noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> But I completely respect you opinion and hope you find a supplier</li>
            <li> (Where to find cacao powder, where to find arrowroot powder, where to find non-GMO cornstarch)&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons naturally derived vitamin E, optional (Where to find naturally derived, non-GMO</li>
            <li> coconut oil and melt until completely liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
            <li> After years of using products like vitamin C serum and natural wrinkle products</li>
            <li> and I bought it twice so far THX</li>
            <li> I use a cotton cloth and natural soap to wash my face as a way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this to anyone seeking a quality topical moisturizer without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> skin recovered in days.&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that Shea is sensitive to the temp in the room.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the shea butter so far is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I emailed the seller thru Amazon and received a download of the manual.</li>
            <li> It melts very easily, soft</li>
            <li> natural not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I know that this is not going to make it go away completely</li>
            <li> The jar stuff was hard-not soft like this is.</li>
            <li> she butter so far is as a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> The result is really soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i purchased this to use on my 2 month old baby girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Made one batch of lotion with it so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Because this is a natural product, though, it can spoil.</li>
            <li> Just a pinch leaves my face, neck and hands so soft, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I use DoTERRA essential oils and no matter how much I used, all I could smell was the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in two recipes so far, in a lotion and a body butter</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural and organic</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, a rash that was on the brink of breaking the skin, was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have used it in Chapstick and deodorant so far</li>
            <li> It is so creamy and soft.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an all natural lotion that contained NO harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how much this shea butter has changed my life.</li>
            <li> something hit me and told me I should go all natural.</li>
            <li> The company is also very diligent about following up and ensuring customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product/company to anyone looking for an all natural and organic way to moisturize their skin/face.</li>
            <li> Used the Shea butter after a shower and I wake up feeling uber soft.</li>
            <li> But the feel is soft when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m liking it so far, doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> There is an Oder that is natural but is covered up with scented oil and does not linger on skin.</li>
            <li> So far I like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> 4 stars so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assured that I have a natural product..</li>
            <li> So far...</li>
            <li> soft hands&lt;br /&gt;Softened</li>
            <li> The butter was soft when I opened</li>
            <li> I apply it directly on my skin (face &amp; body).</li>
            <li> and now my skin is sooo soft and I&#x27;m getting my magnesium transdermally.  </li>
            <li> All natural</li>
            <li> and I would buy larger supplies from them if it was reasonably priced.</li>

            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Like this product so far.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skn</li>
            <li> I made a night cream with it using coconut oil and young living essentional oils, called face lift in a jar</li>
            <li> The company is professional and I feel that they appreciate my buisness.</li>
            <li> So soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> Have also used on my elbows and hands; Wow, makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft and creamy - my skin loves it.  </li>
            <li> It was soft and doesn&#x27;t have any grit.  </li>
            <li> We ordered our Shea butter for our 7 month old daughter with severe chronic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> so soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve made two batches of whipped body butter (from a recipe I found on the internet) and made a face cream from the recipe book that&#x27;s given to you with the purchase of this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hand drummer and when I used natural cowhide drumheads, they would suck out the oils from my hands...</li>
            <li> It is easier to apply to the skin because it is soft and malleable.</li>
            <li> I used it as a detangling conditioner in my 4yr old daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> I also allowed my 9yr old daughter to use it as a body moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have made so far a body butter smoothie for my skin and lip balm.</li>
            <li> and I use that as a moisturiser for myself and my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> I shower and put it on while I am still a bit damp adding a dab of castor oil and my skin is soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Have used it with delight in my hair and also to make a natural homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling luxuriously soft.</li>
            <li> It is soo silky soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have made a natural oil mixture for my baby bump and a zinc oxide cream to treat sea lice.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft all through the day.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and I have developed eczema as an adult</li>
            <li> I waited until after I completely used it make a review...</li>
            <li> Label was put on straight and has a barcode though, it states for external use only, and has an incomplete phrase at the very bottom of the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes it really soft</li>
            <li> does have a natural scent.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is all natural and has no synthetic material added.</li>
            <li> Shea butter seems to be old, its smelling hence returning the product.</li>
            <li> It smells so natural.</li>
            <li> Make Your Skin Feel soft and shiny ,That&#x27;s All .</li>
            <li> The company also has a website where you can enter your Amazon order number and then download an e-book with 21 recipes for hair, face, and body products using all natural ingredients, in case you are looking for recipe ideas.</li>
            <li> Luv Shea butter natural from Africa.</li>
            <li> Skip fancy store lotion with &#x27;Shea butter&#x27; if u want soft.</li>
            <li> Scent with natural oils.</li>
            <li> Homemade shea coco butter lotion with costco&#x27;s organic coconut oil to replace lotion bar from Lush.</li>
            <li> I applied it directly to my face as well</li>
            <li> Smelled like a natural nut butter to me.</li>
            <li> The color reminded me of natural cheddar (white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am incredibly sensitive to the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; of things I eat and use on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, buttery, and 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I even use it in my one year old.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not messy and the rest is up to your imagination.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much guys for the proper business etiquette and also with handling the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would be the natural answer to my children&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> So far, I agree with everyone else.</li>
            <li> I use this product straight, blended with a bit of clove oil, as an all-over body moisturizer, and with no scent added as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my naturally coily hairs FRIZZ to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I have even been told that I look as if I am wearing make up while being au natural.</li>
            <li> Omg WOW.</li>
            <li> So far, this Shea Butter is relieving the dryness.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin feeling baby soft and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and like using a one-ingredient product.</li>
            <li> It is light and fluffy as well as odorless .  </li>
            <li> Soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Used it to make a natural sunscreen as well as some lavender body butter.  </li>
            <li> Naturally I then look on Amazon which is my go to place for research and found this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend the product as well as the company for its short shipping success.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days and notice more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product, though quite expensive.</li>
            <li> smells good enough to eat, it is the base for hand and lip cream and my favorite deodorant recipe.</li>
            <li> The plastic bag can get kind of messy, so I transferred the shea butter to an empty container for easier accessibility.</li>
            <li> Well packaged in a thick bag with a resealable zip top.</li>
            <li> As a base, the Shea Butter absorbs wonderfully and the texture is silky.  </li>
            <li> I have recently bought my second batch of this raw shea butter, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Not real hard.....</li>
            <li> This shea butter is definitely super creamy and super thick!</li>
            <li> I read that if you melt it and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down, it would be &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks later I bought shea butter from a different seller and got a batch that is a mild nutty smell, nicer color and is exactly what I expected shea butter to be.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper and better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used (and I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li> I like the whipped version better because it is a little creamier (and looks nicer for gifting) but both versions are somewhat soft even though my house is a little cool now in the middle of a Minnesota winter.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and made my skin smooth and moisturized during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So moisturizing and sinks right in.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but a little peppermint essential oil fixed that!</li>
            <li> Others I bought from other sellers smelled old and just didn&#x27;t look fresh.</li>
            <li> The dry skin on my feet went away after the first month.</li>
            <li> My testing of other shea butters, even those carried by my local upscale market, ended up that none were nearly as smooth and absorbable.</li>
            <li> I like this shea butter so much that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to purchase any other scented body lotions again.</li>
            <li> This melted smoothly and mixed well with the other ingrediants I used.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin and</li>
            <li> I whipped it up with coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, avacado oil, Jamaican black castor oil, sweet almond oil, and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea in it&#x27;s pure form, but it is very much like other consumers reported: creamy white in color, a very faint nutty odor (not a bad thing!), playdoh-like texture, and quick to melt.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of this Raw Shea Butter in the future!</li>
            <li> (why is it that legs dry out more than arms even when less exposed to the elements?</li>
            <li> It has several easy recipes to follow that made getting started less</li>
            <li> Seeing as this is my first time using the product I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too, but it is as expected and has helped my skin in various ways.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the original smell, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only made a new face cream with it so far, but I&#x27;ve completely replaced my old online Paleo version and am saving a ton of $.</li>
            <li> A huge raw Shea butter(1LB) is inside the bag!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Those raw ones I used are light colored.</li>
            <li> It even came with instructions for downloading their free Manual &amp; Raw Shea Butter Recipes eBook.  </li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my skin every day, simply to keep it young,  tight, supple, smooth and moisturized well into old age.</li>
            <li> It does have a faint natural smell of its own, but I think I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I will also buy a more fragrant essential oil to add to the next half.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of shea butter from this particular company.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter as my main facial moisturize for years.</li>
            <li> This particular brand comes in both ivory and yellow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use , not stiff and hard like others .</li>
            <li> The child who has severe eczema and has more rashy skin than dry patches is also showing improvement but a little slower which I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and made the lip balm recipe, and my lips are not flaking for the first time I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times and it&#x27;s always of high quality.  </li>
            <li> Smoother than the yellow, noticably high quality.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any experience with shea butter prior to this, but had done some research and knew what to expect from high- versus low-quality shea.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product, because it was highly recommended for use in essential oil body and face recipes.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I used a small portion and applied to my face before putting on foundation and it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea Before, usually from the sweet street vendors in New York City.  </li>
            <li> I love it, i&#x27;m using it everyday as moisturiser for my dry skin</li>
            <li> Healed my split ends, had my hair looking glossy and super soft to the touch even during this rough winter weather, wool hats and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> When you make it yourself, you can control how solid or soft it is and how much fragrance (essential oils) to add.</li>
            <li> This is a solid, simple, real and untainted product from as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and silky; I have used it straight on my skin and also mixed it with Vitamin E, essential oils, vitamin C....</li>
            <li> I was not able to download the free recipe book, but the company said they would email it to me.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and moisturizes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought a tiny jar of the white butter at Whole Foods because I was completely out.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my nasty calloused feet and have noticed great softening, better than commercial foot care products.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from atopic dermatitis and eczema, I have spent an unreasonable amount of money on products over the course of many years - most of which did not work.  </li>
            <li> and it came out feeling very greasy and takes a long time to soak in.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they&#x27;ve all had a sand like texture (whether white or yellow) and they didn&#x27;t mix well with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> when you first put it on it seems a bit heavy and greasy especially if you dont heat it up first</li>
            <li> I only have one recipe to use the shae butter for a hand cream, so I am excited to down load your instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> will say that it hasn&#x27;t &#x27;fixed&#x27; the hard skin completely - (i keep forgetting to use the product) but as long as i can remember to moisturise every day with this butter, my feet look and feel better.</li>
            <li> Other butters have irritated my skin and scalp; this butter seems absolutely pure!</li>
            <li> (Find jojoba oil here)&lt;br /&gt;1-2 teaspoons peppermint essential oil, depending on preference (where to find peppermint essential oil)&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons pure cocoa or cacao powder.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s hair is also very fine but thin</li>
            <li> It feels different than slathering on chemical filled, store bought moisturizer and takes a little getting used to, if you haven&#x27;t used shea butter before.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like cheese, but it&#x27;s my first time using it, and someone said that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> My mixture did get hard again, so I melted it for easy application.</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell of this Shea butter whereas all others I&#x27;ve purchased (especially from large name suppliers) the smell was so overwhelming that I had a hard time using the product!</li>
            <li> This time it is so hard I have to use I knife to get any off, ok, no big deal.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a few of my other oils and it all came together nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase this product and create new lotions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying the extra versus other raw organic shea butters sold here because this one is definitely better quality!</li>
            <li> I read reviews of people applying this to their face, which left me totally aghast (lol).</li>
            <li> This really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs and leaves it so soft; my facial wrinkles are less noticeable, although I read somewhere that it can 46 weeks to see permanent wrinkle removal.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it for my dry face skin and hope to see improvements very soon.</li>
            <li> Very healing to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin and this is helping so much.</li>
            <li> I reside in Alaska where it is extremely dry and no matter how much I would moisturize my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a flight attendant, so my skin is dry anyway.</li>
            <li> With the shea, I&#x27;ve noticed that much of the wrinkling and dry skin has gone away.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get results, using it on dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s legs are incredibly dry and get very ashy.  </li>
            <li> Just made a batch of face moisturizer with the Shea Butter and my face feels soft and not dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that I find that makes my naturally kinky curly hair soft.</li>
            <li> Plus one order last a long time for me... stay in business ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooo soft and not dry and cracked as before.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter suffers from severe eczema, and finding a great quality all natural moisturizing product is difficult because so many things can cause stinging or burning.</li>
            <li> I mixed some with coconut oil and use it as my evening facial cream and works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I know that the characteristics of shea butter differ from batch to batch, but I really didn&#x27;t like the gritty, sandy feeling shea butter that I got the second time.</li>
            <li> It instantly made my skin soft and miusturized and my hair drank it up and was soft and stopped breaking.  </li>
            <li> This was my third purchase with this seller, and I am once again blown away by not only the product I received, but also the high level of customer service!</li>
            <li> I did equal parts shea butter and organic coconut oil, then whipped it until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> It really improves the skin around the eye area and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, unlike the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used, which did jack s</li>
            <li> Excellent as lip balm, body lotion base, hair conditioner (used sparingly), and a tiny bit inside the nostrils temporarily clears my spring-allergy-induced sinus congestion.</li>
            <li> I can order more and a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li> My skin is soft &amp; smooth &amp; a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used the butter for my acne-prone face as well, and next morning the skin was very soft and had that satin feel to it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely of higher quality than other shea butters I have tried.</li>
            <li> Dryness is gone, rosacea is vastly improving, my skin feels more supple, no more breakouts, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on my skin!</li>
            <li> Well I was so excited and anxious to receive my Organic Shea Butter</li>
            <li> also like how it doesn&#x27;t melt in higher heats, like other lotions and butters I&#x27;ve had with coconut oil in</li>
            <li> This is Shea butter like no other.  </li>
            <li> I had bought locally, but the quality actually seems to be better than the Shea Butter I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, she loves it, too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it head to toe after showering and have noticed a major difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly use my shea butter in my body butters and find that this one is a little less dense, so I have to add larger amounts of the shea to get a better consistency.</li>
            <li> The company bugged the living crap out of me for a review but the product is pretty good as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way and , by all means, use the recipes that come with it to whip it up into a lighter consistency and add your favorite essential oils...</li>
            <li> This is 100% true raw Shea.</li>
            <li> refill a small dish that I keep in the shower and use it after everything is clean.</li>
            <li> I also love the recipe book that came along with the purchase and have ordered some other oils to make a few.</li>
            <li> I made a whipped body butter with this shea butter and 100% organic unrefined Cocoa Butter from &#x27;Better Shea Butter&#x27; along with a few other ingredients.</li>
            <li> But the latter is creamier and easier to apply especially in winter when plain shea butter became so solid and took more time to melt in my hands before I could apply them on my body.</li>
            <li> The packaging is sent as expected and the shea butter is pure and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I bought from a really expensive shop and found this online for much cheaper and since it had really good reviews decided I could make my own for a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> One had the consistency of Barbasol shaving cream and didn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth and the other did a better job on my skin, but was like hard dried wax which made it difficult to dab on my skin withouy having to warm it up.</li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; lightly with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the butter is smooth, but rather hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their customer care is surpassing to say the least, as is the butter which leaves a greasy film on (my) skin but is surprisingly quickly absorbed leaving it very soft!</li>
            <li> Perhaps the yellow shea butter is different, but I definitely would not purchase the ivory butter again, and I am now reluctant to buy raw shea butter over the internet at all - I want to be able to smell it before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I melt the butter and pure extra virgin coconut oil, Jamaican castor oil, wheat germ oil, horsetail extract and extra virgin olive oil and mix together then put in fridge to return it to its solid form.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and will definitely be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> Product overall is great however, the smell is unpleasant :</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter specifically because I am pursuing a healthier lifestyle in general, and this shea butter is both organic and unrefined-</li>
            <li> They give you so much it should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> had some pesky dry skin flaking off my legs (why is it that legs dry out more than arms even when less exposed to the elements?</li>
            <li> But my skin feels so soft after I use it and it has definitely helped the itchiness on my skin.</li>
            <li> far as the shea butter itself, it&#x27;s definitely quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I used it to make face cream with my Young Living essential</li>
            <li> I just mixed mine with natural vitamin e to make a body butter and</li>
            <li> and I use it for soft tissue work in my holistic physical therapy and bodywork practice...</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE the moisture as it keeps me soft and silky for the entire day.</li>
            <li> My toddler also has sensitive skin and eczema--I&#x27;m using this butter mixed with some lavender oil for him.  </li>
            <li> my skin became so soft, will come back in two months for an update</li>
            <li> We are using it for home made lotion and hair care products with coconut oil and Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used just a bit so far</li>
            <li> and when it got here it was just as the description stated it would be ivory white, soft in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> I used this along with cocnut oil and beeswax to make my mother homemade deodorant since she has developed an allergy to commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it in my natural hair.</li>
            <li> When I mixed it with the oils, it did not blend completely, and the body butter was chunky.</li>
            <li> her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing.</li>
            <li> old baby from her hair to her feet and with every diaper change for the last five months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The natural scent of the butter is obvious when you open the package, and it&#x27;s clear that the butter hasn&#x27;t been processed with chemicals or bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a resent natural, I&#x27;m trying to get my hair staples in order, my hair has been battling dryness since my big chop.</li>
            <li> His skin is no longer red and patchy, but soft like a baby&#x27;s skin should be.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is cream colored (not white) and has a smell that is not perfume-y, but natural smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the last couple of days and my skin is extremely soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It was still solid, and not even overly soft.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have natural hair.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it only once</li>
            <li> I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and was still plagued occasionally with acne...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to create a natural face lotion using essential oils.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s able to use a small amount on wet har.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hands so nice and soft, which is sometimes difficult because I am a nurse and constantly washing my hands/using hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> and there and some are better and worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very surprising, and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, already used almost all of it making body butters, lip balm, sunscreen and bug repellent.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is somewhat thick, but once your skin absorbs it, your skin feels naturally smooth, not oily.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not great bit is not terrible either.</li>
            <li> It is messy to mix but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> shea butter was super moisturizing &amp; so I only have to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I bought shea butter once before and this one seems more soft and wasn&#x27;t as hard to scoop like the other one.</li>
            <li> I used it on both old and new stretch marks and have not really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Strangely, one package was amazingly smooth and the other was a tiny bit gritty.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because my skin was a mess - sun damaged, dry, rosacea, breakouts.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly grainy texture at first</li>
            <li> Now at first I found it odd because I was going to do that anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more creamy than other brands I have bought in the past .</li>
            <li> and I bought it knowing that I will not have the exact same experience as other people had.</li>
            <li> and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again;</li>
            <li> and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again;</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Shea in the past, until I came across this one, Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this produce, needless to say I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if pure shea butter actually does all it says it does.</li>
            <li> The inside bowl needs to be able to hold at least 4-5 cups of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Using a double boiler or a pot of boiling water with a smaller pot fitted inside, melt cocoa butter and mango butter over a low</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry right away, which is expected, so I just do my hair and make up while I let it soak in.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was very pliable even before mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li> It blends very well with the other ingredients for my lotion.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than I expected and very high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the other butter I bought BROUGHT mild eczema and dry skin back on the my chest and decolletage which immediately went away with this one.</li>
            <li> Both of my children have have rough hands from the cold winter we have experienced and nothing worked to soften them...</li>
            <li> Product is great and has helped all of our chapped hands here on the east coast during this bitter cold.  </li>
            <li> Shea is one of these, so I figure why not cut out all the filler and use the active ingredient straight?</li>
            <li> It blends very well with various essential oils and has worked wonders on my dry &#x27;winter skin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I understand that this natural product will have slightly different characteristics in different batches.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use steroid based creams &amp; have used several different natural creams &amp; emollients, up to this point.</li>
            <li> I have no issue with the natural smell but mixed it with essential oils and coco oil</li>
            <li> You have to work it in and be careful not to use too much, just enough so you can feel it on the skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as a slab packed in a double zip-lock bag, so it survived rough handling very well.</li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing expensive products with shea butter, why not just cut out the middle man and make your own?</li>
            <li> I do not know alot about Shea butter or have experience with it enough to say it is better or worse than another brand of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I made a lavender rosemary whipped butter blend with a few different oils and the result was an ultra hydrating easily absorbed butter.</li>
            <li> I was a little thrown by the texture when I first bought this.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first after reading reviews about the freshness of the product</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter due to the ratings that other buyers had left and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have seen such a major difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I try to not use chemicals, but organic creams are expensive, so I&#x27;ll be making a face cream, using shea butter, coconut oil &amp; either avocado or almond oil, but am interested also in the many other uses.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I moved to high altitude and was suddenly waking up with terribly dry and cracked skin around my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; stuff at the store that uses a small percentage of actual shea butter when you can just use it at 100%, and more cheaply?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any one looking for high quality raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered from dry skin nearly all my life, but this stuff has made my skin softer than ever before!</li>
            <li> i bought the ivory butter and use it all over my body and face everyday and in just a few days i have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin feels and looks, i highly recomend it isspecially if your prone to dry flaky legs like i am.</li>
            <li> I like to use the raw shea butter right on my skin as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m tempted to give some of these</li>
            <li> I use it in the raw form right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Raw Shea Butter and made my first homemade lotion!  </li>
            <li> This butter is indeed the color of raw Shea Butter, more of a cream color, perhaps a little lighter than others I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> This is more like butter and clay then the other stuff which was harder, lighter colored and had less of a smell.</li>
            <li> With the two other oils I used this whipped up into a smooth fluffy consistancy.</li>
            <li> I really think an expiration date needs to be printed on the package as BetterSheaButter&#x27;s site says to use it within six months if mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> however, both my kiddos, one being eight months old broke out in hives from this product, and my five year old was extremely itchy after using it.  </li>
            <li> Reading reviews from other shea butter products/sellers left me worried about obtaining the real and undiluted shea butter product.</li>
            <li> The smell is distinct, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I think it would be fun to use it as a base for making my own moisturizer, adding stuff like essential oil and food coloring maybe.</li>
            <li> ;) it was messy when I got it</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate so it takes a toll on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Super supple and easy to work with...does have a weird, smoky/musty smell that&#x27;s hard to cover up even with high quality essential oils, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is light, and the consistency is less grainy than the previous shea butter I tried from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle, the butter was soft and smooth (not grainy like some others).</li>
            <li> and it melts down very well.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much I am researching other homemade skin products to make with it!</li>
            <li> , my skin is very dry and very sensitive</li>
            <li> I finally got around to making my first batch of body butter and made a little mistake when it came to scenting.  </li>
            <li> (one prior purchase much smaller amount, much more expensive, far inferior in quality)</li>
            <li> I rub a little between my hands and then put on my hair to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> The texture was extremely grainy, color was more on the light brown and the smell was overpowering, to the point that the trial formulas I did for soaps and lotions could not eliminate the bad smell and the grainy feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the scent, but I can live with it if it gives me these results.</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and this winter has been rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually put booties on right after.</li>
            <li> I havent had this young looking skin for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s due to this high quality Shea butter!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works to clear up my dry skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from extremely dry and sensitive skin were</li>
            <li> have dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Cuticles (mine were really dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how wonderfully soft it has made my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used heat to dry my daughters&#x27; naturally kinky curly hair in over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I use this directly on my skin in the winter to prevent that really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I let dry naturally to see if it got hard, it was still moist  and soft, and of course I use it on my body as well arizona is very hot  and dry</li>
            <li> I am a gardener, and often my legs and arms dry out from the season changes and frequent showering.  </li>
            <li> Made my first batch of lotion with the shea butter, avocado oil and a few drops of essential oils</li>
            <li> Liked it - was a little hard to measure out of the bag but no complaints and did its job!</li>
            <li> I would say; it felt a little light (less than 1 lb.).</li>
            <li> Rubbing just a little bit into your hands leaves them silky soft, and afterwards the skin does not get dry immediately after an exposure to water as it does after using even very high end hand</li>
            <li> I mean, I didn&#x27;t think that this was so different from other brands that it was worth paying twice as much for.&lt;br /&gt;Minus an additional star because both the batch of body butter and the batch of lip balm I made with this brand became grainy after being stored for a week.  </li>
            <li> I am currently applying it to my daughter&#x27;s stubborn dry skin patch; it has considerably helped.</li>
            <li> That is a lifesaver for me as a beginner, so I deal with heating the mixtures only half as much.  </li>
            <li> It really takes care of those rough, dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and the only problem is, I have to apply it, leave on for about half an hour and get it off because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is useful everyday to soothe dry skin and excema.</li>
            <li> There are less expensive Shea Butter sites, but I&#x27;m unsure of the quality, maybe they are just as good.</li>
            <li> hard to say if i will spend more for less in the future or not.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with raw shea butter, so I was unsure what to expect.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> This is my first time using raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I just made my first batch of whipped Shea butter and coconut oil tonight with this raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is first time I purchased an unrefined raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> This is the first time i have used raw shea butter</li>
            <li> My first time using raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was my first time getting raw unrefined Shea Butter</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with raw unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was my first order of Raw Shay Butter .  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of organic, raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> but I honestly can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than some of the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry skin on my body since my early childhood, and have always used moisturizers after I shower.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin so soft all day since I have very dry</li>
            <li> In the morning I rub it under my eyes only, this helps to keep the delicate area moist &#x3D; less likely to add more wrinkles and make-up adheres better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By itself, it was very moisturizing and takes a little while for it to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my body either straight (a dab in your palm and rub together to melt) or combined with a little jojoba or almond oil to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I used a knife to scrape a little bit off its surface, this way it was much easier for me to soften it</li>
            <li> So much shea butter for so little</li>
            <li> I tried the yellow and did not like it as much as the ivory because it left white under-clothing with a slight shade of yellow.  </li>
            <li> My 6 month old has suffered with eczema since he was a little over two months old</li>
            <li> All the money we recieve is destined to cancer patients that get their treatments in the towns public hospital and live in extreme poverty here in Guadalajara, Mexico.</li>
            <li> When trying to apply it directly to my skin, it is very slippery and it hard to turn into a gel or liquid state for spreading.</li>
            <li> The big difference between this and several other brands/types of Shea butter (which I have purchased and used) is that this is very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit to a rather complicated skin care routine as I am a product junkie, but here is what I do to keep my body smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I started using this brand of raw shea butter on my face, neck and chest after my dermatologist prescribed me something to penetrate the dermis that was full of sulfates and other chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> B0009MHJE4 African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold) 8 Oz.]</li>
            <li> Some of the other brands of shea butter that I&#x27;ve tried are clumpy and hard, but this one melts in your hands and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Having never purchased shea butter before, I was not really sure what to expect from this product, and simply ordered by relying on all the positive reviews...</li>
            <li> It has been so helpful with my eczema and just dry skin in general and yet doesn&#x27;t break out my face that still gets pimples at age 41.  </li>
            <li> One 32 oz and one 16 oz, also mixed with other natural oils.</li>
            <li> A slight odor must be normal for Shea butter</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was unbelievably soft and mixed well with other oils that I used to whip up by body butter.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils and use it for my body and natural hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell great, but this stuff has a strange smell to it (not sure if that&#x27;s normal, or if it&#x27;s bad quality)</li>
            <li> customer service is prompt and above standard, and the product is far above average.</li>
            <li> Its been fairly cold where I live ,but the butter melts quite easily when you rub it between your hands.</li>
            <li> I did mix it with real 100% raw cocoa butter and some coconut oil and some essential oils of my liking and those of my daughters liking as well</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit every time you use it and there is so much that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> this product was bought to help with dry skin, and to use as a lotion for my young children to help combat with their dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> Very natural and only a slight scent associated with it</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it in other natural products.</li>
            <li> (Shea butter can get a rancid smell when it gets old, just like any other oil/fat).  </li>
            <li> I have extremely acne prone skin, discoloration from a variety of things (including too frequent peel treatments), and now aging concerns.  </li>
            <li> I hope she branches out into other natural products.  </li>
            <li> It was incredibly soft and felt smoother(younger) than the skin on the other hand.</li>
            <li> Isabella was a dream to work with: when there was a delivery issue because my Amazon account had the wrong zip code, she immediately sent it directly to me with her apologies and a free e-book of recipes so that I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to make my homemade body butters.</li>
            <li> It is a little waxy and sticky and can be odd to work with, but the benefits are definitely worth the extra work to apply.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used Shea before (like us) know that it feels a little waxy on the skin but absorbs very quickly leaving soft supple skin behind.</li>
            <li> no more, no less, no waste!</li>
            <li> It is so much softer than bricks of raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone and since using this raw butter as an ingredient, my face has been much clearer.</li>
            <li> After melting on very low heat in a double boiler, there were strange stringy looking sediments in the oil.</li>
            <li> This is my second order I will continue to use it as long as it remains the same.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the de~luxe pure shea butter from drugstore, and have been using for the past 8 months.</li>
            <li> and I added some essential oils to tone down the natural scent of the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> No other commercial product comes near shea butter in my opinion in moisturizing dry, sensitive skin with the price/economy considered (seriously, this stuff will last you ages!).</li>
            <li> I simply cannot go back to the regular local stores where the shea butter is mixed with other stuff.</li>
            <li> the water is pretty  hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> Upon researching it, all the descriptions of raw shea butter say that it should smell slightly nutty, earthy, and/or mildly smoky...</li>
            <li> Very thick and may stick to your sheets when use at night ( if youre not wearing pants, socks or long sleeves) but TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I have 2 adopted children who are African American and there skin tends to get dry and chalky.  </li>
            <li> However, the second two were entirely different – dry, and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> If my skin was extremely dry, which is a lot of the time, it would turn red and sting after putting regular lotions on.  </li>
            <li> (essential oils tend to run high and, through Amazon, I can still support small businesses even though they might not be local).</li>
            <li> When used regularly my skin and hair are soft and supple, scars heal faster, and I do not have to be paranoid about my dark skin looking dry or applying lotion multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> (I had to get serious now right?).</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback - purely because I hadn&#x27;t expected it to look like a lump of lard.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for producing this product, the quality is unbelievable and the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy in small amounts much but&lt;</li>
            <li> I put it her before bed time and dress her in long pijamas ( so she will not scratch), the next morning her skin still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This block will last a long time</li>
            <li> so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> , that is if it lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> It last for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, keeps your skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I thought I already submitted a review but apparently not...</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> At first I made the mistake of using a piece about the size of a nickel, and it covered my hands in a thick sheen of oil that I had to wash off.</li>
            <li> Anyway, even though this shea butter is formed in a hard block, it is easy to cut with a butter knife, with no mess, so since my other ingredients still haven&#x27;t arrived, I have been shaving off bits of the butter in its raw state and rubbing them into my skin as is.</li>
            <li> Their recipe book was very helpful in knowing how to melt it down and how to mix it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My first adventure has been making a lotion with half shea butter and half coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be putting it into jars for presentation, however, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to melt it down or anything as it is quite soft as is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had recently given up trying to find Palmers Shae Butter and have been going back and forth trying to find something that will work on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have only worked with it a little bit so far.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought it in hopes of healing my cracked heels and this stuff is actually doing the job where so many other products have failed.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing from here again in the future, but it may be a while becuase this stuff lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> We are on our third purchase of this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> well.. they know exactly what I mean.)</li>
            <li> (Call me paranoid, but if you are a parent, you know exactly what I mean.)</li>
            <li> Raw, Ivory, that classic organic shea butter smell.</li>
            <li> Given the amount in this block, it will last me a very long time though.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this lasting my family very long.</li>
            <li> Anyways the product was packaged well and the smell not that bad at all, very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have recently had dry skin on my feet and I am giving shea butter a shot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this white shea butter this time as I&#x27;m already fighting dry skin.  </li>
            <li> +, extra  dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I plan to use half and make a whipped butter with some of my natural oils.</li>
            <li> you struggle with acne or red, dry, irritated skin, give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I tried numerous times to get rid of stretch marks and scars from surgery and dry skin.</li>
            <li> so have I received an old batch of the previous product before improvement?????  </li>
            <li> I personally use it for dry heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the only thing that I rely on to keep my family&#x27;s dry skin from chaffing.</li>
            <li> I will never spend again so much money for ready lotions which make my skin even worse!</li>
            <li> Also, if you use it on your body as an extra treat for dry skin before bed, you will wake up with newborn-like skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps me moisturized all over, especially for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have had problems finding a cream or lotion that would penetrate the dry patches, but I have definitely found</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times so far and can already tell that my feet are softer.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by the seller who explained what normal shea butter should look, feel and smell like, and she helped me ascertain that this second order batch is probably not okay (</li>
            <li> My daughter and I spent the afternoon making up different creams and lotions with the Shea butter and essential oils!</li>
            <li> I have experimented with various butters and oils; coconut oil (too greasy and does not absorb well), avocado butter (good, but greasier than shea), cocoa butter (very greasy but does the job), sesame oil (terrible, does not absorb at all and leaves skin strangely dry beneath the oil), olive oil (will do in a pinch when I am out of argan oil).</li>
            <li> Its faint scent and ivory color are a strong indicator that the butter is unrefined.</li>
            <li> Creamy but a little dry, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a raw Shea butter, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it comes in as well as take out a little bit for use in other stuff without aerating the whole batch</li>
            <li> When I pay this much for a product (especially when there are other less expensive Shea butter choices), I expect to get one FULL pound.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have never smelled raw Shea butter before, so maybe this is how it normally smells</li>
            <li> I purchased most of my ingredients on Amazon because they are often less expensive than one might find in local stores</li>
            <li> I added several other oils I had such as Jojoba oil, vit E oil, vit. C oil and Bata Carotene.</li>
            <li> I used it as a daily moisturizer mixed with an other oil .</li>
            <li> I made two variations: one mixing just the shea butter and essential oils, the other whipping together shea butter, coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li> The real deal...Don&#x27;t waste time with the other fakes.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> a smell but raw unrefined Shea butter should have a smell, that it is solid but still soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Since it is so soft, it being shrink wrapped makes it a little troublesome to get to it all.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil and apply it on my dry skin, and my dry skin is gone, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not ordered this in the past but had to try it based on the amount of reviews with a high satisfaction rate.  </li>
            <li> I simply flat twist her hair and let it air dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to rub into my skin, but it&#x27;s not so it doesn&#x27;t take much time to apply.  </li>
            <li> And I can even add a different scent daily depending on my mood with a little essential oil!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from other places and it did not have the normal smell, it smelled spoiled or odd.</li>
            <li> Like bunt bacon or some kind of bad meat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on expensive, chemical and perfume filled lotions; go natural and use this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Strange smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I look at over-the-counter creams and lotions, and always wonder why they have a long ingredient list with names I can&#x27;t pronounce, and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not oily for long periods of time</li>
            <li> There was a smoky smell that did not go away for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as you keep selling it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS LONG</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It has anti-inflammatory properties; protects against sunburn; and can aid in healing minor cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As you can tell, I&#x27;m using the butter simply to moisturize my face, and not much else.</li>
            <li> A quality product that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t purchase Shea from Amazon because of past experiences of rancid Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I made a lotion using this and olive oil and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair, starting at the root and working my way to the ends.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days, Has a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for my 60 plus dried body to feel soft again.  </li>
            <li> but goes a long ways..</li>
            <li> I whip mines with castor oil and my skin stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I prefer, to store the butter in something different because once you start to run out it gets harder to get it out of the plastic.</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> : no unexpected smells (some reviews mentioned chemical smells).</li>
            <li> arrived on time and the smell is not loud</li>
            <li> It came as expected two days later.  </li>
            <li> I decided the store-bought antiperspirants that cause breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s are not for me or my niece, and we went natural a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> The one that ships is way too long.</li>
            <li> Ends up with the smoothest product without any strange smells.</li>
            <li> The shea butter alone does take a long time to soak into my skin, though.</li>
            <li> (Widely used for its calming and relaxing qualities, Soothes occasional skin irritations, Helps skin recovery</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> The real stuff and thick</li>
            <li> and I think it made my final chapstick product a little grainy and unpleasant, but this brand is top notch!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past finding right shea butter to use.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne is much less prevalent than it was when I use commercial facial moisturizers from WalMart and the like.</li>
            <li> If I continue to use it regularly, I have noticed that my stretch marks will appear smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;raw shea butters&amp;#34; that feel like rubbing wax all over myself and gave my sensitive skin a rash (shea butter has latex-like qualities that latex sensitive people like myself can react negatively to).</li>
            <li> I was looking for shea butter for a hand balm and almost bought one of the other first page search results that was far far less expensive.</li>
            <li> Face cream, baby bum cream, body butter, stretch marks, acne, exczema, minor scrapes, any type of rash or dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you have used other Shea butter in the past in various recipes, whether lip balm or hand lotion, be aware that you may need to alter your recipes slightly if you use this product.</li>
            <li> Although it melted down well, and made for a creamy whipped body butter, despite adding quite a lot of scented essential oil, it still has a very strong smell that I find unpleasant - instead of smelling like clay, it now smells like clay and lavender.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that when I do free shipping Amazon uses Fed Ex...who give my package to the post office... making my package always late!!!</li>
            <li> Shea butter has always been a solution for my different skin problems like extreme dryness in the winter, or some acne breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand several times as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other.</li>
            <li> Looking at other products and the same smell seems to be coming up</li>
            <li> I got it to mix with essential oils and other ingredients for body lotion, face creams, sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it fully diluted with other products or grainy or yellow or foul smelling.</li>
            <li> At this point, I have only used the Shea Butter as a cream for hands &amp; feet, but I look forward to making lip balm and other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying a different brand now and will post about it in due time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some from other places that were a bit gritty</li>
            <li> I use it a moisturizer and to make other self-care products such as my homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> From what I see on Amazon reviews, it seems my second order matches complaints other customers had, which then seemed to be improved upon, resulting in the improved packaging changing to ziplock and the product smell and texture being improved on...</li>
            <li> It mixed together well with my other ingredients.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I&#x27;ve been getting my Shea butter from my local hair supply store, needless to say I won&#x27;t be getting the yellow, greasy \\&quot;Shea</li>
            <li> I have used it in my deodorant recipe along with coconut oil, cocoa butter and several other ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got several other recipes that I want to try with it now - deodorant, shaving cream, diaper cream...</li>
            <li> To start, I don&#x27;t use Shea butter mixed into other home made cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used product about two weeks, not daily but maybe every other day.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this was the same as the other order that I placed.</li>
            <li> I have already made enough to share with 2 other people -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I only use it in the evenings to slather on my feet, legs, elbows and other dry patches, and then let it soak in during the night.  </li>
            <li> For my natural sisters &amp; brothers who are having a hard time finding a product to soften their hair, this is definitely a must have staple.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with synthetic fragrance but natural scents(essential oils and such)</li>
            <li> it helps her a lot it locks the moist for a very long time</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for some natural raw shea butter, try this product.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a raw &amp; organic Shea butter to use in my natural deodarant recipe when I began breastfeeding</li>
            <li> This product is raw, organic shea butter and the packaging gives it that natural feel.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it raw on my extremely dry sensitive skin this winter</li>
            <li> a try on my dry hand...</li>
            <li> Before, it was dry, regardless of the season.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to make moisturizing lotion and use to condition my curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have friends and family with eczema and dry skin issues and this shea butter is so nourishing to their needs.  </li>
            <li> I dry brush my body with a dry brush, soak in bubble bath and while still damp, put the cream on.</li>
            <li> I used this directly on my dry skin and in a home made body butter.  </li>
            <li> My skin never got dry once.</li>
            <li> The dry crusty skin from the eczema didn&#x27;t disappear immediately.</li>
            <li> I moved to a state with extremely dry air at the end of October.</li>
            <li> So, after researching dry skin on the internet, I decided to try this Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I find that I can use it as a pre shampoo treatment when my hair and scalp is dry and also as a moisturizer between shampoos.</li>
            <li> was always bone dry.</li>
            <li> dr said it was simply dry and irritated skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in a recipe for a homemade body cream and it has done wonders for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Any dry patches I had on my skin were gone within a couple days of using shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Her scalp was dry and having dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use this for making cream for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot and find that they get really dry.  </li>
            <li> Note, I had really dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it all winter long and never have dry skin!</li>
            <li> It helped my dry, cracked,  peeling skin through the winter.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to treat holistically and wanted to give this a try since his skin was beyond dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is the answer to your problem.</li>
            <li> My knuckles, hands, feet, and cuticles were cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin, this will keep you hydrated all day while correcting the dryness.  </li>
            <li> I also had dry patches all over my legs that are gone.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from any skin condition, this product will soften extremely dry skin IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> I need to apply it once in the morning, and again in the afternoon to keep the dry skin feeling at bay.  </li>
            <li> I used the Shea Butter to make homemade organic body butter for dry skin(along</li>
            <li> My son has dry, itchy skin and even prescription lotion with steroids didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter, and I just whip this up with some coconut oil and</li>
            <li> , I use it on my face after the shower because my face gets so dry</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has severe case of dry skin and Eczema.</li>
            <li> (was) dry.</li>
            <li> it was so dry</li>
            <li> It soothes dry skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it without adding anything to it for my face, neck, hair/scalp, under-arm deodorant, and a dry spot that shows up from time to time on one leg.</li>
            <li> In the winter my daughter&#x27;s skin gets dry and scaley.  </li>
            <li> My feet are incredibly dry and now living in Chicago</li>
            <li> My left hand by the fatty part by the thumb was cracked, red like a tomato and oozing nastiness.</li>
            <li> that said, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing by using the yellow butter rather than the white!</li>
            <li> The product was gritty the second time I ordered it, and it was not smooth...</li>
            <li> It definitely has an odor to it, but after a few days the essential oils in the recipe took over and now I don&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what it is typically like, but this has been working really well in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Natural products like this can sometimes be sold by shady, fly-by-night sort of operations.</li>
            <li> The block is big enough to last at least 8 months just for the face.</li>
            <li> So it is a dark yellow now, but it works well.</li>
            <li> The natural fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even the so-called &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; brands have a long list of unknown stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not wonderful, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Nothing to loose and All Compliments to gain when you make this Purchase</li>
            <li> Melted it down and mixed it into my homemade cream/lotion, and could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t melt it down or add any essential oils or anything to it.</li>
            <li> Melted this oil down &amp; mixed it</li>
            <li> I just down loaded the ebook and plan to make the lotion for eczema next.  </li>
            <li> Has helped maintain my skin moisturized in this dry weather!</li>
            <li> I have dry patches of skin that already look and feel a lot softer!</li>
            <li> I give my wife half hour back massages every morning and this product keeps its consistancy  </li>
            <li> I purchased yellow shea butter in the past (from a different seller) and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or</li>
            <li> Keep my unused she&#x27;s butter in the fridge for future use, though I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy from her again, although a little does go a long way!</li>
            <li> I instantly feel the different between using the usual moisturizer and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a faint shea smell, barely noticeable, it disappears once you add anything else with a scent, also the texture is very creamy and even.</li>
            <li> Also, the butter is not absorbed into skin immediately, you’d need to give it several minutes; and that, again, I think is to be expected from</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands in the past and will definitely order again .</li>
            <li> I cut it for my recipe, sliced nicely, only slightly crumbly.</li>
            <li> No more overpriced, fancy French creams that are only 20% shea butter!</li>
            <li> 90 degree heat in Kentucky wearing a black business suit to meetings, walking three or four miles daily, and NO body odor.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this fix dry skin immediately, its actually healed and reduced some of my face and hand skin issues like bags under eyes, thin under eye skin, and general hand dryness.</li>
            <li> I have used the refined prepared shea butter products in the past and never realized how little of the natural product actually remains in those creams.</li>
            <li> Due to the heat in the palm Spring area my Raw Shea Butter was completely melted.</li>
            <li> what ever other natural oils I have in my house and no more dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I formulate my own skin care cosmetics and I have a feelings that it is not pure since it has consistency of a playdough :(</li>
            <li> I struggle with eczema and very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, but since I started using this</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, this is the remedy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> This helped but leaves the skin very dry looking thereafter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and flaky after applying this product</li>
            <li> I will only order my shea butter from this company, why mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the yellowish/orange gritty mess that you can get from others.  </li>
            <li> In my transition to natural, homemade cosmetics (no more parabens for me), I decided to make a moisturizer using unrefined organic Shea butter, jojoba oil and a few skin-friendly essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am already seeing a big difference in my dry cracked heels after using the shea butter for just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to conventional lotion again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve whipped some up with a little coconut oil and Lavender to use on larger areas as my legs and arms get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had been using Bath &amp; Body Works Shea Butter and got tired of the tiny quantity you receive and the fact it doesn&#x27;t really work all that well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Playing beach volleyball my feet are always in rough shape, heels are cracked and very dry.</li>
            <li> with  this, a little  coconut  oil and some essential oils.  </li>
            <li> However when I went to use it on her hair there were little gritty bits in the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is made in Africa and every batch is a little different in color and or consistency.</li>
            <li> Second, I do find it to be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> You only need a little to put on your face.</li>
            <li> The only little thing...</li>
            <li> Recommend using only at night though as it&#x27;s a little greasy for day use.</li>
            <li> For my lip balms I simply increased the amount of beeswax in the recipe and for my Shea lotion I added a little &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; butter (like mango or cocoa)</li>
            <li> A little goes along way, I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell was a little different than what I anticipated</li>
            <li> package and it weighed only a little over 12 oz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also mixed it with some vitamin E and olive oil, which is a little greasy</li>
            <li> It is very thick and if you&#x27;re using it straight off of the block (without warming it)</li>
            <li> I use raw organic shea butter for topical treatment of conditions such as dry skin, blemishes, scars and wrinkles; a massage cream for tight and sore muscles; and added to my sunblock.</li>
            <li> We use it for face, fingers and other dry skin area of body.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I used it in my natural DIY hard lotions and also lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Because it is naturally soft instead of hard and crumbly, your finished product will also be softer.</li>
            <li> I made lotions with it and even with two other oils and a lot of essential oils, it still has a slightly rancid smell I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> The other half I use in my hair as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the plastic is hard to open.</li>
            <li> In the last six months, I have purchased three different kinds of she butter for my hard lotion and body butter.</li>
            <li> I am using the Shea butter, raw, every night, &amp; so far her skin seems smoother &amp; less inflamed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, but it isn&#x27;t a particularly enjoyable smell either.</li>
            <li> I brought a small chunk of this on a 2 week long beach vacation and this was my only form of body lotion.</li>
            <li> One pound is a lot for me, so this will probably last me an entire year at least.</li>
            <li> so it makes it harder to dispense.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I leave it on my wet hair and put it on my face underneath my make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have been adding it to my skincare routine with coconut oil (it is a bit harder to spread than I anticipated) and I have noticed that some scars on my arms have faded.</li>
            <li> sinks in.</li>
            <li> Expected texture.</li>
            <li> Got it on time,  and transferred to empty lotion container.</li>
            <li> Added a few essential oils to it as well.  </li>
            <li> Was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I make a whipped Shea butter cream that I use daily and noticed a stark difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> It is so nourishing that instead of using lip balm several times a day he now uses it once every few days.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> In MY patch (which could be different for everyone else) in a small dime size amount, it only two about 5-6 seconds for it to melt from my body temperature and my average body temp is between 96-98 degrees U.S.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and used it recently to make some skin care products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> Although there&#x27;s not much instructions on how to download the guide book, but just enter your order code &amp; email into their website &amp; press the button to have the PDF emailed to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is minimal &amp; resealable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used organic ones that were stark white and had no smell.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected in these temps.</li>
            <li> Why is the texture now rough and grainy??  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd go round with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I also mix this Shea butter with coconut oil and argan oil (equal parts Shea butter and coconut oil with a few drops of argan oil) to use on my knees, elbows, and feet.</li>
            <li> It is all that the reviews said it was and what I expected.</li>
            <li> We wasted years and countless dollars on eczema creams, steroid creams, anti-itch creams, etc.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks I have to say it basically transforms my skin texture, especially on my tummy (stretch marks).</li>
            <li> so I emailed them and they got back to me within a few hours with the e-book.</li>
            <li> Curious to use for stretch mark prevention come pregnancy time.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and quality was as expected.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a bit rough putting on.</li>
            <li> However, prepare yourself a wide mouth jar for this product</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for hair, body, lips and because you don&#x27;t need a lot with each use, I still have a ton left (purchased in February 2014).</li>
            <li> to no real avail...</li>
            <li> It was a giant messy blob when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and I swear my skin has gone back in time a few years.</li>
            <li> Was jus as expected...</li>
            <li> We decided to go with as few ingredients as possible and thought &amp;#34;why not Shea&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this a few times to make custom lotion with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Although because it doesn&#x27;t have the creamy texture this brand has it is much harder to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Shea butter, so I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times on my hair and its</li>
            <li> Just what I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to make body butter with it but the lotion became gritty after a few days.</li>
            <li> The shea butter has a creamy color and it smells like I expected.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Frankincense essential oils -few drops&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oils -few drops for smells</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of Shea butter to use in homemade lotions, lotion bars, and deodorant.</li>
            <li> Packaging was well done and arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used it in a few different recipes, and like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I hate using many of the medical grade products associated with it.</li>
            <li> I made my own stretching creme using this as a base.</li>
            <li> well all of the above and wait to cool down in frig or in a cold place.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy about the free book that you need to go to their website to download I was required to use my Amazon Secret code to get the book</li>
            <li> The smell of the Shea butter is earthy clay, some people might not like this, some people do, but you can add fragrance and the &#x27;Shea&#x27; smell will tone down but not completely go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the Shea butter is earthy clay, some people might not like this, some people do, but you can add fragrance and the &#x27;Shea&#x27; smell will tone down but not completely go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use it, I remove a tiny piece, and I do mean tiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pale yellow.</li>
            <li> I had slight internal bleeding on the soul of my foot that traveled up to my toes and caused a couple of my toenails to darken and they have been dark for about six or seven months.</li>
            <li> ps: I have used this shea butter plain or mixed with olive oil.</li>
            <li> Everything I had previously had was almost rock solid and had to be melted down in order for me to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s raw scent does overpower most anything you mix it with, so adding essential oils becomes a must.</li>
            <li> Paper bag, easy to re wrap, plastic inside...not big hard plastic case, hard to store and tough to recycle~</li>
            <li> I use it on my face only for now and it only takes a very small amount to cover the face.</li>
            <li> First the smell is HEAVENLY, the consistency is thick, buttery creamy goodness!!  </li>
            <li> look so much healthier and I am dead serious</li>
            <li> I have combination oily w/ dry patches on my face and trouble with dry patches on my arms.</li>
            <li> for dry elbows&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep the frizzies down on your hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using yellow Shea for about a year or two now, and while it has worked wonders for my face in combination with African Black soap, the yellow shea butter always felt heavier on my face; even though it would melt fairly easily, it never truly seemed to absorb into my skin, which would frequently leave my face uncomfortably oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than I expected and mixes well with other products like coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I mixed it for a long time and still it had hard bits in it....</li>
            <li> This is enough shea to make several dozen small round containers (keep in mind there are other ingredients needed in addition to Shea).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everybody - and their follow-up after the purchase was unbelievable!!  </li>
            <li> I recently switched from using a costly $$$ shea butter lotion to 100% RAW UNREFINED ORGANIC SHEA BUTTER.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used  raw shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have a standard to compare it with.</li>
            <li> I want to get some raw cocoa butter to mix in with the next batch.</li>
            <li> stuff has a consistency similar to raw cookie dough.</li>
            <li> Similar to the raw shea butter that i bought in Ghana.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; of raw shea but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I like the ability to use both raw and whip it or melt it into something different.</li>
            <li> However, for reducing the look of stretch marks specifically I have found that Raw African Shea Butter[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I made facial cream using the raw shea butter</li>
            <li> I immediately applied apple cider vinegar that day and the next and applied the raw shea butter morning and night and have not peeled.</li>
            <li> I bought the white raw shea butter</li>
            <li> I have no prior experience with raw shea butter</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin which is so dry that I need moisturizer all year round even in humid climate.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes A LONG way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing, but a little goes a long way and can leave my face feeling a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> store it in a glass container with a snap lid to make it easier to use, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way if you use it like that.</li>
            <li> I have been using unrefined shea butter for a while, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way for that.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this for lotions and hair conditioner, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to share with my neighbor because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way..</li>
            <li> I melted it down and mixed it with other oils, then whipped it to a fluffy mousse.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (very minor)</li>
            <li> and I will never buy from any other.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert as usually use cocoa butter but recently tried NOW shea butter and now this product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a different shea butter in the past from Amazon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can use any other brand now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that felt course and grainy, but that&#x27;s not the case here.</li>
            <li> When I sneezed I would get an Itch all over my body, but now after I put this on there is no more itch keep the product the same</li>
            <li> I bought it to make body butter for my family and diaper ointment for my baby due in December.</li>
            <li> I put this on my body 1-2 times a week before bed and on my hands every other night with gloves</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I have ordered other Shea butter on Amazon</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make a body butter with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> but again, I don&#x27;t see a difference between this and other brands of Shea butter on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i use it alone and sometimes with other organic oils</li>
            <li> Anyways, upon opening the package, the shea butter smelled extremely RANCID.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> For sure you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , it is a miracle, i tried other brands before</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it in other recipes.</li>
            <li> Other products seem to coagulate but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> The applications for its use are endless.</li>
            <li> It was used along with other products to make DIY Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It should come in a plastic tub or other durable container.</li>
            <li> She will be selling other products soon</li>
            <li> Service was extremely guick</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;M GIVING AWAY ALL MY OTHER BEAUTY LOTIONS, CREAMS, ETC.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I can&#x27;t do anything with it because of the putrid smell.&lt;br /&gt;4.14.2015</li>
            <li> I also like that it came packaged with the other things I ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture when blending it with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased yellow shea butter in the past.  </li>
            <li> After my shower each day I would rub a small amount in my hands to melt it then apply to my entire body.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have ordered shea butter from a different company.</li>
            <li> After the winter months on Artic fish beaches, I use the NOW Foods Shea Butter Lotion for the area of my nose that is prone to cracking, dryness and soreness due to the winter sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FYI - I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> So knowing the freshness of the batch would be extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of it having a smoky odor, which it does</li>
            <li> It does absorb and does not just stay sticky on the surface like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> When deciding to make this purchase, I had read other reviews stating that the product smelled and others that claimed there was no smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful that I had only made a small batch.  </li>
            <li> I just received mine the the other day and have been using it on my face every night.  </li>
            <li> but I mix it with other oils and beeswax for lip balms and whipped body/feet lotion.</li>
            <li> and I have to warn you that you need to be prepared to filter the product twice after melting due to the additional impurities and residue.</li>
            <li> so I tested to put climber hand cream on one hand and shea butter on the other hand.</li>
            <li> Now I put shea butter on my hands after every climbing day before going to bed and other nights too if I remember.</li>
            <li> I had ordered another&lt;br /&gt;shea butter from a different seller in the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we will ever switch to any other Shea Butter...</li>
            <li> It was creamy and blended well with the other oils.</li>
            <li> She just sent me a ebook with properties, other uses and recipes the shea butter can be used in</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried to mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount for skin moisturization and it does moisturize superbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it to make a soothing balm , with other ingredients, for my Frenchie</li>
            <li> I put some in a small container for daily use.</li>
            <li> It was not grainy as I&#x27;ve had before with other companies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did because I am SO disappointed with what I received.  </li>
            <li> cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture from heat.&lt;br /&gt;Measure 5 teaspoons of cocoa powder into a small bowl and gradually add several tablespoons of jojoba/almond/olive oil.</li>
            <li> I have some stretch marks from the past, and I can see them fading after applying it for a week...which totally exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> Did not smell smokey or rancid like some of the other comments indicated.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve heard that people use it as cooking oil, but I&#x27;m not sure that appeals to me.</li>
            <li> My baby had a angry red rash that several dr&#x27;s said were various types of infections.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using Shea butter or the past three years and have no allergic reactions or dryness.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if is due to temperature that caused during delivery or</li>
            <li> If you suffer from eczema, psoriasis, or any other skin ailment please give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> as I did not like any of the other brands I tried.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using the shea butter in other ways.</li>
            <li> It melts and blends well into other oils and into my conditioners.</li>
            <li> Other products we purchase have chemicals added but this is an organic brick of shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using this in my hair in place of other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for anything else although possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use up what I have in making other products</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> it has an extremely earthy smell</li>
            <li> you letter for ordering and an invite to share uses and recipes with other customers.</li>
            <li> Blended with other oils to make a whipped hair cream.</li>
            <li> butter is extremely dense, off-white, and has an earthy, nutty scent.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of an odor, not moldy as I have heard complaints of with some Shea butters, but not exactly what I would call nutty either.  </li>
            <li> It came just as I expected!</li>
            <li> No, REALLY!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll use it for other products as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered and am waiting one other ingredient.</li>
            <li> When I received it, i took a small amount from the package and rubbed it on the back of one hand.</li>
            <li> I have used two other brands of Shea Butter and wanted to try this one because of the creamier texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One friend raves about it due to his hands cracking severely from Bar tending and continuously washing his hands without gloves...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands</li>
            <li> Other ones I tried were grainy (</li>
            <li> in other words &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I simply melted a small amount of Shea Butter and applied it to her hair while at the sink.</li>
            <li> The nuttiness goes well with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but I already notice the difference!</li>
            <li> I listened to the other reviewers and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I have never used shea butter before or any other brand to compare this to.</li>
            <li> Unlike other shea butters I have tried, it is not &#x27;grainy&#x27; at all and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I use it on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products from this company...</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I thought there was going to be a recipe to make products from it</li>
            <li> also looked for mold as other buyers had listed they found</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product but that was not necessary anyway,</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil for the past couple years, but it never leaves my skin moisturized - it actually often leaves it drier than when I started.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had to contact the seller, but there are lots of recipies using Shea Butter on the web, so I had other recipies to work with until I got the book that comes with this</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it for other things.</li>
            <li> I use for eczema and other skin aliments on my kids and myself.</li>
            <li> I have bought some in the past that was gritty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Shea butters, and even tried using cocoa butter instead for my projects, and I have regretted all of them.</li>
            <li> I use it for my skin and hair as I do mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> the texture is a little different (a little grainy) than the previous shea butter I purchased but, the last shea butter wasn&#x27;t raw or organic.  </li>
            <li> and this is one of the very few items that actually work without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have always had rough patches on my hands due to the work that I do and this has made them noticeably less.</li>
            <li> Beeswax is also very messy and difficult to clean away once it cools/hardens.</li>
            <li> For me, its too heavy to use on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the additives that are in most of the manufactured Body Butters and was tired of paying for the expensive all organic brands.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Rather, I should say; buy this product will full intent on making the Shea Butter part of a larger blend or you will find yourself disappointed.</li>
            <li> Rather, I should say; buy this product will full intent on making the Shea Butter part of a larger blend or you will find yourself disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a active climber, I need skin recovery</li>
            <li> I was shocked and couldnt imagine anyone wanting to use this as a beauty care product, and no amount of essential oils could possibly make it smell decent.</li>
            <li> We needed to get back to nature and get rid of the chemicals and water based serums that were actually making her eczema worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others that left a grainy feel behind, but not this one.</li>
            <li> All natural, doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty chemicals that most moisturizers have.  </li>
            <li> Cow.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little harder than other times, but I don&#x27;t mind that inconsistency.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it plain for a week now, warming it in my hand and spreading on arms and legs, which then stay hydrated and soft for at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> The other product was yellow, hard and had an smell to it.</li>
            <li> I also cut off several chunks of the raw Shea and put into little containers to have everywhere</li>
            <li> All my other lotions feel so watered down now  after using this product.</li>
            <li> We used it for our body bars and just plain on my daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit on my hands that have very bad dry patches and they are healing nicely after just one application</li>
            <li> I applied the Shea Butter extra heavy in that area and I am writing this Sunday morning and that area&#x27;s color is almost normal and the deep painful cracks are well on their way of being closed and healed.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> have tried a few different shea butters over time, even refined shea butter - which I will never use again and does not compare to raw &amp; unrefined.</li>
            <li> Very similar to an all-natural raw shea butter I bought a few years ago at a home and garden show.  </li>
            <li> The heels of my feet were a little rough and this butter smoothed it within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> However since the butter is very thick, it is advised by some frequent users of the shea butter on Youtube to exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will try other brand though hopefully with less scent</li>
            <li> The smell is on the &#x27;smokier&#x27; side, but it becomes less noticeable when blended with other oils.</li>
            <li> Because it stays solid at room temperature, it was hard for me to soften some of it in my palms.</li>
            <li> Packaging needs help,  the product is hard to remove from the package and store properly.</li>
            <li> The marks are not totally gone, but they are hardly noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little like slightly rotten vegetables, but not in an overly imposing way, it&#x27;s very subtle (I have to practically stick my nose up to it to really smell it) and</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it should come in a resealable container.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it had a very grainy texture to it, that would not go away.</li>
            <li> Bought this late last October and my experience with the Shea Butter has been without ANY complaints.</li>
            <li> My only complaint and why it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star is I am not overly fond of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that I had a negative reaction to.</li>
            <li> The Shea has also cleared dark marks on my face and has lightened my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast; however, the Shea butter had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint I would say is it smells like a food product, like butter or something.</li>
            <li> At times the Shea butter I got would have a sour smell.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly because I wanted to see if they would stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> All of the lotions, creams and soaps recommended by their doctors are full of chemicals and not only did they hate the stinging</li>
            <li> a butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in reviews of some other shea butter products, I read that those products were not clean: the products were contaminated with some dirt and particles.</li>
            <li> I melted it down with some coconut and vitamin E oil, and let it solidify and use it twice a day on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> It locks in moisture without weighing my hair down and making it feel greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a carrier oil melted down.</li>
            <li> Has not let me down yet</li>
            <li> it does take a bit of encouragement to melt it down yourself.</li>
            <li> I did down load the e-book and plan to try some of the recipes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try out other recipes with it and see how they turn out!</li>
            <li> They provide helpful tips and are extremely knowledgable!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other recipes!</li>
            <li> I had some major stretch marks after the baby and this has lightened them (or at least I believe that to be the case!).</li>
            <li> but other than that, i will ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I have seen other butters listed for cheaper prices at heavier weights but the reviewers complain of debris in the butter!</li>
            <li> No more cracked dry lips for either of us.</li>
            <li> and there is no hair, mold , sticks or any other thing other than the product and the smell it what it should be for something being organic, raw and unrefined because there are no fragrances or additives</li>
            <li> I was very interested in this product since I had in the past purchase Shea butters products, but they all came with a sent that I was not to crazy about and other list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I made a face/all skin lotion with few other ingredients and whipped it up</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been burned a few other times on the quality, skimped on weight etc.</li>
            <li> There were no clumps and it wasn&#x27;t heavy on the skin like other so called Shea Butter products.  </li>
            <li> with a few other organic ingredients).</li>
            <li> Gf is black and uses this with organic sandalwood oil and a few other things to make a hair cream for her 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> and even though I like it, the negative factors right now make it very difficult for me to even use the product (the smell and texture especially)  </li>
            <li> Using it in homemade balm bars for family members with skin issues not responding well to typical medicinal products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put nothing less into my homemade body and hair products.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with the weight of the product; I received less than what was registered on the package.  </li>
            <li> This time around it seemed to have less in the packaging.</li>
            <li> They are also less severe.</li>
            <li> but I learned shea butter is sopposed to have a slight odor that I am just not accustomed to.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year and half now, and my stretch marks start fading.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the slight nutty smell offensive.  </li>
            <li> I took less than dime size amount and rubbed it in between my palms</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the difference in quality between this brand and the previous one I had used.</li>
            <li> the only thing wrong with my order is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a proper container.</li>
            <li> previously brought 7 of this Ivory Shea Butter from &amp;#34;Better Shea Butter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unlike coconut oil, which I had tried previously, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> but there is a black hair inside of the package inside with the product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add, it had a black hair in it,</li>
            <li> there was a slight gray color when whipped it up for the lotion body butter</li>
            <li> I happen to like the slightly smokey scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells like typical shea butter.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got an odd smell, but it served its purpose for the homemade products I was making.</li>
            <li> There is a slight earthy/ nutty scent to it.</li>
            <li> I whipped this up with some Coconut Oil and Black Castor Oil for a hair mask.  </li>
            <li> I bought this over a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> so maybe less coconut oil?</li>
            <li> Bland in 1/4 jar of</li>
            <li> No more dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s oily and greasy, leaves a serious shine</li>
            <li> Recently my husband had a horrible bicycle accident and completely pulled the skin from a rather large section of his knee.</li>
            <li> Wish the price would go down a little.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from very dry skin lately and after failed attempts with coconut oil (too greasy and not long lasting) I decided to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s UNREFINED, ORGANIC and not full of chemicals is the reason I chose it.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on a day our temps were 100 and there was no leaking or mess.  </li>
            <li> The shape wasn&#x27;t too thrilling as I use a measuring cup for my recipes, but it DID turn out to be helpful in cutting it up for the cup.</li>
            <li> The smell took some getting use to because it is not full of chemically smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li> (yea i was a mess)</li>
            <li> Made a hugh mess.</li>
            <li> Nothing has been done to mess with the nutritional value or the texture.  </li>
            <li> I was melting down, so a few crumbles made no difference to me.</li>
            <li> I use it raw and also as an additive to my other skin lotions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of very few things I use on my lifelong acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> shea butter itself is definitely higher quality than what I ordered afterwards from another seller, in that it was not in any way &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; but unfortunately the shea butter from both share the same gritty, unpleasant</li>
            <li> I have used Shea butter for years but unfortunately can not find any in my new location.</li>
            <li> I only use natural raw, cold pressed ingredients when I make lotions, butters, lip balms etc.  </li>
            <li> Huge waste of my money.... :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a common brand sold at my local beauty supply store for the past year</li>
            <li> For a few minutes your hands will have a slight sheen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m contemplating putting this product in a small jar and bringing it to work to use without adding it to other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greaser than coconut oil, but I just use it at night</li>
            <li> and I now have little to no issues.</li>
            <li> I will melt it again (not in the microwave, as the seller advised) -- and pour it into little glass jars anyway.</li>
            <li> , otherwise I&#x27;m feel a little greasy during the day.</li>
            <li> A little rancid smelling</li>
            <li> Just like all other shea butters that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooooooong way.</li>
            <li> It is creamy and goes on my skin with little residue.</li>
            <li> A little shea butter with a dab of almond oil to soften the shea and then add a bit of lavender</li>
            <li> A little change on stretch marks</li>
            <li> I usually whip my shea butter with other oils to help with the texture</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to mix it with a little coconut butter, meadow foam oil and carrot seed oil when I get the chance.</li>
            <li> because i have tried it, i may stick with ivory shea butter for a little to see how my skin and hair reacts to it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut out for lotion and just use a little on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about some of the reviews about the scent</li>
            <li> I take a little bit of the butter, melt it by rubing and then apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes I rub it between my fingers or in my palm, and sometimes I just press a little piece against my face and work it around, letting my face melt it.</li>
            <li> Just a little will</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous though because of all the varied accounts of the scent of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I weighed it, checked for any molding, rancidity,  and then gave it a little skin test.</li>
            <li> It drags a little when applying it after melting in my hands.</li>
            <li> The result is softer and covers up the shea scent a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not been as grainy as a number of other ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Mary little</li>
            <li> use this in a little bit of everything</li>
            <li> By itself it can be a little crumbly and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who might need something a little richer than coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are already familiar with Shea Butters.</li>
            <li> I already made a body butter from this Shea butter, coco butter, a little coconut oil and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> not fresh!</li>
            <li> I blended the shea butter and a little lavender oil with a hand mixer.</li>
            <li> its a little greasy and takes awhile to soak in</li>
            <li> My brother lives in a very dry climate, aka the desert and has hard water and he says he doesn&#x27;t have to put lotion on after each time he washes his hands now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was enough to make me instantly nauseous and I am especially annoyed because I am making my lotions and deodorants for the year, and now I am down an essential ingredient.</li>
            <li> but there was a large hallow spot in the block which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, I dont like how its sealed in that plastic, because it gets stuck in the corners, and it can get a little messy when you try to break it up to use.  </li>
            <li> (although the bag was a little wrinkled like it had been handled a few times passing it from point a to point b).</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a little to heavy as a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> With a little rubbing between the fingers its melts, which I like because I don&#x27;t like really heavy and sticky substances in my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little messy</li>
            <li> The price went down 2 days after I bought it - don&#x27;t get that?!</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> After returning the first bad order, I expected the replacement order to be like the first one’s, but alas, it was a disappointing dry and crumbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice this shea butter has a distinct scent, which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> but it really did have an unpleasant sour smell to me.</li>
            <li> and it really helps my skin in the cold winter.</li>
            <li> it is SO much easier to measure out for my cold process soap and lotion bar recipes.  </li>
            <li> it was a pain getting it out of that bag and into the box, messy anyway.</li>
            <li> but I feel that the plastic bag it comes in wasted a lot of Shea which stuck to it.</li>
            <li> This time of year in Wyoming is so harsh on skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told quite a few people about this product.</li>
            <li> but I now mix this with my cocco body butter mixture because I don&#x27;t want to waste my money</li>
            <li> Just received this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> it to the wife who made it into some kind of  lotion, which also tasted terrible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t downloaded the e-book yet, but I have used this a few times and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product a few times already</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times this week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy but manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few brands here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it for my hair as a conditioner because I don&#x27;t want to waste all of it and for my feet in socks at night.</li>
            <li> and I can use this everyday on my face with no problems.</li>
            <li> A few days after my ordering through amazon i received an email from owner Isabella thanking me for my purchase and just letting me know</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I cut the ingredients into the butter and then used my hand mixer and whipped it together for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It comes packaged in such a way that it&#x27;s totally contained, yet not &amp;#34;over packaged&amp;#34; (meaning they don&#x27;t waste resources on a lot of unnecessary packaging the way I do with unnecessary verbiage in my reviews...).</li>
            <li> Went rancid after a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been bringing this to my massage therapist to use instead of the messy oils.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from using harsh chemicals on my body.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this to make a few home made items.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now on my toddler and also for myself</li>
            <li> I am utterly confused about the inconsistent packaging as well as the inconsistent (and in my opinion), inferior quality of the second order.  </li>
            <li> If after a few minutes it does not seem to be thickening return the bowl to the ice bath and whip</li>
            <li> I ordered the ivory Shea butter which was delivered within a few working days.</li>
            <li> No dryness or flaking yet so supple and firm  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you apply it too heavily you&#x27;ll feel greasy for hours.</li>
            <li> My husband also uses it for his trouble spots, so it works for the men folk as well.  </li>
            <li> It feels softer after a few days.</li>
            <li> I blended it with coconut oil and apricot oil to make a body lotion as hostess gifts for a few showers that were thrown for me.  </li>
            <li> We saw results in skin softness and health after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of dried pig skin for dogs or something.</li>
            <li> I will review again after I use for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The Shea itself was in a plastic zip lock inside the re-sealable, heavy duty paper bag.</li>
            <li> and it can be a bit messy trying to get the amount you want out of it.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to write a review</li>
            <li> It may be too heavy for me for daytime use</li>
            <li> We applied Melrose oil from YoungLiving and then after a few days it scabbed over (thankfully the oil killed the pain and kept the infection at bay).</li>
            <li> Just a few days</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I can tell you that I will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, doesn&#x27;t kill or get tested on anything, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday and night</li>
            <li> Made one of the recipes a few days ago</li>
            <li> I did go to the beach and got some extra sun on the calf of my legs and behind the knees.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews beforehand and was apprehensive about the purchase -</li>
            <li> Will give a feedback a few months from now.</li>
            <li> I have at it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I use a round, air-tight tapper ware to store it in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I misplaced the instructions for downloading the ebook; within minutes after sending an email, I received the book as an attachment.  </li>
            <li> , I use this, combined with organic coconut oil and a few drops of peppermint oil, as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few days it became messy.  </li>
            <li> I use it to make my son Ethan&#x27;s dermatitis trouble skin</li>
            <li> It melts at the touch, is soft, and doesn&#x27;t have any weird stuff in it (like the batch I got from another company.)</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of Shea.  </li>
            <li> With that out of the way, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this butter.</li>
            <li> Some raw shea butter varieties are very flaky and/or get hard and are difficult to mix, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Product as described, arrived in a day and a half !</li>
            <li> And so much less greasy than coconut oil!</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s been less than a week!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a neat little brick, just as the picture shows, and is within a baggie in the raw shea butter bag which is also pictured (both are resealable).</li>
            <li> The only thing is it has a little nutty smell (normal), so I use it as my base.</li>
            <li> Why has the color changed from pale yellow/cream to greyish cream??</li>
            <li> It has a nutty scent that I chose not to mask with oils since my daughter would also be using it and with cold and flu season here I planned on using in her face to keep her nose from getting raw from blowing it so much</li>
            <li> This brand of shea butter is the smoothest without being to mushy or too thick like the other cheaper two brands I&#x27;ve bought from street vendors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remove mixture from ice bath and whip until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li> I know shea butter can also be used in aiding cases of eczema, dermatitis, skin discoloration, arthritis, stiff joints and bruising.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong odor and wasn&#x27;t offensive to me</li>
            <li> Not easy butter style as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not able to achieve this due to the fact that the main ingredient for the hand cream (this shea butter) was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I put a little into a small container that I keep by my vanity and use it every day and every night before bed, and my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before purchasing and was a little thrown off by the packaging thinking that it may be difficult or messy to use without a traditional container.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially for some dry patches on my face, but with the cold weather...</li>
            <li> I usually just scoop out a small amount after a shower and melt it in my hands and apply while skin is still slightly damp.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard, but I take a little and press it into my palm to melt it a bit before applying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell one bit, and I don&#x27;t really understand why some people find it unpleasant to the point they can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any of the hard, pebble-sized chunks you sometimes have to break down in raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> My son suffers from dry skin which is made even worse during the school year because he is on his high school&#x27;s swim team.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to handle, because it&#x27;s just a big block in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I bought some unrefined raw Shea butter at a market in Charlston years ago.  </li>
            <li> The idea of making my soap and body lotion led me to the Raw Unrefined Organic Shea</li>
            <li> I almost can use raw</li>
            <li> Since I have zero experience with Shea butter in raw form, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> We use this raw shea butter as lotion for ourselves &amp; our toddler.</li>
            <li> advice to use this organic raw Prodact</li>
            <li> I returned both raw shea butters and ordered clay-refined (odorless) shea butter from Brambleberry.</li>
            <li> Definitely raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have been using raw Shea butter for about 5 years now.  </li>
            <li> Raw and unrefined,</li>
            <li> It is definitely raw shea.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this raw</li>
            <li> I bought raw shea butter from another source and ended up with chemical burns on my scalp, so I was a bit leery about trying Shea butter from anyone.</li>
            <li> It is definitely raw and unfefined as described.</li>
            <li> This product is raw and organic</li>
            <li> That is probably something you just have to get used to with a raw product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a go, and Raw Shea Butter does</li>
            <li> mix the raw shea butter with coconut oil when applying to my hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen shea butter raw</li>
            <li> Wishing they would send right one :(</li>
            <li> But my second order this month has been so bad that I have to give an overall rating of 2...</li>
            <li> Its all natural, its going to have smell, at least the smell isnt fake or chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> NOW I put this on at LEAST half my body every night :</li>
            <li> but I like to apply immediately to body to exfoliate a little!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packaged well and sealed tight (in fact, hard to get out of the bag, so you know it&#x27;s sealed).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good or bad - but the scent dissipates quickly, so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is my daily moisturizer, but lately my skin has been very tight and dry and the coconut just hasn&#x27;t been cutting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought~ Very little smell if any (I can&#x27;t quite remember...</li>
            <li> It darkened, even tho there was very little heat used to soften it.  </li>
            <li> The difference between this and the other brand was like the distance from here to the sun!!!</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little less expensive, but other than that, 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the packing is messy, plastic wrap, and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about the bad smell in the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my face and have been using it for the past 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> In the past, we used all kinds of lotions, creams and coconut butters</li>
            <li> It also helps with the small amount of acne that he has.  </li>
            <li> I had never used shea butter before so was not sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure if they all come this way, but I have a problem with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the recipe book is for?</li>
            <li> if not more.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with that response</li>
            <li> I have purchased shea butter in the past.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality As Usual</li>
            <li> I used a plastic spoon to remove small quantities of it, and I also put a measuring cup into the bag to pack it in.</li>
            <li> I found a small hole at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Already the dryness on my legs is a thing of the past, but I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> But then I ran out :-/.</li>
            <li> I like the purity of the product and that the company that produces this does so in small batches.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what the consistency is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> Still not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> it gave a small pea size piece to each of my kids and</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount under my eyes at night sometimes as an under eye treatment.</li>
            <li> my used refined in the past</li>
            <li> not sure i will use it again, if ever.</li>
            <li> Not sure what my expectations were for this</li>
            <li> I wanted to formulate a small batch that was whipped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I went to my dermatologist and they recommended microdermabrasion, several lotions and expensive creams, which I used.  </li>
            <li> I tried making lotion with and it hardened back (which I read it would), but that makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for my hair, and I also don&#x27;t even care about the scent (which I truly find to be faint -- its definitely there, but it doesn&#x27;t linger nor does it even fill a room up with its scent.)</li>
            <li> She also responded to the few negative reviews with grace.</li>
            <li> She also responded to the few negative reviews with grace.</li>
            <li> No more allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> This is unbelievable for my skin.</li>
            <li> Before getting out of the shower I apply a small amount</li>
            <li> It was not grainy like some Shea butters I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so ecstatic over this product, I can only say you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to, but I&#x27;m not eating it as it&#x27;s just going on my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this instead of another companies like I&#x27;d done in the past because it offered Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> Has a scent but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The quality of this runs circles around anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased from beauty supply stores in the past.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a bit difficult to open (packing tape around a ziplock plastic bag).  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be running out any time soon</li>
            <li> Our family of four uses it everyday and it has already lasted five months and it&#x27;s not yet finished!</li>
            <li> I cut off a small chunk to put in another container.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make body butter and packaged in small jars for a bridal shower favor.  </li>
            <li> I placed some in a small container and carry it in my purse as a hand creme also.</li>
            <li> The only thing preventing five stars is the ziplock packaging is difficult to close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why though.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I ordered an organic shipment the second time around and was slightly sad when I discovered it was not in fact organic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for all of my trouble spots - elbows, heels, knees, etc., and I use it all over!</li>
            <li> Small amount.</li>
            <li> It solidified over the small recipe book.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s how it should smell or if something happened in the mail.  </li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how to make use of the rest of this block of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a bit of shea butter in the past, since I prefer it to the chemicals in hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews</li>
            <li> so not sure if it&#x27;s making a difference yet,</li>
            <li> This shea butter is also one of the few products that I can put on my skin without breaking out!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to make body butter of even use it plain.</li>
            <li> it is not as tough to break apart like other brands</li>
            <li> It was very earthy and nutty and did not make me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> The same quality as all the other very expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i wont name other stores, which are less expensive, but they are out there.</li>
            <li> which I have no problem with but the 8th patch I received smell bad with foul older and tasted so</li>
            <li> Needless to say i was a little apprehensive to buy this product due to the price and purchasing online.</li>
            <li> The other butter went bad about 3-4 months later...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it yet and am not sure if I can get past the scent!</li>
            <li> Product came having a few areas that looked dark or slightly dirty meaning it was not a clean look throughout the block.</li>
            <li> It just has a strong terrible odor.</li>
            <li> The smell is so awful and strong.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and not happy with smell and color of my first order</li>
            <li> Indeed unrefined and RAW!</li>
            <li> I had horrible dry skin on my chin that I absolutely could not get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Hard as a BRICK.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve hardly even scratched the surface it</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time getting all of it out of the plastic wrapping that it is in.  </li>
            <li> It is a hard block but creamy when softened.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to review.</li>
            <li> but it was yellow/gold, grainy, and hard.</li>
            <li> It is sort of hard</li>
            <li> But then it&#x27;s still so hard it doesn&#x27;t melt in my hands to rub on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hard lotion and whipped body scrub.</li>
            <li> I was making my salves and balms with just beeswax but didn&#x27;t like the hard texture I was getting.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the ebook</li>
            <li> so it is hard to rate  the product.</li>
            <li> Reading reviews I prepared myself for a bad smell but was surprised when I opened the bag.</li>
            <li> I cant imagine both companies would be selling bad butter, so this must be how shea butter naturally smells.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shea butter for at least 10 years now.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would melt in the southern heat, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> sucks up a lot of moisture (like my hair)....</li>
            <li> sucks up a lot of moisture (like my hair)....</li>
            <li> After that, I apply a sunscreen moisturizer with at least 30 SPF.</li>
            <li> the smell can not be detected once it absorbs, at least not per my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so at least I know how to use it</li>
            <li> I use this on both my hair and skin at least weekly and have ordered it for almost everyone I know.</li>
            <li> some complained about the packaging.</li>
            <li> The smell is very raw.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter arrived in a very raw form (a brick in a plastic bag)</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy,</li>
            <li> Support small businesses!</li>
            <li> Literally, other shea butters I&#x27;ve tried are 4x&#x27;s as expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean it smelled like shea butter.</li>
            <li> What does this mean?  </li>
            <li> One use and the difference in my skin is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> (Call me woo-woo, but those who know what I mean...</li>
            <li> Anyone who deals with eczema knows what I mean.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because you hear about people experience with getting a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Such a waste :-(</li>
            <li> but I personally feel the scent is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> i realized that after i purchased it that this is a very small package/piece of shea butter for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower whatever scent of oil I&#x27;m using with it.</li>
            <li> had to get really serious now.</li>
            <li> My son has had crazy dry patches on his elbows and thighs for months.  </li>
            <li> (less scary).</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a less expensive Shea Butter</li>
            <li> It does smell a little weird</li>
            <li> A slight odor, but not as bad as the previous brand I used.  </li>
            <li> This has been the ONLY product used for my skin that&#x27;s prevented my eczema from rearing its ugly head...</li>
            <li> It was difficult to transfer product and it stuck to the walls of ziplock which is a waste.</li>
            <li> It soothed my painful cracking skin immediately and my overall skin condition improved in the winter.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the smell as it doesn&#x27;t smell like other shea butters.</li>
            <li> He had a very bad case, covering his entire head and face and extending down to patches on his arms.  </li>
            <li> and I even used it plain because it didn&#x27;t have any weird scent to it</li>
            <li> I have worked in construction for thirty years and my skin has taken a beating from dust, dirt, wind, severe cold and extreme heat.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a weird batch or what,</li>
            <li> my order came on Friday, late in the day!</li>
            <li> but every place was too expensive or too shady.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I had noticed was the terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> I have used this brand multiple times and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming or weird smells or textures.</li>
            <li> I made a recipe with cocunut oil and essencial oils, and found it very hard to mask the Shea smell, still practicing..  </li>
            <li> Got my Raw Shea butter today but was a little disappointed when I didn&#x27;t recieve my recipe book</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream-like paste.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and oily,</li>
            <li> On to the product, I mean it&#x27;s 100% organic unrefined Shea butter!</li>
            <li> No More!!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has horrible eczema, so we mix this, almond oil, and a few essential oils</li>
            <li> Shea butter has a natural insect repellent without the chemicals.</li>
            <li> My husband, who was previously addicted to burts bees, loves the homemade with this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This product is an abosulte game changer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> but then I got tired of the thickness and greasy feeling it would leave on my hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, my skin just soaked up anything I put on it and seemed to get worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> Am tired of paying for fillers and preservatives</li>
            <li> /&gt;We made a heavy duty pain cream for me, one for my daughter&#x27;s eczema, a sleepy time lotion for the kids and some lotion for feet and chest for the upcoming flu and cold season.</li>
            <li> Last shea butter was actually annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> i have nothing bad to say about this product other than the nagging they do when you buy it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this is what you want!</li>
            <li> They are serious about shea butter!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from all the chemicals in modern skin care products that claimed to make improvements to my skin but failed miserably and see if what I&#x27;d been reading about shea butter would work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very bad scent and quite hard but other</li>
            <li> I hate feeling greasy and this cream sinks in.</li>
            <li> It is so soft, it&#x27;s insane!  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, it does not have a bad odor and it is not strong.  </li>
            <li> Extremely versatile as a base ingredient for homemade skincare products.</li>
            <li> It is not an unpleasant smell, but hard to cover up...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought shea butter before, so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like, but I thought this stuff smelled kinda bad.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s going to go unused and a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> One of the few times I have been disappointed in an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband was shocked when I bought a pound, but we went through it in less than 3 months!!</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed with the fact that I ordered one pound and Shea butter with all the packaging weighed only 15.2 ounces.</li>
            <li> I bought five because of the discount offer and was a little afraid that I would end up with 5 lbs of bad product .</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong with it?</li>
            <li> I had purchased some recently from another vendor, and it smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> I tried coconut oil, but ended up with horrible acne, and I normally only have a pimple here</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time with my skin drying out during the winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away all my expensive serums and used this butter on my face almost exclusively.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer than when i use orher expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> With a variety of uses where can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like bacon gone wrong.</li>
            <li> I would buy this over some of those expensive butters found at retailers.  </li>
            <li> Again, sadly, I purchased 2</li>
            <li> I have used unrefined Shea Butter in the past, but this time I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> : Sorry, but I have to reduce to one star.</li>
            <li> its unfortunate</li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> and it was grainy and difficult time rubbing into skin.</li>
            <li> But when I received it, I was not impressed at all, after attempting to nourish my skin with it, so I put it aside.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I hate leaving bad reviews on a whim, but my experiences are so vastly different:</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying from them anymore.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry the shea butter wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and is constantly scratching his skin to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li> It made the entire house smell disgusting after melting it and no matter what I tried</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I get headaches from using this product.  </li>
            <li> It was awful, oozing and red and</li>
            <li> Texture Reminds me of kids silly putty</li>
            <li> and I have everyone in my family obsessed with it as well.  </li>
            <li> Nothing complicated, Just rancid oil.</li>
            <li> So the idea of applying a butter to my skin had me really skeptical.</li>
            <li> Sadly, both Shea Butters had a rancid, smokey scent.</li>
            <li> BUT I HAD THIS CONDITION FOR A LONG MISERABLE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter from other companies and it was awful.</li>
            <li> The butter seemed to have nut bark residue,  the appearance a dirty looking ivory.  </li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it stinks</li>
            <li> This Shea butter STINKS~</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting it because I thought I was cutting the tape.</li>
            <li> I just know it stinks.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed !</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> It was awful- hard to explain but sort of like pork rinds, but stronger.</li>
            <li> Why has the smell become so pungent and unpleasant?</li>
            <li> but it is not altogether unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Ordered during the summer and it came as a melted blob with a slightly unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I found the scent of the Shea Butter to be unpleasant, which is the reason for 4/5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of very expensive Shea Butter products.</li>
            <li> made it nearly impossible to scoop it out.</li>
            <li> Secondly, and worst of all, the product smells terrible - it smells like burned rubber...</li>
            <li> and it was impossible.</li>
            <li> so I hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad before I can use it all.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad batch, either way</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t put it on my body because it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> Could not detect any bad smell from it.</li>
            <li> While the Shea butter does not have a bad scent, I just wanted a softer scent for my neck and face creams.</li>
            <li> This butter never went bad after 6 months.</li>
            <li> but we recieved it smashed pritty bad</li>
            <li> It is so off putting even my boyfriend has commented on how bad it is.  </li>
            <li> This 8th patch I received seem to be a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just not what I am used to from store bought lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad makes me wanna puke.</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad here</li>
            <li> When I got a bad sun burn this shea butter helped the healing process.  </li>
            <li> The butter would be in a lumpy shape that wasn&#x27;t esthetically pleasing and crudely wrapped in plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> Every so often my sister breaks out in a painful rash and the shea butter has also helped soothe that.  </li>
            <li> have not made me sick.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for lotions. :-(</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter feels like there is sand in it.  :(  </li>
            <li> He felt like a reptile, not a baby :(  </li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> Buy somewhere else... :(</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s very cold.</li>
            <li> I have never bought shea butter before so my opinion may be off base.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is the base of the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I hate throwing stuff out</li>
            <li> but I hate the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> horrible smell impossible to keep it on face.</li>
            <li> (I have terrible scars from a bad allergic reaction).</li>
            <li> but it smells so bad!</li>
            <li> but i hated the smell.</li>
            <li> I thought I hated shea butter until I tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I hated the ingredients.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Used it in a Beard Balm and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you plan to buy, buy from this seller, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible eczema on my hands and every lotion/cream/body butter/oil I had tried would burn like lemon on a paper cut.</li>
            <li> I have terrible reactions.  </li>
            <li> Tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> but it smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> It had a creamy ivory color but had a terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> I received the shea butter and it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> but then some where just awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working wonders on my college-girl&#x27;s skin, after a horrible bout with scabies.  </li>
            <li> It still smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this product because I got a nasty strepth infection after using the product.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible scar from surgery</li>
            <li> It did the job well in my recipes, but I never knew how much I hate the smell!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling Shea butter I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The smell is still horrible but after doing research it seems like that is what its supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> Then I read its reviews and it sounded awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful product! We recently moved to CO and needed a product that was safe for the entire family, natural, and very moisturizing for a dry climate. This has worked beautifully. I combine with organic coconut oil and essential oils for fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. Raw, Ivory, that classic organic shea butter smell. Everything about it is 100%. Great product and a great company.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it could be packaged in one ounce blocks so that you don&#x27;t have to measure out portions.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, fast and easy to make into a rejuvenating cream in 15 mins!!</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised. It&#x27;s a great batch of Shea Butter. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish it came in a plastic. light blocking container with a lid.</li>
            <li> Pure wonderful Shea butter.  Definitely will purchase from this company again</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected it is such a rich product and I can stretch it to make my favorite hair products to my liking when I mix with different organic oils and it keeps every thing it&#x27;s applied to moisturized for hours until you wash it off. I will be ordering this again and again.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it! It&#x27;s so soft and it penetrates into my skin after a minute or two. I personally like the scent although I don&#x27;t love it. But my skin feels so soft after I use it and it has definitely helped the itchiness on my skin. I definitely recommend this. I&#x27;m already looking forward to make this recipes as well.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter. I have made a sleepytime rub and look forward to making a variety of things. Also enjoying the recipe book.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own body butter. I have not had a chance to make that yet, however I used a small amount on the back of my hand to feel it out and make sure my sensitive skin was ok with. I can already feel a difference between the hand I put some on and the hand I didn&#x27;t. It is so much softer!!!</li>
            <li> love it, works wonders!! Im 8 months prego and It right away soothes any itching I have! also, makes my hair/skin soft</li>
            <li> Melts in your hand - not gritty like others can be. Great product</li>
            <li> I made lip balm and lotion bars with this and it turned out great! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Best Shea butter I have ever bought.  Very clean and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great shea butter. I used this instead of moisturazing lotions during winter. It has a mild scent which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service!</li>
            <li> Loved the Shea Butter! Made my own deodorant last weekend and will make body lotion today :)</li>
            <li> I have started using shea butter as a cleanser. I am pleased with the results I am seeing and will continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I made body butter using this as one of the ingredients and it performed wonderfully !  Melted completely and thoroughly.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product I didnt experience the smell other people reported it smell kind of nutty. Delivery was very quick and I even received a email thanking me for my business I cant wait to start making lotions with this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product from a wonderful person named Isabella. She was very good to me and cares about her customers. I told her that I really wanted to try this product but it didn&#x27;t work for me. She was kind enought to give me a refund and also hoped I find the right product for my skin. Did work for me but I know it has helped so many people out there :)</li>
            <li> Arrived today.  I love it! Ordered the ivory shea butter and it smells so good and it is so creamy. This is my first purchase from Better Shea Butter and I will never buy from any other. Others I bought from other sellers smelled old and just didn&#x27;t look fresh. So glad I bought this to make my homemade body butters, scrubs, deodorants and lotions. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it to create...as my husband likes to say, my concoctions. &#x3D;) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have  made  my  own  whipped butter  with  this, a little  coconut  oil and some essential oils.  Had  worked  out  nicely.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I made some of my own lotion using this product for my tummy (9 months pregnant). I mixed some olive oil and essential oils with it from a &amp;#34;recipe book&amp;#34; and it turned out fabulous!! I don&#x27;t have any itching anymore and it feels so good on my skin for hours. Love! Can&#x27;t wait to try out other recipes with it and see how they turn out!</li>
            <li> I love this product ! Best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased . I bought it for my face and have been using it for the past 2 weeks . My skin is radiant and my complexion is beautiful. This does not break me out at all and I use it twice a day after I wash my face in the morning and at night ! Love it !</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s so soft silky and smooth.  Use it to make luxurious soap that the stores just cannot compete with.  My wife made soap with it by using one of the recipes that Isabella provided with the purchase.  It is creamy and wonderful.  I use it for my body, face and hair lol.  I don&#x27;t recommend you do that, but I&#x27;m a guy, so I can get away with it.  Wife also made lotion bars with it as well by mixing it with cocoa butter, beezwax vitamin E and vanilla drops--wow is it rich and wonderful.  The product shipped very fast and the customer service is the best I&#x27;ve had on Amazon so far.  Isabella is the best.  I love her!</li>
            <li> this is exactly the product i was looking for.  Bonus: comes with a recipe book!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product. Using it in homemade balm bars for family members with skin issues not responding well to typical medicinal products. Love the texture of the bars and the fact that there are only all natural ingredients in my bars!</li>
            <li> I am not an expert as usually use cocoa butter but recently tried NOW shea butter and now this product. At a glance this product is smoother, creamier and more appealing. And the feel is also and moister too-not grainy and kind of dry like the Now seemed to be.. my lotion turned out better too. and cheaper to buy by the pound  definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Even got an email with recipes when I purchased this product. I use in a lot of my home made beauty products.</li>
            <li> This was packaged great.  Super product, used it to make lotions worked great.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for use in homemade lotions and body butters, and while I haven&#x27;t quite had time to use this in lotions/BB, I&#x27;ve put it straight on my skin.  It makes my hands so nice and soft, which is sometimes difficult because I am a nurse and constantly washing my hands/using hand sanitizer.  I&#x27;m contemplating putting this product in a small jar and bringing it to work to use without adding it to other ingredients.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using Shea butter. I bought it to make deodorant and moisturizer. I&#x27;m wild about the results! I will be getting more for sure! Lip balm is next! Yay!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is so good!! It&#x27;s very soft and pliable. It&#x27;s easy to work with--I made a nice, moisturizing body cream out of it,  along with some olive oil and coconut oil. The packaging was very neat and nothing was damaged. My package actually came about 5 days earlier than expected, so that was a pleasant surprise!  However, I dont like how its sealed in that plastic, because it gets stuck in the corners, and it can get a little messy when you try to break it up to use.  Besides that minor issue, I&#x27;m looking forward to using the recipes in the ebook, which btw, was very easy to download and access--just have your order ID #. So far, I&#x27;ve used my body cream I made from this on my hair, my face, my body, my scalp and as a makeup remover! This is such a high quality product and I will definitely be buying again when I need more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughters to make lip balm.  They love it and have used it to make some pretty amazing DIY products.</li>
            <li> Quality shea butter. I love using it in my homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> I like the purity and simplicity of this product. At first the smell seems odd, it&#x27;s kind of earthy, different from the synthetic scents you find in commercial products. But it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after you rub it in, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. Also the lotion has a grainy texture at first, but when you rub it between your palms it softens into a beautifully creamy, spreadable balm. My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter.  Easy to use and nicely packaged.  Will order from again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Shea Butter, the company is awesome. I love the fact it comes with a e-book, the company sends emails of DIY I just love it all together. I use it on my skin and hair, the Shea Butter is good quality. I cannot wait to make different hair/skin care products.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li> High quality and great for my nighttime face cream!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased shea butter before. However, from my research the is good stuff. The smell is really nice. I have used it for my lotion and my skin feels so much better. This really helps with dry skin. I keep it in a cool dry place in my kitchen. It becomes slightly soft with the warmer Texas weather.</li>
            <li> I have never bought shea butter before so my opinion may be off base. I was expecting it to be a bit more creamy, but instead it was crumbly. After I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair conditioner recipe with some other oils, it looked better. However when I went to use it on her hair there were little gritty bits in the conditioner. Maybe that is normal, but I didn&#x27;t like working with it. I was surprised because this brand had the best reviews which is why I bought it. Is that the way shea butter works? Am I doing something wrong with it?</li>
            <li> Love this butter... Makes great body butters!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. I used it to make various body buttersm Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the quality &amp; color!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Very soft. Easy to use. Nice scent. Moisturizing. Blends well in my lip balms and whipped body butters. Comes with recipe ebook. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best value around  I absolutely love this and will buy again</li>
            <li> As mentioned in my &#x27;cocoa butter review&#x27; this shea (as well as the cocoa) butter is awesome.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and high quality.  I&#x27;d put nothing less into my homemade body and hair products.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  The ebook did not contain the exact recipe that I was interested in but it did give a starting point.  The shea butter is much thicker than I had anticipated.  But, that&#x27;s okay.  I will learn not to be heavy-handed with it.  It mixes easily with coconut oil and castor oil. The smell is earthy and somewhat full bodied.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is very creamy and easy to whip, the smell is nice and not stale - I had found that problem with other butters in the past and I am always nervous to open up a new package, but this shea butter smells fresh and sort of nutty. I have recently had dry skin on my feet and I am giving shea butter a shot. This comes with a free recipes book, I hope it will help me with my skin problem on my feet and if so I will continue to buy this product. PS: I love the resealable bag! UPDATE.  This shea butter works great. I have been using it for about 6 months.  The dry skin on my feet went away after the first month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short, sweet and to the point.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft. A bit grainy when mixed to use as hair butter, but it works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the fact that it comes with a manual is also helpful. The only thing is that I wish it came in larger amounts. It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;annoying&amp;#34; having to buy it in 1lb portions when I&#x27;m going to be using it on a regular basis to make my skin care line. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eczema, it&#x27;s amazing quality and pure. I use it every night and have had no issues with my skin since using it. definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Hard as a BRICK. Did not soften after sitting out for several days</li>
            <li> I finally made my first batch of lotion! Love it so far.</li>
            <li> great stuff... i fly for a living and keeps my skin hydrated and soft  from lips to elbows</li>
            <li> Love this-will definitely be reordering. Perfect organic Shea butter for body lotion with its mild nutty scent. Lastly, kudos for the quick ship.</li>
            <li> This is a grainy product, but I love it because as you rub it together it just heats up in your hands and you can do as you please! I love it for my feet, keeps them softer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a different shea butter in the past from Amazon and I am glad that I decided to give this one a try as it is so much better. You can clearly tell that it is of better quality. It&#x27;s creamy, smells nice and with it being organic, it just seems cleaner. I will definitely purchase it again. The DIY ebook that comes with the purchase of the shea butter is an added bonus! I&#x27;ve made a couple of the recipes so far. It was easy and I am enjoying them.</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Butter for many year, I just bought the Ivory one from this seller and I have to say I really love it. It smells fresh, it melts easily and I do love the packaging - it does not look like food for once:) I have used most of it, but I am storing the rest in their resealable bag. The recipes book is very helpful, they have more than 10 recipes using Shea Butter and I am determined to try all of them. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter--use it all the time with coconut oil and almond oil to make lotion!</li>
            <li> Great product, as described</li>
            <li> The butter was great, I used it to make body butters for all of my friends and it came out great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Shea Butter&#x27;s scent was a bit powerful and I had to use extra essential oils</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great for softening my extremely dry skin as well as a wonderful natural sunblock.This is the BEST stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I make an eczema cream out of this (with cedarwood, geranium, and lavender essential oils) and it&#x27;s amazing at clearing up my eczema! It&#x27;s the only thing that works, not even prescriptions do the trick. This shea butter is great at moisturizing. It&#x27;s yellow, but don&#x27;t leave it in the sun or it will turn white and lose some of its healing properties (from what I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li> Love the product and the eBook!</li>
            <li> I used it to make sunscreen. Product arrived quickly and although in block form, was very easy to measure out for my recipe. Would order again.</li>
            <li> awesome packaging, quick sgipping and quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> i have nothing bad to say about this product other than the nagging they do when you buy it.  the product itself is 5 stars, but for the price you only get a bag. the cheaper stuff where you get more, they include a container. i dinged it a star because of that. while the bag is a nice bag, it&#x27;s not a box or a container. so it makes it harder to dispense. on the plus side it fit perfectly in a loaf sized box made by ziplock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the butter is smooth, but rather hard. a little goes a long way, but because you have to warm it up, you tend to use more. comparing it with a paste version of this, this goes on smoother - like butter, but they are both the same. hard to say if i will spend more for less in the future or not. it was a pain getting it out of that bag and into the box, messy anyway.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Able to make cleansers and moisturizers and sunscreen (with Zinc Oxide) at a FRACTION of what they cost in the store.  It works!  It is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible eczema on my hands and every lotion/cream/body butter/oil I had tried would burn like lemon on a paper cut. No longer! This goes on smoothly, pain-free, and my hands are doing better than they have in years. This was my first experience with raw shea butter, so I was unsure what to expect. It did take me a bit of trial and error to figure out how to apply the stuff. The consistency is a bit crumbly, similar to play-doh, and I had no idea how big of a chunk to use. Now, I would say dime size works well for just my hands and maybe half-dollar if I am doing a full body slather.  I found that warming it briefly between my hands allowed it to melt a bit and spread more easily on my skin. Once you start working it into your skin it melts beautifully. Also, it is essentially an oil, so it does not absorb into skin the way a lotion will. It has met my needs well, and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time buying this and I love it! I make deodorant and lotion with it and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! My skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great for lotions, scubs, and lip balms!  Would by again!</li>
            <li> I used this to make all natural lip balm with bees wax, coconut oil, and lavender oil.  PERFECT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the lip balm out to my friends, and they&#x27;ve been asking for more!</li>
            <li> This is really great shea butter.  I like the consistency and it doesn&#x27;t feel grainy.  I am loving it.  I don&#x27;t think I can use any other brand now.  This is just the best out there.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !! It&#x27;s more creamy than other brands I have bought in the past . I used it for my hair and skin ..and I absolutely love it !!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will be ordering from this compant again!</li>
            <li> My first time buying Shea butter and so far I&#x27;m impressed! Better Shea includes a free e-book with purchase and I&#x27;ve already bookmarked several to try. I purchased this to mix with some essential oils for a homemade eczema cream. I have incredibly sensitive skin and am looking forward to using a pure and natural product on my skin!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love having smooth skin and glossy hair. Shea butter has always been a solution for my different skin problems like extreme dryness in the winter, or some acne breakouts here and there. I then started using it in recipes with Lavender Oil and Coconut Oil, and the smell mixed with the creaminess of whipped shea butter is just too addicting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different shea butters over time, even refined shea butter - which I will never use again and does not compare to raw &amp; unrefined. Anyways, this shea butter is very smooth, smells delicious and the bonus is an ebook with great tips and recipes, which I love. I would recommend this product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;JKJ</li>
            <li> i got this for my sister she has eczema on her hands. my sister loves it her eczema still there but i can tell the difference it helps her a lot it locks the moist for a very long time and it didnt irritate her all. she told me she definitely going to buy it again</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it in a container but otherwise the shea butter is perfect.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is so smooth and creamy. I have been so thoroughly satisfied that this is my 3rd or 4th order.</li>
            <li> Very good quality...creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product was everything they said it should be.can&#x27;t wait to start my project.the only thing I notice is the  smell is not that great.customer service is good too.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I&#x27;ve made one lotion so far (I got the recipe from the Internet).  I&#x27;m really excited about trying out the free e-book as well.  The owner of Better Shea Butter was very friendly.  She contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and that I was able to access my free e-book.  I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This product came out so much smoother that others I have used. It felt very creamy, smooth on my skin. Perfect for the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was nice and it came with an e-book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely to purchase from this vendor again</li>
            <li> This was one of the best shea butter&#x27;s I have ever purchased. I had purchased some recently from another vendor, and it smelled horrible. This didn&#x27;t have any smell and worked great with the salves that I make. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing.  I love it.  I have used it in body butter, lip balm, and deodorant.  It is simply as good as it claims.</li>
            <li> Really high grade and quality!</li>
            <li> Good quality, smooth and melts on contact.</li>
            <li> wonderful no bad smells</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is AHHMAZE!!! LOVE IT!!! ♥ Will recommend to many &amp; plan on using forever!!!♥</li>
            <li> I have never used pure Shea Butter before but now I am a true believer. This stuff is wonderful. For weeks I just kept a tub beside my bed and ran my hand over it and scraped my nails across it before I got into bed. It was wonderful. Then I got more creative and ordered Mango Butter. I melted both and added Coconut oil. I didn&#x27;t stop there I added several other oils I had such as Jojoba oil, vit E oil, vit. C oil and Bata Carotene. It just kept getting better. I have used this on my hands, face and hair!  My hair is soft and shiny, my hands and face are deeply moisturized and my nails have never looked better. I am so impressed I am giving small tubs of it to my friends. All I can say is this is really good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the soft creamy consistence of BSB! I use it in my homemade skin care &amp; bath products. It&#x27;s easy to work with, beautiful quality. I&#x27;ve used other brands that felt course and grainy, but that&#x27;s not the case here. I find this Shea butter blends nicely with other ingredients, easy to melt, and all in all a very nice addition to my collection of ingredients. I have sensitive mature skin, and Shea butter is an important part of my recipes. I also very much appreciated the free ebook that was included with my purchase, and the excellent communication from the seller. I plan to try some of their other products; I think the standard of quality will be great, based my the Shea butter experience!</li>
            <li> Super smooth, fantastic product, customer service and recipe ebook. Will purchase again and again!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> When I sneezed I would get an Itch all over my body, but now after I put this on there is no more itch keep the product the same and I will keep buying</li>
            <li> A+++++++++ product ! This is the best I have used and will not buy anywhere else. The seller shipped it fast and has had great communication ! I would recommend this product and seller to anyone looking for a quality Shea Butter !</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is lovely!  I have been able to whip it with essential oils for facial moisturizers and hand creams.  It is rich,  blends well and leaves my skin very moisturized but not greasy. This is a luxurious product.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Best stuff yet.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make homemade body butter and it turned out better than I expected! I would recommend this and would definitely use it again!</li>
            <li> Great product and recipes!</li>
            <li> This is real shea butter with nothing added!  Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li> I always have problems with new skin care products, and have been trying to go natural. I tried coconut oil, but ended up with horrible acne, and I normally only have a pimple here and there, so I decided to give this a try. It is a little greaser than coconut oil, but I just use it at night and it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve had no additional breakouts, or issues.&lt;br /&gt;The book that you get have awesome little recipes. I havent made one yet, but I really want to try. This is great stuff, and it weighed in at pretty much exactly a pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again if I ever get through this brick!</li>
            <li> Great product and the seller was even better!  They were prompt in shipping, the item was exactly as described and they were very kind.</li>
            <li> Great product, starting to use, reccomend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Smells great and works nicely in my diy moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter melts into a gorgeous creamy texture and is perfect in homemade body butters and lip balms!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Has helped maintain my skin moisturized in this dry weather! I use the Wellness Mama (http://wellnessmama.com/6544/whipped-body-butter-recipe/) recipe and apply it to my hands and body.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful butter!! very clean &amp; fresh... I made my whipped Body Butter with this &amp; it is heavenly...wonderful to work with...I will be buying more...Thanks... A+++++ Seller!</li>
            <li> nice product. arrived as described.  Would purchase from again</li>
            <li> Amazing product and great service.  I received my order quickly and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, but I just can&#x27;t over the scent. Not sure if I got a weird batch or what, but I used it to make homemade body butter, and tried adding a bunch of lavender essential oil, but nothing got rid of the smell. Second guessing whether I want to give it away as gifts as planned.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Came well packaged, just as pictured. High quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fast delivery. Can&#x27;t wait to try the sweet recipes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service and top quality product!</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter I &#x27;ve ever used. Some of the other brands of shea butter that I&#x27;ve tried are clumpy and hard, but this one melts in your hands and goes on smooth. I use it for my body and hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It melts so quickly and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  Shea butter arrived promptly, and I love it!  It melts easily and whips up beautifully!  Cannot wait to use it for more projects, especially those in the ebook of recipes provided by Better Shea Butter!  The seller has excellent follow-up, which is a bonus.  I highly recommend this product and seller...a superb experience!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I literally apply it all over my body when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, all day. It doesn&#x27;t dry right away, which is expected, so I just do my hair and make up while I let it soak in. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THEBOMBDOTCOM!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;and the seller is a very nice person.  She talks to ya! ;)&lt;br /&gt;customer for life!</li>
            <li> Authentic Shea Butter. Exceptional quality. I have ordered Shea Butter from several companies and this one is the best in my opinion. Fresh, easy to use, no added additives just plain Shea butter. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Good quality shea butter and delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> Quality shea butter. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Well packaged, fast delivery, wonderful product! Soft and workable in your palm. Definitely fresh!</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous amount of shea butter for the price. I bought this quite a while back and I&#x27;ve hardly even scratched the surface it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shea butter itself, it&#x27;s definitely quality stuff. I suffer from both eczema and stretch marks and it&#x27;s helped with both. Of course, you can&#x27;t expect a miracle overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if shea butter is what you think you need, then this is a great product. You won&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it...I made some body butter with this product today!! Great quality and my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is awesome!!  The real deal.  Melts at skin temp, smells like it should.  Very happy with this purchase.  I keep searching for honest sellers who support the women who make this product.  I have found her.</li>
            <li> Great, high quality product. I am using it on my 15 months old baby, she has eczema and pediatrician wanted to treat her with prescription creams and antibiotics. I decided to take the natural route first and so far I have been bathing her with colloidal oatmeal and after bath I use the shea butter. The ointment is very thick, odorless and its very good quality. I put it her before bed time and dress her in long pijamas ( so she will not scratch), the next morning her skin still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this! I just made lotion and lotion bars with it last night and they turned out perfect and smell so good. Just a pure, clean smell and oh so soft. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Great for making homemade lipbalm! Once I saw how easy it is, I can&#x27;t imagine buying it at the store again. This is enough shea to make several dozen small round containers (keep in mind there are other ingredients needed in addition to Shea).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I bought it to make body butter for my family and diaper ointment for my baby due in December. I have mild eczema on my hands that worsens in the winter and after using this product for a day my skin was smooth and nourished. I use the body butter on my feet and they are now as smooth as can be! It has a nutty scent that I chose not to mask with oils since my daughter would also be using it and with cold and flu season here I planned on using in her face to keep her nose from getting raw from blowing it so much and it has done just that! Product was delivered timely and the owner of the company sent a follow up email to see what I thought and ensure I was able to access the ebook. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product or the company. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Love the quality of the Shea butter it is wonderful. It came on time and packaged nicely. Also amazing customer service! Very happy!</li>
            <li> The quality of this was awesome! I made some lovely whipped body butters with this. I loved it so much I placed another and I cannot wait for that to get here! The packaging was simple and sturdy, don&#x27;t need much more than that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quick delivery! I make my own two ingredient lotion with this ( 6 tbsp olive oil and one order of this shea butter, melted over very low heat, refrigerated for about 45 minutes, the whipped with an electric mixer). It&#x27;s a fantastic body butter for very dry skin in the colder months!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Feels so silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product , wonderful purpose . Love this company. I made soaps and body butters and everyone loved it!</li>
            <li> I used this Shea butter for a homemade deodorant recipe and it worked out great.  I&#x27;m not some one who often uses shea butter or makes homemade recipes for beauty care products or anything so I&#x27;m sure some one else&#x27;s review may have more information if you need specifics, however for what I used it for I was happy with the product.  Also I received the product as it was described and on time in good packaging.</li>
            <li> I purchased shea butter because I was planning on making my own lotion and moisturizers.  My sister made an eye cream and wanted to try my shea butter that I had just received from the mail.  When I opened the package, the shea butter was sooooo fresh!  The shea butter from this vendor was such a great quality!  I just loved it!  I will definitely buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> love it! its a recommended product.</li>
            <li> I love the butter!  It&#x27;s soft &amp; silky in the recipe that I prepared for my son.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to disclose though...  I had a problem with the weight of the product; I received less than what was registered on the package.  I notified the company; they were really prompt with getting back to me &amp; fixing the problem.  So I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is soft in the packaging and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;m in LOVE with the packaging, unique and easily accessible with the re-seal lid.  On to the product, I mean it&#x27;s 100% organic unrefined Shea butter! WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY.  The texture is smooth and melts at the warmth of your body.  I&#x27;ll mostly use it for hair moisturizer and facial lotion from Acne.  My product shipped and arrived the next day &amp; customer service is excellent! Thx you Better Shea Butter</li>
            <li> good quality shea butter</li>
            <li> Have ordered this twice now, great stuff!  Have used it right out of the package to rub on skin.  Prefer this over bottled lotion.  Have used it in a couple batches of lotion as well and works great.</li>
            <li> I meant to make this into a body butter but I never got around to it. I&#x27;ve been using it raw on my extremely dry sensitive skin this winter and it&#x27;s worked wonders. It&#x27;s very soft and malleable like playdoh. Has an earthy scent which I don&#x27;t mind but I can see it offending others. If it bothers you, look up body butter recipes with essential oils for scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for making body butter with essential oils.  Great quality and overall a great product.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> smells very earthy. mixes great with other oils to make lotion. super happy I found this</li>
            <li> I bought some unrefined raw Shea butter at a market in Charlston years ago.  It was amazing until I ran out and could not seem to find the same product again until now!!  This is such a quality product and wonderful to work with .  Delivery was very quick and the information and various recipes provided were very helpful!  I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Shipped in good timing package was undamaged and product was fresh will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Love the shea butter and the recipes. First time I ever bought shea butter, but sure I will br buying more.</li>
            <li> The product came as pictured.  I wanted to use the product before I wrote a review.  My familiy&#x27;s results with the product have been better than expected.  My son suffers from dry skin which is made even worse during the school year because he is on his high school&#x27;s swim team.  In the past, we used all kinds of lotions, creams and coconut butters but this product has been the best!  It also helps with the small amount of acne that he has.  I have very fine hair but I have a lot of it.  I leave it on my wet hair and put it on my face underneath my make-up.  For me, its too heavy to use on dry hair.  My mother&#x27;s hair is also very fine but thin and she&#x27;s able to use a small amount on wet har.  She also uses it as a body moisturizer.  The smell is not unpleasant and it melts and goes on easily.  Lastly, I received an email from the seller thanking me for my purchase before my product arrived.  I didn&#x27;t have to call them but reading from the reviews, it would appear they have excellent customer service.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is only the second time I have purchased shea butter. The first time i didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for.  I have to say that I&#x27;m still not very skilled at picking out good shea butter, but what I received from this company was nicer than what I got before.  The smell was much more pleasant and the body butter I made with it was creamier. I am happy and will order again.  I did have difficulty downloading the recipe book that was included on the website</li>
            <li> great product , smell and service ! it works great on my skin , also on my friends&#x27; skin :)</li>
            <li> Very very good I love !!!</li>
            <li> it helps make skin softer  but too greasy for me and I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have never used Shea Butter before, but I have read about all of the benefits for healthy skin. I like using organic products. I found several recipes, including lip balm. I made the lip balm yesterday and LOVE it!! It is so much better than anything I have found in stores or on line. When you make it yourself, you can control how solid or soft it is and how much fragrance (essential oils) to add. I plan to use more of the recipes found on their website. I will definitely order more when I have used this up.</li>
            <li> Seller was very prompt and thorough in addressing my concerns. Once the product came, I was very satisfied with it. I have been adding it to my skincare routine with coconut oil (it is a bit harder to spread than I anticipated) and I have noticed that some scars on my arms have faded. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> The idea of making my soap and body lotion led me to the Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Easy to use even as it. It came with a very helpful recipe ebook. The lemon scent is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It came very promptly double wrapped in a plastic bag and resealable organic paper bag. Playing beach volleyball my feet are always in rough shape, heels are cracked and very dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for two days and I can see the difference! My heels started feeling smooth already.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> sinks in. great for ezcema</li>
            <li> I used this in homemade deodorant. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Lovely product but I feel that the plastic bag it comes in wasted a lot of Shea which stuck to it. Please reconsider your packaging!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to make some homemade body butter. My skin is very sensitive and buying lotion has always been a challenge for me. This stuff is AMAZING. My skin was so soft after I used it. I have used it by itself and with the body butter I made. By itself, it was very moisturizing and takes a little while for it to absorb into your skin. With the body butter it is amazing. I will never go back to conventional lotion again!</li>
            <li> Totally love, love, love this shea butter. It&#x27;s so rich and creamy. I melted it down and mixed it with other oils, then whipped it to a fluffy mousse. Its so smooth.</li>
            <li> Just made a batch of face moisturizer with the Shea Butter and my face feels soft and not dry anymore.  Great product so far....will use the recipe from the ebook to make body lotion next.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Raw Shea Butter and the Free Body Butter Recipes eBook.  I have always been highly satisfied with the product and the wonderful customer service.  This Shea Butter is by far the best anywhere.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>
            <li> I struggle with eczema and very dry skin.  I needed a product that had No perfumes, No dyes and was gentle and moisturized well.  This Shea Butter does all those things!  I am seeing improvements in my skin after just under a week of use.  I would highly recommend this product and I will be buying it again, no doubt!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I am very happy with it. I will continue to order this product again. I made hand cream with it as gifts and kept one jar for myself- it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve used it to make deodorant, lotion, chapstick, and body butter. It whipped up beautifully for the body butter. It has a subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower whatever scent of oil I&#x27;m using with it. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice now and will continue to!</li>
            <li> 1st time ordering Shea Butter, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to but I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of shea butter from this particular company. This time around it seemed to have less in the packaging. Other than that, I love the product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product, especially in the winter where it provides a soothing, smooth texture to every inch of skin! I&#x27;ve tried many different Shea butter products but this is by far the best! Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! Used it to make some natural deodorant and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased the shea butter for DIY deodorant.. the Shea butter is of real good quality.. the only place i&#x27;ll get my shea and cocoa butter from!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great.  This time of year in Wyoming is so harsh on skin.  The shea butter softens it like nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is the only vender I order from.  Love the Shea Butter.....</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! I love the product! AH-MAZING feel, and scent! I can&#x27;t keep my hands off it,been using straight off the block with the cocoa butter..mmmmm...heaven! And I bought it for my body butters and lotion/perfume sticks;)</li>
            <li> I love my Shea Butter! It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> Has a very unique and distinct smell, still getting use to it. Otherwise very moisturizing. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging. I&#x27;m a first time user, but I after having 3 boys I needed something to help my stretch marks. I love that its so creamy &amp; not greasy. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I have found! If you have not yet tried this product you need to do so before wasting your money on anything else. You will not be disappointed! I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Strange smell. Seller did not reply when I contacted with a question about the smell. I will keep and use minute amounts for recipes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love the smell and my skin has never been happier.</li>
            <li> wow! I didn&#x27;t know there could be such a difference! This is truly the consistency of butter.  It absorbs so well into my skin.  I will certainly be buying more.  I am using it as a moisturizer and as an ingredient in homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> Just as described and yea its great</li>
            <li> The quality, as far as I can tell, is quite good. Nice nutty aroma. Expected texture. Works great alone and in other homemade body products- especially whipped body butter!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I have a difficult time with my skin drying out during the winter (thanks Ohio!) and it will start to crack and bleed quickly. I put this on my body 1-2 times a week before bed and on my hands every other night with gloves and I now have little to no issues. A little goes a long way too! I&#x27;ve told quite a few people about this product. It&#x27;s better than all the money you spend on more expensive stuff that lasts a quarter of the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - I&#x27;ve been mixing it w/ sesame oil and couple drops of lavender and using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used up all my first batch I ordered and was extremely satisfied with the quality of the shea butter which is why I am now on my second order. I love that this is from Austin, which is only about an hour from me. Keep up the great work and thank you for offering a high-quality product for my skin care projects! I have used this for lip balms, sunblock and deodorant.</li>
            <li> The product was great.  I on,y wish it would have been packaged differently.  I had to put what I didn&#x27;t use right away into a ziplock baggie.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter!  The fact that it&#x27;s UNREFINED, ORGANIC and not full of chemicals is the reason I chose it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I&#x27;m soon happy with it.  I go to bed with it on my face and wake up with such amazingly smooth skin the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added Plus:  My cat has fleas.  When they get on me I have terrible reactions.  I put some of this on my skin after breaking out and the skin rashes and bites stopped hurting and festering.  I put it on to prevent them from reacting and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very very good.  Thank you for having this.</li>
            <li> my first time using Shea butter and so far I have no complaints. Adds incredible moisture to my skin and doesn&#x27;t bother my eczema at all after use</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter and Seller on Amazon.  Great products. 3rd time I have ordered this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff. Has nice nutty aroma. I put it on my face at night right after washing. Does a great job at reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of shea butter!  Fast shipping and I liked the packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product, just as described, fast shop. A great shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a different Shea Butter so I can&#x27;t compare. I use this one for my DIY sunscreen and Body Care. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far. I will keep using this Shea Butter :)</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  I will definitely be ordering from them again.  This is so smooth and feels so good on, very moisturizing.  I loved that I got an ebook with some recipes for free.  I just had to send them my order number after going to their link and the next day I had an email for the ebook which I could open up in my kindle app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/18/2015&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Shea Butter for a second time and it&#x27;s as wonderful as the first time.  It has been so helpful with my eczema and just dry skin in general and yet doesn&#x27;t break out my face that still gets pimples at age 41.  The ebook is great as well, lots of really good recipes.  I&#x27;m sold and will continue to order from this company.  I&#x27;m about to order some of their zinc oxide as well to make some homemade sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality Shea butter</li>
            <li> This came it seemed already creamy, I haven&#x27;t made the recipes but can&#x27;t wait to try. I almost can use raw it comes so smooth.</li>
            <li> Great Shea Butter!  Great quality!  Melts easily into your hands and spreads well.  Love it for a body moisturizer.  No strong smell at all, just good ol&#x27; Shea butter smell (mild, natural scent).  Comes in large rectangular cube.  I cut tiny chunks off as needed and store in Tupperware.  Shelf life is 3 years and mine was sent to me fresh made on Dec 14th 2014.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! Excellent info sheet to explain how to use!</li>
            <li> listen!!! This is the best. They give you so much it should last you a long time. I make my own oils and I made  two big coconut oil jar filled . One 32 oz and one 16 oz, also mixed with other natural oils. and I still have enough . It will probably last me a year or so. They emailed me to make sure I received it, also wanted to know if I had questions . They have receipes for everything. I am telling you this is the best. Trust me someone who loves to spen her money on quality products.</li>
            <li> Crumbles too easily. I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I have ordered this shea butter 3 times and I am in love!! My skin loves the shea!!  I whipped it with essential oils, their cocoa butter, aloe and it is all good!!! I made gifts for friends and they love too!</li>
            <li> great guys, nice recipes very helpful</li>
            <li> Very happy with this raw shea butter, it&#x27;s organic and just what I needed!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shea butter. I whip it with coconut oil and it is great in my natural hair. This is the only thing that I find that makes my naturally kinky curly hair soft. I have tried MANY products and this works the best. I must make sure I never run out of this shea butter. For my natural sisters &amp; brothers who are having a hard time finding a product to soften their hair, this is definitely a must have staple.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own whipped shea butter, quick and easy and this package&lt;br /&gt;makes many small batches.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for unrefined shea butter and need some guidance using it, I recommend this seller and this product. I had a several questions and the seller emailed back quickly each time. Even when I wrote her back (3-4 times I think), she answered quickly. My questions had to do with the purity of the product and she shared the official paperwork from Africa so I felt assured. The product arrived a little melted but that is okay; it was San Antonio in the summer. I will melt it again (not in the microwave, as the seller advised) -- and pour it into little glass jars anyway. I plan to stow it everywhere - my purse, drawers all over the house, and in my travel bag. The butter itself feels so silky-creamy and it looks beautiful. My skin feels great, and some dry areas are healing quickly after consistent use. I&#x27;ve thrown away all my expensive serums and used this butter on my face almost exclusively. It&#x27;s oily of course but I just use it at home, and then when I&#x27;m ready to go out, I wash it off, use a tiny bit of organic lotion under my makeup, and I can see how this shea butter has helped repair some damage. My lips, which are constantly begging for moisture, have never been happier than when I apply this shea butter night and day. It feels good to know I&#x27;m using one of God&#x27;s pure creations, raw, unrefined, and non-toxic. A true gift from Africa. I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for making lotion bars and lip balms! Melts very well.</li>
            <li> Used this to make whipped body butter. Love it!</li>
            <li> I made my own body butter and I really love the feel of the Shea butter it melts nice and has a real nice creamy feel on my skin.  It moisterizes better than any store bought stuff I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I need to use more essential oil next time I make my body butter because it does have an off putting smell to it which I don&#x27;t think there is anything you can do about.  It&#x27;s the natural smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as an ingredient in homemade lip balm; it met all my expectations and although it will be some time before I need more I will use this source again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it to make my own &amp;#34;belly butter&amp;#34; for my pregnant belly. Works great on the heels of my feet and dry skin in general.</li>
            <li> Perfect timing! I really like the packaging, esp. since I may not get a chance soon to make my whipped shea butter recipe. Can&#x27;t wait to try it - just looking, smelling, and feeling it makes it seem promising!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> Great product. First time I am doing body lotion and came out perfect.</li>
            <li> Need to purchase more. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product may be slightly more than others but you are getting a quality product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations. I understand that this natural product will have slightly different characteristics in different batches. Some of the reviews and comments do mention variations in color and I bought it knowing that I will not have the exact same experience as other people had. However, despite all the positive comments posted here, I have to say that I will not buy this again. The texture was extremely grainy, color was more on the light brown and the smell was overpowering, to the point that the trial formulas I did for soaps and lotions could not eliminate the bad smell and the grainy feeling made it nearly impossible to scoop it out. Not easy butter style as I was expecting. I probably used 2 ounces of it in the trials, but will not be using it anymore in production formulas.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all good reviews. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I use it on my face and body. My skin is softer than when i use orher expensive lotions. I would suggest this to everyone.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter came packaged very neatly and was the perfect addition to my homemade body lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Very fine, so easy to rub on once it&#x27;s small amounts at a time. Much better than the processed store brands. Got it on time,  and transferred to empty lotion container.</li>
            <li> Great product. I still have outbreaks on my face (a form of psoriasis), but they no longer burn like before. They are also less severe.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It blended well with my essential oils. I will always buy from here.</li>
            <li> Dionysia&#x27;s daughter-&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes A LONG way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> So after some research on Shea Butter, the white Shea is true Shea. The yellow is actually from a completely different tree, but it&#x27;s still good stuff. This is 100% true raw Shea. It comes in the bag shown, and is the brick of Shea wrapped in plastic as shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a moisturizer when my skin is particularly needy. To use it, I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly. I put it on my body at night and let my skin soak it up, otherwise I&#x27;m feel a little greasy during the day. In the morning I rub it under my eyes only, this helps to keep the delicate area moist &#x3D; less likely to add more wrinkles and make-up adheres better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those looking for a good quality Shea, or for those who need a deep moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t done this, but I know some people use it on their hair as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Awesome to use as a cosmetic purpose!  Love it to do my own diaper cream, body cream and sunscreen</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own sunscreen and lotions. It moisturise my skin and does not feel greasy! Loving it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. So smooth and creamy. So many uses. I have ordered other Shea butter on Amazon but it wasn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I love using this product after showering. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth without being oily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I used it to make face cream with my Young Living essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter, Argan oil, Mel-A (tea tree oil), lavender, frankincense and purification.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavenly and my face feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have great customer service. The recipe book that comes with it is super helpful, and the owner emailed me to answer questions immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. I use it for my hair and skin! This is my 5th pack. Bought some for my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> just started using this product but I like so far.</li>
            <li> Used as part of my homemade body butter. Melted nicely, whipped beautifully, incorporated easily with the other oils in my recipe.&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter has a very smooth texture, but I found it to be a bit crumblier than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used. Came very nicely packaged, and upon opening it was clear that this was a high quality product.  I found it to be very moisturizing on skin and lips.  Mild nutty scent, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey for what you get- I mean, I didn&#x27;t think that this was so different from other brands that it was worth paying twice as much for.&lt;br /&gt;Minus an additional star because both the batch of body butter and the batch of lip balm I made with this brand became grainy after being stored for a week.  Everything was still entirely useable, the grains dissolve and absorb right in, but the texture wasn&#x27;t as divine.</li>
            <li> Great product. .. very easy to work with</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, and was exactly as advertised. My wife is very happy with the way it feels on her skin.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make a body butter with other ingredients. It is an awesome product, and my body butter came out beautifully. Everyone I gave it to LOVES it, and several people want me to make it for them to buy! I will definitely be buying more of this shea butter. Thank you for such a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea product to date. I wish they produced it in larger quantity. I will buy fo my smaller quantity needs.</li>
            <li> Comes sealed and fresh. Has worked great so far! Used it in a Beard Balm and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good quality product!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for making lotion!</li>
            <li> I liked this butter but I honestly can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than some of the less expensive brands. I use this to make a mix for my younger kids and it&#x27;s pretty good but again, I don&#x27;t see a difference between this and other brands of Shea butter on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product was same as description and came packaged very well.  I have used the shea butter to make a body butter.  It came out very well.&lt;br /&gt;Make my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product,  met my expectations. Includes a free download digital recipe book. Excellent product. My skin is glowing in health and happiness.</li>
            <li> A little rancid smelling but I learned shea butter is sopposed to have a slight odor that I am just not accustomed to. I made some amazing whipped body butter with this product. This is a must-have.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!!! Great product</li>
            <li> i love this shea butter it smells really nice i use it alone and sometimes with other organic oils but it really a good product i will buy again from this brand.</li>
            <li> I had never used shea butter before so was not sure what to expect.  But when I used it I found it easy to cut, melt and mix with other oils. I look forward to using it in other natural products. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was superb quality Shea butter. The delivery was prompt and packaging was awesome. I would buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Quality product. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Mixed it with coconut oil and avocado oil for use on my face. Added a few essential oils to it as well.  My skin looks and feels amazing and I have not had any breakouts. Been using it for three weeks.  I am now using it as my daily lotion for my body as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to begin making some of our personal care products at home. Since I have zero experience with Shea butter in raw form, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. However, it melted beautifully, there was no discernible odor, and feels SO GOO&lt;br /&gt;D on the skin! I will definitely purchase from this company for all my Shea butter needs! I also loved the included e-book with recipes and interesting facts about their products. 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter!  Just used it for soap making and put some on my arms- it felt so nice and smelt wonderful.  Thanks!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Shea butter. Perfect for making lotions and creams for my household. It&#x27;s packaged nicely, the weight is correct, and is good quality.</li>
            <li> Really excellent product. I use it to make homemade whipped body butter and this product is lovely.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I made lotion with it this past weekend and it turned out great!!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Ivory shea butter.  The first thing I noticed about it was the smell - it has a strong smell, almost like wet clay or plaster in an old house.  Although it melted down well, and made for a creamy whipped body butter, despite adding quite a lot of scented essential oil, it still has a very strong smell that I find unpleasant - instead of smelling like clay, it now smells like clay and lavender.  Perhaps the yellow shea butter is different, but I definitely would not purchase the ivory butter again, and I am now reluctant to buy raw shea butter over the internet at all - I want to be able to smell it before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Using it to make hair conditioner, face cream, and lipstick.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is of excellent quality! I made lotion with it and it</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I purchased this product, as I was planning on making a homemade hand cream for my loved ones for Christmas using all natural ingredients. Unfortunately, I was not able to achieve this due to the fact that the main ingredient for the hand cream (this shea butter) was such a disappointment. I must make note that I did definitely know what shea butter was supposed to smell like prior to me purchasing this product. Anyways, upon opening the package, the shea butter smelled extremely RANCID. I tried melting it, and applying A LOT of essential oils and carrier oils to mask the strong rancid smell, but nope, nothing worked. I ended up throwing the remainder of Better Shea Butter&#x27;s shea butter away. Huge waste of my money.... :(</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter, doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like others I&#x27;ve used have. Nice, smooth, and moisturizing. Love the ivory color for my products.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter.  It is soft and silky, perfect for my Essential Oils.  This is the only Shea Butter I have ever ordered so I am not sure if they all come this way, but I have a problem with the packaging.  I am having a hard time getting all of it out of the plastic wrapping that it is in.  Other then that I love this product.  It melts down perfectly and whips up soft and silky.  I have made many body butters from it already and it&#x27;s just perfect, so perfect that I want every drop of it!!</li>
            <li> I liked the Shea butter very much, I used it to make lip balm.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in combination with cocoa butter and coconut oils to create homemade body lotions/butters.  The product arrived soft and was easy to use; it melted well; it combined well with other ingredients and was especially nice to use when whipped.  I like having a re-seal-able bag that I can store it in.  My only complaint (very minor) - I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of Shea.  I did not add essential oils to the products I created, but will consider doing so next time around to mask the Shea smell.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I&#x27;m using it in home made lotions. Just perfect. Well packaged.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It shipped quickly.  Was well packaged.  No problems at all.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I made lip balm with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just like all other shea butters that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Shea Butter. My skin has never had it so good!  Packaging was great too! Thanks for the free recipe ebook!</li>
            <li> Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> I loved how this came packaged in a &amp;#34;zipper type&amp;#34; on both the outside and the inside package as well.  I cannot use it all at once and this makes it so nice.  I have not used it on my face yet but love the softness as I am working with it into my recipe.  So far very impressed.</li>
            <li> I use this as my moisturizer. Absolutely love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I used it for whipped body butter for a fundraiser and got rave reviews.  I liked it so much that I adjusted the recipe so it used twice the shea butter.  It also made a great base for salve.  It came fast.  I now use it in my massage practice.</li>
            <li> everything it claims to be and more; I will make my own body products from now on!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is absolutely amazing!  I bought this initially for some dry patches on my face, but with the cold weather...I decided to give&lt;br /&gt;it a try on my dry hand...and boy did it work. Nothing else that I have tried has worked as well.  I also was able to download the free book with lots of recipes.  Thank you so much for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve ordered this several times and it&#x27;s always of high quality.  It works well in my lotion bars and body creams.</li>
            <li> My hair hates Shea butter but I now mix this with my cocco body butter mixture because I don&#x27;t want to waste my money</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of Shea Butter, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  It makes a really nice cream, and the company is absolutely awesome.  I&#x27;ve never seen such great customer support and help.  They send recipe books and follow up by personal email to make sure you&#x27;re happy--who does that anymore???!!!  Great product and nice price.</li>
            <li> Love it... it is my face wash and lotion ( I even use it on my baby) Plus one order last a long time for me... stay in business ;-)</li>
            <li> looked and smelled great.  Used it for my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used Shea Butter before, and this was extremely fresh with a pleasant scent (Shea butter can get a rancid smell when it gets old, just like any other oil/fat).  Easy to use, and I quickly took some and mixed it with coconut oil, and a little olive oil to make my own body butter.  Worked out very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I look at over-the-counter creams and lotions, and always wonder why they have a long ingredient list with names I can&#x27;t pronounce, and chemicals i&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with.  Even the so-called &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; brands have a long list of unknown stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m much happier using something natural like this Shea Butter, or mixing it with a few other ingredients to create a wonderful &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just received this a few days ago.  I&#x27;ve not ordered this in the past but had to try it based on the amount of reviews with a high satisfaction rate.  I like the product, the quality seems very good.  I&#x27;ve whipped some up with a little coconut oil and Lavender to use on larger areas as my legs and arms get very dry.  Tried it as an intense facial night time moisturizer as I challenge my skin with Retinol and Vitamin C.  I think it will last a long time.  I keep it wrapped and in a plastic covered tub to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> You are a fast shipper and the butter is just what I want.  I will be compounding it with a number of essential oils.  Thank You.  Thank you also for your recipe book and your communications.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, I create my own skin balm and I have added this shea butter to the recipe.  It is a nice addition to the balm.</li>
            <li> Great quality! I use it to make my sunscreens as by itself as a moisturizer. It arrived quickly and they email you a link to a shea butter recipe book after arrival. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received it within 2 days, which was great. Haven&#x27;t used it for too long yet, but so far it works better than any cream, my skin is very dry and very sensitive which means I can&#x27;t use most of the products. I use it on my face only for now and it only takes a very small amount to cover the face. It is a lot of butter just for a personal use so I hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad before I can use it all.</li>
            <li> great product and great company. It came fast and I love that I could download a recipe book. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am using this to make body care products.  It appears to be very high quality. I have made body butter and lip balm.  It is working perfectly.  I would use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and as described.  Will be buying from this comapny again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shea butter to make homemade moisturizer, as in allergic/sensitive to everything. This was perfect. Quick arrival and the recipes that came along with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I rub a little between my hands and then put on my hair to smooth it down. This works better that any hair product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. You only need a little bit every time you use it and there is so much that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Received my Shea Butter early this week, in excellent condition.  I purchased it as I am trying to clear up my 13 year old daughters eczema- I refuse to use steroid based creams &amp; have used several different natural creams &amp; emollients, up to this point. I am using the Shea butter, raw, every night, &amp; so far her skin seems smoother &amp; less inflamed, I am hoping that with continued use, it will completely clear up. My e-book of recipes was available &amp; easy for me to download &amp; there appear to be some pretty useful &amp; natural recipes in there. Amazing product &amp; amazing service!!</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  Great product. Fast shipping. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter. not that I&#x27;ve grown up in Africa and actually know what shea butter should look like. I&#x27;ve tried some others and have reacted to them. I&#x27;ve even tried some refined and definitely could not tolerate the itchiness and burning sensation they had on my skin. And I&#x27;ve never reacted that way to any lotion...ever!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if pure shea butter actually does all it says it does. It does make my skin softer. I&#x27;ve made lotions and scrubs for my brother and mom. My mom had her masseuse use it on her and they both loved it. So it seems it&#x27;s great for massages. My brother lives in a very dry climate, aka the desert and has hard water and he says he doesn&#x27;t have to put lotion on after each time he washes his hands now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are even given an ebook that gives u some recipes for lotions, creams, etc. That was a great bonus even though u can Google all those things to find recipes. My only downfall with the product, hence 4 stars is that u can only buy it in 1lb blocks and I would like to buy in bulk, so I may continue to look elsewhere for a quality shea Butter in bulk. But if necessary I would buy this while I&#x27;m out hunting for a larger supply</li>
            <li> It smells really bad. I&#x27;m not sure what the recipe book is for? I thought it was going to be a lotion that was easy to apply but it looks and smells like a block of cheese lol I hope it works I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it yet and am not sure if I can get past the scent!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Quick delivery &amp; good follow up from Isabella at Better Shea Butter. The recipes all look worth a try, but for now I&#x27;m so enjoying the plain Shea butter that I&#x27;m a purist.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Great for lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Very good product that works very well as a skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Really nice shea butter.  It smells and works great, and I use it everyday.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shea butter. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Loved the downloaded e-book that was included with purchase.  Used it to make lotion and the recipe was spot on!  Shipped quickly; arrived as promised and product weighed as sold (16 oz).</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter to make my own Body Butter. I don&#x27;t like the additives that are in most of the manufactured Body Butters and was tired of paying for the expensive all organic brands.&lt;br /&gt;This Shea Butter was perfect. With the two other oils I used this whipped up into a smooth fluffy consistancy. I have very dry skin, but since I started using this my skin feels and looks healthier. You have to try this. I&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my skin and for my budget.</li>
            <li> L♡VE this shea butter, so smooth and rich!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> 10/10 would shea again</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it!! Use it on my 2yr. old grandbaby also. Love not using any chemicals or dyes.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter. Feels like waooo!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for selling it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter.  It works great for the lotions I made.  It is nice looking, has a great texture and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Great consistency excellent delivery</li>
            <li> Used this to make hand/body cream and it was perfect.  A slight odor, but not as bad as the previous brand I used.  A slight odor must be normal for Shea butter</li>
            <li> The best Shea Butter hands down.  Live this brand!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter.  I create my own creams, lotions, beauty and hair products for my&lt;br /&gt;shoppe,  and this product infuses well into my creations, lip balms and creams.  Shipped quickly,&lt;br /&gt;and is of a very good quality for those who like to make their own product, whether for yourself&lt;br /&gt;or for your clients.  You KNOW what is in there, as you CREATED it :)</li>
            <li> Customer service means a lot to me but when it&#x27;s coupled with a great product it&#x27;s win win.  I had recently given up trying to find Palmers Shae Butter and have been going back and forth trying to find something that will work on my very dry skin. So far with now much luck.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I couldn&#x27;t find Palmers anymore because it lead me to see what was available online and this is way better.  With most lotions my skin will be dry in an hour or two.  With body butters I will get a few more hours. So,  as a test I put this on before bed and by the next afternoon I was still moisturized. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and ordered two of these on my first order because of the reviews.  I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li> This was a great product, and with the recipe book you can make all kinds of good creams.  My wife is loving the way this makes her skin feel</li>
            <li> Made a few lotions with this shea butter for my daughter will eczema and they turned out great. I already notice the difference with my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; customer service. My dry skin feels much more moisturized. I&#x27;ll for sure buy again this product!</li>
            <li> Love it !!!!!! Great product . I used it to make a cream for my husband and he loved it. Great packaging plus it was delivered sooner than i expected the customer service was great as well I will be buying this product again very soon. Five Stars definitely.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!  I use it to make my own body butters mixing shea, coconut and essential oils.  Friends are begging me to make batches for them!  The shea butter is so emollient and absorbs well.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of your skin so it&#x27;s not oily for long periods of time</li>
            <li> Love it  Love it  Will be ordering more in the future. Easy to work with!</li>
            <li> We use this raw shea butter as lotion for ourselves &amp; our toddler. It smells lovely &amp; leaves our skin soft &amp; moisturized! It comes in a big block, so I cut off chunks and store it in glass.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is soft and easy to break apart. I use it for hair and body products...mainly to do my twist-outs on my natural hair. I don&#x27;t mix it with anything for my hair and it keeps it moisturized for days. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am already seeing a big difference in my dry cracked heels after using the shea butter for just a few days.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes for skin care.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I make skincare/make-up products for myself, family and to sell, and this is high quality shea butter. I get my cocoa butter and zinc oxide from this company as well. Great products!</li>
            <li> I bought this for body butters and lotion bars.  The smell is mild and it&#x27;s easy to break apart for measuring.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am still trying some of the recipes from the free ebook, but I love how soft my skin is! Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter!  It has surpassed my expectations in helping with my son&#x27;s eczema. Will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and quality. I made a homemade whipped shea butter cream with this and rosehip oil. I feel this is a brand I can trust. It&#x27;s super soft and moisturizing. A little goes a loooooooong way.</li>
            <li> I am using this in my homemade body butters and am loving it!  My skin feels awesome and the Shea butter is so smooth!  I love it?</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter. I&#x27;ve used it to make an eczema creme or I use it on it owns. My husband and daughter like it too!</li>
            <li> I just started to use this a couple of weeks ago.  The seller has been very helpful regarding questions I have had about this shea butter.  It is moisturizing, but a little goes a long way and can leave my face feeling a bit greasy.  I am acne prone, and I haven&#x27;t really had any issues with that thankfully.  I have not noticed any miracles yet, but I am hopeful it will help with wrinkles and brown spots.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell one bit, and I don&#x27;t really understand why some people find it unpleasant to the point they can&#x27;t use it.  I use it alone, but I may try it out with rose hip oil.  It is a little hard, but I take a little and press it into my palm to melt it a bit before applying.  It did soften my heels nicely which can get very calloused.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in a salve I made.</li>
            <li> Great price, great Shea butter. Shipped as soon as I ordered. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Was everything I expected. Will order from here again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Absolutely IN LOVE with this!! I&#x27;ve struggled for so many years with sensitivity to commercial soaps and lotions that I decided to try my hand at making my own. As soon as I opened the package, I was sold. Buttery smooth, easily mixes with other ingredients, and a light scent. I can&#x27;t wait to use up my lotion and deodorant I made just so I can work with it again! I can easily get at least ten more body butters and deodorant sticks out of this, if not more. Fantastic price for the amount received!</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! The butter was nice and pliable and the packaging was done very well. This is my first time buying shea butter in bulk &amp; I would definately purchase this product again. The smell is distinct, but not overwhelming. I made six 8oz. containers of whipped butter (with coconut oil) for gifts and they turned out amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product numerous times now and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Rub briskly between hands to melt, then smooth over body, off to bed, and wake up with baby soft skin!  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to moisturize their skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my soap making</li>
            <li> Give me the recipe book then I&#x27;ll make it 5 star.</li>
            <li> This is a very authentic unrefined shea butter of excellent quality. I made a nice whipped shea butter with it and use everyday on my hair, skin, and even as a diaper cream butter for my daughter. It conditioned my hair and is keeping my still expanding pregnant belly nice and smooth with no stretch marks! Love this shea butter.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality.. Packaging is great.. Great product</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> great product! so smooth and easy to work with! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used it to make homemade sunscreen, and it worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Used Shea Butter to make a whipped body butter and it turned out to be a very good body butter that absorbs easily and feel very good on the skin.  Would purchase this shea butter again.</li>
            <li> It has a very unique scent that I am getting used to. Just knowing that I am doing something good for my body makes it all worth while!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, good quality and also included a link to a shea butter recipes ebook. Will purchase again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> We love this Shea Butter!  The packaging is great because you don&#x27;t have plastic container left over. The shea was so fresh and was perfect in our body cream and face lotions. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m love it very good for my face and body I did very good decision to buy it and try it</li>
            <li> Love it..  Use it all the time.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Love it! Delivery was quick. Product description is spot on. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for lotions</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I combine this with almond oil and essential oils to make an awesome body butter. I am going to make lip balm next!</li>
            <li> With a variety of uses where can you go wrong. I haven&#x27;t used a lot of this one since I haven&#x27;t finished the current one I am using. But I love mostly all Raw Shea Butter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I purchased some Shea Butter off Amazon a while and it was more clay than butter.  Tried this Unrefined Organic Shea Butter, and I know try to steal it from my girlfriend. Its amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have used this in many of my lotions and moisturizers and have had wonderful results. Poduct, packaging and delivery, all are very good. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Very stinky. Doesn&#x27;t seem as high of a quality as i was expecting for paying as much as i did.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I bought this items as one of the ingredients for homemade lotion and it worked great! It added the perfect creamy texture to the lotion. I can tell my skin loves it! Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful product. I am very pleased and will certainly be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> great smell, package well. Go smooth on my skin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Great customer service!</li>
            <li> This shea butter arrived quickly and is a large quantity. It is useful everyday to soothe dry skin and excema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea Before, usually from the sweet street vendors in New York City.  I love those guys, but I have to say this product rivals it.  The texture quickly turns from putty to butter.  This is more of a winter seal-in skin moisturizer for me, but I know people who use it all year.  For sure you will not be disappointed.  This is a solid, simple, real and untainted product from as far as I can see.  Makes a great gift for individuals with skin allergies, sensitivities and fashionistas who like raw product!</li>
            <li> Other than the shipping not as promised (Prime) product was good.</li>
            <li> My Shea Butter came in time.  I purchased it to make a face lotion.  I love it.  It is a wonderful consistency that is easy to work with and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Can&#x27;t wait to make more lotions with this!</li>
            <li> This is awesome Organic Shea Butter! I am very pleased with my purchase &amp; will definitely come back when this very generous block of shea is gone!</li>
            <li> I am using Shea Butter for dermatitis The package arrived on time, and it is a good quality Shea Butter, even though I am not an expert, this shea Butter seems fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell rancid at all, the color is as been described to me, I&#x27;ll keep you posted about the progress of this treatment.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a body butter for my hyper sensitive (itchy) skin.  It has been fabulous!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using Shea butter for at least 10 years now. I use to get my Shea butter from local vendors in NYC and was unaware of the grade A system when looking at the quality of Shea butter. At times the Shea butter I got would have a sour smell. When I went back to the vendor to ask the reason, they would tell me it depends on where in Africa they got their Shea butter from. I was not satisfied with that response so I started doing my research and realized that was far from the truth. This is how I stumbled on Better Shea Butter. I am truly impressed with the Shea And Cocoa butter quality. I use it on my self as well as my toddler. Certainly the best I have come across and will be purchasing more before I run out!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged nicely. I am a massage therapist looking to experiment with my own formula of massage creme. The quality seems great from what I have read. I love the ebook that comes with it as well.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Felt wonderful, blended easily. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has a really smooth texture and it melts easily in my hands.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Makes a very good intense moisture for rough dry skin. So many recipes to choose from to make the best moisturizer for tour personal needs.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Shea Butter purchase.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible. Super excited to get a &#x27;new&#x27;  butter, but when put on toast it was just the worse.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to the wife who made it into some kind of  lotion, which also tasted terrible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t downloaded the e-book yet, but I have used this a few times and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it. Since I haven&#x27;t worked with this before I have nothing to compare it to, but I will say that since using it in a lotion recipe mmy skin is looking a lot better - even the boyfriend noticed.</li>
            <li> Great product. We used it in lotions and Chapstick. Works great. It does have a stronger smell, normal for Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Great product, used it to make my own body lotion. Luxurious, moisturizing, and pure heaven!</li>
            <li> excellent massage cream, I like that it only has one ingredient</li>
            <li> ooooooooooh my god&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have never felt my skin so soft and healthy like i do now, it is a miracle, i tried other brands before but i didn&#x27;t see or feel the same results that am&lt;br /&gt;seeing now, this shea butter is a miracle, it is the solution for all of your skin problems, just in two days ( i swear only two days) i noticed a huuuuuuuge different , i mixed it with cocoa butter and almond oil, after every bath i put it all over my body and wear a towel for 20 mins, also i like to put Henna on my hair every week, i added 1 table spoon to my henna bowel and cook it for 2 to 5 mins, my hair became sooooooo shiny and healthy and soooooooooft, guys buy it you wont regret</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  really great product.</li>
            <li> one of the best products i have ever purchased, I have spent many months in Africa so I know what this is and it&#x27;s amazing benefits .</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is great. Love the recipe book!</li>
            <li> I used this Shea Butter as one of the ingredients to make lip balm - it was a beautiful consistency and blended well.  I like this product so much I am researching other homemade skin products to make with it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!! Super emollient and soft. It feels so good on my skin!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer service. Lots of recipes in the free e-book as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!  I wish I would have been told about it years ago.  I just use this &#x27;straight&#x27; and put it on my skin.  It quickly absorbs and leaves it so soft; my facial wrinkles are less noticeable, although I read somewhere that it can 46 weeks to see permanent wrinkle removal.  I am currently applying it to my daughter&#x27;s stubborn dry skin patch; it has considerably helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I&#x27;m  starting to see the results. I recommend it for everyone...</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and it is 100% authnetic. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> This is really nice Shea butter. Most likely since it is raw &amp; organic, it is a tad grainy, and it has a fairly strong scent, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I make lotion using essential oils, coconut oil, and Shea butter &amp; it makes my skin very soft. Good deal for what you get!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Shea butter. Such a great company. I love the free e-book that comes with purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent! It&#x27;s been great thus far for our family skin.</li>
            <li> Love it !!! I will buy again and it ships really fast!!!</li>
            <li> I am new at using shea butter and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It is wonderfully soft and easy to use. I have made lip balm twice and will be on to more recipes soon. Thank you! This Shea butter is really so nice, I have just bought it for the second time. The recipes are a great bonus, I have used several of them.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x60;s natural and smells nice. Purchased it for my dry face skin and hope to see improvements very soon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have purchased shea butter in the past.  There was a smoky smell that did not go away for a long time.  The butter seemed to have nut bark residue,  the appearance a dirty looking ivory.  The butter would be in a lumpy shape that wasn&#x27;t esthetically pleasing and crudely wrapped in plastic wrap.  This bar arrived packaged nicely in a brown craft bag and sealed professionally. The shea butter is a clean ivory with no residue.  It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was in an actual large bullion cube shape.  It made it a joy to open this butter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product... the recipe book was amazing. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I am a truck driver, and driving on the road for hours, my left arm and hand gets darker than my right arm and hand. After using this cocoa butter for a week, My hand and arm started to come back to its original tone! I also noticed that the skin on my hands looks noticeably healthy. I&#x27;ve never noticed that ever before.  It is also good for feet.  I injured one of my feet from jumping off the back of the trailer of the truck wearing sandals.  I had slight internal bleeding on the soul of my foot that traveled up to my toes and caused a couple of my toenails to darken and they have been dark for about six or seven months. This might sound like an infomercial but in that little as a week of rubbing my feet with this cocoa butter my toes started to clear up in my feet look so much healthier and I am dead serious I will get more I hope they don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best organic shea butter ever to grace this planet. I have ordered this product a few times already and when I was unsatisfied with one of the orders, I simply went to their website and asked for a replacement and they sent it for free without the hassle of sending the item back. Not only is the Shea Butter amazing quality but the customer service is just as good! Shea Butter is made in Africa and every batch is a little different in color and or consistency. The process of making it is naturally unpredictable and sometimes you will get a batch not as good as the other but you can always return it hassle-free with no shipping fee if you email them and give your order number from Amazon. You can also alternatively order from their website and buy the shea butter in bulk too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my whipped lotion recipe.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter worked well in lotion and lip balm recipes. Fast shipping and will definitely order again when I need more</li>
            <li> I made a face cream right away. Turned out so smooth and creamy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice now, and I have been delighted each time. The product is fresh-smelling and works wonderfully in the lotions and body butters I have made. I definitely plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than I even expected! It is rich and creamy and goes  a looooong way. I highly recommend it to any one looking for high quality raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great Packaging! Great use for whipped Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Great product. Loved using it for my body butter.</li>
            <li> awesome product very very buttery and great for dry skin</li>
            <li> Gf is black and uses this with organic sandalwood oil and a few other things to make a hair cream for her 4c hair.  Makes it nice and smooth and silky.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Super supple and easy to work with...does have a weird, smoky/musty smell that&#x27;s hard to cover up even with high quality essential oils, though.</li>
            <li> I used this in a couple of different whipped body butter recipes and was very pleased with the results. I would recommend this product and I plan to use it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Seriously, this is what you want!</li>
            <li> High quality product. Just used some to make a soft deodorant for jars. I&#x27;ve yet to try it, but it looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these, one for myself and one to use for gifts for my family. Strangely, one package was amazingly smooth and the other was a tiny bit gritty. Maybe it was left in the sun in shipping? Anyway, it whipped up beautifully and was very easy to use. Smells great and everyone was thrilled with their gifts.</li>
            <li> I have always heard of shea butter, but I never used it. I&#x27;m not big on putting stuff on my skin. I don&#x27;t use lotions or creams of any kind. Being that this shea butter is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have anything else in it, I decided to try it. I&#x27;m a big fan of chemical free. So, I used this stuff fairly quickly after getting it and I can say that it has definitely made some difference. I have used it a few times this week. I have always had rough patches on my hands due to the work that I do and this has made them noticeably less. I have high hopes that it will make it go away altogether! :)</li>
            <li> Love this. Really LOVE it. It is my new go to when m wholesaler is out. Melts on contact and mixes like a dream.</li>
            <li> Works to clear up my dry skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Unlike most people, I don&#x27;t like the scent of coco butter. The shea butter is a wonderful alternative. A very light natural scent that can easily compliment essential oils. I made some lotion bars with the shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, lavender and bergamot. They are heavenly. The quality is amazing. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought raw Shea butter but this product is very moisturizing and I&#x27;m enjoying using it to make lotions.</li>
            <li> This is my first shea butter purchase.  I used it to make an eczema skin cream for my son.  It coats beautifully and smells great with my eo&#x27;s.  I would definitely recommend to others.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and I must say I really like it! It&#x27;s a bit messy but manageable. I&#x27;ve used it mixed with extra virgin coconut oil and olive oil to make a nice whipped skin butter and I love the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li> This has been the ONLY product used for my skin that&#x27;s prevented my eczema from rearing its ugly head...</li>
            <li> I have tried other shea butters on amazon, but this one is smooth and melts into a non-gritty smooth oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shea butter for about 3 months now. I blended it with coconut oil and made some amazing body lotion. It lasts a long time and made my skin smooth and moisturized during the dry winter months. This is raw or unrefined shea butter which is better to make homemade body butter. It is very easily absorbed in the skin. It blends really well after it&#x27;s softened in a hot water bath. The possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> Great product. Best quality</li>
            <li> This stuff is like not from planet earth</li>
            <li> Very smooth and creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;Great quality As Usual</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great price for a great product. I use it in homemade chapsticks, lotions and sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> Love the Shea butter-use it on my hair and all my skin to moisturize and help with my eczema/psoriasis. Love the purity of the product and the way that my skin drinks it in. Seller is very attentive. I heat it up to make an oil to make putting it on go a bit faster than just creaming it on like a butter. Just 90 seconds in the microwave depending on how much you are using-I am using a lot each time since I cover my whole body in it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product. It had great color and is very soft &amp; crumbled. Comparable to brown sugar consistency, only not granulated. I used a plastic spoon to remove small quantities of it, and I also put a measuring cup into the bag to pack it in. So it&#x27;s extremely easy to work with, and melted very quickly too. It came to me double bagged, the butter is in a zip lock bag inside of a sealed bag that is pictured. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on my skin and hair</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the free book of recipes that came with it</li>
            <li> Super soft! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter. I found a small hole at the bottom. Other than that it&#x27;s a great shea butter. I made my own lotion with it. It really moisturize my skin and makes my skin feels so soft like really soft and smooth. It stays on and moisturize my skin all day. ^^</li>
            <li> I did receive  the Shea butter. I love the smell of it. My first batch of body lotion came out great!! It was so easy to work with. I received  my cocoa butter yesterday, can&#x27;t wait to combine the two.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my homemade body butter. Can&#x27;t wait to try it in other recipes.</li>
            <li> Was just as advertised. This product is great - smell, texture, color, value, feeling on my skin. I&#x27;m using it daily and can feel my skin is smoother, healthier, more supple. Before, it was dry, regardless of the season. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is exactly what I expected.  Easy to use, softens my face, and temporary relieves my back pain.  There are 4 of us completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time and with a fun recipe book included!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shea butter!! My skin feels so good and is glowing. Fast delivery , great product, and the people behind the product are so nice. I love getting the recipes as well!  I will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> My first time buying Shea Butter.  I love it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a heartbeat with my Amazon Prime membership. I bought it in order to make my own body butter, foot cream, and hand cream with it (all-natural, and without alcohol, which ironically, has a drying effect, though you will likely find it in many of your moisturizers!) Check the ingredient list on your moisturizers and you may be in for a surprise! Also look for some unpronounceable names of things you probably don&#x27;t want in there! Anyway, even though this shea butter is formed in a hard block, it is easy to cut with a butter knife, with no mess, so since my other ingredients still haven&#x27;t arrived, I have been shaving off bits of the butter in its raw state and rubbing them into my skin as is. It takes a while for the shea butter to melt into my skin, but the results are divine! My skin has never felt so luscious or moisturized. After 6 hours, the butter was still on my skin, as if I had just applied it! They also included a card with a website for customers to sign-up to receive a free book of shea butter DIY recipes, and sent me an email, offering the same. I think this company is fabulous; I&#x27;m truly impressed and will be buying from them exclusively in the future. They are definitely concerned with their customers&#x27; satisfaction, and I am SATISFIED! Can&#x27;t wait to make my body butter, etc.!</li>
            <li> Melted nice and made a great body butter</li>
            <li> The shea butter was very good.  We used it to make a homemade body butter.  It turned out light and smelled great.  Will use this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product.  I have started making my own lotion to deal with extremely dry skin on my shins and ankles, and this shea butter is awesome. I use it on my entire body, and it leaves me silky smooth.  Already the dryness on my legs is a thing of the past, but I will continue to use it.  So happy to find an alternative to the products on the store shelves with ingredients that I cannot pronounce.  The brick of shea butter came with a reference to a website where recipes are offered.  I am grateful for those.  I will continue to purchase this product.  It has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> So - it totally smells like bacon. And not in a way that you are like &amp;#34;Mmmmmm, bacon&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s like bacon gone wrong. My hands get very dry, especially during the winter. I thought this might help. It&#x27;s a little difficult to handle, because it&#x27;s just a big block in a plastic bag. I take out a little bit in clumps and then warm it up between my hands. Sometimes some of the clumps fall on the floor and it&#x27;s annoying. But I don&#x27;t really use it, especially if I&#x27;m going out (when I need it most). Anyone who has been around me has asked, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34; Booooooooo.</li>
            <li> Just used it today to make deodorant. :)</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and at a fair price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my Shea butter! The scent is delicious and the texture is wonderful. My skin is so soft after a few uses. Both of my children have have rough hands from the cold winter we have experienced and nothing worked to soften them... Until I bought this Shea butter! Their hands are softer than soft. And I love that the product is raw and unrefined. I can&#x27;t wait to use the recipe book! The seller is very helpful and reputable. I especially loved the addition of the recipe ebook.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I was born in Ghana and my mom would use this for many things. This is authentic as it gets. Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smelll</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Lovely Shea butter that I look forward to using in my moisturizer recipes!!</li>
            <li> Best Unrefined Shea Butter out there!  Love the consistency!  Also - FedEx claims they delivered and did not.  I contacted Amazon and I had my products the next day!</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair ends mixed with coconut oil.  I also use it on my hands, and it&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried during the dry winter months.  The smell leaves a lot to be desired, but it works better than anything else, so I use it anyway.  Mixed with coconut and some essential oils, it&#x27;s not offensive smelling.</li>
            <li> Awesome Shea Butter. I have used it twice once for some eye cream and then lotion.  The only thing I can say or recommend is not using it in the morning on your face, it does leave a greasy feel.  It may be my recipe that is the problem and haven&#x27;t tried a new one yet.  Lotion is great and don&#x27;t have that problem. Great feel and super easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t have a double broiler, so I used a pot and then a glass Pyrex round bowl that would fit on top of the pot nicely. Fill the pot with water a 1/4 of the way up, you don&#x27;t want the bowl to touch the water.  Stick the amount you need to melt in the glass bowl and set on top till it melts.  After that take off and let cool on a hot pad, follow your recipe directions to water ever you are doing to know how far to let cool.  The eye cream and lotion I made came out like whipped butter.  Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;They even have some nice recipes on line for you to try that are free.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to make moisturizing lotion and use to condition my curly dry hair. the product arrived promptly, in excellent shape and melted smoothly when rubbed on skin. It is oily but quickly is absorbed in skin. If  you do not like the smell of organic shea butter, this can easily be resolved by combining it with Cocoa butter and almond oil. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying Shea Butter.  It feels great on my skin but it smells horrible.  My skin is happy but my nose is not :).  I&#x27;ll try adding essential oils to mask the smell of it.  If it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m still going to use it because it works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my first batch of body butter with this and love it!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for :-) I am already a repeat customer</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product and lightning fast service.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The smell is very raw.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! I have been doing very extensive research on Shea butter and there are so many imposters out there! It makes me so happy to have found an authentic product from an honest company!! I suffer from moderate psoriasis and have found that this Shea butter keeps my skin so soft and helps tremendously with the itching and inflammation!! I have found my Shea butter source for life!</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter in homemade lip balm and it turned out phenomenal! The packaging was great and the butter was clean and smooth. It has a great natural scent but mixes well with any essential oil. So looking forward to using this in my homemade lotions and deodorants!</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied with the Shea that I order from Better Shea Butter. It&#x27;s was a nice surprise to get the ebook with different Shea butter recipes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product from the seller.  It was well packed and easy to open.  It is a hard block but creamy when softened.  I make my own creams and other things with it.  I wanted to give some time using it and compare it others. I would buy this over some of those expensive butters found at retailers.  I believe this to be a good quality product and would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this product but I have to say this is the best of many shea butters I&#x27;ve tried. It melts and applies really nice. One daughter liked it so much I bought a second order to give her. (so mine wouldn&#x27;t disappear to her house) My testing of other shea butters, even those carried by my local upscale market, ended up that none were nearly as smooth and absorbable. I had some glass cosmetic jars on hand for storage. It wouldn&#x27;t be this good a deal if it came in a container rather than plastic wrap. I don&#x27;t have any issues repackaging mine. This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is awesome!  It has a light nutty scent and the color is a light green, very, very light.  This block I am reviewing is a replacement block, directly from the Shea Butter Lady. The 1st order wasn&#x27;t good.  It had a creamy ivory color but had a terrible smell.  I contacted the company directly because I wanted to see if they would stand behind their product.  My email and a resolution was answered the same day, in fact the mailed me a replacement the same day.  I chose this company because of the high reviews and even though the 1 order wasn&#x27;t great, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from this company again. I plan on making my own health and beauty items and it was important to me to have a high quality product from a high quality supplier. Thanks Isabella,  I love my shea butter! UPDATE: 4/3/2015 I have made my own health and beauty products with this shea butter.  I just received another order from this company and it is absolutely a must in diy beauty products!  I have friends and family with eczema and dry skin issues and this shea butter is so nourishing to their needs.  My products turned out fabulous!  I made lip balms, shea sticks, whipped butters, ointment type lotion and lotion bars.  I have had nothing but high praise for the products and their nourishment and this shea butter is in every one of the products.  I would say if you are truly looking for a great product, that goes a long way, is cost efficient and you want awesome customer service, this is the product for you!  Isabella, owner of Better Shea Butter, is awesome to work with, she is very customer orientated and stands behind her product!  I will only order my shea butter from this company, why mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this Shea butter! I make my own lotions with it :)</li>
            <li> This Shea butter makes your skin bronze, beautiful, and healthy. Quit buying those overpriced, watered-down lotions and buy this butter!</li>
            <li> It is the best for making body butter and has an amazing smell!</li>
            <li> Ordered Shea butter and I&#x27;m liking the re-sealable bag it came it. The product is as expected and works great in my homemade body butter plus it was delivered on time. I&#x27;ve even been contacted by the seller to ensure my satisfaction with their product. I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My second time ordering from this company and love the product. I use this Shea butter for my hair and skin. I make a whipped Shea butter cream that I use daily and noticed a stark difference in my skin. It was supple and got tons of compliments from friends. But then I ran out :-/. I thought I could get by just picking some Shea butter up of the shelves of stores and even bought some from street vendors (NYC) with lackluster results. I had to return to what worked the best.. Better Shea Butter, you&#x27;re clean, pure, and just what my hair and skin needs.. Thank you. I will definitely make you a staple.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried to make my own beauty products before and decided to use the shea butter to make body butter from a recipe I found on the internet.  The shea butter worked wonderfully!  And it was easier to make than I&#x27;d imagined.</li>
            <li> The best Shea Butter I have used. I give my wife half hour back massages every morning and this product keeps its consistancy  Other products seem to coagulate but this one does not.  The only drawback is that it will stain sheets.  I tried this brand based upon the number of positive reviews and a very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the money. Good value. Recipes are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get to me, but it looks, smells and feels authentic.</li>
            <li> Top quality Shea Butter delivered promptly will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I used it to make a natural deodorant which really works. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally! This is the best moisturizer for my skin. I have oily skin and it does not make it greasy, but supple! PLUS, my acne scars are FINALLY fading. Whew, amazing. Impressed. About 2 weeks in; I use it morning and night after my clarisonic and love how the shea butter smooths my face.</li>
            <li> Makes our skin feel great!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described...worked perfectly for my body lotion. The seller was very helpful/checked in to make sure I was happy with everything.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own natural hair concoctions. I&#x27;ve ordered from this company several times and have had no issues. It blends nicely with anything that I&#x27;ve mixed it with so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I appreciate that it comes with recipes to create your own skin care.</li>
            <li> I love it. Already used in several recipes. Good quality product. Arrived quickly. All good!</li>
            <li> Great quality, will purchase again in the future. Mixed perfectly in the mixer with my essential oils. Will use for more as time goes on. Nice that they include a free usage booklet download!</li>
            <li> Great product...very happy with how it melted down and mixed.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fantastic. I whipped up this one pound block with 8oz of virgin organic coconut oil and it made a beautiful cream that I use on my entire body, including my face. I will order again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love Better Shea Butter!  I recently ordered the Raw Shea Butter and made my first homemade lotion!  The shipping was quick and the ebook was a great tool to assist me in making the lotion.  My son suffers from eczema and I&#x27;m allergic to sulfate, so a homemade lotion was the only way to go.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read so much about essential oils and homemade body lotion and soaps that I was ready to make my own.  I made an eczema cream with shea butter,  jojoba oil, chamomile oil, tea tree oil and carrot oil.  It turned out great and I can&#x27;t wait to try another product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using raw shea butter. I was shocked and not happy with smell and color of my first order and so I called the owner of better shea butter. She responded back that same day and she was very kind. She sent me another order of shea butter and the color and smell was much better. If you have any questions about shea butter give her a call she is a good person to ask. I was able to speak with her and get everything sorted out. Can&#x27;t wait to start using my shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie</li>
            <li> Excellent shea butter! Indeed unrefined and RAW! This helps  makes the perfect body butter. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product.. My skin looks &amp; feels great. I will def keep buying it!!</li>
            <li> Raw Shea Butter - Good quality product!</li>
            <li> This product came fast and is of exceptional quality. I use this for many things. Face cream, baby bum cream, body butter, stretch marks, acne, exczema, minor scrapes, any type of rash or dry skin. The applications for its use are endless. I have tried other brands but this is by far my favorite company and I will always order from them!! You will be very satisfied. Has a wonderful earthy smell that&#x27;s not overpowering in anyway. Absorbs fairly quickly and leaves your skin feeling so buttery soft. You will notice a difference!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I like how much product it comes with. I notice this shea butter has a distinct scent, which isn&#x27;t bad and I&#x27;m sure is normal. I will most likely repurchase. I used it in a whipped body butter, worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it! And the recipe book you can download after purchase is awesome! Great surprise! Just made a batch of body butter this morning &amp; it&#x27;s the best recipe yet!! Highly recommend! So happy I found this company! Looking forward to trying their cocoa butter too!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Just didn&#x27;t lIke the  packaging.</li>
            <li> Perfect for DIY skin care.  I love this for my homemade potions for aging skin.  I like the purity of the product and that the company that produces this does so in small batches.  Support small businesses!</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I received my BSB 3/18/15 .Its exactly as it looks in the picture.  Its shaped like a brick. It comes in a zip loc and the BSB bag sealed. I cant wait to use it. Make sure you store it in a dry place. Or it will melt.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the downloadable booklet of recipes!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shea butter!  We used it for our body bars and just plain on my daughter&#x27;s dry skin. Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but I did my research before ordering and I&#x27;m very pleased with the recipes that I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;The company contacted me (not in an annoying way) to make sure that my customer experience was a good one. I didn&#x27;t have to make any returns or had any complains but judging by the way they reached out I felt like any issues would had been addressed.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made lip balm with it, turned out perfect! I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter from other companies and it was awful. This is soft and smells wonderfully earthy. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought my friend who had a double mastectomy an order of Better Shea Butter. I have been using this shea butter for my face, works great.  I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 26 years old, so my body went through menopause at a very early age.  I have been searching for a cream to moisturize my face and for the longest time did not have much luck.  This shea butter, Estee Lauder Advance Night Serum, and CUCUMBER infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE EYE BRIGHTENING Gel make a great combination for a facial regimen. I also made another order for my daughter who has eczema.  I did use some shea butter on my husband&#x27;s knuckles which is very close to psoriasis and his knuckles have improved so much. Thank you so much for producing this product, the quality is unbelievable and the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect having never used Shea Butter of any kind before.  It is creamy and goes on my skin with little residue. It was used along with other products to make DIY Deodorant.  I was very satisfied with this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is awesome. I used it on my body and hair. I really like and I gave some to my mother as well.</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand several times as well as other brands. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and ease of use.  Organic and unrefined are important aspects of this product to me. It melts smoothly and evenly in my sunscreen recipe.</li>
            <li> I was better than what i expected, AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used quite a bit of this already and I love it! Plan to buy more soon</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells great, good color too. Everyone in my office uses it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great smell. I would buy it again. I should have ordered more. I used it in my 1st ever batch of soap from scratch and my 1st ever boby butter. Both great</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. That being said though, the product is very nice and the shipping and packaging were great. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and will definitely be purchasing again. BTW I am using this for a deodorant recipe and so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  I guess she uses it as ointment or lotion or something.  I really don&#x27;t know.  The product also comes with an ebook that tells you what the various ways to use it which is cool.</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin never felt smoother. There are so many ways to use Shea butter, and this company gives you some great receipts. I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li> Good product. It should come in a plastic tub or other durable container. I had to transfer it into jars for storage.</li>
            <li> Love this product everything they said and more great product</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was pretty good, but then I tried shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs and it was much better.  The stuff from Mountain Rose Herbs smelled better and was more yellow and kind of gritty.  It has more of a lotion texture, whereas this stuff is in bar form.  The Better Shea Butter was whiteish gray colored and sticky.  I&#x27;ll be buying from Mountain Rose Herbs in the future.</li>
            <li> its a fabulous product...just what i needed for my DIY projects</li>
            <li> Made an essential oil lotion with it and love it. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.  It&#x27;s  off white color and the texture of playdough, made it very easy to work with and add other products.  My skin absorbs it nicely and not to greasy.  I have super dry skin and my skin feels baby soft.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Makes your hair soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I used this to make homemade whipped body butter for the first time. Not only does it smell delicious, but the shea butter itself was high quality. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Very good quality shea butter. Smells great and lends to excellent lotions and soaps. Seller provides excellent customer service. Will definitely purchase with them again.</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a very timely manner and feels wonderful. I was afraid it would melt in the southern heat, but it didn&#x27;t.  I will definitely recommend this product to others and look forward to using it to make some teacher gifts for the end of school! :-)  I hope they enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making lotion bars or for use on its own. Excellent price and quality!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought it and made a really amazing butter out of it. The product smells fine. I have no issue with the natural smell but mixed it with essential oils and coco oil and it came out incredible. i would buy it again and really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s really helping with the super dry conditions here in Texas. I&#x27;ve ordered some for my mother too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shea butter. The price is great!! I bought some at a craft fair last year for twice the price!The delivery was fast!! I ordered 2, one for me and one for my daughter who has a 5 month old. Shea butter has a natural insect repellent without the chemicals.Just a little goes a long way!!! I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great quality</li>
            <li> Nice natural scent and consistency.  Very similar to an all-natural raw shea butter I bought a few years ago at a home and garden show.  I bought this one to make sunscreen, lotion, and lip balm and will buy again from this seller when needed.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used. I put the contents of the bag in my kitchen aide mixer,  with a cap full of olive oil and 5 to 10 drops of lavender. Whip it for 5 mins and you have whipped body butter for months. I dry brush my body with a dry brush, soak in bubble bath and while still damp, put the cream on. I still have the same moisturized feeling,  the next day. I hate feeling greasy and this cream sinks in. Absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ... I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic inside of a brown paper zip lock bag to help keep fresh and dry. It has a nice smell and a great consistency,  and melts down beautifully. I used it to make some lotion and it worked great. The product also comes with an e-book with recipes for using shea butter. The seller has also been in contact with me about the product, and about whether or not the e-book downloaded properly, which I am not sure of because I lost the cute card the link came on. :-) However, if you are looking for some natural raw shea butter, try this product. It really is great.</li>
            <li> Fabulous share butter.  I use it for lotion bars , soap and face creams.  This stuff really delivers.  Plus it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> My skin loves it so much!! A++ product for DIY lip balms, lotions/ moisturizers etc. They have free eBook which is very informative with easy instructions. I highly recommend Shea butter from this company.</li>
            <li> I have never felt Shea butter so smooth and soft, I intend to use this product In my body and hair products.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective this will be, le you know later.  The seller was excellent, fulfilled all my expectations</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems, love the product!</li>
            <li> So far this has been a great service, I ordered this product and it was packed and shipped right away! I am getting ready to mix it up into whipped butter so I will update my review shortly. The product was packaged in plastic wrap so some of it stuck to the sides, butI was able to get it transferred into a container  so no obig deal there. I applied some on my skin as soon as I opened the package and upon first impression it smells good (not strong) and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful rich product of nature is it&#x27;s original form.  I am in love with the body butter that I made using it as well as many of my friends have asked for some so I will be purchasing more in the future.  Seller provided quick shipping and even more, a product they promised.  Thanks very much!!</li>
            <li> Love both the ivory and yellow Shea butters.  Very good quality and enjoyed using them for my homemade skin stuff.  :) :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Fresh, well-packaged and very easy to work with. It arrived promptly as well. I appreciate the packaging because I only use portions of it for the various recipes and by rewrapping it in the plastic, returning it to the sturdy bag it arrives in, and then storing it in a cool, dark place, it has stayed fresh since I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself aside, I contacted the seller because I wanted to receive the free recipe e-book. I received a response very promptly (which also included a video on how to prepare Whipped Shea Butter) and in the process began an email dialogue with her (Isabella) about various things. I asked her questions about recipes, products, and uses and she responded fully and quickly. She also welcomes input which, when I had something to offer, I shared with her. She was enthusiastically receptive to my ideas and it felt really good to know that I might be contributing to something that other people might appreciate or benefit from. She also welcomes feedback about the recipes. I have prepared some of them and, when I have a moment, I am going to send her my comments with the hopes that they might, once again, be helpful. The recipes are very easy to prepare. The ingredients are easy to obtain and easy to use.* I purchased most of my ingredients on Amazon because they are often less expensive than one might find in local stores (essential oils tend to run high and, through Amazon, I can still support small businesses even though they might not be local). All in all, this is a great product, the recipes are excellent (clean, simple and very nice to use once prepared), and the seller/contact person is friendly, informative and interactive. She will be selling other products soon and I highly recommend purchasing products from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A suggestion regarding beeswax: I purchased mine in brick form and though it smells wonderful and is a very good product, it was extremely hard and therefore difficult tocut and measure. While shopping, I noticed that some sellers offer it in bead or pellet form. Next time I need some, I am going to purchase it in that form as it will make handling and measuring much easier and much more accurate. Beeswax is also very messy and difficult to clean away once it cools/hardens. Just a suggestion to keep this in mind when using it.</li>
            <li> Both of my sons have eczema. I applied the butter as direction; It really helps. Their skin is not crack anymore. Thanks you.</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  Great product.  I used it to make whipped body butter and it turned out great. It also came with a free download with other recipes.</li>
            <li> Love it, excellent quality and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Shea butter twice, the first order was awesome, sadly I only purchased one. The color was a mild cream, smelled awesome and the texture was perfect. The second order was nothing like the first. The color is close to a light dirt, the smell has a smoky scent to it and the texture is rather soft.  Again, sadly, I purchased 2 and I&#x27;m not too thrilled about it. I make all natural body products, I can&#x27;t use this in a customers order. Maybe I received a bad batch, either way, it&#x27;s going to go unused and a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time to use this product and absolutely fell in love with it! I was amazed by how quickly it melts and it&#x27;s very easy to use. I gave myself time with the product so as to write an accurate review...it has been amazing for me and the entire family and we&#x27;re all getting positive remarks from friends! The product arrived on time and nicely packaged. Definitely going to order it again!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Will buy again. I use this as my daily moisturizer and after the first week of using it I noticed great changes it my skin. Love this product❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Lovely products. So smooth and pure. I&#x27;ve made several different things with this Shea butter and everyone raves about them!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter!!! I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they&#x27;ve all had a sand like texture (whether white or yellow) and they didn&#x27;t mix well with my essential oils.  This Shea butter has a fantastically smooth and creamy texture and is absolutely perfect for the face and body butters that I make.  I will definitely keep buying this</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!! Takes some getting use to but once you have had the product where you want, nothing but kudos.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was a great addition to my anti-aging essential oil moisturizer. I love that shea butter has a 0 on the comedogenic rating scale so it&#x27;s great for your skin and won&#x27;t clog pores. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This shea butter made a wonderful body butter! I whipped it with some solid coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and essential oils. The e-book is very easy to download and has some nice looking recipes, which is so helpful for a beginner. It does have a sort of rubbery/nutty smell which needs a strong fragrance or essential oil to cover it. I tried a lavender body butter at first, but the lavender was just overpowered by the shea. I had to add some stronger scents to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> First time ever purchasing shea butter, and I was so pleased!  I used it to make my own lotion because my son suffers from eczema.  Their recipe book was very helpful in knowing how to melt it down and how to mix it with other ingredients.  Thank you so much for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Customer service is excellent.  I am reflexologist who uses this product on a daily basis.  My clients love the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! I use it for making lotion for face and body.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and it was just as great as the first!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea butter to make lotion bars. It worked beautifully. My only complaint would be that it should come in a resealable container.</li>
            <li> This butter is the real deal.  It is smooth and great for making skin care products.  Smells wonderful and nutty.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin feel so hydrated. Even went back and ordered the cocoa butter so I can make a body smoothie!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get my package. It arrived on time and just as pictured. As soon as I am about to run out I will be ordering it again. Thanks again for a great product and service.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it for body butter and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with Better Shea Butter! The freshness is perfect, packaged so it&#x27;s easy to use, use a little or use the whole chunk for a large batch, the choice is yours. I used Better Shea Butter in a recipe for whipped shea butter for a scalp psoriasis condition and the size and quality worked like a charm. The recipe booklet was a nice bonus too! If you&#x27;re looking for a no nonsense unrefined organic version, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Shea butter. Service was extremely guick</li>
            <li> Will most certainly buy from this seller again! Excellent service and excellent product. And the free ebook is a nice bonus. It has some great shea butter recipes.</li>
            <li> good quality, nice raw color and smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Very smooth and creamy.  Melted quickly for use in body cream recipe.  Nice packaging too.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF; I&#x27;M GIVING AWAY ALL MY OTHER BEAUTY LOTIONS, CREAMS, ETC. GREAT FOR HANDS, FACE, BODY; I HAD A RASH OF SORTS ON MY FACE THAT THE BUTTER CLEARED UP IN 2-3 DAYS</li>
            <li> I love this SO MUCH!! Thank you for quick delivery and fantastic packaging!! Will def. order again!!</li>
            <li> Love, love love it! Feels magical on skin and a delicious smell!</li>
            <li> Great Shea Butter, quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i love it,  smooth and smelled wonderful ! I made lotion bars with it, it feels great !!</li>
            <li> This brand of shea butter is the smoothest without being to mushy or too thick like the other cheaper two brands I&#x27;ve bought from street vendors. One had the consistency of Barbasol shaving cream and didn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth and the other did a better job on my skin, but was like hard dried wax which made it difficult to dab on my skin withouy having to warm it up. Better shea butter brand is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic Shea Butter! I get excellent results each time. The recipes are five star also!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the product. Great job, A+.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> great feeling of smoothness</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier w this product! Delivered in a timely manner. Well packaged. I immediately used it that night to start our Homemade baby products. Thank you! Will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great product, first time homemade lotion and turns out perfect!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! It makes my wife&#x27;s skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was an excellent quality.  I look forward to making more purchases in the future!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I purchased this for making lotion and body butters and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong shea odor and it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE !! It&#x27;s so easy to work with. I made a body butter using this along with some oils.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I use it in my salves, body butters and soap.  Wonderful product to help heal dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it exclusively for my body care products and I also use their Cocoa Butter....can&#x27;t find any better anywhere as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  I use it for making my exema cream it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying shea butter from Better Shea Butter. I am very highly satisfied and will continue to buy my shea butter from them. It is high quality and smells great. The service from the company is great and well and they truly seem to care about the products that they sell. I use this to make lotion and it is easy to use and the packaging is simple.</li>
            <li> Great quality and texture. Just what we needed!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for my natural african american hair, i love it and will be coming back for more. It smells great and was nice and clean. I plan on using for my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it much, but l love the customer service and follow up emails. Once I explore more, I&#x27;m sure ill give 5 stars...</li>
            <li> I wanted to eat this when I got it - it smelled so delicious. I am making a whipped body cream with it and coconut oil, almond oil and an added essential oil of your choice. The price went down 2 days after I bought it - don&#x27;t get that?! Very well packaged and would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great quality product for a great price. Works wonderful in the making and use of my beauty products. Will buy again and again as needed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! We use it in lotions and by itself.</li>
            <li> So good. I use this on my natural hair and body. And it&#x27;s excellent. I melt the butter and pure extra virgin coconut oil, Jamaican castor oil, wheat germ oil, horsetail extract and extra virgin olive oil and mix together then put in fridge to return it to its solid form. It works wonders for my hair especially my ends and on my skin. Love this butter.</li>
            <li> excellent.  great for a simple lotion!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using straight Shea Butter and I am so glad I did. I have extremely acne prone skin, discoloration from a variety of things (including too frequent peel treatments), and now aging concerns.  I have been making changes from my chemical saturated skin care products to more natural skin care; once I read about the healing properties, vitamin A, and the fact that Shea Butter melts into the skin quickly (oils that sit on my skin tend to break me out) I just had to try it. I then researched the best and most natural Shea Butter to use and I decided to buy this product - I am so happy to say that I will absolutely be buying again. My skin is soft and silky; I have used it straight on my skin and also mixed it with Vitamin E, essential oils, vitamin C....there is just so much you can do with it and its really just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this she&#x27;s butter. Made body butter with it and the results were awesome. It&#x27;s smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li> So far so good just received my shea butter two weeks ago. I have been suffering from extremely dry and sensitive skin were I live the water is pretty  hard on my skin. Ive heard great things about shea butter for hair and especially skin. As far as this product excuse me this amazing creation I have enjoyed how my skin has felt , no more itching! Thank you for creating such an incredible cure for people who have not so great skin like me, I will continue to buy from here for years to come! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Superior quality.  Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I love this butter. I made a lotion with it and it is amazing. I already see a difference in my skin texture after only a week of use. I&#x27;m not really a fan of the scent, but I can live with it if it gives me these results. Good price, quick delivery. I will be buying more from this company.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the best! I just mixed mine with natural vitamin e to make a body butter and so far it has not caused any breakouts on my face and it soaks really good into my skin also</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> I come from a country where we produce shea butter even traditionally and we use it for many things. I must say, I was surprised by the quality of the shea here. It is excellent and the delivery was fast too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have found.  The other ones were grainy and this is buttery smooth!  Goes a long way and I use it for soft tissue work in my holistic physical therapy and bodywork practice...love it!</li>
            <li> Packaged very nicely.  It arrived on a day our temps were 100 and there was no leaking or mess.  Lovely product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the fast shipping! Great product - will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I used it to make lotion at home. I mixed it with almond oil, coconut oil, lavender and vitamin c serum. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Ok so I use Shea Butter to make my own lotions, lip balms, etc....I&#x27;ve used a few brands here and there and some are better and worse.  I was really pleased with this one.  seemed really fresh...already planning to buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Easy to work with. I use it to make lotion bars and it melts easily. Nice product. Would order again. On time delivery.</li>
            <li> This Shea is amazing! Love the texture, melts easily and blends well with other butters and/or oils. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing! Nice ivory color. Soft consistancy. Love how it&#x27;s packaged. Very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this supplier again. Please don&#x27;t be fooled by those buyers selling shea for dirt cheap. This shea butter is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on shea butter and the best kind to purchase when I started using it. I ultimately chose this shea butter and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it. I use it in making lotion bars and lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to post a review until I had used the entire pound. Well, it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;ve ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Now I need to find my favorite essential oil mix...didn&#x27;t realize how strong shea was on it&#x27;s own. Great product!</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own lotion and it worked great.  The lotion isn&#x27;t as smooth (feels like sand is in it) as the last time I made it but as soon as I put it on my skin it melted instantly so no worries!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter. It&#x27;s pure, soft and smooth. It is definitely of higher quality than other shea butters I have tried. Looking forward to trying some of the recipes seller provides you with.</li>
            <li> Melts like butter, and it was a great price! Especially for being unrefined and organic. It does smell a little weird but I think that&#x27;s just what shea butter naturally smells like. Definitely will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other. I was able to  make my shea hair product without incident. I also used it as a skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast, the ebook is very helpful and the product is A 1 !!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I have used it in numerous skincare recipes-baby lotions, diaper rash cream,etc- and it melts down very well. My favorite DIY to use it in is a peppermint lip balm similar to burts bees. My husband, who was previously addicted to burts bees, loves the homemade with this Shea butter. It is so nourishing that instead of using lip balm several times a day he now uses it once every few days. No more cracked dry lips for either of us. At this low price, I will continue to purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> So, aside from the great customer service (Isabella has been very responsive via email), I LOVE this Shea Butter. I melted it down with some coconut and vitamin E oil, and let it solidify and use it twice a day on my arms and legs. (I have terrible scars from a bad allergic reaction). I LOOOOVE the moisture as it keeps me soft and silky for the entire day. I also love the recipe book that came along with the purchase and have ordered some other oils to make a few. I will definitely be returning when I need to get more. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Got my Raw Shea butter today but was a little disappointed when I didn&#x27;t recieve my recipe book instead I have to visit bettersheabutter.com/recipes. I wanted this item to be a gift. Anyways the product was packaged well and the smell not that bad at all, very creamy and smooth. WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I already used raw shea butter for my sensitive and dry skin, but this one is the best quality I have ever come across. It&#x27;s fresh, smooth and it smells nice and fragrant. I love the packaging and I easily divided the butter in my own containers, so I always have some with me. It&#x27;s great as lip balm, eye contour cream, I even used it as a gloss for my rebellious hair. I highly recommend this product and I will absolutely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this! Very absorbent and has made my skin feel so soft! I started making my own whipped body butter and this is the perfect ingredient!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Product is exactly as advertised, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a quality shea butter. It feels good, and it&#x27;s vacuum sealed for freshness. I used it to make a whipped butter for my hair, and I need more jars! I have a lot more left over than I thought I would, because the consistency was great for whipping.</li>
            <li> The Shae Butter was exactly what I expected, the color the smell, all lovely. I like that smoky smell! Spreads beutifully on skin. I made a face/all skin lotion with few other ingredients and whipped it up, it&#x27;s like whipped butter almost good enough to eat ;) I like making my own face/body creams, I know exactly what&#x27;s in it!&lt;br /&gt;Since my order did not come with the booklet, (I learned  latter it was an E-book) I send the Better Shea Butter an email, if they could send me the link, I got the link in less then 24h! Mind you my order came on Friday, late in the day! So they send me the link over the weekend! How nice! I really wanted their Shea Butter beacause of the E-book and obviously the high rattings of the Shea Butter it self. The book is very inforamative and has very nice recipes for lotions! Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I have never used pure Shea Butter before...with that said.  I am not sure what the consistency is supposed to be.  When I whipped up an ounce it didn&#x27;t feel gritty but the next morning when I used some of the whipped up it had a gritty feeling so I have to give it a 4. It arrived neatly packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> I used this for DIY sunscreen and it worked great! I may use a little more next time to have more lotion and less oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect!</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  Came with extra downloadable recipes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Got it VERY quick!  Quality looks, smells, and feels awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product and very speedy delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality...thanks!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with the product.  My only complaint is that it seems quite pricey.  I plan to test some competitors before committing to paying this much.  If, after the test, I like the others as well, I will likely drop a star.  If, after the test, this product is clearly better, I will bump it up a star.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly. I was able to make whipped butter with it but it smells so bad! It feels like quality Shea butter but I can&#x27;t put it on my body because it smells so bad. It smells like cigarette smoke or something. I tried everything! I even used a whole bottle of 100% lemon oil and it still smelled. I&#x27;ll use it for my hair as a conditioner because I don&#x27;t want to waste all of it and for my feet in socks at night. Other than that, I can&#x27;t do anything with it because of the putrid smell.&lt;br /&gt;4.14.2015 After letting my whipped mixture sit for about 24 hours, it no longer has that funky scent! I added a star to my review because I&#x27;m pretty satisfied now but not 5 stars because of the shenanigans. Still not sure if I will buy again. Looking at other products and the same smell seems to be coming up so maybe that&#x27;s just how it smells *shrugs* I&#x27;m just happy it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste. I will also buy a more fragrant essential oil to add to the next half.</li>
            <li> I have used raw shea butter before and loved it, could  not find it locally until I checked Amazon.  It was what I expected.  I have looked into the recipes for making shea butter, coconut oil and jojoba oil whipped creams and will try it someday, for now I use the shea butter by itself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product--made my husband&#x27;s shaving cream with it for my first use.  I also like that it came packaged with the other things I ordered from Amazon.  Arrived very quickly and I appreciate the resealable bag.</li>
            <li> Very high quality shea butter.  Best product I have used for moisturizing all over, and skin feels so soft.  I&#x27;m just starting to make body butter using this shea butter with coconut oil, avocado oil and essential oils.  Looking forward to new recipes...I think will make lovely gifts.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!  Super Fast Delivery and amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love the shea butter!</li>
            <li> Lovely, lovely block of shea butter - will definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to use this but I like it so far.  I like the texture when blending it with other products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter!  I have been searching for alternatives to steroids for my daughter&#x27;s eczema and this, along with essential oils, has done wonders!  I would highly recommend it.  Everyone in my family uses the whipped body butter I made with this butter.  We look forward to seeing how well we can retain moisture in the winter months!</li>
            <li> This arrived promptly and it is luxurious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased yellow shea butter in the past.  It had a much stronger scent.  I purchased this white shea butter this time as I&#x27;m already fighting dry skin.  I used this directly on my dry skin and in a home made body butter.  This shea butter is fantastic!  I&#x27;ll never puchase another again.  It&#x27;s packaged appropriately and smells wonderfully chocolate + nutty.  edit 12/8/15 - This ivory shea butter is a life saver.  I had horrible dry skin on my chin that I absolutely could not get rid of.  I started applying this shea butter at night to my face after cleansing and it&#x27;s cleared up.  I mix this in my hand with organic Argon oil at night - my skin looks fantastic! I also started making my own shea butter body wash with this, vegetable glycerin, and Dr Bronner&#x27;s castile soap.  My dry skin feels wonderfully hydrated and best of all - no chemicals!  This product is an abosulte game changer for my skin.  I will continue to use it as long as you keep selling it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled. Delivery, packaging, quality &amp; quantity of the product amazing. Will buy this brand again &amp;again.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth; always clears my skin up</li>
            <li> This product is working out well so far.  I would like to learn more about its uses.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Made diaper cream for cloth diapers.  It turned out great and can&#x27;t wait to make more.  Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because my skin was a mess - sun damaged, dry, rosacea, breakouts. I wanted to get away from all the chemicals in modern skin care products that claimed to make improvements to my skin but failed miserably and see if what I&#x27;d been reading about shea butter would work for my skin. I am soooo glad I did and now I&#x27;m back for more of this high quality, remarkable product. I have used it alone as well as in homemade lotions and have been blown away by the improvement in my skin. Dryness is gone, rosacea is vastly improving, my skin feels more supple, no more breakouts, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on my skin! I will NEVER be without this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely texture &amp; scent!</li>
            <li> Shipped in two days! I used it to make my own lotion, but it&#x27;s great just on it&#x27;s own too. Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft, not greasy. Smells earthy and nutty. I&#x27;m already planning on ordering more! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got stretch marks from giving birth to my daughter 5 years ago, and had been tried many expensive brand products until my cousin introduced me this Shea butter. I have been using it for a year and half now, and my stretch marks start fading. I mixed it with coconut oil and apply it on my dry skin, and my dry skin is gone, as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived I opened it gave a small pea size piece to each of my kids and my husband they all lathered and conditioned their hands. Loving the way it felt my daughter rubbed it on her eczema on her legs and said it stop the itching.  I used the shea butter in making my deodorant and also in my chapstick.  Great Product I will always keep on hand!</li>
            <li> This has a slightly grainy texture at first but it rubs in so easy and lasts through several hand washes. Used essential oils to give it some scent &amp; it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was everything I expected and more. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve been using it in some homemade lotion and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> First experience with Shea Butter--very nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Shea Butter for about a week now and I will say that my face seems to be loving it. It&#x27;s still a bit early to give all the praise to the Shea Butter alone so I will return in a month to give a follow up review however thus far I am please. My initial concern was that I would not get authentic  Shea Butter but this is definitely the real deal. The smell leaves a lot to be desired but the benefits are worth the scent.</li>
            <li> Hahahaha when you Step out .. Nothing to loose and All Compliments to gain when you make this Purchase I wish I had known about this Shea Butter  years ago I would have saved tons of money on beauty Products .. thank you Shea Butter and the Love you put in your Product:)</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it in a homemade cream for lotion and diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite amazon purchases. I have been using it now for about a year and can&#x27;t imagine living without it now. I brought a small chunk of this on a 2 week long beach vacation and this was my only form of body lotion. After my shower each day I would rub a small amount in my hands to melt it then apply to my entire body. I spent everyday in the pool and ocean and this was the best moisturizer I have ever used. It creates such a great barrier on your skin to things that dry it out. My skin never got dry once. I also use a small amount under my eyes at night sometimes as an under eye treatment. It melts into your skin and you wake up with the softest skin ever. I was a little thrown by the texture when I first bought this. It is a little waxy and sticky and can be odd to work with, but the benefits are definitely worth the extra work to apply. I have tried making lotion with this, but have found I like the pure shea butter much better. I also love that I can use it on my kids and it is safe and effective. It has helped my son&#x27;s kp on his arms, as well as some patches of eczema my daughter had. When I purchased this shea butter I also purchased a bottle of Leven Rose jojoba Oil. I also highly recommend that oil if you are looking for another amazing product to include in your skin care routine. That oil changed my life. Together with that oil and this shea butter, I will never purchase another bottle of body lotion, face lotion, or face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like this product... I have been using it to moisturize my hair and skin and am throughly enjoying this product. In the past, I have ordered shea butter from a different company. But, would say this product is superior to the one I&#x27;ve been using before. Item arrived early and in great condition. Will buy again, when I run out.</li>
            <li> Delicious! I&#x27;m newly pregnant and have been using the shea butter straight, on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, but the included recipes look great too. Here&#x27;s hoping this first pregnancy a zero stretch mark one!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this particular shea butter after reading the reviews. I know there are some who have revived unauthentic shea butter. Well this Shea butter is truly authentic! I use raw unrefined shea butter to make my own whipped shea butter cream, which I use for my hair and skin. I must say this shea butter is by far the best I&#x27;ve purchased. I purchased yellow shea butter in the past (from a different seller) and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or how greasy it was. The ivory doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it&#x27;s not as greasy. I will definitely purchase this Shea butter from this seller again! I won&#x27;t be taking chances elsewhere!</li>
            <li> After the winter months on Artic fish beaches, I use the NOW Foods Shea Butter Lotion for the area of my nose that is prone to cracking, dryness and soreness due to the winter sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good stuff and close to being more natural than chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typed all the Ingredients from my product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: De-ionized Water, Shea Butter, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice*, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Vegetable Glycerin, Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Cetyl Alcohol/Cetearyl Glucoside, Glucose/Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperoxidase (natural preservative), Jojoba Oil, Vegetable Squalene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Phospholipids (from soy lecithin), Potassium Sorbate, Vitamin A (as Retinyl Palmitate), D-Panthenol, Grapefruit Oil, Lime Oil, Natural Vanilla Extract and Natural Orange-Grapefruit Citrus Essence.&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic</li>
            <li> I like the product and have used it in some cocoa/mint lip balm.  This was a smooth and easy transaction..</li>
            <li> Used this to make a whipped body butter. I put the shea butter in a large glass measuring cup and then placed the cup in a pot of very hot water. It melted quickly and was perfectly clear with no specks of residue in it. The smell is mild and pleasant; the feel is a little oily when first applied, but just wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed. Once it is you will have beautifully hydrated skin with a wonderful satiny look and feel. Love this shea!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make cosmetics.  The butter has a good consistency, and the smell is pleasant.  It blended well into my hand salve.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Love it and the Service was great</li>
            <li> Use it as regular moisturizer, is great</li>
            <li> I used this in a recipe I found on the crunchy moose website for Varicose Veins.  Don&#x27;t know if it works yet.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, smells great, melts in your palm for easy application. I got it to mix with essential oils and other ingredients for body lotion, face creams, sunscreen.  Also works just fine by itself as facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. Good in face and hair creams.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.  Quality is number one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Raw Shea Butter many times and this Raw Shea Butter is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Sometimes it&#x27;s a little harder than other times, but I don&#x27;t mind that inconsistency.  Melts well, I use it to make homemade butters and creams and it works so well.  I have 2 adopted children who are African American and there skin tends to get dry and chalky.  This Shea butter is the perfect skin soothing cream to keep their skin soft and beautiful!  Best Shea butter on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used unrefined Shea Butter in the past, but this time I was disappointed.  Once I opened it, ready to use, the smell was not the nutty aroma that I am use to, it had a rancid smell.  I contacted Amazon immediately, returned the product.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed to make my body butter!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality product at an amazing value!</li>
            <li> i made body butter using this, coconut oil, and vitamin E, along with some orange oil for fragrance. Really keeps my 60+, extra  dry skin moisturized. Could not detect any bad smell from it. Keep my unused she&#x27;s butter in the fridge for future use, though I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> Love this! Shipped prompt, product exactly as described-easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!! Easy to apply and it feels great. Your skin won&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Works great as a facial moisturizer too and does not leave your face feeling too oily. I have noticed a difference in my skin clearing and also way fewer breakouts than when I was using oil of olay as a facial moisturizer. FYI - I have extremely oily skin and I can use this everyday on my face with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell of these shea butter and the way packaging</li>
            <li> High quality product!! 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I have never used shea butter before in my health and beauty products.  Just made a wonderful body butter with this shea butter, cocoa butter coconut oil and almond oil.  Love the resealable packaging the shea butter came in.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I received the shea butter and it smells horrible. Like bunt bacon or some kind of bad meat. I use the shea butter to make a body butter for my eczema. I thought that after I made the recipe and added the essential oils that the smell would be better but it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading so many great reviews.  When I took it out of the package it looked just as depicted in the picture. I followed the directions and gently melted the shea butter. Unlike the picture, as it melted it did not turn a pretty amber liquied but it was kinda of greenish. I thought once it cooled and I whipped it, it might change. The color stayed the same even after I whipped it, the texture did not look the same as in the pics either. I still kept it, thinking if I massaged it in my hand before use it might still be useful. Unfortunately it had a very grainy texture to it, that would not go away. I had to clean the bits off with a damp cloth. I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Keep in mind this is unrefined she&#x27;s butter so it has a stronger more distinctive smell. If you are making your own beauty products or sunscreen a few drops of essential oil will take care of it. The texture was quite creamy and smooth and you are definitely getting great value for the money. I will order from them again she I am ready for my next batch.</li>
            <li> Great product! Used in a recipe for natural deodorant and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s really creamy and keeps my natural 3C hair moisturizer! I bought this to take on deployment with me so I can do twist outs, and it&#x27;s been amazing, no complaints from me!!</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and was good quality. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations.  Have only worked with it a little bit so far.</li>
            <li> Used my Shea butter to make a body lotion.  It was amazing!</li>
            <li> First of all this smells light and nutty. I love it! I have been using it on my hands, nails and hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality. I used it for a body cream but also for my face and  hair. i will definitely order this product again!</li>
            <li> I received it in a very good conditiin and i use it on my lips it is perfect realy amazing</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great.  I have o my used refined in the past and I am so happy I found unrefined.  Leaves skin so soft and is cheaper than the fancy brand.</li>
            <li> I am a believer in Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter by Better Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter. I have worked in construction for thirty years and my skin has taken a beating from dust, dirt, wind, severe cold and extreme heat. Of course I didn&#x27;t take good care of my skin except the once in a while squirt of brand name lotions filled with ingredients that sound like they were imported from some intergalactic trade agreement we have with the planet Uranus.&lt;br /&gt;Well I have developed super dry cracking skin on my hands and spots on my legs and arms. After months of regularly applying the lotions mentioned above I had no improvement in my skin (I had to get serious now right?). Of course an immediate relief was obtained when the chemical laced lotions were applied but it lasted a matter of thirty to sixty minutes then it was back to scratching, rubbing and constant discomfort. No over the counter OR prescription (more ingredients from Uranus) lotions or creams helped in the long haul nor did they start to HEAL my skin (I was hideous).&lt;br /&gt;I had to get really serious now. I did research and found great articles and reviews about Shea Butter and  home made lotions that contained Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP READING... I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT I HAD THIS CONDITION FOR A LONG MISERABLE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Shea Butter I received it on Friday. I applied it to the problem areas twice a day for two days and I can see AND feel my skin healing. My left hand by the fatty part by the thumb was cracked, red like a tomato and oozing nastiness. I applied the Shea Butter extra heavy in that area and I am writing this Sunday morning and that area&#x27;s color is almost normal and the deep painful cracks are well on their way of being closed and healed. I am a true believer in two days that I purchased everything Better Shea Butter has on their website.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product IT WORKS!!!!  incredible</li>
            <li> Thank you for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by a fellow essential oil user and I am so glad she recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This butter doesn&#x27;t take too long to melt and smells natural and clean. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that when I added my oils to it, such as wintergreen or citrus, the shea butter scent was strong and overpowered the essential oil scent a bit. I think that really is just something I&#x27;ll need to get used to and adjust my recipes accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, just wish it came in a bigger amount, but I will just have to order more next time.</li>
            <li> Product came having a few areas that looked dark or slightly dirty meaning it was not a clean look throughout the block. Maybe this is normal? Nevertheless it was soft and pliable and the scent was not overpowering. I really think an expiration date needs to be printed on the package as BetterSheaButter&#x27;s site says to use it within six months if mixed with other oils. So knowing the freshness of the batch would be extremely helpful. Also, I did not receive the information on now to download the free ebook with the order but it was emailed after I inquired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December: Sorry, but I have to reduce to one star. After melting on very low heat in a double boiler, there were strange stringy looking sediments in the oil. To me, it looked like fungus. (See photo) I had to throw it out. Maybe my batch was old but I would not buy it again. See picture for reference.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Life-Flo brand of unrefined shea butter and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was my  first time to order Shea butter. This huge block of Shea butter was so easy to work with. The Shea butter is very smooth and I found adding it to my homemade face and body cream very easy. I received recipes from the company so it was nice to see how to use the Shea butter in different ways. I melted the Shea butter and I added some essential oils to tone down the natural scent of the Shea butter. Once it was cool, I whipped the Shea butter with a little coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and argon oil. I was looking for a light airy cream. My finished product feels like softened butter.  While the Shea butter does not have a bad scent, I just wanted a softer scent for my neck and face creams. My husband thinks the finished product has a better scent than just the Shea butter without the essential oil added! I used about a fourth of my big block so I have a huge amount leftover.  I will be making much more of body and face creams in the future! Better Shea Butter is an awesome company with great customer service!</li>
            <li> This was my first time handling Shea. It is different than I thought it would be. Its kinda like putty. I read other reviews of it having a smoky odor, which it does but it seems natural and isn&#x27;t over powering. I&#x27;ve had great results using it in body lotions and lip balm. It melts nicely and has never been grainy as some have stated.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and was just as described.  The accompanying eBook was very helpful since I was purchasing the shea butter to make my own homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> I moved in desert area and I have to need something moist. I bought this Shea butter, and this is very good choice I think. It&#x27;s wonderful! I will buy again next time!</li>
            <li> this product was bought to help with dry skin, and to use as a lotion for my young children to help combat with their dry skin and eczema.  however, both my kiddos, one being eight months old broke out in hives from this product, and my five year old was extremely itchy after using it.  not sure i will use it again, if ever. its unfortunate I can&#x27;t use this on them. the smell of this isn&#x27;t very pleasing either, but if it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  I mixed it with olive oil and made a body butter.  I would totally recommend this product!  :)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this as a face and body moisturizer. I have been suffering from very dry skin lately and after failed attempts with coconut oil (too greasy and not long lasting) I decided to give this a shot. Its doing a great job! It takes minimal effort to warm it up well enough to apply. I plan to make some recipes included in the digital book soon, just waiting on the ingredients to ship.</li>
            <li> Great quality Shea Butter. I will be overriding it again.</li>
            <li> Everything great! Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Great product and exceptional customer service. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> a wonderful product, perfect for blending with olive oil and making a base for my essential oils.  Very pleased. Prompt shipping, great follow up support.</li>
            <li> I made face cream out of this shea butter with some jojoba, rose hip, and essential oils.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, but it is very moisturizing. The shea butter has a pleasant smell and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This unrefined shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  All unrefined shea butters have a distinct smell, but this one has the least of all and it seems to go away fairly quickly.  It is perfectly smooth, not at all grainy, and has done wonders for my face and hands. The seller is absolutely wonderful to communicate with -  I will definitely buy from her again, although a little does go a long way!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter.  A little shea butter with a dab of almond oil to soften the shea and then add a bit of lavender helps cool a rash I get on my hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Exactly as explained</li>
            <li> This shea butter is lovely and makes a wonderful homemade cream or body butter. The free recipe book gives lots of great information and instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have been using it in its raw form. Directly on my skin. Have breakout issues and scaring on arms and back it is healing in only 1 week&lt;br /&gt;Use it on my lips and neck too</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this Shea Butter and I love it!  I have used it as a lotion, and also in recipes with essential oils such as body butter.  It is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great shea butter I use it on my hair and skin!!</li>
            <li> Second time I get this butter, because my mom pretty much stole the first one. I was glad she took it because honestly she was wearing all kinds of smelly lotions that made my head hurt. This is great for sensitive and non-sensitive people alike, because it has a very nice earthy pleasant smell, not strong at all (not like the yellow Shea butter. Yellow butter is still good but I think it&#x27;s for people with intense skin issues, because it is /extremely/ moisturizing and oily. This butter is VERY rich still but not as greasy and actually after about 15-20 minutes absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after shower, hang out for 20 minutes with a cup of coffee, and then get to touching &#x27;mechanical&#x27; things. I wouldn&#x27;t advise picking up your laptop immediately after application since it takes about that 20 minutes. Fast shipping and great customer service. The yellow butter I got from a different company I don&#x27;t remember whom.. but I these people are better. This butter never went bad after 6 months. The other butter went bad about 3-4 months later... moldy. This time I&#x27;m keeping it in the fridge too so it should last me a whole year. A year of lotions taken care of is a great deal for this price and quality. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This smells like burning plastic. It was enough to make me instantly nauseous and I am especially annoyed because I am making my lotions and deodorants for the year, and now I am down an essential ingredient. I also have to deal with the hassle of trying to get this item returned. One of the few times I have been disappointed in an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it...I will be a repet customer.</li>
            <li> Excellent raw ivory shea butter. We have been using it for our whole family for several months now.  It is non-comedogenic meaning it does not clog pores or cause acne, and it is a great moisturizer especially for winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light, and the consistency is less grainy than the previous shea butter I tried from Amazon.  It does have a smell, however, and this is normal for undefined shea butter, which retains more of its healthy healing vitamins and nutritional value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We mix the shea butter with hemp seed oil, which is also a non-comedogenic oil, to loosen the consistency and make it easier to apply.  I also do another mixture with zinc oxide powder (also by the same seller) as sunscreen.  Extremely versatile as a base ingredient for homemade skincare products.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not real hard.....easily cut or shaved for incorporation into body cream.  Pleasant smell as compared to other I&#x27;ve used.  Shipped fast and was packaged properly.  Definitely will get this again.</li>
            <li> Read about the benefits of shea butter and wanted to try it out. I hunted around for the product in stores and online but every place was too expensive or too shady. This shea butter was reasonably priced and I revived exactly was was in the picture. I ordered Ivory and it smelt like shea butter( not a factory) and was not crumbly at all. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I literally got rid of hundreds of dollars in high end lotions. I now make my own skin care products. This is a staple because it can be used alone. Friendly company. Smells great. Not rancid. $16 how are you going to be that? Plus no added toxic chemicals or carcinogens!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is remarkable stuff! It truly moisturizers our skin and lips. It is the ONLY cream I can use after radiation that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. I am so grateful to have discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times so far and can already tell that my feet are softer.  I use it right before going to bed and in the morning I can tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough how amazing their customer service is, Isabella. I received my Shea butter and it was a bit grittier than I would prefer. She was so kind in helping me with suggestions to get it to improve. She sent me a replacement order for no cost. I am SO pleased with this batch! It is so silky smooth and it smells amazing. I will be purchasing again and recommend them highly!!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Not only is the product excellent; the customer service and follow up is amazing! They provide helpful tips and are extremely knowledgable! Will definitely purchase again when I need my next batch!</li>
            <li> Made great lotion bars</li>
            <li> Delivered super quick &amp; high quality!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. This is an amazing product that is going to last me a long time, and when I do run out, I will order more!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. We&#x27;ve ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I received my shea butter within five days after placing my order.  It smells great and it is soft.</li>
            <li> Smells and looks great! I&#x27;m enjoying right now as part of a whipped body butter, my skin is feeling wonderful! Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter to make lotions, deodorants and lip balms.  I was running low and decided to try this brand.  Not only is the shea butter of great quality but the company sent emails making sure I was satisfied and they give recipe ideas with the butter.  It was nice feeling the company cares about their customers, which makes me trust them all the more.  I will definitely buy this shea butter again.</li>
            <li> A little change on stretch marks</li>
            <li> Arrived soon after I ordered it -- looks great; can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> It works great!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to use and I love that it comes with recipes!  Feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> Probiotics and shea butter keep my baby&#x27;s eczema at bay. This is the best butter out there. The first time I ordered it, I added jojoba oil. The next time, no jojoba. The butter doesn&#x27;t need any amendments. My baby&#x27;s skin loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter! I made the most luxurious body butter with it. Customer service is great too!</li>
            <li> At first I was leery about buying this product because of the reviews. Yes, they were mostly good but then some where just awful and I didn&#x27;t want to fall into the trap of ignoring the warnings in favor of positive news. I end up giving this product a chance because it said exactly what I was looking for in a Shea Butter product. I didn&#x27;t want it fully diluted with other products or grainy or yellow or foul smelling. Plus for 16 dollars for a pound is a good deal when other companies sell lower quality for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before shipment i received a nice letter, I&#x27;m not sure if it was automatic (pretty sure it was) but it was lovely anyhow to be noticed  as a customer and to know the company appreciated my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping - I bought it on a Friday and received it on a Wednesday of the follow week. I might have gotten it sooner if it wasn&#x27;t for the weekend, however, its still fast shipping compared to the almond oil I am still waiting on, the one I paid shipping on where as this came with free shipping and still got to me in under a week. Keep in mind, I live in the States in the Midwest so people further out or not in the country might have a different shipping speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - The box itself came with another package so I can&#x27;t say anything on the package stand alone. As for the image promoted. It looks exactly as the picture, same brown resealable package with a pound Shea Butter in plastic resealable baggie which is excellent because you can take out the product without messing up the brown pack, your hands, or product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter - Its ivory white, none grainy, looks like a mix between play-dough and butter. It feels smooth to the touch and breaks apart fairly easy.  In MY patch (which could be different for everyone else) in a small dime size amount, it only two about 5-6 seconds for it to melt from my body temperature and my average body temp is between 96-98 degrees U.S. The Shea Butter itself is soft enough to scoop out easily with a spoon, even a plastic one and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again; excellent, because I can make homemade body butters without going through the traditional methods of a double boiler. This also means unlike the boiler method you have to be very careful of the amount of oils the Shea Butter gets mixed into because it can easily become borderline Shea &#x27;liquid&#x27;..unless you are making a shampoo, that&#x27;s good too! Thankfully! This order does come with a recipe book the you have to DL online if you are into the type of DIY like myself. The smell of the Shea butter is earthy clay, some people might not like this, some people do, but you can add fragrance and the &#x27;Shea&#x27; smell will tone down but not completely go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Keep in mind as much as I praise this product and will most likely buy more in the future. I do have to add this product is not for everyone. If your skin/hair type doesn&#x27;t absorb well, or you have very sensitive skin/hair, or skin/hair sucks up a lot of moisture (like my hair).... this product is not for you. Rather, I should say; buy this product will full intent on making the Shea Butter part of a larger blend or you will find yourself disappointed. Personally, I enjoy the Shea Butter, my mother enjoys it, and as I said, I will be buying from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If 16 dollars (or whatever the price change will be by the time anyone reads this) is not going to break your wallet and you do want a good Shea Butter product, definitely consider trying this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps!h to scoop out easily with a spoon, even a plastic one and I could mix a palm size amount with essential and other oils without heating it up first which is again; excellent, because I can make homemade body butters without going through the traditional methods of a double boiler.

            <li> I really like this product. Had enough to make two 16 oz jars of whipped body butter. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from using a costly $$$ shea butter lotion to 100% RAW UNREFINED ORGANIC SHEA BUTTER.  And my skin is thanking me for making the switch :). This product is totally AMAZING! My skin is sooo soft and not dry and cracked as before. I am so happy I found this product. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Whipped this into a body butter with coconut oil and then refrigerated! First use was smooth and super moisturizing but after it &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a bit it was a little grainy - could&#x27;ve been from the coconut oil. Still LOVE it and it is super moisturizing, just may think about keeping it refrigerated! The Shea came packaged well and seems to be very pure - this is my first experience ever with Shea so I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> 5 Star product and service!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea butter, needing a small amount to make homemade sunscreen for the first time.  I am so glad I bought enough to try more products!  It made the sunscreen amazingly soft and moisturizing.  I can&#x27;t wait to try other recipes!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Use it to make moisturizer and it works great in the dry AZ weather!</li>
            <li> I really like this company and the product. This is my first time ordering Shea butter online. I usually go to my local beauty supply store and pay about 6.99 for 16 oz. of yellow shea butter. Needless to say i was a little apprehensive to buy this product due to the price and purchasing online. With that being said I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and I am so glad I did it. This Ivory shea butter is unlike any Shea butter I have used. it smells the same (to me) as the yellow shea butter I have been using but it is so much easier to manipulate. I usually whip my shea butter with other oils to help with the texture but you really don&#x27;t need to with this shea butter. I received my package right on time in a very neat simple packaging. A few days after my ordering through amazon i received an email from owner Isabella thanking me for my purchase and just letting me know i could contact her directly if i had any questions or concerns! i really appreciated this and would recommend this company to anyone who is new to using shea butter. I believe this company would be very helpful. I love knowing i am spending my money at a company who really appreciates my business. Thank you Isabella for your commitment to quality product and customer satisfaction!</li>
            <li> It came on time and the Shea butter was good quality. I have been using it and I love how it makes my hair and skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am knew to making my own products with Shea so it&#x27;s hard for me to review. First off I&#x27;m not in love with the smell. It&#x27;s not horrible but I haven&#x27;t found the right combinations and strength of essential oils to use that will cover the Shea smell. Second, I do find it to be a little greasy. The product itself seems good and I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure what my expectations were for this but I am in love.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my arns - my skin is the nicest it has ever been.  It does not smell great but it&#x27;s not bad either.  I am considering adding some essential oil, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.  Once it is on my skin it almost has a nutty scent and then it goes away. It also does take time to absorb but also not a big deal.  It does absorb and does not just stay sticky on the surface like some other products I have tried. You just have to give it time. Overall - really loving this and plan to order more.  A great value for what you get.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter comes well wrapped, with a quite strong nut? smell, I melt some in my palm and tried on my face, my skin absorbs quickly and felt smooth. I like it. But this is my first time using an ivory colored one. Those raw ones I used are light colored.</li>
            <li> This shea butter came in a block about 7x3x2. I cut it in half and used double boiler to melt the shea butter with other oils and coconut oil to make wonderful lotion that is 75% shea and 25% other oil. My skin and hair, and boyfriend and dog, love the wonderful smell and texture of the final product. Thanks so much for making this process easier and successful!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in perfect condition. I used it to make a couple of things and so far I really love it! The recipes are great too!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It&#x27;s working wonders on my college-girl&#x27;s skin, after a horrible bout with scabies.  Oy...you don&#x27;t ever want to be infected by this scourge.</li>
            <li> Works great with my essential oils in making lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shea butter. I use it when making my own lotions and creams. It feels really great on my skin and is easy to work with. I&#x27;ve bought this multiple times now.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the Shea butter itself but there was a large hallow spot in the block which was disappointing. It went the length of the whole block so there was a good amount of product missing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in order to make lotion bars.  When my items arrived today, I immediately opened the packages and set to work.  The first thing that I had noticed was the terrible smell.  When deciding to make this purchase, I had read other reviews stating that the product smelled and others that claimed there was no smell.  Guess I got a smelly one.  This picture shows a lighter color than I had received as well.  Mine was pretty green/brown in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began melting all of my items and noticed that the smell was not as strong.  (This gave me some hope).  Once all of my items were melted, I removed the liquid from the heat and added in my essential oils.  I added more drops than usual because the smell of this shea butter was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 hours later my bars were set.  I smelled one of them.  UGH!  It still smells horrible.  I&#x27;m thankful that I had only made a small batch.  I refuse to waste good essential oil just trying to mask the smell of this product.  I will continue to use it until it runs out, but I will not reorder this product.  The lotion bars that I have made with this product work well, but then my body smells like this shea butter and it&#x27;s a little repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the smell doesn&#x27;t bother you, then consider this a 5 star review.  I gave it 3 because it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well aware that good raw shea butter should have a nutty smell (almost like roasted) and this does not.  It does not smell rancid.  It just has a strong terrible odor.</li>
            <li> I am on my second block of this.  I like it. I have sensitive skin.  I use it to make my own lotions.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  I highly recommend it. I want to get more and more to natural products.</li>
            <li> This has a strong smell but aside from that is absolutely wonderful. I bought it for making lip balms, but I&#x27;ve ended up just using it straight on my skin because it feels luxurious. The shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st time buying Shea Butter so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Reading reviews I prepared myself for a bad smell but was surprised when I opened the bag. It smells really nice. The Costumer Service is A+. They really care about the happiness of their Customers and the quality of product upon receipt. The free e-book is a added bonus. Going to be placing another order today.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from Better Shea Butter, and it will likely not be the last. The shea butter itself is fantastic quality and has worked lovely as an ingredient in some of the DIY body butters and lotions I&#x27;ve been making recently. Isabella provides excellent customer service as well. The e-book with recipe ideas was a nice treat! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Used this in my first DIY sunscreen. Was very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, buyer eager to get to know how product is and provided website for recipes. It is really good quality. I used it for eczema treatment and in lotions and soap making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the ziplock packaging. It would be great to have it in a jar or plastic container. It was difficult to transfer product and it stuck to the walls of ziplock which is a waste. Otherwise; love it, will order again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I received the amazing Shea Butter in good condition, &amp; in a timely manner!  The product looks clean, and has a nutty fragrance.  At this point, I have only used the Shea Butter as a cream for hands &amp; feet, but I look forward to making lip balm and other products.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought Shea Butter.  I have had a problem with peeling lips for many years and it seems to be helping a lot.  I am using it as a moisturizer all over including my face and I can tell a difference already.  I don&#x27;t find the slight nutty smell offensive.  I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave this a five star because it deserves this rating. My daughter made up a natural hair and body cream of all natural products olive oil, avocado, coconut oil and Shea butter. Great!!</li>
            <li> Great product that was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its all we use for our body butters</li>
            <li> I just received mine the the other day and have been using it on my face every night.  I love it so far.  It came very well packaged just as shown in the picture - the shea butter is in sealed plastic within another bag that zip locks.  There was no mold at all, not even a hint.  The color and texture of the entire block is uniform and smooth.  I keep it stored in the fridge, and as others have mentioned, the product melts beautifully in your fingers just from body heat. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of this product.  I make my own hair and body products and I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past finding right shea butter to use.  This product was malleable an easy to mix with other oils at room temperature, the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and the packaging was simple and effective.  I research the color, texture and quailty of the various grades of shea butter and this was definitley on point.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve used shea butter before but it was yellow/gold, grainy, and hard. This butter is is completely smooth, and soft enough to mix in essential oil by hand. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this butter goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and provides all day moisture. This is also the first product where I see and feel a great difference in skin texture after using it (and it&#x27;s only been a few days!). My toddler also has sensitive skin and eczema--I&#x27;m using this butter mixed with some lavender oil for him.  I am very pleased with the results and plan to keep this purchase regular for my family.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrives exactly as pictured- a bar wrapped in plastic. I transferred mine to a plastic tupperware, Reditainer (http://www.amazon.com/Reditainer-Extreme-Containers-32-Ounce-24-Pack/dp/B00N2TADOY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1432648818&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;deep+freeze+tupperware) which provide airtight storage and easy access for use. Plus, the entire bar fits easily inside.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to make some lotion for my sons eczema. I received an email from Isabella/owner asking me to use the shea butter alone for 24hrs to ensure that there would be no allergic reaction. Now at first I found it odd because I was going to do that anyway. First on myself then on my son but then I realized not everyone would think to do so. It&#x27;s a nice little reminder and her follow up emails were very helpful. They show that this company is ran by people that actually care about the customer and take pride in their product. In responses to those that stay they never received the recipes. The recipes DO NOT COME WITH THE PRODUCT. You have to download the pdf. I haven&#x27;t used the recipes because I have my own but they look to be a really good starting point for those that want to make their own beauty products and don&#x27;t know where to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the shea butter. It came in a sealed brown bag (shown in picture) and inside that bag was another ziplock baggie that had the actual shea butter inside. The consistency was soft like playdough. I took less than dime size amount and rubbed it in between my palms and it was kind of like a hair pomade consistency because it melted but didn&#x27;t disappear or melt completely into an oily mess. I rubbed it into my skin and my skin absorbed it nicely and it felt nice not sticky or oily. Now when I put a lot more on my sons eczema spots and at first it was a little oily but then his skin absorbed completely it and seemed to need more. After a couple uses I thought that it wasn&#x27;t working on him. It&#x27;s like his skin was drinking it in but I continued to use it because it made my skin feel lovely. So a little less than a week went by and I started to see that the skin underneath his dry eczema skin was healing beautifully. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and the skin underneath is completely healed but he still has dry dead skin on top which I lightly rub off with a very soft wash cloth after his bath. I apply the Sheabutter about 3-4 times a day. We use a very small amount on our very curly hair and it leaves it nice and soft. We are a natural chemical free family and this shea butter is now something we cannot live without. I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! I have just received my 2nd batch and it is as great as the 1st. I love everything about this Shea butter. I have even strarted to put a small amount into my all natural  homemade deodorant (just for moisturizing purposes) and it feels lovely. Will order again next month because the one pound block seems to last my family about a month. We use it alone on our faces and hair but I mix it with other oils and beeswax for lip balms and whipped body/feet lotion.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great quality and product, Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> great quality of shea butter.  Made a phenomenal eczema cream for a friends baby and had great results.  the butter melted in nicely</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter on my baby since she was born and I have been very satisfied as it has been very very kind to her eczema. No other commercial product comes near shea butter in my opinion in moisturizing dry, sensitive skin with the price/economy considered (seriously, this stuff will last you ages!). Also will not cause any issues on my react-to-everything facial skin. I love it. Its my first time ordering this specific brand and from this seller and I found the texture of their shea butter to be divine. It is silky and soft and skin just loves it. It arrives in a plastic packaging which I transfer to a glass jar. I had some major stretch marks after the baby and this has lightened them (or at least I believe that to be the case!). I just wonder if this ever goes rancid because it can last months and months in our house.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells!  It melted easily when I combined this with Organic Coconut oil for a body butter.  I definitely recommend this and will purchase it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter wasn&#x27;t white, but more of an off-white or ivory color. It came in a bag that was brown paper on the outside with a zip closure. The butter itself is sealed in an interior plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s texture reminds me a bit of cookie dough with a twist. It feels like pure Shea butter. It is sort of hard but as it is handled or manipulated it morphs into a somewhat soft and at times liquid or oily form&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a super moisturizer/treatment for eczema without preservatives and found several recipes. I did not want anything was heated. I wanted to formulate a small batch that was whipped.&lt;br /&gt;I combined the Shea butter with wheat germ oil as well as a couple fragrant essential oils. I cut the ingredients into the butter and then used my hand mixer and whipped it together for a few minutes. I packed the entire mix into a 4 oz. Ball glass jar and popped it into the fridge. The mix isn&#x27;t quite as hard as most Shea butter mixes. It is somewhat pliant and sort of liquifies as it is applied. While it is a little greasy, when it is applied to the skin it absorbs easily. In the morning my skin was super soft and seemed firmer. The dry crusty skin from the eczema didn&#x27;t disappear immediately. It gradually disappeared and healed over a four day period.&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t used unrefined organic Shea Butter before I can only speak of this experience. I thought this product was great. It was easy to use and it was clear of particles and visible impurities.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular brand because of all the positive Amazon reviews that this was a superior product when compared to other shea butters. I&#x27;m recommending it as well.</li>
            <li> Product is just as listed. Natural shea butter, makes the skin feel soft and smooth, smells good and for the price, the amount of shea butter is good, better than good. I use it for lotions, hair products and chapstick. Mixes great with essential oils. This product willl last a good long while. Delivery was fast and the customer service was awesome. Will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make a body/face cream. I have some experience with cocoa butter, coconut oils and the ever ready mix ins of essential oils and herbs from the garden but I had never used Shea butter before. I was thankful for all the information given to me by the company, although was too excited to stop and read any of their recipes. I went straight to work on my magic potion designed just for me. FIRST, the Shea butter is heavenly to work with. It is so much softer than bricks of raw cocoa butter. If I were to guess, this butter came right from harvest. Swear, it was that fresh!  Not only was I able to make a 1-2mo supply of body lotion, I was also able to make a 1-2mo supply of facial exfoliant and night cream. I am so thankful I found this product. My skin LOVES it and that makes me very happy.  Super smart buy... this is a new must have in my household.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make into a face lotion. I&#x27;ve never had any other type of Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others but it worked great and has helped re-motorize my skin without the added chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter.  It&#x27;s creamy and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve order several times from this seller and will continue to get my shea butter from them.  Repeat buyer &amp; proud!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I make many products for my family skin with this shea butter. I&#x27;ve tried many different companies product and this is the best. I absolutely love working with it...and even more so using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! This Shea butter is amazing!</li>
            <li> Being a newbie to the &amp;#34;make your own lotion&amp;#34; tribe, I bought this on the recommendation of one of the bloggers I follow. My first night with it, I just slathered the shea butter in my hair and on my face &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; and went to bed. Divine! Made my first batch of lotion with the shea butter, avocado oil and a few drops of essential oils and now I slather that on my hands &amp; feet every night before bed. MAGIC! You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this shea butter. It comes packaged in such a way that it&#x27;s totally contained, yet not &amp;#34;over packaged&amp;#34; (meaning they don&#x27;t waste resources on a lot of unnecessary packaging the way I do with unnecessary verbiage in my reviews...). Also, upon purchasing, you can download a free recipe book from the seller. I highly recommend the product and will definitely be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on a product ever but I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this Shea butter that I had to.  The Shea butter arrived in a very raw form (a brick in a plastic bag) but I appreciated the raw quality (which is awesome - I&#x27;ve been a huge Shea butter fan for years) for such a low price.  The best part was this amazing free booklet of Shea butter recipes that was easy to download once the product was ordered.  I&#x27;m so excited to try several of them - lip balm, intense moisturizer, shave cream, mask...so many!  The booklet printed out beautifully.  I also cut off several chunks of the raw Shea and put into little containers to have everywhere (nightstand, purse, etc) - awesome lip balm/hand lotion in raw form on the go.  I also gave pieces of it to several friends.  This block will last a long time but I&#x27;ll be ordering more - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea butter for my wife , she always talks about making her own creams and lotions, this product was the best way to start specially it comes with e book recipes , she was very happy with it , good quality raw Shea butter and nice eBook recipes , Thank you better Shea butter.</li>
            <li> My favorite Shea butter! I keep coming back for more and telling everyone how much I love it! My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Fast shipping. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought she&#x27;s butter before so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to. The packaging was nice, the butter was wrapped in plastic and came inside another bag so my other products didn&#x27;t get greasy. The only think is the Shea butter smell is stronger then I thought. I made lotions with it and even with two other oils and a lot of essential oils, it still has a slightly rancid smell I can&#x27;t get rid of. It could just be the butter but I&#x27;ve read some other reviews that say the older the more rancid it will smell. But like I said, I have nothing else to compare it to so I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I took it to my wife, a very excellent and arrived in Saudi Arabia in excellent condition thank you for this beautiful product</li>
            <li> I make my own body products for friends and family as well with skin issues. I used this and I have to warn you that you need to be prepared to filter the product twice after melting due to the additional impurities and residue.</li>
            <li> I used it almost daily by itself (you have to melt it in your palms to make it easier to apply) or in mixture with oils (almond or apricot or emu oil)</li>
            <li> Very high quality product. I am so happy that I went with this brand. The shea butter is smooth and free of any impurities. So far I have used some of it to make homemade chapstick. I plan to make some whipped body butter as well. This products is so easy to blend and use. I am very happy and will be ordering this shea butter again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used  raw shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have a standard to compare it with. But I like this product and I believe it is what it says it is. I used it under my night cream and I like how it is so rich to moisturize the skin. I melted some shea butter in a pot and added almond oil and rose oil to make some lip balm too. Loved it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the ivory she&#x27;s butter. I have always used the yellow one but then I got tired of the thickness and greasy feeling it would leave on my hair. So I decided to try the ivory shea butter and it is effective. It locks in moisture without weighing my hair down and making it feel greasy and oily. I have also melted it down and used in a few of my body lotions this stuff is great. I just wish I could&#x27;ve downloaded the eBook. But other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the best Shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used, but the company is amazing, as well.  I had ordered the Shea butter for making soap, and have now been using it directly on my skin.  It&#x27;s so creamy and nice.  I order all my Shea butter through this company now.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;It feel wonderful. I will never go back to store bought lotion again. My skin is never felt better and I can&#x27;t wait to mix it with almond and coconut oil to make my own hair and skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was going to use this in one of the recipes that comes in the e-book. However, I find myself just pinching off a piece, warming it in my hands and using it straight from the container. It has a mild and nutty aroma. My skin is defintely softer after using this once a day for about a week. I am going to mix it with a little coconut butter, meadow foam oil and carrot seed oil when I get the chance. Meanwhile, I just mix these together in my hands and apply. This way I can vary the mix and add the essential oils as I feel I need.</li>
            <li> Best Quality I&#x27;ve seen on the market. My wife loves it. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> I was truly in shock when I tried this product. I&#x27;ve used a lot of very expensive Shea Butter products. This RAW SHEA BUTTER is perfect! The same quality as all the other very expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Literally, other shea butters I&#x27;ve tried are 4x&#x27;s as expensive. This is a great value for a five star product! Works beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this RAW SHEA BUTTER is that its ORGANIC and PURE.  Doesn&#x27;t have additives or stinky things mixed into it. It&#x27;s soft as can be and all at such an amazing price! Really, I&#x27;m SO excited I found this and I&#x27;ll be a lifetime user so please keep providing this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my entire body every day. At this price, you can afford to do that. Really helps keep my feet and elbows soft and beautiful! If your a high end product consumer like myself, don&#x27;t let the price fool you - this is an amazing product that&#x27;s totally worth 4x&#x27;s what they charge! I&#x27;m SO grateful to find it at such a good price. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I moved to a state with extremely dry air at the end of October. Once winter came, my skin was the driest it&#x27;d ever been. It started to peel, darken and break out because of the dryness.  I went to my dermatologist and they recommended microdermabrasion, several lotions and expensive creams, which I used.  Nothing worked, my skin just soaked up anything I put on it and seemed to get worse and worse.  So, after researching dry skin on the internet, I decided to try this Shea Butter and I absolutely love it! My skin is so much softer, brighter, and moist! I will continue to use the Better Shea Butter and would recommend it to anyone who wants to naturally moisturize their skin.</li>
            <li> i realized that after i purchased it that this is a very small package/piece of shea butter for the price. i wont name other stores, which are less expensive, but they are out there. this is a nice shea butter however. because i have tried it, i may stick with ivory shea butter for a little to see how my skin and hair reacts to it.</li>
            <li> Raw, clean, very high quality. Fast shipping and very kind customer service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Made a ton of great projects</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff. It&#x27;s a beautiful consistency, perfect true shea butter. Melted it down and mixed it into my homemade cream/lotion, and could not be happier with the results. Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smoother than the yellow, noticably high quality.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like it one thing that it does that I was surprised about it was it helps for the muscles and joints and I&#x27;m a big weight lifter</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the product is the best! Have used it in several recipes and find it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I returned this item.  I did NOT get one full pound.  I got 14 ounces.  When I pay this much for a product (especially when there are other less expensive Shea butter choices), I expect to get one FULL pound.</li>
            <li> Works wonders love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Will be purchasing again - and soon since I am almost out already!</li>
            <li> Very high quality Shea butter for any project. The product smells great, almost like chocolate when blended with a sweet oil like coconut... texture is outstanding. Packaged well. The seller really cares about quality, and it shows. The free recipe booklet (downloaded separately) offers great tips for working with Shea and many ideas for your own creations like body butter, chap stick, soap, and more. Not the cheapest option but if quality matters it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li> Soft texture, easy to incorporate into my recipes. My hair and skin love it! Thank you.</li>
            <li> My wife and I agreed; the quality of this batch was the best we have ever ordered.</li>
            <li> Very good quality very smooth and mixes well with essential oils this was my second order</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I had bought some organic lotion at a crafts fair and when I went on the retailers site I found they were selling it for 15$ for 3oz! Yikes! So I purchased this pound of shea butter, I mixed it with sesame oil. I use if for my toddler he has very sensitive skin and I figured the fewer the ingredients the better. It turned out great, very creamy, a little bit goes a long way. I do L-O-V-E it and will definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Got it on time and already used it to whip up my own hair concoction.  I always buy my shea butter like this and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This product is NOTHING like the Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere. It&#x27;s GREAT. The others had a grainy texture to it, but this melts as soon as you begin to rub it in your skin and is great on my hair. I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most amazingly smooth shea butter ever. I bought an organic brand in a plastic tub before and it was grainy and difficult time rubbing into skin. This is smooth and melts into skin immediately. I highly recommend this to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and super quick delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> very good stuff.. arrived on time .</li>
            <li> Love this. It came quick and it a grate quality. I have used it for a few lotions and will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> At my pediatrician&#x27;s suggestion, we used this to help with my baby&#x27;s cradle cap.  He had a very bad case, covering his entire head and face and extending down to patches on his arms.  This Shea Butter helped improve his skin dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;I store it in a glass container with a snap lid to make it easier to use, and a little bit goes a long way.  It does have a strong, earthy smell.  I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, but it isn&#x27;t a particularly enjoyable smell either.</li>
            <li> Skin defining product from Texas. Very absorbant into the skin. Supplies a lot of helpful moisture. Very healing to dry skin. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I placed my order for this after reading many of the other positive reviews, and although I have not yet used the product (I intend too real soon!), I have to say that the attention in sending my order quickly, and the follow-up with my order informing me that I could receive a free-download of recipes, was quite unexpected.  I have made my own moisturizer in the past using white shea butter from the health food store, but after reading about the high temperature used in the refining of the white shea butter (I used prior), I am feeling very good about ordering this unrefined and organic shea butter. I look forward to using it, and very much appreciate the additional information provided. The owner Isbella, has proven to me she is sincere in providing an integritous product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Wonderful service and very friendly!&lt;br /&gt;- Courtney S.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my dry frizzy hair</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!! My skin feels amazing. It arrived via Amazon boxed and in the packaging exactly as shown in its photo. Easily one of the better Shea butter products I&#x27;ve ever come across. My mother bought it first and made certain that I bought one as well!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this product in the beginning. Went rancid after a few months. Seller says that&#x27;s possible f the package has been left open. So best to transfer to a sealed container asap. I&#x27;m trying a different brand now and will post about it in due time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Perfect for my little ones sensitive dry skin! It even works for diaper rash! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from here, and definitely not my last! I absolutely love this Shea butter!</li>
            <li> The company bugged the living crap out of me for a review but the product is pretty good as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product. I bought this a few months ago and used it recently to make some skin care products. I was amazed at the difference in quality between this brand and the previous one I had used. This butter was much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word). Previous brand had many pieces of debris throughout, so after it melted I would try to pick out some of the larger pieces. This product is lacking debris and is a very pleasant texture. However, I was able to buy twice the amount of shea butter for the same price with the previous brand I used. Despite the steep price, I was highly satisfied and will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> great product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter to make butter for my hair.  i add essential oils to the mixture and it&#x27;s great.  When it arrived it was the color and very smooth.  I enjoyed my mixture when it was finish.  I will most definitely order this product again.  The packaging is awesome.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I wasn&#x27;t very happy with this batch of Shea butter. It was very grainy and crumbly. I had a hard time trying to make body butter of even use it plain. I won&#x27;t be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> love the IVORY unrefined organic shea butter by Better Shea Butter. :) the texture is really nice, the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and my skin loves the quality of it. i&#x27;ve already used it to make a jar of whipped shea with coconut oil, jojoba oil (to increase the shelf life) and sweet orange essential oil. i probably won&#x27;t add as much coconut oil the next time because the shea is just so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to making more body care gifts with this shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really fast delivery and excellent customer service! i was able to get a response via email within a day.&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely purchase from them (and probably will) again!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and purchased Better Shea Butter&#x27;s 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter online and was not disappointed. It was neither grainy, nor malodorous and required no warming or mixing to use. I would both recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I buy this constantly and use all over my body (including face). Bought it initially because my friends dog was constantly cleaning me and found out that Shea butter is like doggie crack. I switched from my body lotion that contained Shea butter to the unrefined product so there are no harmful chemicals for her in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delightful surprise it&#x27;s cheaper and better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used (and I have very dry skin). I love it on my face and feet especially. I use it on my hair too as it&#x27;s a great curl definer and acts like a light hold gel if you use a quarter size dollop. I&#x27;ve also been bringing this to my massage therapist to use instead of the messy oils. It sinks right into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s become a staple at my house and my friend even cooks with it for his dog when she starts getting finicky over her meals. And of course we give it to her directly as well to eat as a treat. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be melted in microwave if needed although I prefer not to to that as it condenses after cooling and gets more solid if you plan on using it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it as an awesome moisturizing body scrub by adding Epsom salt and sitting in a steamed shower before rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I will always purchase  this shea butter please so not discounted. Keeps me from using harsh chemicals on my body.  My skin is more softer</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin which is so dry that I need moisturizer all year round even in humid climate. In winter it cracks and is flaky. Last winter I bought this unrefined ivory shea butter, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. It soothed my painful cracking skin immediately and my overall skin condition improved in the winter. I&#x27;m also a climber that means I always torture my finger skin until my fingertips so sore and sometimes even bruise and can&#x27;t climb anymore. I&#x27;ve tried some hand cream specifically designed for climbers for skin recovery, it worked. As a active climber, I need skin recovery quick so I tested to put climber hand cream on one hand and shea butter on the other hand. The next morning I compare them, the finger skin on the hand which I put shea butter is obviously better. Now I put shea butter on my hands after every climbing day before going to bed and other nights too if I remember. ps: I have used this shea butter plain or mixed with olive oil. Both worked equally well. But the latter is creamier and easier to apply especially in winter when plain shea butter became so solid and took more time to melt in my hands before I could apply them on my body.</li>
            <li> This product is really great and worth every cent. The packaging is sent as expected and the shea butter is pure and unrefined. Great product</li>
            <li> The best Shea Butter I have ever used! I have been creating creams and lotions for 20 years now and I am absolutely in love with this Shea Butter. It is super soft and pliable and creates a very creamy product when used in your recipes.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Made whipped body butter with the shea butter!  Fabulous results!  Will definitely purchase again! This is a high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product.  It comes withn the time frame stated.  I am looking forward to buying more!</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter products are incredible. I whipped up the most luxurious body and face creams using the Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, and Rosehip Seed Oil that I have ever used. I highly recommend this extraordinary product for its high quality. The recipes included with my purchase were easy to follow and the results have been wonderful. My skin has never been so happy.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I like that this is completely natural and healthy for my skin, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so greasy! I can&#x27;t use it during the day. I am using it at night, but I have to wash it off in the morning, which makes me think it&#x27;s not even soaking into my skin. I tried making lotion with and it hardened back (which I read it would), but that makes it difficult to use. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying the extra versus other raw organic shea butters sold here because this one is definitely better quality! For some reason, the other butter I bought BROUGHT mild eczema and dry skin back on the my chest and decolletage which immediately went away with this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used it to make sunscreen and deodorant for my sensitive skin and I workedgreat. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from three different vendors on Amazon and this is by far the very best shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased. It is unrefined but it is clean, no straining. It has that shea odor, but it isn&#x27;t as strong as others. It is so easy to work with compared to the other brands. Easy to scoop and measure. I love it. It does cost a bit more than others, but not much and it&#x27;s worth the extra money for sure. I use it to make lotions, body butters, creams, and salves. And just to be sure the good review goes to the right vendor and not some general feedback on a general product, this came from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> smooths my skin and mixes with a variety of things to make even the roughest elbows soft :) I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to make a few home made items.  My favorite is her home made shaving cream.  The shea butter is the base of the shaving cream.  It makes shaving very smooth and she puts some lavender and mint in it to make it smell really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that is very oily and sticky, which makes the shaving very smooth but the clean up is a bit difficult.  The shea butter sticks to the blade and sticks to the sink, so we have to essentially scrub the sink after shaving, but other than that it is really better than any store bought shaving cream</li>
            <li> I love it, i&#x27;m using it everyday as moisturiser for my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;And my skin became so soft, will come back in two months for an update&lt;br /&gt;But for now things are looking good</li>
            <li> Beautiful! i use this shea butter from head to toe, my hair my face, body! my skin is so soft! my husband keeps giving me compliments on how soft my skin is:-)) Love it!</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the real deal! I use the butter as a part of by body massage regiment and it works. My skin is soooooo soft and smooth. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feelings like a huge grease ball. I plan to use half and make a whipped butter with some of my natural oils. The other half I use in my hair as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  I bought this to make body Butter. This product has a great consistency and blended well. I was able to measure appropriately and whip into a phenomenal body butter that my  skin truly loves!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! We got exactly what we wanted and ordered exactly when we wanted it! Very good value for the money!</li>
            <li> Im just starting to make my own homemade deodorant and some balms, after searching amazon for good Shea Butter i&#x27;ve deceded to purchase this brand due to the good reviews, I havent tried it yet but the customer service on its own deserves five stars as ive received two emails since purchasing the shea butter just asking about how i like the product. I really appreciate companies that take the time to ask customers about their opinions. Would definately purchase from this company again if i needed more Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Nice Prodact all mr family use it&lt;br /&gt;my advice to use this organic raw Prodact I will buy it more&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp;best regards</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. This is the real deal. Smooth and creamy. No debris. Will repurchase. God Bless✔️ The Lord provides❤️</li>
            <li> the only thing wrong with my order is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a proper container. but other than that, i will ordering this again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve started to use it as a cream, it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice when used on the skin and made into a leave in product for moisture but i hated the smell. it took a few days after making the leave in smell to change, it&#x27;s pretty pleasant now and the smell is less strong and more like the coconut oil and avocado oil used in my leave in. it&#x27;s nice and very helpful for my hair with twist outs and braiding.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  Used to make sun screen and lotions.</li>
            <li> So great. They have improved both the consistency of the product and the packaging since last year when I bought this. They are serious about shea butter!</li>
            <li> Were can I start? First let say thank you to the amazing team at  Better Shea Butter.. Not only for selling this amazing product, but to their attentive customer service, you can really see that they care about their customers and the quality of the shea butter they produce.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking at this shea butter for some time on amazon.com. Hoping it was of good quality. I had ordered another&lt;br /&gt;shea butter from a different seller in the past.  But when I received it, I was not impressed at all, after attempting to nourish my skin with it, so I put it aside.&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered my shea butter from better shea butter here on amazon.com, I was impressed already by how fast it had arrived.&lt;br /&gt;And OMG! when I opened it up, smelled it  and felt it, I knew it was the one!!! This stuff is like Gold.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling after applying it directly to my face and skin after a shower.. was so relaxing and nourishing to my skin. I felt rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I dislike about this wonderful shea butter, I would highly recommend this to family and friends and anyone inquiring about  shea butter. It is the best and of high quality. You will not be disappointed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again from only this seller. Amazing Shea Butter!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly A Faithful Customer,&lt;br /&gt;Tonette.J</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. A little goes a long way.  It will make your skin so smooth. Not greasy at all. The scent is nothing special, but mix with a drop of coconut oil and it&#x27;s divine. Nice packaging, too!</li>
            <li> Much better than any other shea butter I&#x27;ve used. It has a very nice consistency, smooths on easily, and softens the skin.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product, though quite expensive. I bought this to use in a recipe for natural deodorant and it worked great and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> made so many lotions,deodorant, with this, I use it every day. smells good enough to eat, it is the base for hand and lip cream and my favorite deodorant recipe.</li>
            <li> Nice Shea Butter. I love to make homemade bath and body products. Knowing this is organic makes it even better.</li>
            <li> i wish it had nicer smell</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product.  Delivery was quick and follow-up good.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived quickly and was in very good condition. I used it to make an organic body butter that turned out great. The shea butter was everything promised. I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  It feels so good just smoothed over the skin.  Good quality, and great seller.</li>
            <li> I use the shea butter as 1 of my ingredients in my lotions I make for my business. The lotion is liked by my customers. So I like your product.</li>
            <li> Great product and very happy with the follow up from the seller. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> First time ever buying Shea butter but I gotta say this stuff is GREAT. Is, what I imagine, REALLY great quality. Great seller and SUPER fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. I use it on my face morning and evening. It is so gentle and healing. Also, it helps heal skin irritations. Love it.</li>
            <li> very pure. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just made my first batch of whipped Shea butter and coconut oil tonight with this raw shea butter. It came out better than anytime I&#x27;ve made it. Nice packaging and came in a timely manner. I&#x27;m the ultimate penny pincher so I wish it were cheaper.....Definitely will order again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this rich moisturizer (Shea Butter--organic) to use in my homemade soap bars.  Shea Butter is used as a healthful product to smooth and hydrate dry and irritated skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t think of making my soap without this--and the fact that it&#x27;s totally organic makes it that much better!  It arrived at my home as promised.  Packaging was great!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and feels delicious on my skin! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Very good quality, smell great and feels good on the skin! I&#x27;m bought mine awhile ago and I&#x27;m still using it now so it last a long time! This Shea butter is definitely on my repurchase list!</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Awesome product! Would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality shea butter, thank you! it came well-sealed in a foil, re-sealable bag, soft and fresh. Good purchase, I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I absolutely love this Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Quick arrival, good quality, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This is quality Shea -- clean and fresh. I use it everyday and it keeps my skin soft and supple. Shea Butter comes from the Karite tree—meaning “TREE OF LIFE”  It has anti-inflammatory properties; protects against sunburn; and can aid in healing minor cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> This is great shea butter.  It was what I had hoped it would be.  Deffinately would order again.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Good colour, clean, no debris like some I&#x27;ve bought~ Very little smell if any (I can&#x27;t quite remember... I made a salve and used coconut oil that is really smelly:) I will buy this product again definitely! Oh and it comes in the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; amount of packaging also... Paper bag, easy to re wrap, plastic inside...not big hard plastic case, hard to store and tough to recycle~</li>
            <li> Giving this a 3 star for the seller. I had to return this product because I got a nasty strepth infection after using the product. I only got blisters on the spots I.used this product. I had to return it and the seller and Amazon were great. Customer service really made up for the product failure.&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FyI I have eczema and a severely compromised skin barrier so Im susceptible to infection more so than other people. This is probably a good product but I just couldnt use it.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and fabulous price!</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used another brand of unrefined Shea Butter from Amazon, with which I was not disappointed, enjoyed very much and used every scrap of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is better.  Creamier, richer... so happy I purchased this.  A step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase from here out.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this Shea Butter this is my 1st time purchasing this and I will again when it runs out. I have natural hair so I use it in Shea Butter mixtures</li>
            <li> I really, really love this shea butter.  For moisturizing my skin, I mix it with organic coconut oil and/or my favorite scented lotions. What better endorsement than having men compliment you on your soft skin!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived quickly and was packaged in plastic wrap.  I cut off part of the brick and transferred it to an old jar to make it easier to access.  The butter is not as hard as I was expecting, which makes it very easy to take some off and melt in my hands while spreading it.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but it seems to be working.  I only use it in the evenings to slather on my feet, legs, elbows and other dry patches, and then let it soak in during the night.  The scent is mild, nutty.  I was not able to download the free recipe book, but the company said they would email it to me.</li>
            <li> Did not get the ebook but I don&#x27;t  do computer very well.&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Butter is great. I wish I had a better container for it. I did not think about it coming like a big hunk of butter in platic  bag. Great stuff though. No smell so I am going to try Mango next and hope it has some fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE RECIPE BOOK! THANK YOU! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we will ever switch to any other Shea Butter... Thanks for a great product. Keep up the good quality.</li>
            <li> Love it ! :-) Can&#x27;t wait to try it with a recipe</li>
            <li> Must have !This really helps me moisture my face without break out specially that I am on accutane. It&#x27;s also lightened scarring . Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It is bigger than I expected and very high quality shea butter. I will DEFINITELY order again! Isabella was a dream to work with: when there was a delivery issue because my Amazon account had the wrong zip code, she immediately sent it directly to me with her apologies and a free e-book of recipes so that I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to make my homemade body butters. Thank you Isabella, this stuff is awesome and so are you!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I use Shea butter for making all types of lotions &amp; sunscreen. Well packaged &amp; easy to use. Would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far I love it. First time using unrefined. Was neatly packed and sealed. It was very soft and not brick like some butters.  Only issue is if it was already diluted with oils because when it melted in my hands, it was more oily than shea I am used to getting.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> I liked the Shea Butter and it was just what I expected. I would say; it felt a little light (less than 1 lb.).</li>
            <li> Great service with good recipes for an awesome price!!!!</li>
            <li> Really good product! I&#x27;m so glad to have found this for my DIY recipes!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, even comes with a recipe book!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, its super smooth I finally found a good shea butter better than Coastal Scents brand, &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product.  I was able to blend my additional oils with this shea butter without having to melt the product.  When applying the product to you skin, you have to just have to rub your had together a few time to the product would spreads smoothly on your skin.  How this helps.</li>
            <li> This is where I will get my Shea butter from now on. I received it two days after ordering. It is excellent quality and you get great recipes with it. I use it on my body, face and hair.  I have ordered from other places and it did not have the normal smell, it smelled spoiled or odd. This shea butter is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. It works well in all of my lotions and deodorant recipes. I have used this brand multiple times and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter like this so I have nothing to compare it to but I used it to make a body cream. My end results we great!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the shea butter arrived well-packaged and in fine condition. The shea butter is very good quality. I saw some reviews that &amp;#34;it stinks&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think it stinks and neither does my boyfriend. It has a nutty smell. You do have to get used to it but it&#x27;s not unpleasant to me, however I suppose that can be a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I have found this shea butter heals the skin. I LOVE it as a facial moisturizer, because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Coconut oil always made me break out. And I&#x27;ve had skin that could easily break out with most moisturizers, including jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently shea butter is a ZERO on the comedogenic scale of 0 to 5 (coconut oil is a 4 which explains to me why it clogged my pores and broke me out every time I tried to use it). I was a bit wary to use it on my face, but I can now say after use for a couple of weeks that I had no breakout at all, and my skin is looking wonderful - I especially love using it as an eye cream. It really improves the skin around the eye area and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, unlike the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used, which did jack s*** for my eye area. This makes my skin healthy. It heals cuts and wounds. It is great for hands, feet, everything, and ALL natural. I don&#x27;t like the recipes to add it to coconut oil because for me, coconut oil just cheapens the wonderful rich shea quality. I mixed it with lavender essential oil and use it as my face and eye cream. Totally will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;The free ebook comes as soon as you enter the confirmation code from your order, so it was prompt. While I didn&#x27;t use all the recipes, it&#x27;s nice to have some guides on how to mix it up. I will use it with many essential oils for various uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service. I do wish it was a little less expensive, but other than that, 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 30, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pregnant with our first baby (30 weeks - over 7 months) and used this as a pure moisturizer throughout, it has worked nicely, still never causes any breakouts either. I use it on my belly, and any areas where women get stretch marks, after every shower. So far, my skin is supple and never has itched (I hear many pregnant women get itchy skin on their bellies because the skin is stretching). I make sure to drink lots of water and use my shea butter on my skin, and have felt quite comfortable, so I like this a lot. I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple of times, and will certainly order again. Good value, great product, and has many uses! A favorite for me (:causes any breakouts either.

            <li> This item was delivered to me along with 2 Shea butter products which I also loved . I used it as a daily moisturizer mixed with an other oil . I feel that me hands are softer and better looking.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first after reading reviews about the freshness of the product but it is actually very fresh, nice secure package and delivered right on time. Definitely will reorder!</li>
            <li> At last REAL Unrefined Organic Shea Butter! Love it Love it!! Use for beautiful hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Love this products!!! When I opened the package I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be much but it was a lots!! One big block of it!!! I am very satisfied with this one and I will buy from them again!!</li>
            <li> This is first time I purchased an unrefined raw Shea butter. When I opened the package, the smell is nutty and quite distinct, so I think it&#x27;s an original product. Then I visit their website &amp; entered my Amazon order number in their website for the guide book on how to make DiY cream w/ this butter. Although there&#x27;s not much instructions on how to download the guide book, but just enter your order code &amp; email into their website &amp; press the button to have the PDF emailed to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter melt easily using double boiler, and later on when it becomes cream, the mix of Shea butter and coconut extra virgin oil that I made can easily glide on my skin &amp; not grainy as long as you heat it right using double boiler until it melt right. I think the product works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love my shea butter and will be ordering more. You will have to try it to see the big differents in your skin. I wish i had know about this early.Thanks to a friend who told me ab it.out this great item. I have been telling everyone about</li>
            <li> Love to use Shea Butter for body and face moisturizing as Shea Butter is non-comedogenic.  Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate so it takes a toll on my skin.  I bought this product solely because I love the fact that it is organic and I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid products that have too many additives in them.  I also prefer African shea butter products. In the past I&#x27;ve had to really work with the shea butters to get them to a consistency that could be applied directly and smoothly to my skin without clumping.  What I really like about this particular shea butter is that it needs little preparation and goes so smoothly on my skin. I use it raw and also as an additive to my other skin lotions.  It&#x27;s the best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever found.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and really do appreciate the recipes. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love it.  As always, superior quality.</li>
            <li> reasonable price for quality product</li>
            <li> This is my first time using raw Shea butter and I have to say it&#x27;s very nice. It arrived in great condition too. Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast! Smells a little like cheese, but it&#x27;s my first time using it, and someone said that&#x27;s normal. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made some body butter and it turned out wonderful. I would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Good product clean and creamy....does wonder as a leaving conditionner for my hair And cuticles and body lotion ..great mixed with coconut oil for a pré shampoo treatment. ..all natural...</li>
            <li> I made my own stretching creme using this as a base. It was creamy and blended well with the other oils. No lumps or rocks or shells like others were describing. I only used 1/4 of a pound to and it will last me a while. This was a good purchase and I would buy it again. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well. It is exactly as pictured and has a nutty smell. I used this product to make a Shea Butter product/moisturizer for my hair. The Shea Butter mixes easily with other oils. I would definitely recommend this product to it&#x27;s quality and would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th-6th time purchasing this and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. This time, (last week) they changed the shape of the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; based on reviewers requests. The shape wasn&#x27;t too thrilling as I use a measuring cup for my recipes, but it DID turn out to be helpful in cutting it up for the cup. This brand is consistanly flawless, I&#x27;ll never try another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by the quality of this shea butter. I have been using it for about 10 days now. My skin is brighter and more moisturized. The seller has a ebook of recipes for making your own whipped butter, soaps and so on. I&#x27;ve not tried using the shea butter for this yet any  but plan to so soon. Its been fairly cold where I live ,but the butter melts quite easily when you rub it between your hands. It absorbs fast and moisturizes for a long time. The heels of my feet were a little rough and this butter smoothed it within a couple of days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Never bought it before but seems to be a nice product. I mix it with coconut out for lotion and just use a little on my hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality &amp; came on time.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Amazing!! My skin is so soft!! I won&#x27;t be needing my over priced, over scented, over processed lotions any longer- many of them never worked anyway! Love that this is pure &amp; genuinely works.</li>
            <li> Bought this late last October and my experience with the Shea Butter has been without ANY complaints. It was shipped promptly, arrived exactly as pictured (small brown bag with the Shea in it), and the actual butter itself is of great quality (as far as I can tell, anyways.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using yellow Shea for about a year or two now, and while it has worked wonders for my face in combination with African Black soap, the yellow shea butter always felt heavier on my face; even though it would melt fairly easily, it never truly seemed to absorb into my skin, which would frequently leave my face uncomfortably oily. I more or less coped with it over the past couple years, but I finally decided to buy this Ivory Shea to change it up a bit, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. It melts ridiculously fast when you rub it in between your fingertips, and it also absorbs into the skin quickly, without even clogging my pores up! Being that Shea butter is naturally oily, this Ivory Shea has still left my skin oily from time to time, but I mostly blame that on myself for applying too much, or even not applying it evenly on my face. This truly leaves the skin moisturized and soft, and I hope this seller never stops selling this Shea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, I&#x27;m using the butter simply to moisturize my face, and not much else. I don&#x27;t use this for my hair, and I also don&#x27;t even care about the scent (which I truly find to be faint -- its definitely there, but it doesn&#x27;t linger nor does it even fill a room up with its scent.) As my daily face moisturizer, this Shea butter does a superb job of keeping my face moisturized and smooth, which is all I ask for.</li>
            <li> I love my shea butter will be ordering again real soon.  Love the packaging, love the product.  I make lotions with no additives this is a great part of the finished product.  thank you so much, love great skin.</li>
            <li> Really loved the product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;ve recently become a Shea Butter convert. I wanted something reasonably priced that I could use to make a basic whipped Shea Butter lotion, and this is perfect. I mix it with a bit of olive oil and some essential oils that smell nice to me. It&#x27;s the perfect lotion to keep winter skin from feeling parched. The price is reasonable and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: It comes shaped like a brick and in a resealable bag. This wasn&#x27;t an issue for me since I intended to whip it and put it in another container. Though if you wanted to just use it for lotion straight out of the package, the packaging wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue. You&#x27;d just need to pinch a bit off and warm it up in your hands before spreading it on your skin. If you&#x27;re the type of person who wants something that looks and feels more like a commercial lotion, you might want to consider something that has already been whipped and packaged in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, this is exactly what I want when making a basic whipped shea butter lotion for myself. When I&#x27;ve worked my way through it, I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE! It&#x27;s only been about a week or so, but this stuff is amazing! Smells divine, doesn&#x27;t break me out and I have WICKED sensitive skin where EVERYTHING breaks me out! I use it in my hair, on my skin! YAY!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other options on Amazon, I think this is probably the best you&#x27;re going to find. It&#x27;s also much better than what I&#x27;ve seen in local stores, which mainly only sell the yellow shea butter. Comes well packaged in a sealed bag. The Butter is solid more or less at room temperature, but it melts very easily in your hand without heating. Some people mention the smell - well, it smells like Shea Butter. You can&#x27;t have unrefined shea butter without it smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from the last shea butter I bought elsewhere - it&#x27;s soft and crumbly as opposed to a solid mass, but works just as well, maybe even better than the other stuff. I love the resealable bag, and the price is great. The ebook is full of fantastic recipes. I like to use the raw shea butter right on my skin as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m tempted to give some of these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really impresses me is the customer service. This company has been more attentive than any other company I&#x27;ve bought from on amazon. Great follow-up emails, checking to make sure I got the ebook, then sending it to me right away when I asked for it. Natural products like this can sometimes be sold by shady, fly-by-night sort of operations. The service I&#x27;ve gotten so far gives me a lot of confidence in the product and in buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further - this is the shea butter you want.</li>
            <li> This is the first time buying Shea Butter.  I was a little worried about some of the reviews about the scent but I didn&#x27;t actually smell the odor until I started to melt it.  It&#x27;s not a strong odor and wasn&#x27;t offensive to me but I can see where someone might not like it.  After I added my essential oils, I didn&#x27;t even smell it anymore.  I love the way it comes packaged with a re-closeable top.  So easy to handle. Only 4 stars because I really wanted the white, but that was my fault for not reading &amp;#34;ivory.&amp;#34;  Very good on everything else though.</li>
            <li> Creamy and clean.  I make my own creams and this product surpassed all others. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased essential oils recently &amp; decided to try a recipe I stumbled upon in my researching of ways to use my EO&#x27;s. I decided on this company for shea butter from reviews &amp; price. My whipped shea body butter turned out fantastic!  I&#x27;m making more for my whole family! I got a free download from them off more recipes that I plan to try as well! This is good quality stuff!  Super satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Bought this product to make a facial cream with essential oils. The Shea Butter was amazing! Packaged wonderfully. I would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Amazing loved it, I wonder if  better Shea butter could sell bigger  amount of Shea butter. For example 10lb of Shea at once. I use them in my products cuz I know it&#x27;s the best in market so far I&#x27;ve tried so many but this Shea butter is different so pure so natural. I wish I could get I discount when I purchase big amounts.</li>
            <li> This is third time I buy this amazing products.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. Definitely something I will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I use shea butter instead of lotion for  my 3 and 20 month olb babies. I used to buy the pure shea butter from a chain store specializing in cosmetics for a much higher price and not such a user friendly product but because I wanted to make sure what I put on them was natural I dealt with it. I received the raw shea butter yesterday and used it last night , I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone. it has a fine sandy texture that melts within seconds of rubbing it into your hands and it spreads beautifully. I bought five because of the discount offer and was a little afraid that I would end up with 5 lbs of bad product . I am so glad I did now, I love love love this product and intend to use it daily. The seller is wonderful, I received an email from her the day after I ordered it to check on my experience. I think that is such a nice gesture. She just sent me a ebook with properties, other uses and recipes the shea butter can be used in, I can not wait to try them!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fantastic. It is a beautiful texture, color, and scent. I use it as-is and have also used it in my own recipes for lotions, salves, and lip balm. It is amazing. The quality is impeccable. Everyone who has tried the lotion I have made from this shea butter has raved about it. Seems to be a great balance for a variety of skin types and ages. I have combination oily w/ dry patches on my face and trouble with dry patches on my arms. This shea butter has dramatically improved my skin texture and appearance. Very soothing, smoothing, and gives a very appealing glow. My skin is very sensitive, and it&#x27;s wonderful to know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very quickly, and was very well packaged. This is my second time ordering this product - the first batch I ordered lasted for nearly one year and kept perfectly after opening in a sealed ziplock that it came in, kept in a dark, cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely my go-to shea butter for the future.</li>
            <li> I love to apply it on my face! I use it the way it came. I take a little bit of the butter, melt it by rubing and then apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to mix it with other oils. The smell is a little bit strong but I really don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and sensitive skin and it is just perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the shea butter! It moisturizes my skin, leaving it very soft. Furthermore, I have used it to moisturize and deep condition my 4c natural hair and I am very pleased! It leaves my hair feeling very soft and hydrated.  Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter, I use it every night before bed on my face and hands. My skin is glowing the next day!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great product.  We are using it for home made lotion and hair care products with coconut oil and Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only experience with raw shea butter, but I already came back for more!  I used it to make body butter for mother&#x27;s day gifts and it was a hit!  The ivory shea butter does have distinct smell, but it is a mild one.  This is so creamy and smooth.  I loved the texture.  It moisturizes very well and melted down nicely (with no residue at all) to make the body butter.  The packaging was nice, and shipping was fast!  The Better Shea Butter people are wonderful - great customer service - quick response to questions and very polite.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my raw unrefined shea butter!!! My skin is soft, supple and even toned when I use this cream, it&#x27;s like magic! And I can even add a different scent daily depending on my mood with a little essential oil! Thank you Better Shea Butter!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Ivory shea butter!  Others I&#x27;ve used are too yellow but the ivory is much better for fair skin.  I put it all over my face at night and then just wipe it off with a warm washcloth in the morning without even using any soaps and my skin feels great!  I also tried making homemade lip balm with it and will never use chap stick again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have irritated, red skin, but one layer of this at night, and my skin is soft, smooth, and healthy! I really feel like I&#x27;m feeding my skin with wonderful nutrients every time I use it.  Highly recommend.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s also totally helped prevent acne and heal my acne scars.  If I have a blemish, I&#x27;ll put a dab of this on at night, and by morning the redness and inflammation is noticeably decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with acne or red, dry, irritated skin, give this a try.  I tried oils like avocado and almond oil, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much and only clogged my pores.  Shea butter is more nurturing, more healing, and much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Quality product but we recieved it smashed pritty bad i know its not fragile but not the point it would be 5 star if the fraight was better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought shea butter before, so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like, but I thought this stuff smelled kinda bad. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell great, but this stuff has a strange smell to it (not sure if that&#x27;s normal, or if it&#x27;s bad quality)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used just a bit so far and it was very good.  I had to contact the owner of the shea butter as I wasn&#x27;t able to get the ebook, she was very helpful I was able to get the book</li>
            <li> I always purchase my shea butter from this company. It is a great product, it does not have that rancid smell other Shea butters do and it is not oily. I mix it with evening primrose or olive oil and lotion my skin, I have seen a reduction in stretch marks and skin blemishes. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> My mom let me try some of hers, and I loved it. Ran out of it and reordered.&lt;br /&gt; Face feels and looks better.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It took me a few days to get used to the smell (not offensive, just pretty strong and unfamiliar), but I&#x27;ve adjusted over the course of a week and now use shea butter on my hair, face, and body. I have not had any experience with shea butter prior to this, but had done some research and knew what to expect from high- versus low-quality shea.  This is high quality.  It is somewhat like coconut oil in that it melts when it comes in contact with body heat, but is quite a bit thicker in consistency--more of a butter than an oil, obviously. My somewhat finicky kinky/curly/wavy hair drinks it up and shea butter keeps it very well moisturized. I have ordered vanilla extract to combat the now-familiar smell, and will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I am now hooked on making my own natural body lotions using this shea butter, and also my own sunscreens - no irritation to my skin - it feels so silky smooth and absorbs well.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Very pure quality Shea butter. We use this to make our own lotion and deodorant. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent quality shea butter.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Good product, very smooth and buttery- used it to make my DIY sunscreen lotion bars.  Will be making body butter too with it.  No smell, good consistency, very creamy.</li>
            <li> I buy this product routinely. It&#x27;s always delivered on time, at a fair price and the quality is excellent. I have no complaints whatsoever and will be a continued customer for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I gotta say. You get what you pay for. This is the most expensive shea butter I have ever ordered, but it is definitely the highest quality. This shea butter was very pliable even before mixing with other oils. My hair loves it. I expect this batch to last a while, but I can&#x27;t go back to the cheap stuff. I&#x27;m hooked and will have to order again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the price is right, easy to use and shipping was great I am going to purchase again</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product. I look forward to trying out some of the recommended recipes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve never used Shea Butter before except in store-bought products. Now I know, you just cannot compare anything from a shelf  to something as fresh as this product. The packaging is minimal &amp; resealable. The product is absolutely fresh smelling but most amazing is the texture-soft &amp; silky, just beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my first home made body butter with it and I could not be happier. I have very high standards for health &amp; body care products and this one exceeded those standards. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recipe if you&#x27;re interested. It&#x27;s a Magnesium Oil Body Butter (I omitted the Bees Wax): [...]</li>
            <li> Perfect for making lotion</li>
            <li> I tried many Shea butters from different web sites and this one is definitely not 100% pure. I formulate my own skin care cosmetics and I have a feelings that it is not pure since it has consistency of a playdough :(</li>
            <li> My son has had crazy dry patches on his elbows and thighs for months.  Nothing was getting rid of it...except when I started using this product.  I started making his lotion and he has since been dry patch free!  Product smells great, lovely texture, great price, and shipped in a timely manner.  I will totally buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is incredible. So pure and creamy. The company is outstanding to deal with, they emailed me to make sure I was satisfies. I will definitely be doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> Used for lotions and love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and looks raw but it is not Yellow. I have had yellow Shea before and this just regular ivory. I bought ivory Shea from same company and compared the two. They r identical. Still good Shea but not what I ordered. I didn&#x27;t subtract stars, it&#x27;s still high quality butter and that&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t return it. Wishing they would send right one :( though....</li>
            <li> Just used this and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Super easy to take out of the package! To read my full review on how I enjoyed incorporating the shea butter into my family&#x27;s skin care routine, click here. http://www.realhousewivesofmotherhood.com/diy-lotion-for-dry-skin/</li>
            <li> Product as described, arrived in a day and a half !</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer. Perfect during pregnancy</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, provided me with the best grade of shea butter to use in a formula for an amazing skin lotion.  Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good quality Shea butter. I use it form lotion bars and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> High quality Shea Butter. I used mine to make a whipped body butter with coconut oil and some EO&#x27;s. With this shea butter the end product was very calming to my skin and the feel is much softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially for my fiancés acne and skin... I now use it for myself, on my hair and skin.. It is a tremendous product and I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes in the cookbook.&lt;br /&gt;Better Shea Butter will be getting more business from me!  :-)</li>
            <li> The product was just what I needed! I would order again.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!! Makes you look good. It was pretty blocky at 1st but I figured it out!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I make my own lotion at home to avoid all the chemicaly laden products that are on the market. I couldnt do it without Better Shea Butter.  I am really happy I came across this brand and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Been using the Shea butter anti-wrinkle cream recipe from their free ebook for almoast a week now. It&#x27;s so rich, but not greasy at all. It absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling smooth. Love it. Can&#x27;t wait to try out more recipes!!!</li>
            <li> So much shea butter for the price. I bought this product because I moved to high altitude and was suddenly waking up with terribly dry and cracked skin around my mouth and chin. I just let it warm in my hand and then rub it onto my face. It does not cause me to break out or become overly oily, just dewy, then I put regular moisturizer on top followed by my makeup. I now only have to use it about twice a week because my skin stays moisturized.</li>
            <li> Needed good shea butter as an ingredient to make butt butter diaper cream when the price of my favorite cjs butter sky rocketed. Ordered this particular one because it was a similar price of another I was considering, except that I would save with free shipping. When I opened the plastic zippered pouch, the stench hit me. I didnt even have to unwrap the actual butter. It was awful- hard to explain but sort of like pork rinds, but stronger. I was shocked and couldnt imagine anyone wanting to use this as a beauty care product, and no amount of essential oils could possibly make it smell decent. Upon researching it, all the descriptions of raw shea butter say that it should smell slightly nutty, earthy, and/or mildly smoky... Not like pig skins. I still dont know if this peculiar smell is how unrefined shea butter is supposed to smell or not. I returned and am trying another company.  Update: Ordered unrefined shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs, and the smell is similar, although not quite as strong. I cant imagine both companies would be selling bad butter, so this must be how shea butter naturally smells. Gave this company a few more stars. I returned both raw shea butters and ordered clay-refined (odorless) shea butter from Brambleberry. NOW I am happy!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it !!! I use this to make a whipped body butter and I&#x27;m obsessed ! My skin is so much clearer and smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter will not buy any other kind. Make a lot of products with this and my EO never disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter! It&#x27;s so malleable and it mixes well when creating a shea butter mix. I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I really love it! Great quality ! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many and no other company compares to the quality of Better Shea Butter! I use this unrefined ivory shea butter to make whipped butter for use on my hair and body. I find that I can use it as a pre shampoo treatment when my hair and scalp is dry and also as a moisturizer between shampoos. The butter moisturizes my skin when I slather it on after a warm shower making my skin felt like velvet! Other butters have irritated my skin and scalp; this butter seems absolutely pure! I have seen other butters listed for cheaper prices at heavier weights but the reviewers complain of debris in the butter! This butter is smooth and mixes well with all of my oils and conditioners resulting it a whipped edition that is fluffy and light like whipped cream! Search no more, you have found the best seller with ultimately the best quality butter here with Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is a perfect consistency. I&#x27;ve bought some from other places that were a bit gritty but this one is smooth and creamy just as it should be.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this, I had only ever used the yellow shea butter by a different company. While waiting for this one to arrive I bought a tiny jar of the white butter at Whole Foods because I was completely out. While I like the other brand, I absolutely LOVE Better Shea Butter&#x27;s brand; it is not whipped (the Whole Foods brand was) and was soft, pliable, easy to apply to my skin. Sometimes I get excited when I get a new product and tend to use too much, so I took it easier with this and it paid off. I only use a small amount for skin moisturization and it does moisturize superbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit to a rather complicated skin care routine as I am a product junkie, but here is what I do to keep my body smooth and soft: argan oil goes on my skin first thing after a shower, then shea butter, then Kiehl&#x27;s body lotion. I have experimented with various butters and oils; coconut oil (too greasy and does not absorb well), avocado butter (good, but greasier than shea), cocoa butter (very greasy but does the job), sesame oil (terrible, does not absorb at all and leaves skin strangely dry beneath the oil), olive oil (will do in a pinch when I am out of argan oil). But shea butter is my all-time favorite because it has a bit of sun protection in it - my fair skin does not burn but turns a nice golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing by using the yellow butter rather than the white! The texture is smoother and does not harden even in my air-conditioned house. It absorbs into the skin even better than the yellow and this brand better than the other white butter I bought (AAA brand). It is a massive amount that I am sure will take me through the summer. And even though temperatures here in the South are in the upper 80s right mow, this chunk-o-butter arrived only soft, not melted though it had been on a carrier vehicle all day. It would have even been okay with me if it were melted but nice that it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some pesky dry skin flaking off my legs (why is it that legs dry out more than arms even when less exposed to the elements? One of life&#x27;s mysteries...). Even with exfoliation and my meticulous skin care routine the condition persisted. However, this shea butter has significantly reduced the problem with just two applications and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses. This is real shea butter, folks - the best I&#x27;ve used. The price is actually a steal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on use for hair or face. My hair is too fine to withstand heavy oils and butters but I bet that someone with thicker or more coarse hair would benefit greatly from it. My skin is pretty oily right now so I can only see myself using it there in the wintertime when skin is drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am greatly impressed with this company&#x27;s customer service. Isabella has been right on top of things with personal emails thanking me for my order and information on downloading recipes.

One of life&#x27;s mysteries...). Even with exfoliation and my meticulous skin care routine the condition persisted. However, this shea butter has significantly reduced the problem with just two applications and I fully expect it to be \\&quot;cured\\&quot; with several more uses.

            <li> This Shea butter has a pleasant slightly earthy aroma and absorbs into skin with ease! My skin is very sensitive and this is a much better alternative than petroleum based lotions that clog pores.</li>
            <li> Hello, This is actually my second purchase of your product.  The first purchase was made through a friend. I Absolutely love your product I tried numerous times to get rid of stretch marks and scars from surgery and dry skin. Once I started using your Raw Shea Butter the darkness of stretch marks &amp; scars start to disappear and my own complexion returned! And my dry skin was now moist and feeling smooth. I love the results. I have referred your product to friends &amp; family. And I will continue to use it. It&#x27;s so worth it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter as a daily lotion, mixing in various oils as I went. A quality product that lasted a long time. I&#x27;d order this again and plan to do so when the drying winter months come back around!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for making salves and sunblock.  It is a beautiful product.  The quality is great, it melts evenly and resolidifies well.  And it has been wonderful with my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I started using this shea butter and my skin is so soft! Better Shea Butter is so much more fresh &amp; creamy than any other brand I&#x27;ve used before. The packaging is also so convenient because it comes in a resealable bag so it is so easy to keep fresh and use daily. And how cool is the free recipe book you get?! There are so many skin and hair products you can make, and it&#x27;s all organic. I will definitely be buying and using this product again, thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love how it melts in ur hands and spreads evenly over your body surface. It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer  as well. I would recommend this product for all your moisturizing needs. It doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I mix the Shea butter with coconut oil and use it on my face, hair, and body. This is a quality Shea butter and much better than the beauty supply stores brands.</li>
            <li> Best Shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used organic ones that were stark white and had no smell. This has a pleasant light nut smell and is so buttery soft. I&#x27;m in heaven using this in my body butters. Will definitely buy the ivory Shea butter again and again!  Update: I&#x27;ve now bought this butter three times in the past year and the quality is still superb!</li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin and I hate using many of the medical grade products associated with it. I recently discovered this shea butter and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. Not only is this priced really well for the amount you get but the customer service is phenomenal. When you rub this product in the palms of your hand  the heat melts the shea and it gives off this wonderful scent. I use it by itself and I have also mixed some with lavender oil to calm me after a nice long bath before bed. I have also used some to make a whipped cacao shea butter. Very decadent and I recommend if you want something natural, that smells great and does a wonderful job moisturizing the driest and most sensitive of skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to just try shea butter since it had become so popular.  I thought it would be hard to rub into my skin, but it&#x27;s not so it doesn&#x27;t take much time to apply.  And, it keeps me moisturized during the day.  I also like how it was packaged (double sealed) to maintain quality. Lastly, it&#x27;s a large block, so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Received my order promptly and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter, its perfect for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t melt it down or add any essential oils or anything to it. I usually just scoop out a small amount after a shower and melt it in my hands and apply while skin is still slightly damp. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now on my toddler and also for myself and it works beautifully. I love the nutty smell and the way my skin feels when I wake up in the morning. I like this shea butter so much that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to purchase any other scented body lotions again. I have finally found the perfect solution for my very dry skin. Excellent customer service from the seller. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a totally natural shea butter product with integrity,  but I found so much more!  The owner of the company is amazing!  She communicates, takes an interest, and is genuinely concerned about you.  She wants you to be happy with her product and gives you resources for you to enjoy the shea butter to its full potential.  When I told Isabel, the owner, about the natural way I cleanse my face, she was very interested and wanted to know more.  She then wrote a blog about it and referenced my name.  Her customers are her partners.  I hope she branches out into other natural products.  I would definitely buy from this lady!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will be reordering from this seller!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! We&#x27;ll definitely purchase more. Use it to make a soothing balm , with other ingredients, for my Frenchie</li>
            <li> I like to make my own lotion and this stuff really is a nice texture and quality. Pretty decent stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this Shea and I will only buy this brand, I&#x27;ve been burned a few other times on the quality, skimped on weight etc. This is perfect and feels amazing on your skin. Thank you for having a high quality product:)</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever purchasing shea butter! I looked at MANY reviews, looked at the packaging, and the pricing of course. I went with this brand because of the high reviews of being creamy. AND THAT IT IS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked exactly like it showed It was packaged in the brown bag which was a zip lock top (although the bag was a little wrinkled like it had been handled a few times passing it from point a to point b). There was the brick of Shea Butter inside and I pulled it out and felt firmly soft (does that make sense?). I opened it right away and scooped some out with my finger and WOW!!! First the smell is HEAVENLY, the consistency is thick, buttery creamy goodness!!  It smells good enough to eat and well, I tried just a bit and it smells better than it tastes! LOL It is thick and creamy, however its very coating (I don&#x27;t want to say waxy, because it&#x27;s not that but the way it coats (or holds in moisture) seems healing to me- I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a beautiful ivory color and it just felt gorgeous!! There were no imperfections, just pure shea butter goodness all wrapped up in a package!!  I&#x27;m thrilled with my decision!</li>
            <li> Just used this in a homemade body lotion recipe and I really like it so far. After melting the ingredients, it all solidified again into a nice cream lotion. I will totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, I love to make this into body butter (3-1 ratio of shea butter to coconut oil, stir and add your favorite essential oil). My husband was shocked when I bought a pound, but we went through it in less than 3 months!! Personally prefer the ivory shea butter over the yellow, as it is noticeably softer on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I enjoy the product and have used it mostly for hair care. I melt it down a little..personal preference but good overall.</li>
            <li> I do not like the scent</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in body butter. The smell is so awful and strong. No way you can add enough essential oils to cover it. Such a waste :-(</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter -- soft and very easy to work with. Was the perfect base for my homemade body butter! Would highly recommend and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will be ordering another batch. I used it to make my own eczema cream with essential oils. Perfect!</li>
            <li> The shea butter I bought is great! I already made my pregnant sister in law a butter for her growing belly and I plan to make more healthy gifts for friends and family. I bought shea butter once before and this one seems more soft and wasn&#x27;t as hard to scoop like the other one.</li>
            <li> I made some simple lotion bars using this Shea butter as one of the ingredients. I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s packaged nicely, looks and smells great, has the perfect texture.....  It&#x27;s working just fine in my skin cream recipe! I have been using shea butter on my skin consistently for 2 months now and see a big improvement! I will definitely order this again! Great quality and a great price! Thanks, Isabel!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I have tried Shea butter from a lot of different sellers and this beats them all with respect to Quality. I would definitely recommend this to friends and buy this again after I use up my current batch.</li>
            <li> Quality Shea butter.  Already gifting this to family this holiday. My skin is being transformed. I don&#x27;t mix it with anything. I put some in a small container for daily use. I also use on my face at night.</li>
            <li> I love it. And mixes well with the other oils.it smells nice. I tried other shea butter and this is one of the best shea butter I tried so far.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter. I use it a moisturizer and to make other self-care products such as my homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter the very next day after it had shipped, which is fantastic. When I opened it up, it was exactly like the description said it would be. Its a beautiful ivory creamy color and melts superbly into the skin, and it also smells like shea butter is supposed to smell like: an earthy nutty smell which can be masked for the most part with essential oils. I have no trouble with the natural smell though! Overall its some of the best quality shea butter I&#x27;ve found online and I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li> I have a horrible scar from surgery and this has really helped reduce how much my scar stands out. Much more effective than so called shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Previously I had been using Bath &amp; Body Works Shea Butter and got tired of the tiny quantity you receive and the fact it doesn&#x27;t really work all that well.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this and it&#x27;s so much better!  It&#x27;s thicker, has an exotic natural semi-sweet smell to it, and can be used as is from the package.  It puts the B&amp;BW junk to shame.  It comes sealed in plastic in a brick form and, depending on the ambient temperature where you live (it&#x27;s about 70 here right now) it is soft and usable right from the package.  I&#x27;ll be putting it into jars for presentation, however, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to melt it down or anything as it is quite soft as is.&lt;br /&gt;I only need to apply it, literally, once, after I get out of the shower, and my skin stays moisturized all day.  I use lotion on my hands a lot and, with this, I only had to reapply lotion about 3 times the whole day and that was after cleaning and having to really wash my hands.</li>
            <li> Have only used this once in a deodorant recipe but it was great!</li>
            <li> It was super good. It was not grainy as I&#x27;ve had before with other companies. It was melted when I got it because of the summer heat...but that&#x27;s to be expected in these temps. It firmed back up &amp; was good to go. No problems whatsoever. Great smell!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing. It is light and crumbly (in a good way!) and rubs in to the skin with no stickiness. Smells great and has a super light color- just as pictured.</li>
            <li> These people contact you right away and thank you for buying their product. Then they send you a free ebook with recipes. this was a gift and I will be ordering my own next. I put a little bit on my hands that have very bad dry patches and they are healing nicely after just one application, I cannot wait to try the recipes and buy my own!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the Customer Service at Better Shea Butter.  They contacted me to check on quality, if I was happy, etc.  Felt like the good old days of great customer service.  Included is an e-Book of Shea Butter recipes which I plan to try.  Otherwise I just use &amp;#34;straight up&amp;#34; on my skin.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Mixed it with your mango butter! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Used this shea butter to make whipped body lotion and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Just tried this in a lotion bar. It is divine! Definitely the easiest to work with, and the nicest feel of any shea butter I&#x27;ve tried. Thank you for taking such care in choosing the best. It melts right away and added the perfect amount of fat to my bars.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I made shaving lotion and I have to say I will never buy shaving cream from the store again! You even get a recipe ebook when you order this product. Customer service is awesome as well. I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t purchase Shea from Amazon because of past experiences of rancid Shea Butter. I decided to just give this a shot and to my surprise this was the softest Shea I had ever felt before. Everything I had previously had was almost rock solid and had to be melted down in order for me to use it. Will purchase from this company again, great stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, exactly as described. Love the manual and recipe booklet. Highly recommend this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotion. I mixed the shea butter and coconut oil together. It works so much better than store bought lotion! I want to get some raw cocoa butter to mix in with the next batch.</li>
            <li> This worked wonderfully as a moisturizer but it smells kind of like play dough. I don&#x27;t know if all shea butters normally do though.</li>
            <li> I decided to start making my own body butter and other lotions and most recipes have Shea Butter as its main ingredient. This butter came in a double sealed bag (sealed plastic, then heat-sealed resealable organic-looking bag) and was a very nice, solid block that I could easily cut in 4oz doses to make my recipes. This shea butter is creamy and looks very fresh, and unrefined is definitely the way to go. I was able to see results on my skin immediately after using it and I am very happy I found this organic product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, this shea butter comes with a free Recipes eBook that has awesome recipes and tips for acne, eczema, stretch marks, dry skin, etc. It saved me a lot of time looking around the web and the Whipped Shea Butter recipe they have is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter due to the ratings that other buyers had left and I was not disappointed.  It is very smooth, clean and has a light scent.  I made our family&#x27;s deodorant and will be using it for more products soon.  Will order again as I am very satisfied with the quality, the price and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! My 3 year old daughter suffers from severe eczema, and finding a great quality all natural moisturizing product is difficult because so many things can cause stinging or burning. This product allows for a great amount of moisture. We use it at night mostly, I put a generous amount of shea butter all over my daughter, then put wet cotton scratch me nots on (cotton underclothes that cover her from foot to neck including hands) then I put dry jammies over top of the cotton ones. This really helps the shea butter to fully absorb into her skin. By morning she is soft and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I never knew about!&lt;br /&gt;So glad someone told me about Unrefined Organic Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it takes a little bit more time and work to apply it to all the areas you desire because of it&#x27;s butter form, but it is way better than any amount of lotion you could ever use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pregnant right now and am doing my best to avoid stretch marks by any means possible and this is indeed a great product for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  I made a lotion using this and olive oil and it lasts all day long.  Plus the customer service through Better Shea Butter is wonderful.  I emailed them with a question and they responded right away and were very helpful.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Very good shea butter! Perfect for use in winter and they are so much cheaper compared with other organic shea butter you can find anywhere, with excellent quality too!</li>
            <li> Just I could not download the recipe book.</li>
            <li> ***Update***   I was contacted by the seller who explained what normal shea butter should look, feel and smell like, and she helped me ascertain that this second order batch is probably not okay (my judgment based on the smell more than anything else).  They are making accommodations to send me a replacement product within 24hrs!! Now thats excellent service and I am happy to up the review to a 4! Would give a 5 but for tracking purposes I think they need to see a 4 to review customer feedback.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am writing this review hoping that the seller will respond to my email which I sent them in regard to this product...I will update my review when I hear from the seller (that will tell me alot about their customer service too!)  I would give 5 stars based on my first order of this product back in Feb 2015.  But my second order this month has been so bad that I have to give an overall rating of 2...I hate leaving bad reviews on a whim, but my experiences are so vastly different:(  I first ordered the Better Shea Butter &amp;#34;100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter - African Grade A Ivory&amp;#34; back in Feb 2015.  The product arrived in a brown bag, in which the butter was placed in a ziplock bag.  I loved the packaging.  The product also was an off yellow color and had a very nice, pleasant, mildly nutty smell (almost a bit like a very pleasant and light licorice smell).  The product was smooth was no grainy or rough texture.  I liked it so much I then re-ordered the product earlier this month.  I was going to write a review after finishing the first pack but then thought perhaps I should wait to see how my second experience is with this product. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I am SO disappointed with what I received.  First off, the re-order product was not in a ziplock, but rather in a regular plastic that when opened could NOT be resealed. Secondly, and worst of all, the product smells terrible - it smells like burned rubber...i dont know what exactly but &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; is the definite vibe!  It is so off putting even my boyfriend has commented on how bad it is.  To add insult to injury, the product is very grainy in texture and not smooth at all.  Also, the color is more grey than yellow.  I am utterly confused about the inconsistent packaging as well as the inconsistent (and in my opinion), inferior quality of the second order.  Why has the color changed from pale yellow/cream to greyish cream?? Why has the smell become so pungent and unpleasant? Why is the packaging not in ziplock? Why is the texture now rough and grainy??  From what I see on Amazon reviews, it seems my second order matches complaints other customers had, which then seemed to be improved upon, resulting in the improved packaging changing to ziplock and the product smell and texture being improved on...so have I received an old batch of the previous product before improvement?????  If this were how it always smelled and felt, then I would not complain, but there is a vast difference between the two orders...this product has been the only thing that works for me (keeping breakouts away, skin smooth and well nourished)....and even though I like it, the negative factors right now make it very difficult for me to even use the product (the smell and texture especially)  As said, I will update my review when I hear from the seller</li>
            <li> Good product. Good service. 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from this company in 6 months! Will be a return customer and a few more months!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter to make cold process soap with great results. I always use up every ounce of my shea butter... after I measure the amount that the recipe calls for, I rub my hands and legs with the butter that gets stuck in my utensils, leaving my skin very soft and comfortable. My final soap bars are very moisturizing. Product comes well packaged and the butter is very fresh and clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service! I love their recipe ebook, too. I&#x27;ve never used Shea butter before, but my first attempt ( sunscreen) turned out well, so I&#x27;m eager to try more recipes.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I started looking for more natural alternatives to store bought beauty products and came across Better Shea Butter. The quality is terrific and I have noticed a real difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve tried several of the recipes in their e-book and they work! I will never buy another face cream, body lotion or lip balm again! The lotions absorb very well into my skin and have left it feeling soft and healthy. I encourage you to try their shea butter out and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> i use it just like that  its so light yet leave my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;for the colder month i mised it with Coco butter and Almond oil to prevent my  skin from over drying. Summer time i use it as is since its so light</li>
            <li> I make body butters and this Shea Butter is the best I had used. Thank you for such great product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd go round with Shea Butter. I had the yellow one before, but now I&#x27;m trying the ivory colored one. You only need a little to put on your face. This will last me a long time, so I&#x27;m excited about that. The only thing is it has a little nutty smell (normal), so I use it as my base. I then cover that nutty smell by applying a little bit of coconut oil on my face (which is also good for skin). After that, I apply a sunscreen moisturizer with at least 30 SPF. The seller also reached out to me about my purchase, which was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! I&#x27;ve been using it in a mix for a facial and body lotion, and it works as a great base to add essential oils in. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> The first two orders I received of this product where perfect – nice and moist with a firm consistency.  However, the second two were entirely different – dry, and crumbly.  After returning the first bad order, I expected the replacement order to be like the first one’s, but alas, it was a disappointing dry and crumbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notified the company of this issue, and below is their response. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying from them anymore.  I&#x27;ve since tried Cleopatra&#x27;s Shea Butter, and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you for the information. I am sorry the shea butter wasn&#x27;t consistent, unfortunately real unrefined shea butter comes with a price, which is getting different batches depending on the harvest. We process all of them the same way, and even if some look more grainy, we sell them because the end result is, in our opinion, the same. But I completely respect you opinion and hope you find a supplier you like.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very surprising, and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard Shea butter was a good moisturizer and boy am I glad I did. I have chronic dry skin and this is helping so much. I use this after showering. I take a nickel size amount and rub it between my hands. It starts out looking like a putty and then becomes a creamy consistency. So a nickel size amount for elbows and knees and quarter size  for full legs  It glides on the skin like an oil. A little goes a long way if you use it like that. The recipe eBook is very helpful also the customer service was great. The owner inquired about my satisfaction with the product and answered questions I had. If you like a nutty smell you will definitely enjoy the light aroma but don&#x27;t worry its not lingering. Next I will try this on my face and hair. Have only used it a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t tried the recipes yet but I think I made a wise choice with this product .&lt;br /&gt;P.S I purchased the ivory but plan to also try the yellow.😊</li>
            <li> I was very interested in this product since I had in the past purchase Shea butters products, but they all came with a sent that I was not to crazy about and other list of ingredients.  So I decided to try the 100% real stuff and I made an incredible lotion not only for me, but for my daughters.  And believe me making it your self there is nothing in comparison.  I did mix it with real 100% raw cocoa butter and some coconut oil and some essential oils of my liking and those of my daughters liking as well and wow!  Our skin felt like it had never had before loved it!!!  Will always purchase from this vender I had a problem and she quickly took care of it very kind and gracious.  Here is the lotion I made my daughters.  Have fun!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint Chocolate Whipped Body Butter&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup of organic cocoa butter (where to find cocoa butter)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup organic shea butter. You can also substitute another 1/2 cup cocoa butter. It will be a smidge less \\&quot;light\\&quot; when whipped up, but it is amazing! (where to find organic mango butter, where to find shea butter)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup coconut oil (find coconut oil here)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup of jojoba or a mild olive oil. Almond oil can also be used but it will decrease shelf life because it is more vulnerable to oxidation. (Find jojoba oil here)&lt;br /&gt;1-2 teaspoons peppermint essential oil, depending on preference (where to find peppermint essential oil)&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons pure cocoa or cacao powder. If you would prefer a \\&quot;white chocolate\\&quot; version that is not a bronzer, substitute arrowroot powder or non-GMO cornstarch. (Where to find cacao powder, where to find arrowroot powder, where to find non-GMO cornstarch)&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons naturally derived vitamin E, optional (Where to find naturally derived, non-GMO vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;How To Make Whipped Body Butter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and fitting a smaller bowl inside. The inside bowl needs to be able to hold at least 4-5 cups of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Using a double boiler or a pot of boiling water with a smaller pot fitted inside, melt cocoa butter and mango butter over a low simmer.&lt;br /&gt;Add coconut oil and melt until completely liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Remove cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture from heat.&lt;br /&gt;Measure 5 teaspoons of cocoa powder into a small bowl and gradually add several tablespoons of jojoba/almond/olive oil. Mix thoroughly and then add to cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture along with remaining jojoba/almond/olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;Place mixture in chilled bowl (which should still be resting above the ice bowl) and allow to cool for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Remove mixture from ice bath and whip until stiff peaks form. If after a few minutes it does not seem to be thickening return the bowl to the ice bath and whip there.&lt;br /&gt;Store in an airtight jar - Amber or cobalt are best but a clear jar is fine if kept out of direct sunlight (which promotes oxidation).</li>
            <li> I started using this brand of raw shea butter on my face, neck and chest after my dermatologist prescribed me something to penetrate the dermis that was full of sulfates and other chemical ingredients. After years of using products like vitamin C serum and natural wrinkle products this raw shea butter has diminished fine lines and dark spots better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it on my entire body and have never been more impressed with any face and body product ever.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I used this to make an all natural deodorant and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> It is great. Perfect for my diy lotions and make up. I am looking forward to learning more recipes to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Mild scent. Well packaged. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great company and great products!</li>
            <li> Feels and smells really nice.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> First time buyer from this vendor and I am very satisfied. The order came on time. The vendor sent me an email to make sure that everything was alright. The product comes with great recipes. Since I received the product I am trying the recipes that apply to my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Shea butter on my body even on my face!! It is so moisturizing. I am an African, being exposed to Shea butter when I was a child! Now I am thinking: what was I thinking and I put the Shea on the side for something else!! Love it, natural with multiple properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely spreading the word around.</li>
            <li> Love it! The smell of pure shea butter is a bit strong for me, so i combined it with some coconut oil and almond extract and whipped it into a fabulous body butter!  My skin feels like silk!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best Shea butter around! I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. It is expensive so I tried cheaper Shea butter and it doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I had been suffering from allergic reactions to almost everything I put on my face, including items from the dermatologist, until I tried this. It is gentle, smells slightly nutty and makes my face feel and look much better. I also use it to make my whipped body butters. Would recommend this product to anyone. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of using organic shea butter on my skin, but this HANDS DOWN has to be the best i&#x27;ve ever tried. My skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been since I&#x27;ve been using raw shea buttter soap to wash head to toe, grapeseed oil to moisturize, and this raw shea butter to seal in the moisture and add the softest texture to my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. Works great for my moisturizing cream I make.</li>
            <li> I did all the standard research and decided to give this supplier and product a try.  Well - I have to say I just love the product!  As a surfer and fisherman, I need a product that&#x27;s effective on my dry and sun baked skin.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive creams my wife buys, but by far, Shea Butter is the best product I&#x27;ve found - I&#x27;m sold on Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I made a pain cream for my dogs arthritis pain in her foot and it seems to help. It mixed very easily and feels wonderful!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and wonderful product</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is wonderful for my homemade body butter. It blends perfectly. The seller also followed up with me and reminded me of the eBook with awesome recipes in it! I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. Great price and product</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Quality Product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter as a moisturizer for my skin. When I received the package, I was excited to open it and begin using it. I must say that this Shea butter was soft and easy to apply. It met all of my expectations and then some! I did not receive the link with the free downloadable recipe book with my package as stated in the thank you email that I received when I purchased Shea butter. However, I did receive 1) a thank u email for making my purchase 2) a follow up email to confirm that I received my product and that I was pleased with it. I responded to one of the emails to inform Isabella (the owner) that I never received the link and she replied quickly with an attachment full of recipes! I have found my new go to place to order Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Well I was so excited and anxious to receive my Organic Shea Butter and when it got here it was just as the description stated it would be ivory white, soft in a plastic bag and there is no hair, mold , sticks or any other thing other than the product and the smell it what it should be for something being organic, raw and unrefined because there are no fragrances or additives added so I expect it to smell like this. So now I&#x27;m going to try it for about a week and see how it works and it.</li>
            <li> I use it with Glysolid Glycerine cream,, Vernal Skincare and 2-3 drops of Lemon Oil.... LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Great Moisutrizer in the combination above</li>
            <li> This unrefined ivory Shea butter by better Shea butter is  awesome thanks for selling a great product.</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly, good packaging. Many more uses for this than I originally thought! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I have made. While the quality of items I choose are all good it seems that the butters and other items Better Shea Butter sells always top my expectations!  The shipping is always fast too!</li>
            <li> repeat purchase. i use on my face rotating between argan oil. if you put on legs overnight you will have silky legs in am when you shave. i also use it on my scalp</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just as described.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Shea Butter and the products I have made with it so far!!!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I have some stretch marks from the past, and I can see them fading after applying it for a week...which totally exceeded my expectation. I mixed some with coconut oil and use it as my evening facial cream and works really well for me. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter. Made my own lotion - I love it for my feet. When I apply it to my feet I usually put booties on right after. It really helps my dryness.</li>
            <li> Makes an amazing body butter.  2 parts Shea butter to one part olive oil and beat as it is cooling.  Add essential oils when still liquid if desired.  Should look like frosting when done</li>
            <li> I made my own shea body butter from this stuff, added a few essential oils and it was LUXURIOUS.  It worked really well for a friend going through chemo as well.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter. I love the recipe ebook that is included with it.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I ordered worked great to make a body lotion. The product came with support from the seller in an ebook of recipes. Highly suggested.</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of body butter with it and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Got this and used it to make body butter. Seemed really pure and natural to me! I didn&#x27;t notice an overwhelming smell or any discoloration. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like this product and I bought it twice so far THX</li>
            <li> I had allergic reaction to many moisturizer products and set out to find some solution.  I came upon the reviews of the Shea Butter in this thread.  It turns out to be one of the best things I have ever bought.  No more allergic reaction.  The skin looks clear.  However since the butter is very thick, it is advised by some frequent users of the shea butter on Youtube to exfoliate your skin.  I use a cotton cloth and natural soap to wash my face as a way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have never purchased before but will be sure to purchase again. I bought it in hopes of healing my cracked heels and this stuff is actually doing the job where so many other products have failed. I have been using it every night on my feet, legs and face. In only 2 days I could tell a significant difference. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Quality stuff! Great service too. I received an awesome recipe book that I can&#x27;t wait to dive into. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Liked it - was a little hard to measure out of the bag but no complaints and did its job! Did not smell smokey or rancid like some of the other comments indicated.</li>
            <li> While this is a good product, I cannot understand a price increase from December 2015 of $14.95 to January 2016 of $25.00.  There are also many other similar competing products that are not atrociously expensive.</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter and have tried a number of different shea butters over the years and this one is by far the best! It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and smells amazing! Also the packaging is very nice. I will continue to buy this, thanks for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, faster than I imagined. I placed the order on Saturday evening, product arrived on Tuesday. Very happy so far, I already made a home skin product from the e-book with recipes and I love it. There is so much shea butter in the package that will probably last a good 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> This product was rich and creamy, exactly what I wanted.  If you have very dry skin, this is the remedy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter. I&#x27;ve been using a common brand sold at my local beauty supply store for the past year but I wanted to search for a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; brand!😆 Well the search has stopped here! I&#x27;m in love with this creamy texture. I mix it with argan oil and put it on my face after my bath and I don&#x27;t have any clogged pores!! That&#x27;s pretty miraculous considering I have combination skin. I do need to use a mild soap to remove any excess oil in the morning, I think it&#x27;s a little to heavy as a daytime moisturizer. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been oil cleansing with Jamaican black castor oil and coconut oil (2:1 ratio) and my skin looks gorgeous. I also mix this Shea butter with coconut oil and argan oil (equal parts Shea butter and coconut oil with a few drops of argan oil) to use on my knees, elbows, and feet. My husband has a bald head and he uses it morning and night. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this brand of Shea butter, look no further!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Shea butter expert but this seems pretty legit. I personally love it. I&#x27;ve used with essential oils in body creams and even on my face with severe dryness. I do love how it just melts into your skin. I would definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> I like the color and nice smell of this unrefined shea butter, I have started making my own Whipped Body Butter and this shea butter melts really well and gave me a great lotion. Raw is the way to go for sure, it gives me soft skin in 1/2 the time of the white, refined shea butters you find in most stores. I would recommend this brand and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time ordering shea butter I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. After opening I thought it had a strong odd smell, not the nutty smell as expected and a more grayish color than expected. The texture was nice though. I made some cream with essential oils and thought I did ok.  A couple weeks later I bought shea butter from a different seller and got a batch that is a mild nutty smell, nicer color and is exactly what I expected shea butter to be.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i have used raw shea butter and it is fabulous.  It smooths on the skin and does not leave an oily film. The smell took some getting use to because it is not full of chemically smelling perfumes. I will definitely be buying this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> product is exactly as stated</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels so soft and silky. I reside in Alaska where it is extremely dry and no matter how much I would moisturize my skin was always bone dry. When I received my butter I blended it with some essential oils and I&#x27;ve received so many compliments. It&#x27;s so nice not hearing my teenage daughter calling me super ashy.😁</li>
            <li> This has been the best shea butter.  It mixed well with my oils.</li>
            <li> This last batch seems even more creamy than the last.  I love it.  How do I print the free recipe book?</li>
            <li> I bought it, (never used shea butter before) to try it out and loved it--I will be buying more! I bought a very large plastic container to put the she butter in it, with raw unrefined organic coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, aura cacia tea tree oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oils and mix it in my blender until it was nice and creamy. I use it on my skin and hair. It has a nutty scent though.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this Shea butter. I always buy this shea butter when I do buy some. Love it...</li>
            <li> This product is everything I wanted with none of the stuff I didn&#x27;t.  It makes an excellent moisturizer that lasts all day; I use it all over!  Great price for the quantity and quality.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it raw, it does not melt easily as many have stated it does.  I had to make a batch of whipped shea and coconut oil and that came out great...So four stars just because of that but it is a great product..</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought this stuff because it looked delicious. No, I&#x27;m not going to eat it, but the photos of it looking like fudge just make it so appealing, am I right? You just want to take a bite out of it. It&#x27;s actually edible, but my guess is it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a consistency similar to raw cookie dough. The photos are accurate. I chose ivory because I read that ivory shea butter is higher quality, which I can&#x27;t confirm. When I first got it, I was impressed by the substantial feel and weight; I could tell right away that I have a lot of shea butter here, especially since I plan to use it straight as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, I remove a tiny piece, and I do mean tiny. At first I made the mistake of using a piece about the size of a nickel, and it covered my hands in a thick sheen of oil that I had to wash off. Way too much. Now, I use a piece maybe the size of a pea to do my entire face. It does not go on like regular lotion: you need to warm it a bit before it spreads, which takes maybe 10 seconds, and even then you need to use more force than lotion to spread it around. Sometimes I rub it between my fingers or in my palm, and sometimes I just press a little piece against my face and work it around, letting my face melt it. Ha, face melt. Anyhoo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is an ingredient in many, if not most of the quality moisturizers on the market, and I&#x27;m starting to think that there are only a few key ingredients in moisturizers that really do anything and could work just fine on their own, but moisturizers blend in a bunch of filler ingredients to make it easier to use and save on cost. Shea is one of these, so I figure why not cut out all the filler and use the active ingredient straight? I don&#x27;t know how accurate my speculation is, but I do know that this stuff moisturizes skin, and does it well. You have to work it in and be careful not to use too much, just enough so you can feel it on the skin. In about10 minutes, unless you used too much, it absorbs into the skin, leaving behind a slight sheen that is more matte than many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It lasts a long time, too, keeping my skin soft most of the day. Allegedly shea is a natural UV inhibitor, which if true is a nice bonus, but I don&#x27;t know what sort of SPF it achieves if so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not wonderful, but not bad. It smells a little like slightly rotten vegetables, but not in an overly imposing way, it&#x27;s very subtle (I have to practically stick my nose up to it to really smell it) and the smell can not be detected once it absorbs, at least not per my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up giving chunks of it to friends, and everyone has been impressed with it. At the rate I use it, this brick of shea would last a lifetime. I think it would be fun to use it as a base for making my own moisturizer, adding stuff like essential oil and food coloring maybe. Actually, I&#x27;ve heard that people use it as cooking oil, but I&#x27;m not sure that appeals to me.</li>
            <li> The ivory Shea butter is awesome and my wife loves it.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone seeking a quality topical moisturizer without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> My baby had a angry red rash that several dr&#x27;s said were various types of infections.&lt;br /&gt;Finally a skin dr said it was simply dry and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;We used cetephil first to soak in and then covered him with this lovely Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;His skin recovered in days.&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that Shea is sensitive to the temp in the room.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping itv  warm will make it easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I love it! I use it on my face and although it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell, it leaves my skin feeling smooth. I also use jojoba oil (now foods) along with this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked it and it smelled really was rich there wasn&#x27;t a smell I mean it smelled like shea butter. I will keep ordering it. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product so far. I like how it keeps my skin from drying out. Jury still out. Not quite sure of the consistency only because it&#x27;s not what I remember trying years ago.</li>
            <li> Such good quality! I make lotions bars with this and it really helps my skin in the cold winter. I don&#x27;t know what i did without shea butter all these years and this brand is a really good quality!</li>
            <li> ...as stated in the product description. Luckily, I already had recipes to use this on. Otherwise, the shea butter so far is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I emailed the seller thru Amazon and received a download of the manual. It&#x27;s a great manual full of info and pics. A lot of recipes to try out! Thank you! Also, I&#x27;d already used this shea butter in one of my recipes for skin cream and this butter is really good. It was fresh and had the consistency that it should have. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order this product again. The quality is great and the owner was very responsive when I contacted her about the product.</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brand for making lotion, and it worked beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package the shea was wrapped in it&#x27;s own plastic packaging. (I later tore it all off and replaced it with plastic wrap.) The shea was a nice golden/yellow color, and smelled earthy. (It quickly goes away after you apply it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I definitely plan to order from them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the ivory Shea butter which was delivered within a few working days. I had never used it before so i didn&#x27;t know how to use it or whether i was supposed to store it in the refrigerator or not but the owner Isabella was kind enough to assist me, i was sent an e-copy of different recipes and persisted to know whether i was pleased with the product or not.&lt;br /&gt;Their customer care is surpassing to say the least, as is the butter which leaves a greasy film on (my) skin but is surprisingly quickly absorbed leaving it very soft!</li>
            <li> My first time using raw shea butter. Seems to absorb more quickly than the many store-bought shea butter concoctions I&#x27;ve tried. I made two variations: one mixing just the shea butter and essential oils, the other whipping together shea butter, coconut oil and essential oils. I like the whipped version better because it is a little creamier (and looks nicer for gifting) but both versions are somewhat soft even though my house is a little cool now in the middle of a Minnesota winter.</li>
            <li> There is shea butter, and then there is this shea butter. This is unbelievable for my skin. I use it on my face with [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO NuNutrients - Cucumber Eye Cream]] for unreal results, especially around my eyes. I havent had this young looking skin for a very very long time. (Well, since I was younger, duh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this shea butter and i highly recommend buying it. It truly is a gift from africa! Ill be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product to use in homemade body butters and I must say I was very happy with this purchase.  The shea butter was very fresh, consistency was lovely and easy to use.  It melted perfectly when I made my body butter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using unrefined shea butter for a while, but a little goes a long way so this was my first purchase in several months. I chose this shea butter because from the pictures it looks really fresh and high quality. I am happy I made this choice, it was exactly as I expected and I love the brown resealable bag it comes in.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is definitely super creamy and super thick! I used it for very dry skin on my knees and elbows and it stayed moisturized for a while (more than a day). I also like mixing it with essential oils so it has a nice smell. Not a huge fan of the original smell, but it&#x27;s easy to mix in your own favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how it doesn&#x27;t melt in higher heats, like other lotions and butters I&#x27;ve had with coconut oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a high quality product, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using Shea butter or the past three years and have no allergic reactions or dryness. It melts very easily, soft just like Can&#x27;t believe its butter with more thickness, creaminess in texture. Since purchasing item, been using on face as night cream and the results are amazing! No dryness or flaking yet so supple and firm  since have hsv 1 which produces severe inflammation and redness as well as red bumps. It&#x27;s a great reliever for my symptoms.</li>
            <li> This 8th patch I received seem to be a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;I previously brought 7 of this Ivory Shea Butter from &amp;#34;Better Shea Butter&amp;#34; which I have no problem with but the 8th patch I received smell bad with foul older and tasted so bad.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if is due to temperature that caused during delivery or rather is expired.&lt;br /&gt;And since amazon don&#x27;t accept return for grocery products, I end throwing away and let you folks know about it.</li>
            <li> Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter arrived perfectly packaged and was Not melted. I had some fears it might melt in our heat. It was perfect. I only have one recipe to use the shae butter for a hand cream, so I am excited to down load your instruction booklet. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Received Shea Butter quickly. I&#x27;m a first time user. It is all that the reviews said it was and what I expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter. Shea butter was recommended for my feet and hands as I am going thru chemo. The shea butter and the recipes are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter! I use it in a recipe for a homemade body cream and it has done wonders for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good texture, soft, easy to work with.  Worked perfect for making lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Packaged very nicely. Gave 4 stars because it was not easy to mix, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> I used this to make face moisturizer and as an ingredient in deodorant.  It has performed very well and I have been pleased with the results.  My skin is acne prone and since using this raw butter as an ingredient, my face has been much clearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the Shea Butter by Better Shea Butter. I also appreciate the ebook that was included for recipes using the Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve made the facial moisturizer and my face is loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be making more of the recipes soon.</li>
            <li> not rock hard like many others, informative, good quality and texture</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have ordered twice. Last year I melted it in a sauce pan with some organic olive oil and Lavender essential oil then transferred it to a jar. This lasted the entire season and I still have some as I don&#x27;t use it over the Summer.. Before getting out of the shower I apply a small amount and it really keeps my dry skin in good condition. It has a pleasant light scent which is hard to describe...natural not perfumed. It arrives promptly &amp; well packaged and I feel the customer service is very good too.</li>
            <li> Super smooth! Love this. Wonderful product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from eczema, psoriasis, or any other skin ailment please give this stuff a try. We wasted years and countless dollars on eczema creams, steroid creams, anti-itch creams, etc. for my partner&#x27;s dyshidrotic eczema. We needed to get back to nature and get rid of the chemicals and water based serums that were actually making her eczema worse. Enter this unrefined, organic shea butter and lavender essential oil. I melted the shea in a double boiler, added the lavender and blended it with a hand mixer until it had a whipped consistency. The two ingredient body butter has been one of the best things to come our way. Within a week her hands had cleared drastically and the inflammation, burning, and itching was all but gone. Even if you don&#x27;t have skin issues, it makes a glorious after shower body cream. Our skin drinks it up and stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotions and sunscreen. It melts very well and make a nice smooth lotion. I definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Shea Butter I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea butter from Better Shea Butter and the customer service is outstanding.  I recently made the most awesome sunscreen lotion bars with the Shea butter, And am thrilled with the results - these lotion bars came out firm, but soft and smooth and moisturizing to the skin. - I almost wish I could eat them!&lt;br /&gt; I rarely use sunscreen until I made my own  because there is nothing I like on the market!  I think the high quality of the shea butter was a big factor in the the success of this sunscreen recipe. These sunscreen bars are so pretty / they are in the shape if daisies and would make great gifts.  The shea butter was a pleasure to work with; it has a pleasant smell, and has a nice consistency kind of like the Play Dough I used to play with as a kid- except the shea butter is more luxurious with a very nice snell.!. Better Shea butter is not gritty like some other brands. Thank goodness I found the Better  Shea Butter company  as I did not like any of the other brands I tried.  I have to comment on the customer service ,  and I am very impressed. I had lots of questions and the shea butter lady always responded quickly by phone and email. I am so exited to make lip balm and body butter next .  I just ordered the cocoa butter from Better Shea Butter  and can&#x27;t wait to use it - I think I will try a chocolate peppermint body butter recipe - I&#x27;ll let you know how it turns out !&lt;br /&gt; I just made a batch of vanilla bean body butter with the better Shea butter and I can&#x27;t believe I made it!  It is divine and luxurious and smells heavenly. I went for many years not using body lotion because I didn&#x27;t like any of them on the market- now I can honestly say that I truly enjoy using this product; especially knowing that there are no harmful chemicals. In so excited that I found the Better Shea Butter company!</li>
            <li> Definitely raw shea butter. Packaging was nice. It comes in a plastic bag on the inside in block form. Mine looks just like the picture displayed. A light coco color I guess. The smell is fine. I received it on time. One pound is a lot for me, so this will probably last me an entire year at least. I bought this mainly for lightening some scars that I have so we&#x27;ll see how it pans out.</li>
            <li> In a word, luxurious.  We made lotion and diaper cream with this shea butter and we are happy with the results.  However I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend shea butter for cloth diaper users.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent Service.</li>
            <li> Read most of the review before buying it.  I was very concerned about the bad smell in the reviews.  Mine was just fine! The smell is mild and really acceptable.  Afterall, it&#x27;s natural and should come with some smell!  it is also easily taken out and melt.  I have already use it in my DIY skin care.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great color, smell and texture. Very fast shipping. Will buy from again!!!</li>
            <li> I used it day and night over my body. I instantly feel the different between using the usual moisturizer and Shea butter. But after a few weeks I have to say it basically transforms my skin texture, especially on my tummy (stretch marks). I&#x27;ve noticed that the lines has gone smoother (less scary). I know that this is not going to make it go away completely but I am sure it is the best food for my skin. I will continue to use it everyday. The best part is how it does not feel sticky or oily at all during the summer and I know it would give me an amazing feeling during winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shea butter with coconut oil on my skin for about two weeks now and you can really tell the difference I love it and will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li> Nice texture, no weird smell and was shipped in a decent time period!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Quick delivery! Made my first batch with this shea butter! Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased some shea butter from another retailer and it was way more expensive and in a much smaller jar about 10 oz. The jar stuff was hard-not soft like this is. This has a pleasant smell and the color is nice. I used this along with cocnut oil and beeswax to make my mother homemade deodorant since she has developed an allergy to commercial deodorants. This melted smoothly and mixed well with the other ingrediants I used.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea butter to make my own sunscreen and it is awesome!!  I am going to figure out how to make my own lotion with this too!  The reviews are absolutely true. Best stuff out there!! I could almost use it alone. Thanks for providing such a great product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality! Great addition to my lotion. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Good and fast service</li>
            <li> Best shea butter you can find. Not sticky either!!</li>
            <li> I orderd 3 of these and everything is okay,  it melts great on your skin with and without mixing with other oils,  it smells like shea butter so its fine , I don&#x27;t mind the smell&lt;br /&gt;Good job</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s not grainy or gritty at all. The scent is very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company is also excellent to deal with. I couldn&#x27;t find the info for the recipe e-book in my package so I emailed them and they got back to me within a few hours with the e-book. It&#x27;s nice to deal with a small company that seems to care about their customers after the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; lightly with this shea butter. If you apply it too heavily you&#x27;ll feel greasy for hours. Just a little will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my body either straight (a dab in your palm and rub together to melt) or combined with a little jojoba or almond oil to make it easier to spread. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer for the whole body. Any dry patches I had on my skin were gone within a couple days of using shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use shea butter lightly on my face at night. Unlike coconut oil, which I had tried previously, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. No breakouts from shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a week it got rid of callouses on my feet. For that, I pretty much douse my feet and put on socks before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last use for this she butter so far is as a hair conditioner. I apply it to wet hair, starting at the root and working my way to the ends. Leave it in overnight and shampoo it out the next day. The result is really soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chunk of shea butter is pretty big so it should last a long time. Considering the quality of the product, it&#x27;s a bargain. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> No complaints... Beats the cheap store brands by a long shot</li>
            <li> Love it making my iwn creams</li>
            <li> good smell, good quality. used it for homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter. I use it on my skin and hair. My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for my husband&#x27;s eczema, even used it on myself post sunburn to sooth and prevent peeling. I  enjoy the smell and feel of this Shea butter so much that I just use as an everyday all over moisturizer. Curious to use for stretch mark prevention come pregnancy time.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after using the shea butter. I have very dry skin and now my skin does feel smooth and moisturized. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I would have liked the shea butter in a container, but otherwise I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Already purchased another one to make more homemade body products. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great quality and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair nourishment.</li>
            <li> Product overall is great however, the smell is unpleasant :-(&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter was very well package, melts quickly, absorbs very good on skin however, the smell is very unpleasant. I started making my own organic body butter and the smell of the shea butter is so strong that although my body butter turned out good the smell is awful.  I had to use extra essential oils.  I told my family members focus on the result of the body butter not the fragrance.  I tried adding extra oils to the mix but shea butter is too strong.  Keep this is mind I would not recommend this product for lotions. :-(</li>
            <li> The best quality, very affordable. I ordered the shea in hopes to help my sons eczema. Although, I cannot comment on the results quite yet, I can comment on ots overall use for our family. My husband and I both use it daily and LOVE it as a moisturizer. I also use it as a carrier oil melted down. It&#x27;s great with lavender oil! The best comment I can give is on the customer service which has been amazing! Quick and caring responses to meet our ends and questions. Would definetly recommend and reorder.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful Shea butter.  I look forward to making some amazing lotions and creams with it.</li>
            <li> i purchased this to use on my 2 month old baby girl&#x27;s hair. Her scalp was dry and having dandruff. Immediately after applying the shea butter + jojoba oil (purchased from whole foods) her hair looked moisutrized. she has no allergic reaction to the product and her hair looks healthy, shines and still maintaining its moisture. This is a great product and I plan to start using on my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product! This is my 3rd time purchasing it. Delivery was fast! I love the  recipe ebook.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I never had raw shea butter before and this is amazing.  It&#x27;s so creamy.  I was going to melt it down and make my own &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - the heck with that, I&#x27;m just using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s too good to mess with!</li>
            <li> The product was gritty the second time I ordered it, and it was not smooth...I know that the characteristics of shea butter differ from batch to batch, but I really didn&#x27;t like the gritty, sandy feeling shea butter that I got the second time.</li>
            <li> Made one batch of lotion with it so far. Seems like great stuff! Would definitely use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter STINKS~ It has a very strong chemical smell. I was hopping that when I mixed in my coconut oil, bees wax and essential oils the smell would be tolerable. I was wrong! I can&#x27;t add enough essential oils to mask the smell~ Smells like kerosine~I will NOT use this again! Buyer beware!  If I could give one star I would~</li>
            <li> Love! High quality Shea!!  I ordered the ivory Shea and was very pleased with the product..  I make my own Shea body butter and will definitely be ordering with them again!  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using raw Shea butter for about 5 years now.  This is by far THE best Shea butter I have ever used.  The texture becomes nice and creamy when rubbed between your hands.  It was not grainy like some Shea butters I have used in the past.  I also appreciated the friendly email I received from the seller.  Very friendly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in Shea butter for a while now and have done quite a bit of reading about it. My skin has been changing as I&#x27;ve been getting older(who knew right? lol) and I&#x27;ve heard and read that it can really help. I was a little nervous though because of all the varied accounts of the scent of Shea butter. I have a hard time with synthetic fragrance but natural scents(essential oils and such) have not made me sick. After much reading and reviewing I decided to give it a go and ordered some. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. It was very soft and the scent was not strong or overwhelming at all like others have said. It was very earthy and nutty and did not make me sick to my stomach. I rather liked the smell and so did my teenage step daughter. I&#x27;ve made some creams using this Shea butter and they have all turned out great. I&#x27;m very happy with this Shea butter and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This really makes my skin smooth trying see if it really helps with acne on face. Just dont like the smell really not bad but not flower either</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! I made my own shea butter mix out of it adding additional oils and it made my hair so soft. I will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I use this for making cream for dry skin.  They great customer service sends you recipes if you need them and answers questions.  It has a mild nutty smell..  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  My skin is amazingly soft and healthy.  Sweetest people as well and really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I deff see improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time buyer and user of Shea Butter.  I purchased product to make my own body care products. The product was of good quality and made a wonderful body butter.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but it arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  Appears to be great quality, smells nice.  Looking forward to using it.  No complaints, will order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product! I will probably order again.</li>
            <li> I use raw organic shea butter for topical treatment of conditions such as dry skin, blemishes, scars and wrinkles; a massage cream for tight and sore muscles; and added to my sunblock. I also add it to lots of soaps! Just an ounce or 2 to superfat the soap. My soap turns out so much better and moisturizes the skin as well as cleaning it. I love adding it in lotions, shampoos and other hair and skin products. I know shea butter can also be used in aiding cases of eczema, dermatitis, skin discoloration, arthritis, stiff joints and bruising. So I add it into many of my creams-such as calendula cream and jewelweed cream, gives it a nice extra umph!

            <li> Absolutely beautiful!! The best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered. The packaging was impressive and the product is outstanding!! It also came right on time! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to shea butter,I love the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;My feet and hands look good and feel good.</li>
            <li> I received my Shea Butter quickly and the package was well intact. I highly recommend this product. The 1lb. Block of Shea Butter is easy to work with smells great silky smooth to touch I will definitely be making a future purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it is exactly what they say, i just got 2 days ago and tried it on, really nice. It is very oily as most products of its kind so if you dont like oily products this is not for you. Otherwise all amazing for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> It did the job well in my recipes, but I never knew how much I hate the smell!  Sent it home with my mom for some psoriasis touch ups since she didn&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> Great natural product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Isabella and The Better Shea Butter Team. Customer support is absolutely amazing and the products is magnificient! I use it on my face and it has done wonders for my skin. Thank you for supplying an awesome product!</li>
            <li> High quality product at a good price. Love that it comes with recipes</li>
            <li> Made shaving cream with it. It was great!</li>
            <li> Great product. It looks, feels and smells authentic. Similar to the raw shea butter that i bought in Ghana.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating product, I was very pleased. Free E-book was a nice bonus too!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter! I have started making my own beauty supplies and made a body butter out of Shea, vitamin e oil and lavender/vanilla essential oils. Amazing! I gave some to a friend and she can&#x27;t stop talking about it. :)</li>
            <li> Put it in your hair and use It as a type of lotion after you shower I promise your skin will look very radiant your hair will look more lively this a product that I highly recommend aND can&#x27;t wait to get my moving situation in order sp I can order more and a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is scrumptious. I have enjoyed working with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this from this seller twice now.  Good seller and Good product.</li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing expensive products with shea butter, why not just cut out the middle man and make your own? Better yet, just use the shea butter raw. I use this on all my skin, including my face--no breakouts, and my skin has never looked better. I particularly like the Better Shea Butter brand because the size is a bit more reasonable for someone looking to use the products themselves rather than to make other products to sell. Because this is a natural product, though, it can spoil. Make sure you have a jar or something to store small amounts of shea, then just refill the jar as needed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I am having some hormonal issues with my skin, so I decided to try this instead of spending a ton of money on a dermatologist.  I am SO glad I did!  I purchased this about a month ago, along with some pure tea tree oil and some pure coconut oil.  The shea butter came exactly as it was advertised, and all 3 products were packed very well in an Amazon cardboard box, so I had no issues with melting, damage, or anything else.  The mixture I created with these ingredients is AWESOME!!  The tea tree oil has a very strong smell, but the shea butter and the coconut oil offset it somewhat. This product works great as an everyday moisturizer (I use it every night and every morning, but you may want to let it sit for a while before putting on makeup if you have naturally oily skin like I do), and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  My husband also uses it for his trouble spots, so it works for the men folk as well.  This product gets a definite recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> Melts wonderfully and is great quality for making massage bars. No foul odor and no mold on the product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> its really nice! it gets my skin extra smooth. i whipped it with coconut oil and use it as a conditiner and it works wonders! i love it</li>
            <li> Ohh I love this!  I will surely buy more of it.</li>
            <li> This is THE best Shea butter EVER. I purchased to make body butter gifts. Well so far I&#x27;m using it straight out of the packaging ... for myself. The FREE eBook that comes with the purchase is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I purchased as a gift.  The person I purchased for loves the white shea.  Contacted the seller about the ebook and they responded right away.  Wish the price would go down a little.  Other than that, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great quality Shea Butter! I enjoy the texture and the instruction booklet of recipes. I use Shea Butter on from head to toe and it keeps my skin super soft. It&#x27;s one of very few things I use on my lifelong acne prone skin. Thanks Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Great product used it to make my hair moisturizer. Works great the only downside is I wish I was able to buy larger quantity in bulk- i use it for hair, body, and lip balm for me and my family.</li>
            <li> made a body butter out of it and turned out great. still has that shea butter smell but no one minded, it wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> Great stuff:)&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this product I didn&#x27;t know there is instructions to download the ebook inside the packing and I tossed it out I hope if I call they can help me download so at least I know how to use it</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter to use in my own hair products and I really like it. It mixed together well with my other ingredients. I liked how it was wrapped in a plastic bag and then a paper bag, I feel that it keeps it fresher. I also liked the free ebook which has great recipes to use. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> wow !!! great product !!</li>
            <li> Products (rosehip seed oil and Shea butter) were packaged beautifully and were exactly as advertised.  Great customer service was a bonus. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Awesome and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have used this Shea Butter several times now and am loving it!  Just a pinch leaves my face, neck and hands so soft, not oily at all.  My makeup goes over it smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Used this to make a really great anti aging moisturizer. So far it is working really well and my skin is loving it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy using this product in my DIY body lotions.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, keep on buying it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is still in the package, but even through the wrap it smells so good compared with previous pure Shea butter I have used. It appears to be creamier in consistency as well. I think this will be a superior product to create my butters with.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! I use it to make all my DIY lotions and lip balms. It blends well not grainy at all and holds the smell of the essential oils nicely. Its also very moisterizing and leaves a nice sheen on your skin. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade body butter and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Great shea butter! Easily blends into products and is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer service!</li>
            <li> Wonderful feel but very strong smell. I make my own body butter and it blends and feels wonderfully but the smell overpowered my whole recipe. I actually like the smell but if you&#x27;re looking for odorless, this is definitely not recommended. I use DoTERRA essential oils and no matter how much I used, all I could smell was the Shea Butter. If you like the smell of it, you&#x27;ll LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my DIY projects. Creamy but a little dry, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, great product!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Worked really well for a lotion I was making; had the perfect consistency!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I love it. It absorbs well and really works. I would buy again and recommend.  I personally use it for dry heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> Beautifully pure product.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my very own hair moisturizer, and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful love this Shea Butter and thank you for the free download I used one of the recipes today.</li>
            <li> It look good and i love the Shea Butter Recipes eBook that they have👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I used the shea butter to mix with coconut oil to use as my moisturizer.  I am very happy with my purchase and it blended very well with the oil.  Very natural scent and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter as my main facial moisturize for years. After experience with several other brands, I must say that this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Not only will I be ordering this again, but my daughter is using it now after sampling mine.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Good quality.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Used it to make Homemade deodorant with essential oils. Seems to work really well. Thanx!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have finally discovered this Shea Butter. Such an outstanding moisturizer in every way possible. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very fast shipment also.</li>
            <li> Easy to scoop out and the recipe book gives a lot of ideas.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fantastic! I&#x27;ve used it in two recipes so far, in a lotion and a body butter and I love both. I put the lotions on in the morning and my skin stays soft all day! The smell is fantastic! Once I work my way through this batch of shea butter I&#x27;ll be buying more, I wouldn&#x27;t even consider another seller!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is so much better than others I have purchased. It is smooth and is absorbed on contact. It is not chalky/gritty at all. The ebook that comes with your purchase is chocked full of helpful hints and recipes. An excellent value for the cost.</li>
            <li> best I have been able to find so far.  soft and spreadable out of the bag unlike many others we have tried. recommend.</li>
            <li> Can not wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I have made whipped lotion and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I weighed it, checked for any molding, rancidity,  and then gave it a little skin test. I love it and give it an A (trust me, my stamp of approval should be highly regarded after all the $$$$ I spend here), that said check it out.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Initially purchased to make whip body butter for my family, but I found out that it makes an amazing diaper rash treatment and it&#x27;s all natural and organic so I feel safe using it. I whip this with coconut oil, almond oil and essential oil.  It significantly reduces redness and rawness within a day.  Will purchase more when the time comes. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This products seems okay but there is a black hair inside of the package inside with the product. Kinda gross.</li>
            <li> This shea butter arrived well packaged. It was very soft and easy to break up.  I was able to separate it and put it in jars for storage.  I use it on my face and body and it works quite well. The odor is very light.  I will usually not add any fragance, because of allergies, but I will probably try some of the butter recipes that are on the website.</li>
            <li> Nice product and good service. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps me very mousturized. Its a multipurpose butter.</li>
            <li> Got the product right on time. I love the shea butter. Got it for skin care product making.</li>
            <li> Great service and a free recipe ebook included!!!</li>
            <li> Helps my sons eczema!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing! I had an accident, injured mostly my skin. Rubbing the shea butter on the wound caused it to heal within 2 days. fantastic! Also, rubbing it through my hair contributes to  better health and its manageable condition. The amount is also substantial. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve only used it in my natural hair. It feels softer after a few days. I look forward to using the shea butter in other ways.</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter!!! I have very curly 3c/4a afro-american hair that is very fine so it weighs down easily. I add 2 tsp of this to my deep conditioner, leave on with heat for 30 mins and then rinse with cool water. This shea leaves my hair so soft and shiny and not limp at all for DAYS!!!! There&#x27;s a faint shea smell, barely noticeable, it disappears once you add anything else with a scent, also the texture is very creamy and even. It melts and blends well into other oils and into my conditioners. I have tried other &amp;#34;raw shea butters&amp;#34; that feel like rubbing wax all over myself and gave my sensitive skin a rash (shea butter has latex-like qualities that latex sensitive people like myself can react negatively to). I thought I hated shea butter until I tried this stuff. This shea is so pure, my skin did not react, in fact i use it all over my body after a shower and feel super smooth. The recipes that come with this via e-book are also awesome, I am so thankful to find such a high quality product, I will buy only from this seller in future!</li>
            <li> Packaged well and quality was as expected.  I blended it with coconut oil and apricot oil to make a body lotion as hostess gifts for a few showers that were thrown for me.  I received good feedback from my friends on the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter on the market in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This is Shea butter like no other.  It is pure, fresh and does not have any filler agents.  I have been sharing mine with friends and family.  I have been using it with essential oils for added benefit too!  You won&#x27;t believe how great your skin will feel!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this immediately! I first used it for my growing pregnant belly and really loved the all day moisture it provided. It was especially great during the winter when my skin is usually really dry. When my daughter arrived, I used California Baby diaper rash cream to help prevent and treat a developing rash. It didn&#x27;t work for her. I decided to try Better Shea Butter&#x27;s Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter on my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash. Within 24 hours, a rash that was on the brink of breaking the skin, was completely gone. I will continue to buy this for both my daughter and I. It&#x27;s a miracle worker in my eyes! No complaints!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure why or how but all i know is its good to have around when i finally do figure out how to make a soap or moisturizer out of it.. Or maybe i&#x27;ll just pick at it like cake.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and will purchase more when it runs out.  Given the amount in this block, it will last me a very long time though.&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost of creams, lotions, etc. today, this is a great buy.  Other products we purchase have chemicals added but this is an organic brick of shea butter.  Good stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with raw shea butter and oils. I have been using the same &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; of raw shea but decided to give this a try. When I mixed it with the oils, it did not blend completely, and the body butter was chunky. If you are using the shea alone, though, this can be great for you, though. It is packaged very nicely, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This butter is wonderful. I have used it in Chapstick and deodorant so far and they are both lovely!</li>
            <li> Is really great product, I recently had foot surgery, leaving me with a 3 inch scar on the bottom of my foot, a 4 1/2 in scar on the side of my big toe and a 3 inch one on top of second toe. So needless to say I wanted the best Icould use to minimize permanent scaring. After munch research I heard that most of the best products had Shea Butter, Rosehip Oil, there was a few others but those two after reaserch were the top one to use. They both can also be used for anti aging. I have seen such a major difference in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m 52 although I bought in mainly for the scars on my feet, I&#x27;m using it on my forearms to help with old scaring from playing with my cat and miscellaneous other scars, I&#x27;m also using it for my skin care on my face, the two products have made remarkable difference and is really working well on a wrinkle line and lines I had been getting on my upper lip. The Shea Butter alone is wonderful leaves my arm feeling smooth and not so dehydrated looking, I did buy a full pound and use it so often on any part of my body that needs it. I&#x27;m so ecstatic over this product, I can only say you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The ivory shea is much better</li>
            <li> Love the personalization of the company. Great product. Simple.</li>
            <li> i love it so much works miracle on my skin... it became soft smooth and fresh just by days of use... i love the smell and the product is soft and easy to put on... i love my skin now very very clear and healthy looking... deliver very fast and good customer service... will reorder again... im a happy customer... Fatima Best</li>
            <li> I purchased the shea butter for my hair and skin. I absolutely LOVE IT!  It instantly made my skin soft and miusturized and my hair drank it up and was soft and stopped breaking.  I would never use anything else for my hair and body again. I will be purchasing again. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this along with some zinc oxide for a homemade sunscreen.  They mix well together, but best if heated.  I put mine in a tin (like Altoids) and let it sit in the sun for a few minutes to warm up.  It goes on the skin much easier this way, too.  Otherwise it gets hard and crumbly and does not go on very smoothly.  As for the smell, it does not have a bad odor and it is not strong.  My son is very, very sensitive to smells and he well tolerated it and was used to it after 3 applications.  I am so appreciative that we can still get good, pure, unrefined products on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter that i have ever used. For all you that use shea try it you will love it. It is so creamy and soft. It is packaged very well and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Easy ordering system. Delivered on time. Most importantly, my wife loves it. We saw results in skin softness and health after a few uses. Will day order more when we run low!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind of shea butter I&#x27;ve bought, and it seems great enough. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s raw scent does overpower most anything you mix it with, so adding essential oils becomes a must. Unless you don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, no odor or mold and arrived as indicated.  Blended well with oils and I could immediately feel the difference after applying it to my skin.  I&#x27;m also using this in my hair in place of other moisturizers.  Absolutely, I would recommend this seller.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used one other shea butter, also a high quality raw organic, and am very pleased with this brand!  It delivers on all promises!  The customer service of this company is also exceptional...they actually emailed to remind me of the free recipe e-book that comes with the purchase of this butter (it&#x27;s pretty terrific too!) and to ask if I was happy with the product.  I highly recommend this shea butter...you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I make my own hand lotion. This shea butter is very nice. It is clean, w/o any foreign substances in it. Melts nicely in a double boiler. I keep the extra in my fridge.</li>
            <li> I buy Shea butter from several Amazon merchants. This one was the best packaging by far!  Really we&#x27;ll packed to protect freshness and prevent damage. I was really pleased with the product.  Raw and unrefined, just like they state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely order again from this merchant.</li>
            <li> Has a nice Ivory color, easy to work with. Will always buy this product from now on.  Whips up into lotion nicely</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with some other organic ingredients to make my own body butter. It&#x27;s well packaged, was delivered quickly, is easy to use and made a wonderful product! I like this much better than the heavier shea butter I had tried in the past. I was impressed that the company followed up with me to make sure I was pleased, and to offer recipes. They are very customer oriented and I will be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> My new favorite lotion. Have severe eczema and this is a godsend. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I can deal with the mild organic type odor for this kind of relief. I love this stuff. Finally a product with staying power. I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> Loved It!  The packaging was great. The Shea Butter looked white and pure. I received my order very efficiently.  I will definitely order from your company again.  Thank you for producing a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Gave a four becaus I did not&lt;br /&gt; receive E-book for recipes as promised.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells pure.  Arrived just as I thought it would and very quickly as well.  I have already started using it and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin out so much. I haven&#x27;t used it for anything else although possibilities are endless. I&#x27;ve never had a seller check in on my satisfaction with a product - but they did! If you plan to buy, buy from this seller, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well I mix it with vitamin e oil!!</li>
            <li> This is so healing for winter skin problems. I mix it with a small amount of coconut oil and Young Living Lavendar oil for a truly wonderful lotion</li>
            <li> Love the products, have a great smell &amp; I works great to make body butter. The list of recipes is also great.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price. I&#x27;ll be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing Shea Butter I wanted  to try making body lotion it came out well will have to try other brands and get more experience to know what&#x27;s  good Shea butter is.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face!  It does have a strong smell when I open the bag.  I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about Shea butter so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to, but I&#x27;m not eating it as it&#x27;s just going on my face.</li>
            <li> Used this in my homemade body butter and lip balm.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Just made some wonderful body butter with the shea butter, cocoa butter and coconut oil. Really helps with our dry winter skin and smells delicious --- chocolatey.  Absorbs nicely without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchased to to make some ointments/balms with my essential oils.  I whipped one up last night and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> I just started down the path of making my own lotion bars, needed some shea butter and found this one on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t know what to completely expect but it has worked great in the bars I&#x27;m making.  I must say this company has been outstanding and inquired how I liked the product, which I think was wonderful.  Genuine customer service-I love it!  The packaging is also nice.  It comes in a ziptop plastic bag which is then put in a ziptop brown padded pouch.  It is protective without being too bulky.  I would definitely recommend this product and this company to anyone needing organic body products and oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Shipped nice and secure. Only thing is the plastic is hard to open. I ended up cutting it because I thought I was cutting the tape. But I just put in a new plastic bag and it was fine. Definitely real Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was packaged exactly how the picture looks.</li>
            <li> Not what I had originally expected but it turned out being an excellent product. I had been looking for an all natural lotion that contained NO harmful chemicals but it turns out (after buying this) that I will just make my own.</li>
            <li> High quality unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how much this shea butter has changed my life. As a first time user and an African American male with a complextion like Meagan Good that had issue with acne scars major hyperpigmentation blemishes and sum damage (yea i was a mess) i tried everything till recently something hit me and told me I should go all natural. Now i just use this morning and night with my homemade vitamin c serum and my face has cleared and even up greatly. This is just one months use l. I no longer feel the need to but any more face products expect your standard face cleaner. Im actually pretty atractive and now that my face has cleared ive gained tons of attention and I have a modeling agency interested in me. One month ago this couldnt have even been considered! I recommend this for anybody!</li>
            <li> This was my third purchase with this seller, and I am once again blown away by not only the product I received, but also the high level of customer service! Once my order was placed, I received an email from the seller not only thanking me but also opening the door should I have any questions or concerns. This seller ships exceptionally fast! I really appreciate the way the Shea is packaged-plastic wrapped carefully to keep it super fresh and then in a manilla padded envelope. The item itself, in my opinion is first rate. I make my own lotions using essential oils, (some unscented as well...still fantastic!)and this shea melts quickly, and when mixed with a bit of fractionated coconut oil, it whips up into the most amazing body butter! I am thrilled with my purchase and will certainly order again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter, and the company is awesome!  I just wish they sold more products!</li>
            <li> Love  This Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a few lotions with this so far and have loved the results. The look, feel, and smell of the butter are high quality - clean, but rich. The company is also very diligent about following up and ensuring customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> The consistency and quality of this product is wonderful. I keep some in almost every room of our house. I just scoop it into metal or plastic tins that I&#x27;ve recycled from the days when I paid too much for pure shea butter that I found at health and beauty stores. A one pound bag will carry my family through the whole winter. Shea butter is the only thing that I rely on to keep my family&#x27;s dry skin from chaffing.</li>
            <li> I use this in a homeade body butter, mixes really well, and is so soft, love it.</li>
            <li> My shea butter arrived early, which was so nice!  I loved the ability to access the recipe booklet online, and I have already tried one of the &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34;.  It is so very easy to &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; the shea butter, and I love the smooth and silky feel of it on my skin (including my face).  It is truly a &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; for winter!  Wonderful product----I will re-order this when I need more, and I will refer this specific product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I live by this product !  It&#x27;s the only mosturizer that I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Great for melting down and adding essential oils too. It doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but we love that it is raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> Its great. i love the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product! This will last me for quite some time too. The company is extremely friendly, with great customer service. I&#x27;ve emailed them several times for tips/info. and they&#x27;ve always responded back in a timely manner. I would recommend this product/company to anyone looking for an all natural and organic way to moisturize their skin/face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this instead of another companies like I&#x27;d done in the past because it offered Amazon prime.  The reviews were great so I figured for the same price why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing!  I&#x27;m in love.  It&#x27;s just soft and easy to work with compared to other gritty brands of shea butter.  Since I love the feel of it,  I have been moisturizing my hair more often.  This new obsession with this product may get me into a good habit of moisturizing more often.</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter. It is definitely raw shea. You can just tell by the light color and sometimes gritty texture (until you heat it in your hands). Plus, you get a lot for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Has a very strong smell but still moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter and I think I hit the jackpot. I&#x27;ve only made a new face cream with it so far, but I&#x27;ve completely replaced my old online Paleo version and am saving a ton of $. It definitely has an odor to it, but after a few days the essential oils in the recipe took over and now I don&#x27;t smell it at all. I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Stuff is awesome so far. Used the Shea butter after a shower and I wake up feeling uber soft. However, it is a bit rough putting on. It drags a little when applying it after melting in my hands. But the feel is soft when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many reviewers have said, the product does has a semi &#x27;off putting&#x27; smell to it. It reminds me of dried pig skin for dogs or something. I don&#x27;t know.but that&#x27;s just how it is and how it smells! I do wonder at time, &amp;#34;hey-... Am i just rubbing pig grease on my body...cause it smells and looks like pig grease.&amp;#34; Lol But, I dont stink/reek of it when putting it on, just a small odor. I don&#x27;t smell like it at all when I wake up though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m liking it so far, doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. However, prepare yourself a wide mouth jar for this product so you aren&#x27;t having to keep it in the bag it was first sealed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Everything about it seems authentic.  Used it to make my all organic hair serum/pomade.  Turned out great and my hair is coming back to life.  it can be used on your skin straight up as a lotion.</li>
            <li> This item came as promised. I used it in a body lotion recipe I found online which turned out to be way to greasy for my skin though I don&#x27;t think this is a reflection on the shea butter. The next recipe I use it in I will cut back on the amount of the product to hopefully eliminate some of the greasiness.</li>
            <li> love this organic product well packaged .</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I&#x27;ve been getting my Shea butter from my local hair supply store, needless to say I won&#x27;t be getting the yellow, greasy \\&quot;Shea butter\\&quot; from there anymore!  I love making my own hair and skin products and Better Shea Butter its the only place I&#x27;ll get my Shea butter from now on. I did some research and found out that Shea butter is supposed to have an ivory or beige color to it and it&#x27;s supposed to have the consistency of something along the lines of play dough but a little bit softer and those two things is what I found when I ordered my butter from Better Shea Butter.The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how smart, right)! Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right). The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting. Overall my experience with the Better Shea Butter company was great! But you know what made it even better? The owner sent me a thank you card for buying her product! Thanking ME! I should be thanking her for making such a good product! You should buy from Better Shea Butter not only do they have a FANTASTIC product but they also know how to treat their customers!!!</li>
            <li> The customer service is the best! As well as the Shea Butter. You will definitly feel the difference in your skin. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter!  It has a wonderful consistency and a very pleasant smell. It is evident that it is fresh and I appreciate that very much!  It is easy to work with in both the soaps and body butters that I have made (I even love just using it as it is in my lips and on my skin, it really is lovely!). I will be back for more!! Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> reliable, confident in their products. I can&#x27;t wait to make my baby rash cream :)</li>
            <li> I read a lot of great things about raw shea butter and I went on a limb and bought it.  It sat there for 6 months or more then I found it sitting there one day and decided to figure out how to use it.  I knew that it could be used for several things but I just didn&#x27;t know how to use it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I use it to moisturize my body.  It works great.  It literally glides on your skin.  I just hold the block of shea like a stick of butter and rub and it comes off easily and nicely.  Actually I love moisturizing my hands with it.  I wash my hands a lot and find that they get really dry.  However, when I&#x27;m using the shea butter, even after I wash my hands, they still stay moisturized.  When water goes on it, it feels almost a bit waxy but I like it.  Seals in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Great for skin. I will buy again and again again...... Love it.</li>
            <li> this worked wonderful in my face cream that i made!</li>
            <li> Used this to make body butter. I was happy with the product and the size of package. Made 2 large batches with my recipe. Has a scent but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it everyday for hair, body, lips and because you don&#x27;t need a lot with each use, I still have a ton left (purchased in February 2014). It comes in a plastic bag inside of a brown bag as shown in the picture. The plastic bag can get kind of messy, so I transferred the shea butter to an empty container for easier accessibility. The quality of this runs circles around anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased from beauty supply stores in the past.</li>
            <li> Strong unnatural (almost anise-like) smell and a bit of mold on the top (yes, mold, not &#x27;nut skins&#x27; or whathaveyou) have turned me off of using this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Melted this oil down &amp; mixed it w/ oils I had. Product also comes w/ a downloadable guide that you can use when mixing. Great product.</li>
            <li> I shipped around for quite a while before settling on this Shea butter, and an very happy I did. The product is exactly as described, and the quality is superb. Delivery was timely, and had there been any issues I am confident they would have been handled professionally-i was given several ways to contact them if I had been unsatisfied. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I love it! I have tried several other brands of shea butter before and this is so far my favorite-- simply wonderful smooth buttery goodness that melts immediately when applied; none of the grittiness that I sometimes get in previously-tried brands. There are instructions for downloading an e-book of recipes to use the shea butter for too. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> went to shea butter heaven</li>
            <li> I mixed this Shea butter with another brand of shea butter so I&#x27;m not sure how well the product holds up on its own. But I was very disappointed with the fact that I ordered one pound and Shea butter with all the packaging weighed only 15.2 ounces.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I purchased two pounds around the time my daughter was born.  Her skin has only known it and almond oil. She was diagnosed with eczema at birth, but hasn&#x27;t shown ANY signs of it since. My skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> This was a very smooth and has a mild aroma.  I love, love, love it!  My clients love it.  I use it as a massage cream with some special ingredients.  I leaves the moist skin smooth long after application.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. Love the product.. Better than using regular creams. Keep moisturized</li>
            <li> Very good product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, is as pictured and described.  There is an Oder that is natural but is covered up with scented oil and does not linger on skin. Yes it&#x27;s in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I received my Shea Butter in two days. Better than expected since it was Christmas eve. I can&#x27;t review the recipe eBook that was supposed to be free because I can&#x27;t get it to download. This is my first time ordering Shea Butter. I will give it more time before making a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in some of the homemade beauty products I&#x27;m starting to make.  I was a little disappointed in the smell as it doesn&#x27;t smell like other shea butters.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I used it in my natural DIY hard lotions and also lip balm.  Both turned out great.  I gave them as gifts and everyone has raved about both!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quick service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOVE the texture of this shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this shea butter.  Its smoother and more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; than other shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  With a little rubbing between the fingers its melts, which I like because I don&#x27;t like really heavy and sticky substances in my hair.  It came in good packaging: inside a sealed zip lock bag that was in carton package- all in side a cushioned cardboard box.  The shea butter has a light she butter scent and an ivory color as described.  Because of its consistency I&#x27;m sure it will mix very easily with oils as that is what I plan to do with it. Thank you for good service and a good product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this Shea Butter.  I&#x27;ve used it to make several body butter recipes and it works great!</li>
            <li> Great shea butter! There was a lot more than I thought there would be, too.</li>
            <li> I just opened it today! So far I like how it feels on my skin. I will know better in time! 4 stars so far. I will review again after I use for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter!!!!! It&#x27;s perfect for my homemade body butters, leaves my skin silky and moisturised. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have used these for making skin cream for months and very happy about the quality. I have very sensitive skin and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> great product, very soft, melts easily in your hand.  i used it to make a whipped body butter and am very happy with the results.  great customer service &amp; love the recipe e-book that is included with purchase.  will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love shea butter!! and so far this has been the best ive found! and not to mention super fast shipping!! got it in 2 days!!! and I liked it so much I ordered more already!!</li>
            <li> It was a pleasure doing business with them and very refreshing service. It was the added touches and the high quality of product. I&#x27;m assured that I have a natural product..thanks again for the fast service.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! The product is high quality and smells great! Customer service was amazing! They just reach out to make sure you&#x27;re happy and honestly makes buying from the, more personal and i enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I used this for a homemade deodorant recipe!!!  It works great!  Loved it! My kids love to use the deodorant also</li>
            <li> Great product! I have found it to be incredibly effective on my dry skin. I&#x27;ve used just the shea butter by itself, and mixed some with cocoa butter and essential oils to create a body butter. Definitely will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, and a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use shea butter for my daughter’s eczema and this company&#x27;s product is by far the best shea butter I’ve found on Amazon. Even though I’ve only ordered twice now, the quality is consistent and high, which is valuable to me since I&#x27;ve spent the monay before and received low quality that is grainy and doesn&#x27;t melt easily in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this company enough for their super high quality shea!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter feels like there is sand in it.  :(  Very disappointed!  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought shea butter from them because I am a cosmetic do-it-yourselfer. I plan to gather a bunch of natural plant oils and mix them in with a few other things to see if I can get a really great moisturizer. Am tired of paying for fillers and preservatives I dont want. This seller even sent me via email download a recipie book. She even inquired if I had questions or needed help. She clarified what one lopoks for in shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great in my homemade lotions!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter comes in a plastic ziplock bag inside of type of paper zip lock bag. I do wish it came in a container just so that it&#x27;s easier to store. But I love the product overall. I already see a difference in my skin softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I emailed them about the different ways I could use the product and they sent the lovely Ebook. There wasn&#x27;t a recipe for a leave in conditioner and Isbella went ABOVE and BEYOND to look for something that would work well for myself. It&#x27;s that the of interaction that makes a loyal customer. At the rate I&#x27;m going I&#x27;ll be buying another batch from her in the next month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Isabella!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful, fresh and smells good!  I use it in chapstick and lotion.  It comes in a wonderfully natural and easy to keep bag to keep it fresh, that is if it lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered this it was great, smooth - I use it straight on my skin after a shower. Used it up, so I ordered it again. This time it is so hard I have to use I knife to get any off, ok, no big deal. But then it&#x27;s still so hard it doesn&#x27;t melt in my hands to rub on my skin. It just balls up and falls off. I live in California so it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s very cold. I&#x27;ll use up what I have in making other products but I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand to use after showers.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff. Yes, it smells a little--not sure how to describe it--but it&#x27;s really not bad. I used it for hair masks. great for skin too, obviously. It breaks out my face, but for hands feet and elbows esp. during winter its awesome. Why buy expensive &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; stuff at the store that uses a small percentage of actual shea butter when you can just use it at 100%, and more cheaply? I&#x27;m sure this would be worth maybe 10 tubes of hand cream for instance. And it&#x27;s organic! I use it on my hair before shampooing. leaves it softer and in nicer condition. I&#x27;m white by the way with thinnish blonde hair. I color it and that with heat style has made it brittle, so this seems to help. I had been combining w/ jojoba oil or coconut oil, but I just used the shea butter straight from the brick and it shampooed out fine. (I was worried my hair would be greasy afterward or that I would have to shampoo multiple times but it was fine. It&#x27;s a large amount, I&#x27;m sure I could use it for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t finish it. You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Love the Shea butter!!!  So pure and smoothe when I blended it with essential oils and jojoba oil for face cream.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!! Please send attachment with recipes. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! This is my most favorite, versatile beauty/body purchase ever</li>
            <li> Very luscious piece of shea butter. Looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it in my home made skin and beauty recipes.</li>
            <li> The shea butter was wonderful!  Packaging was a bit difficult to open (packing tape around a ziplock plastic bag).  The product was wonderful and as described.  I made a wonderful body butter cream for my skin which is very dry in the winter.  I haven&#x27;t tried any of the recipes from the free manual and recipes ebook that came with it yet.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days, Has a strange smell. Mixed with coconut oil to make a whipped body butter and rubbed on grandsons eczema , he loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I use it every day after my shower. It&#x27;s great for the price and I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter melts smoothly and incorporated well with coconut oil and essential oils. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love that it now comes in a block- it is SO much easier to measure out for my cold process soap and lotion bar recipes.  Thanks for a great improvement to an already great product!  I love the feel and smell of this shea butter.  I am a well-satisfied customer and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for making my natural chapsticks and deodorant</li>
            <li> Works great ! My skin loves it !</li>
            <li> The Shea butter came in exactly like the seller described it and I love that it was &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; packaged. The Shea itself was in a plastic zip lock inside the re-sealable, heavy duty paper bag. This is my first time using Shea in it&#x27;s pure form, but it is very much like other consumers reported: creamy white in color, a very faint nutty odor (not a bad thing!), playdoh-like texture, and quick to melt. I have used it in my deodorant recipe along with coconut oil, cocoa butter and several other ingredients and it does make the overall texture better for the use. I&#x27;ll be using it in my body lotion recipes next so I hope it continues to make me happy and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already whipped up one of the recipes and it is amazing. All my other lotions feel so watered down now  after using this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my order.  I really like the texture.  It is quite nice.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. It blends very smoothly into lotions and body butters. I&#x27;ve tried several others that left a grainy feel behind, but not this one. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great creamy Shea butter. Perfect for whipping up a body scrub.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smooth, melts easier than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I use this to make my own lotion and lotion bars!  I will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> This was the main ingredient in a homemade lotion and I really like it. Very smooth and creamy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but after adding some essential oils, it is fine. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just not what I am used to from store bought lotion. Great product and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my shea butter. It&#x27;s great on it&#x27;s own or in recipes the company provides online. So many options with different oils and scents.  Softening my heels, body and hair.</li>
            <li> So far... I love it!-I bought it to make my own body butter. I mixed it with a few of my other oils and it all came together nicely. The only little thing... it has an extremely earthy smell :/ I tried some of my favorite essential oils in hopes to disguise it... to no real avail... It does eventually dissipate though once on the skin though. As for the quality of my body butter? Amazing! Leaves my skin feeling healthy and hydrated.... and my growing pregnant belly is surely going to stay stretch mark free :-)</li>
            <li> Very good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Lasts and lasts, nice for just out of the shower or to mix with my African black soap. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product customer service is great, recipes that were provided was awesome, will purchase again</li>
            <li> High quality product and great customer service! I really enjoyed the recipes too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My son has horrible eczema and is constantly scratching his skin to the point of bleeding. Once I started using the ivory Shea Butter the constant itching has stopped! It is a great product and since finding BetterSheaButter.com I will never order it from anywhere else. My shipments always arrive within a few days and it is always top quality. I highly recommend them and their products!!!!</li>
            <li> I am excited to use it, it does have an earthy natural smell...</li>
            <li> very nice shea butter. i use it in lotion and soap making. the color is ivory just like advertised.</li>
            <li> Very smooth product! Will definitely use again to make homemade buddy butter.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Silky soft hands&lt;br /&gt;Softened Cuticles (mine were really dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple&lt;br /&gt;Used for dry elbows&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep the frizzies down on your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smell - I just didn&#x27;t like the smell.  However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day.  I am thinking about adding a drop of some great smelling oils to it.  Will use what Shea Butter I have, but will not buy until the smell improves!</li>
            <li> This is quality shea butter, melts nicely, and has no odor.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter so far.  I added coconut oil blended with essential oils to scent and made a moisturizer and make up remover.</li>
            <li> This works great in my baby girls hair her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing. I use it on my face. Not a big fan of the smell I miss the sweet baby smell but its worth it for her to have soft smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good but my skin is looking much better. Hopefully with time it will treat my stretch marks and acne scars.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer, however it didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It was very hard to apply and messy.&lt;br /&gt;Part of it was a tannish brown.. It was a giant messy blob when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Also I wanted to add, it had a black hair in it, medium length and my hair is blonde..yuk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to update this.. The seller contacted me and offered a replacement or refund.&lt;br /&gt;I took the replacement and have already got it.&lt;br /&gt;It was just as advertised. Fantastic. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very creamy and not as hard as I expected for unrefined shae butter, but still amazing product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I requested 2-day shipping &amp; got it on time. The company Better Shea Butter also took extra measures by bagging the product inside of the case which kept the cute bar shape. I had no idea shea butter was super moisturizing &amp; so I only have to use a little bit. You get a lot of product for the price &amp; so I will only buy from them from now on. This company is not skimpy on what they give and the product is super rich and melts with touch. I simply cannot go back to the regular local stores where the shea butter is mixed with other stuff. I love this product pure. I use it as is but I know some people like perfume and so they mix it with essential oils. Overall it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> it is not as tough to break apart like other brands</li>
            <li> All around awesome product, and at a fantastic price!&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face and body. Feels gritty at first but once you rub it in uour hands its like butter!&lt;br /&gt;I see some complaints about the smell, but I got to say, its mild and not bad! Its all natural, its going to have smell, at least the smell isnt fake or chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;Its a really great product.</li>
            <li> The real stuff and thick</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling Shea butter I have ever had. It made the entire house smell disgusting after melting it and no matter what I tried I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out or covered until almost a week later.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost like burning tires.</li>
            <li> Used it to make sunscreen and it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great product, nice packaging, exactly as described. The block is HUGE - great deal, great quality!</li>
            <li> This is amazing Shea butter. The quality, consistency and color is phenomenal. The butter was soft when I opened and I just had to a hand blender to make my oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, already used almost all of it making body butters, lip balm, sunscreen and bug repellent.  It is a wonderful texture and yields a beautifully finished product.  I am thrilled and ordering more right now.</li>
            <li> very soft, great  on my hair</li>
            <li> Absolute best- I&#x27;ve reordered several times to whip up batches of shea body butter for friends and family.  Melts nicely, and mixes well with other oils. They LOVE it, and it has helped a couple of friends solve minor skin issues they&#x27;ve been battling for years.  Great to use small amount on hair too- a little goes a long way for that.</li>
            <li> GREAT quality.  Great recipes in the FREE e-book.  Great prices.  I love this shea butter and I won&#x27;t stop raving about it!!!! Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon. Love you girl.</li>
            <li> Product and customer service are great. Will order more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea butter and I was very impressed. I used it to make my own deodorant and lotion and thought it would&#x27;ve been too greasy but it was perfect and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING in my DIY beauty products! It ships quickly and they even enclosed a personalized thank you letter for ordering and an invite to share uses and recipes with other customers. Good product, great company.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I ordered the Shea Butter and as a last minute decision added the Cocoa Butter. Both were simply amazing. I will order them again and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was great!</li>
            <li> This is the first and only time I have purchased shea butter. I have nothing to compare it to. However, it seems to have worked very well for making the body products I wanted it for. I choose this product/company based on a recommendation on a recipe web site. I will definitely purchase this product again in the near future. I was pleasantly surprised to see a free recipe book was included as well. I am looking forward to seeing all of the wonderful things that can be made using shea butter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, quick shipping!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think this a good product but I personally feel the scent is unpleasant. I tried to make hand lotion and I had to use lots of essential oil to cover the smell. Even then it was still present.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome! Really great product</li>
            <li> this stuff is incredible, and customer service is top notch! I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my shea butter purchase. The product arrived as a slab packed in a double zip-lock bag, so it survived rough handling very well. Although the butter was solid, I was able to cut through it easily with a butter knife in order to place the pieces in several containers. Its faint scent and ivory color are a strong indicator that the butter is unrefined. Because it stays solid at room temperature, it was hard for me to soften some of it in my palms. Therefore, I used a knife to scrape a little bit off its surface, this way it was much easier for me to soften it so I could spread it over my legs. The legs shined only for the first 20 minutes, then the gloss was gone and the skin felt velvety to the touch. I used the butter for my acne-prone face as well, and next morning the skin was very soft and had that satin feel to it. I was a bit apprehensive before putting the butter on my face because my face is very sensitive to any facial products, but it liked the shea butter. I will continue to use it because I am very inspired with the results of my first days of shea butter usage. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality. Blended with other oils to make a whipped hair cream. Seller checked in to make sure the product was up to par and was extremely easy to get in contact with.</li>
            <li> I can really say from experience if this is the best shea butter out there but once you&#x27;ve tried it you won&#x27;t need to look else where. It also comes with a very helpful download to help you get started making creams to use. Love this product and give if a full 5 (stars)🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!!</li>
            <li> Service excellent--received it in a very short time.  The packing was good and the product is excellent.  I used it to make my own body butter and the consistency of the butter was great.</li>
            <li> I used the shea butter to make bath melts and it was really easy to use and was excellent in the bath melts.  I will order again when I need some shea butter for my body butter or bath melts!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. Great customer service. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Has also cleared up my dyshidrotic eczema on my feet. I mixed it with coconut oil and a bit of olive oil to make an all over body lotion that feels so good on my skin leaving it very soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used this to make lip balm, and it was very rich and creamy. It also smells great. I do not know alot about Shea butter or have experience with it enough to say it is better or worse than another brand of Shea butter. But for what i used it for it was perfect and i would be happy buying from this vendor as well. They also include recipes for their product.</li>
            <li> I make many of my own lotions, lip balms, etc. I bought this primarily for my 1 year old, when it seemed like the coconut oil and lavender lotion I make for his eczema-prone skin was at times drying.  I made a lotion using one of the free recipes, and it is amazing!  My baby&#x27;s skin was very soft and no sign of dryness after the first use.  I have very dry lips and made the lip balm recipe, and my lips are not flaking for the first time I can remember.  I personally like the packaging.  I can easily slice off exactly how much I need.  I appreciate that the owner contacted me to see if I liked the product.  She is very responsive and helpful.  I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Arrived fairly quickly and well-sealed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bough Shea butter before, but it came as I imagine it should be, and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The butter is extremely dense, off-white, and has an earthy, nutty scent.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using pure shea butter. So far, it seems to be providing good moisturization for my dry hands. I will have to wait and see if it continues to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a light tan/cream color.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the smell, but I think that&#x27;s normal for shea butter. Hopefully I will get used to it, but in the meantime, I have tried melting it in the microwave with coconut oil. The result is softer and covers up the shea scent a little bit.</li>
            <li> Best quality shea butter I have ever used and I have used shea butter for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service.  I will buy this again.  I found many more recipes online for making your own lotions and creams.  Love it, and feel better using natural products!</li>
            <li> Used for body butters and balms. Was hoping for a softer smell, but still melted/whipped up great.</li>
            <li> I just used the shea butter in an anti-aging face cream recipe. It came out great and made my skin feel very soft. I&#x27;ve got several other recipes that I want to try with it now - deodorant, shaving cream, diaper cream... I think I&#x27;ve officially become a &amp;#34;Crunchy Mom.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great quality. I use it to make my homemade lotion and sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Best of all! Nice nutty smell, ivory color. I have it for almost a year now, and I kept section I am using in room temprature, and saved the rest in the fridge... and all in great condition. Excellent, the best out there, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> To start, I don&#x27;t use Shea butter mixed into other home made cosmetics. I apply it directly on my skin (face &amp; body). That being said, this review might have a bias that doesn&#x27;t pertain to your use of the Shea. With that out of the way, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this butter. I wanted to try it because of all the amazing reviews. And I must agree that is is very creamy to the touch. However, because the Shea doesn&#x27;t come directly in a jar, I spent some time dicing it up and putting it in a container. When trying to apply it directly to my skin, it is very slippery and it hard to turn into a gel or liquid state for spreading. I recommend Molivera Organics Shea Butter for this type of application instead.</li>
            <li> Really lovely Shea butter. I whipped it for a delightful moisturizer that my whole family uses. It was packaged well (not in a plastic tub thank goodness) and very neatly done. It melted well and has a very nice texture.</li>
            <li> This is great shea butter.  While I am new to straight shea butter (one prior purchase much smaller amount, much more expensive, far inferior in quality) this stuff is amazing.  The ivory color is great for whipping into body butter, it is very pliable, melts like a dream and smells like shea butter.  Minimal packaging and supporting women in Africa just makes this the perfect shea.  Oh and the bonus e recipe book is great.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea and all their other products they offer. Quality, great service fast shipping. I have found my supplier. Thanks better Shea 😀</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Will definitely order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is absolutely wonderful!  Very good quality, great consistency and easy to work with.  I was hesitant about the product considering it was SO much cheaper than the organic Shea Butter I had bought locally, but the quality actually seems to be better than the Shea Butter I&#x27;ve had in the past.  So far I have made my skin firming cream, body butter, and healing balm with this, and it has worked  great for all.  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I received the sample of this shea butter a couple days ago. The shea butter was the appropriate color and consistency, so that was very reassuring. I was able to make a batch of lip balm with it last night &amp; it turned out wonderful! Good customer service.</li>
            <li> So nourishing for the skin.  Very fresh product.  Arrived on time.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> They gave a free booklet with lots of recipes to print out, followed up to see if the product was what I expected and I&#x27;d order from them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice. I use it for my hard lotion and whipped body scrub. This will be my go to shae butter. Love the consistency and texture.</li>
            <li> Great product...I used it to make Magnesium Body Butter (recipe on wellnessmama.com) and now my skin is sooo soft and I&#x27;m getting my magnesium transdermally.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin was cracking and peeling, as I have dry skin in the winter that is aggravated even more with the acne medication creams I use. I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and I have to say that this is the only I&#x27;ve found thus far that rehydrates your skin and does not break you out. I also feel that it helped to even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Feels great on the skin and blends nicely. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my recipe: 4 parts shea butter melted in microwave. Monitor closely so shea butter does not burn. When partially cool, add 1 part extra virgin olive oil. Beat with mixer until fully incorporated. Pour into glass container with lid. My mixture did get hard again, so I melted it for easy application. I can not tell you how wonderfully soft it has made my dry skin. Essential oils, NOT fragrance oils could be added if aroma is desired. I love it and will continue to try new formulas.</li>
            <li> This organic shea butter is wonderful! I used it to make a body butter and it came out just perfect. It melted beautifully and my skin feels so silky smooth. The scent is very, very mild and so you could easily add whatever essential oil you would like to and customize the fragrance of your final product.</li>
            <li> Great quality I did soap bars with it. Perfect. :-)</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and the winters are so hash on my skin!! This is luxurious and moisturizing! I don&#x27;t mix this with anything from the recipe book, I just spoon some out and rub it together melt it in my hands, then apply all over my face. I&#x27;d rather use this than anything store bought with all those chemicals!! Clean and pure moisture!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Great!!&lt;br /&gt;The best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;And I got it in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;I made a hair pomade/shaving cream out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use it for my face cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price, and very fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  It has a bit of an odor, not moldy as I have heard complaints of with some Shea butters, but not exactly what I would call nutty either.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, not bad or strong, but not really like anything I have smelled.</li>
            <li> I only use natural raw, cold pressed ingredients when I make lotions, butters, lip balms etc.  I am very picky and it has to be uniform in color and texture and this was perfect.  Very white and not too overwhelming in scent but still very pleasant.  If you make all natural products and want a really good quality shea butter this should be on your list.  Melts well and is not gritty at all, very clean and it makes a really great whipped body butter that is nearly a true white color.  I don&#x27;t buy in small amounts much but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this raw but when I do get it on my hands it does feel like heaven so you could of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviews are about how healthy it is and using it raw(we all know that stuff), this review  is for those who use this as an ingredient and I for one could not be happier.  Definitely a safe buy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I used it to make body cream and it came out amazing!</li>
            <li> Great quality product. Worked perfectly for making body butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer and I wish I would have started using it sooner. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all and I swear my skin has gone back in time a few years. A little goes a very long way so I feel that I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth through Better Shea Butter. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be running out any time soon but when I do I&#x27;ll be sure to go through this seller again.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was unbelievably soft and mixed well with other oils that I used to whip up by body butter.</li>
            <li> Love it, and so does my skin. I bought raw shea butter from another source and ended up with chemical burns on my scalp, so I was a bit leery about trying Shea butter from anyone. But I decided to buy this Shea butter and I found out I have no idea what I had bought before because its nothing like this. This Shea butter from Better Shea butter is soothe and creamy and my skin soaks it up like its water. I love it and I will be getting it again. Thank you for having a wonderful product. I LOVE IT. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It came just as I expected! The packaging was convenient as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the product. I enjoyed it immensely in even have my boyfriend hooked on it</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! It was just as described in their ad! No, REALLY! It&#x27;s super great shea butter and I even used it plain because it didn&#x27;t have any weird scent to it (I&#x27;ve come across a couple brands that were not &amp;#34;olfactory friendly:/). This will be great in lotion body bars with essential oils!!</li>
            <li> After my quest to search for a natural remedy and using all the organic/natural products that exist out there for eczema; I must say that this shea butter is a MIRACLE! this is the only thing that had worked for my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
            <li> Smells so bad makes me wanna puke. What does this mean?  So im changing my review. The smell is still horrible but after doing research it seems like that is what its supposed to smell like. Smokey nutty smell but its strong. I used some on my skin and hair and after applying it seems like itll do the job. I will try other brand though hopefully with less scent</li>
            <li> The product exceeded my expectations.  Much better than the products I&#x27;ve been using from the hair stores that make the claim of 100% shea butter. I will continue to use this product from Better Shea Butter. The product also came packaged exactly as it said in the description. A new great product for me, that I will continue using.</li>
            <li> this is one of my best purchases. I&#x27;m so glad I spent a little bit more for a pure product I could trust was not rancid and good quality. A year later we are still using this shea butter and its the go to &#x27;fix all&#x27; for my toddler whenever she has an &#x27;ouchie&#x27;. I have put it in tins for travel and keep it in a sealed jar otherwise. i recommend it to everyone needing a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural shea butter. Melted together with some FCO &amp; essential oils to make the most wonderful homemade &#x27;boutique&#x27; lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great shea butter. It&#x27;s not been as grainy as a number of other ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Because of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been making my own natural lotions for awhile now. My only complaint and why it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star is I am not overly fond of the packaging. It&#x27;s inside of a paper bag (very good, strong one at that - with a zip-lock kind of closure), but inside it&#x27;s wrapped in a plastic that sticks to the product very easily and it can be a bit messy trying to get the amount you want out of it.</li>
            <li> Loving it and having fun trying different things for hair and skin.  Lesson learned to use smaller portions and not half a block at a time and also to look at website before doing anything rather than looking at YouTube videos first.</li>
            <li> Can in a bag as a brick, soft , smells good, works wonders with dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!  11/19/14 UPDATE: I have been using 100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter daily for about 2 months. I made a whipped body butter with this shea butter and 100% organic unrefined Cocoa Butter from &#x27;Better Shea Butter&#x27; along with a few other ingredients. Note, I had really dry skin and I would lather store bought lotion on my body multiple times per day. However, over the last 2 months, since using my whipped body butter with this shea butter, my skin has consistently felt silky smooth and glowing. The shea butter is high quality and an amazing product. I will be a life long customer! Thank you Issabella from &#x27;Better Shea Butter&#x27; for supplying a high quality shea butter and for the excellent customer service you have provided! I can&#x27;t wait to try some of your other products, like the rose hip oil and lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li> This worked great in a shaving cream I made for my teen nephew.</li>
            <li> This is great quality, and great value for money. When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t use it regularly. But now I am living somewhere very dry, and this stuff is amazing. Every night after a bath I slather it on after melting it in my hands and it has kept my skin very soft. I even use it on my nasty calloused feet and have noticed great softening, better than commercial foot care products. I am hooked. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve used many different shea butters and this by far is the best. A  quick delivery and great customer service. I will definitely be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  Earlier this year, I started making my own skin lotion (for personal use) to combat skin dryness triggered by a rough winter.  My recipe has transitioned over the months, but I now have a wonderful lotion for my skin type.  When I began adding the &amp;#34;Better Shea Butter&amp;#34; Shea Butter to my recipe, I saw a big improvement to how the lotion left my skin.  I&#x27;ve ordered this product multiple times and am happy with the quality.  One of my orders had the yellow shea butter instead of the intended ivory shea butter (mislabeling mishap).  I tried the yellow and did not like it as much as the ivory because it left white under-clothing with a slight shade of yellow.  I contacted Better Shea Butter directly and they were quick to resolve the problem by sending me a replacement.  I have, and will continue to, do business with Better Shea Butter because of the quality of their product and the quality of their customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea butter to make homemade sunscreen (also with Better Shea Butter zinc oxide) and i cant say how wonderful it is. It feels so good on the skin. The recipe book that comes with it is also amazing and full of great ideas. I plan on buying more to make other wonderful products.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it to make all my own DIY skin care products. All natural</li>
            <li> This product is quite well :) and I&#x27;m glad that I got my recipe book ;) it was messy when I got it but it was manageable to clean. It goes on skin very well.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I make my eczema cream and body butter. It smells amazing. This is second batch I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, arrived quickly, in the condition I expected, and has lasted a long time in my homemade EO recipes.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made my own deodorant with this product, and so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Was jus as expected... Thank you</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and even more excited to start experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> I love all natural organic product&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Very happy with this Shea butter. It was correct weight and I would buy larger supplies from them if it was reasonably priced. I made body butter with it!</li>
            <li> loved it. Really good for my skin. my skin feels soft again</li>
            <li> On my third order, and still love it!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is perfect! After purchasing Shea butter from a different seller and it not being of good quality I was nervous about spending more money not knowing what I would get. I read the good reviews of this product better Shea butter and decided to give it a try.. and I&#x27;m glad I did! Had a nice smooth texture and slight nutty smell. Exactly what I was looking for! The body butter I made from this product came out perfect. I will be purchasing my Shea butter from better Shea butter from now on!!</li>
            <li> good product I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Shea butter! I started looking for a raw &amp; organic Shea butter to use in my natural deodarant recipe when I began breastfeeding and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one. It worked so well that I decided to try it on my baby. I threw out all the junk lotions (J&amp;J) I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively on my 14&lt;br /&gt;month old baby from her hair to her feet and with every diaper change for the last five months. Her skin &amp; hair are soft, shiny and well moisturized and she hasn&#x27;t had one diaper rash since! I waited a few months to write a review so I can see the results. It arrived in good condition, smells great (nutty) and melts easily in my hands. Our family of four uses it everyday and it has already lasted five months and it&#x27;s not yet finished! The customer service is AWESOME! The owner Isabella was quick to return my emails. I am a satisfied, lifetime customer! Only wish I could give more stars than 5!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I have a rash on my thighs and legs that wasn&#x27;t looking very attractive.  This helped but leaves the skin very dry looking thereafter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I bought it because I got a sunburn but will use it on my skin every day. It makes my skin so soft. It also makes a difference with my puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few days, but love it so far! I cut off a small chunk to put in another container.  Then I put the remainder in a Quart size Ziplock bag and inserted that in the original paper package! Marcia</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the way I intended yet but I have put some on my hands and lips and it seems very good.</li>
            <li> Always consistently good. Reliable for my lotion bars.  Always arrives fast too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shea butter a couple of weeks ago and love it! It arrived on time, was packaged properly, and I use it by it self as lotion! I am going to look into some of the recipes provided as well. I will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I made lotion with this &amp; it was wonderful. I will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> Came as described I am impressed with the product!  I used it in my homemade deodorant. We each used a pea size and rubbed our hands with it. Better then lotion,  very nourishing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also rubs it on her eczema patch to condition and heal it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to mix with my Ellie&#x27;s Best Fractionated Coconut Oil and make natural deodorant and I love it. Its a very nice consistency and they provide a great ebook for other recipes that I can&#x27;t wait to try! Great product!</li>
            <li> Shipped very well - excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my wife&#x27;s request.  She loves it.  She says the product is fresh, goes on smoothly and smells wonderful.  She will be ordering more shortly.</li>
            <li> Love the 100% unrefined Organic Shea Butter, Use it on my skin during winter time to help maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this and it never disappoints.  A wonderful, consistent product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make the Shea hair conditioner from the free EBOOK</li>
            <li> Top quality incredible feeling product! I made a lavender rosemary whipped butter blend with a few different oils and the result was an ultra hydrating easily absorbed butter. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Very good quality and shipped on time! :)</li>
            <li> Buy this right away!  Use the wonderful recipes that come along with it.  You will not be disappointed!  I thought making my own lotions would be too hard to do, and didn&#x27;t think I had the time...WRONG!  It doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort, and anyone can do it!  I am so grateful for my 60 plus dried body to feel soft again.  And the butter seems to just soak up into your skin so fast.  This is so definitely into my beauty routing each day.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for I have super eczema skin and this is working great, mixing it with hemp oil and Young Living Oils.</li>
            <li> Last forever! This is such a great deal</li>
            <li> A really great product at a great price. After using commercial shea butter products, I tried for the first time to make my own, and it was easier than I thought. It was the best thing I could do for my skin especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Like this product so far. Made me some hand cream with it. Feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love shea butter as I use it as a moisturizer for my skin and as a conditioner for my hair. I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skn and this is one of the very few items that actually work without causing breakouts. A little goes a long way. It is definitely raw and unfefined as described.</li>
            <li> I got my lovely block of Shea butter and immediately used it to make a heavenly whipped body butter. It does have a faint natural smell of its own, but I think I can live with it. Plus, the seller provides a link with many useful recipes, and seems to genuinely care about the product.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I&#x27;ve used! Hands down! Light, fluffy, I love it!</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered from this company. My shea butter is top quality and arrived quickly. I also weighed both orders. It was perfect weight.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever...I will continue to order this. Stock up if you can. Good customer service. Good packaging...The real deal...Don&#x27;t waste time with the other fakes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Shea butter is great quality. Thanks</li>
            <li> Had strong &amp;#34;clay-like&amp;#34; &amp;#34;old-oil&amp;#34; smell which did not agree with me.  Probably natural to this kind of Shea Butter, but I had to add a lot of essential oil to cover it in my lotion products. Otherwise, worked great.</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial moisturizer and it works wonders. My skin instantly glows and I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne is much less prevalent than it was when I use commercial facial moisturizers from WalMart and the like. I even did an experiment to make sure it was the shea butter making the difference in my acne - it definitely was. As soon as I went back to finish off the rest of my store-bought facial moisturizer, my acne flared up again. Also works great on hands and all over the body - although it is a bit of work to get it all soaked in. Takes about 30 minutes for the greasy feeling to go away. I definitely recommend it, though - if for nothing else, then just as a facial moisturizer. The block is big enough to last at least 8 months just for the face.</li>
            <li> This is very good shea butter. It is exactly as pictured. The customer service from this company is excellent. I have ordered from them a couple times and am always pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and quality of product was amazing.  I was pleased since this was my first time purchasing.  Purchased without fear.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> We use this in our diaper creams and love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have recently started making my own natural body butters, scrubs and lip balm and this Shea butter is EXCELLENT! Nice, smooth and full of moisture even by itself. It&#x27;s great even on my toddler. The e book is an excellent gift as well, a good guide for starters. Thank you for a great product! I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I am finally hip to how great raw shea butter is, and all the great things you do with it. I mixed it with different oils and feels great on my skin and hair. I wish I&#x27;d known how easy it was to mix a long time ago I would&#x27;ve been enjoying the benefits of this wonderful product. It&#x27;s one of the best things I ever done for my hair and body I can already see a big difference. I plan to buy more and share it with my mom and sisters. It&#x27;s great for natural hair it makes it soft and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product after purchasing coconut oil in the store.  I wanted to know what all I could do with it, so I searched here and found reviews about people making their own lotion/body butter.  I&#x27;m a simple kinda girl and for me the &amp;#34;simple thing&amp;#34; is to buy my lotion from the store!  But I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This cocoa butter, along with coconut oil and olive oil works wonders for the skin - I literally cannot stop touching myself because of it.  I only began using this because of the benefits of the coconut oil, but I&#x27;ve even noticed reduced stretch marks on my stomach (after 4 babies)!  It works for my oldest son as well, who is now experiencing acne breakouts because of puberty.  He loves it so much that even takes it with him on overnight visits with his friends.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use essential oils because Raw Shea Butter does not have the best smell.  There are pros and cons to everything. :-)</li>
            <li> I am some what of a home mixtress and this shea butter has been the best i have purchased over the internet so far. Its not gritty, its smooth and the smell has the nuttiness that all pure butters have. Im very impressed and plan to purchase this again</li>
            <li> To the folks that complain about the smell; it smells like shea butter. Do you go to the beach then complain that there is sand everywhere or that the ocean is too wet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes packaged nicely and is easy to use. I&#x27;m mixing it with cocoa butter and sweet almond oil and using it to (hopefully) prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Used it to make lotion with my essential oils :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Beautiful raw Shea butter for a great price!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great, high quality product. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a glossy feeling all over your skin, I would recommend it for face use definitely</li>
            <li> Great product, great prices, and excellent customer service and follow up form the seller.  I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Shipping: Perfect timing! Package:Nicely Sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this product was just great. I love shea butter and I use it for all over my face and body.  Does not make me break out at all and the I love the smell of it.  I know some people don&#x27;t like it but I don&#x27;t mind it.  Turns into oil when you heat it with hands, it&#x27;s just awesome!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I have purchased several brands of shea butter, but so far this has been the best. I either use it as is (great) or make my own creams and lotions with it. Wonderful product and will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I just had a chance to use this shea butther very nice texture will buy again</li>
            <li> The best I have used.</li>
            <li> The shea butter from Better Shea Butter is of excellent quality, with no impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with how it&#x27;s worked in my mixtures for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural scent of the butter is obvious when you open the package, and it&#x27;s clear that the butter hasn&#x27;t been processed with chemicals or bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this shea butter!</li>
            <li> Its ok kinda grainy. or so I thought. I whipped it up n its the best. thank u</li>
            <li> Made some amazing body butter with this! Love it. Love the downloadable book!!</li>
            <li> First time user. Product is well packaged and shipped fast. Smell is a bit earthy but not overpowering. It is a bit greasy feeling if your like me and used to squeaky clean and lightweight lotions. That said, it actually feels like I&#x27;m moisturizing my skin now. I just may need to use at night until I get used to the heavier feel of the product.  Whipped a batch for face/body and also dropped a bit into the bath water. So far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never used Shea Butter before so did not have any expectations but it was very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  Price is great and I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to keep buying jars and be wasteful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about a month now to see if my stretch marks would diminish. I bought it because of all the great reviews everyone left but I honestly have not seen a difference in my stretch marks. I used it on both old and new stretch marks and have not really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I used to buy 2-3 lotions every month. That&#x27;s why I decided to make my own with Shea butter! Now I&#x27;m so happy with the result! My skin is much better - soft and moisturized and I apply only every 2 day! My homemade lotion contains - Shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil and jojoba oil! I will never spend again so much money for ready lotions which make my skin even worse!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and good value Shea Butter. I use it to make lotions and shaving creams. Wonderful for your skin!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, I used it to make lip balm already and I&#x27;ll use it for other products as well.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  Great product</li>
            <li> Great product.  Made lotion with it.  Loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had desperately dry skin for years and nothing much has helped except an ammonium lactate lotion that I realized is full of undesireable chemicals.  Tried this shea butter by itself and was first impressed with how long my skin felt hydrated after using it.  I originally bought it to make a body butter that included coconut oil and almond oil, which I really like since the shea is kinda stiff and the oils are, well, oily.  The body butter is easier to spread and soaks into the skin more quickly.  Have no experience with other shea butters but the good ratings of this brand sold me.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> did not get the ebook</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;m ordering this Shea butter. I make my own whipped body butter with it and add aloe vera, avocado oil, sweet almond oil and rosehip oil. This makes my hair and skin look amazing. I no longer buy commercial body moisturizers because that combination is better than anything I have ever used. I never considered putting Shea butter in my hair before but once I did - I was truly impressed and wished I had started using it sooner. Healed my split ends, had my hair looking glossy and super soft to the touch even during this rough winter weather, wool hats and the flat iron. Will continue to purchase this Shea butter. Really good quality and you get a free e recipe book. Not bad for $16.</li>
            <li> I received the shea butter promptly and was very excited to use it.  My first adventure has been making a lotion with half shea butter and half coconut oil.  It was easy and turned out great!  I just down loaded the ebook and plan to make the lotion for eczema next.  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice now.  Good quality, good customer service, and they have a website with recipes. I&#x27;ve made a few body butters and scrubs with this and all have turned out great.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own shea body butter mix.  Great, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Lovely! Made a homemade salve with it. It was easy to work with and soft. The company will also send you a ebook with recipes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Resealable package, the Shea butter itself is Smooth and creamy makes my skin feel great. So far I have used in a foot repair recipe and love it.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time this past weekend to make some lotion bars and really loving this product! It smells good enough to eat, it&#x27;s maleable and easy to work with right out of the packaging, and the end product left my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy in texture.  You not only see the quality of the product in the smoothness and cleanliness, but also in the smell.  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased my Shea Butter from this seller and will continue to be a customer.  Follow up emails regarding quality of service is also a big PLUS.  Kudos to Isabella &amp; the BetterSheaButter team.</li>
            <li> Purchased this with Organic Cocoa Butter and combined them into an awesome head to toe conditioner. The Shea Butter melted well. Smells great. As it is unrefined there will be bits that do not melt.</li>
            <li> So much shea butter for so little and it&#x27;s such a great quality. Perfectly packaged. Recommend using only at night though as it&#x27;s a little greasy for day use. A must have for the winter though.</li>
            <li> Just used this to make sunblock. Real happy with the consistency and the fact that it&#x27;s organic and good enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> Came as expected - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> such a wonderful product! I use it for my hair and it last for months. Glad to have this all natural product for a great price.</li>
            <li> This shea butter makes my skin feel real good and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel gross. Mary little but goes a long ways.. You will need to get a container to out it in or a ziplock bag. I use it on my lips, arms, legs and feet. The smell is real mild. You can just out a little in your hand and rub it in to make it smooth and apply on your body.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent company - very pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li> I love how the Shea butter makes my skin feel. I&#x27;m not wild about the smell, but, I&#x27;m still expirementing with adding the right amount of oils to lessen the Shea smell.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my skin amazingly while still being all natural. I. Love. It.</li>
            <li> I love it, I am able to do many different things with it and helped me avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> Lovely product - am using to make my own skin products.  Good quality - I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
            <li> I used this as one ingredient in a recipe for home made sunscreen. It smells really good and worked wonderfully! I really enjoy putting on my sunscreen now and it works like a charm. I would definitely order more of this shea butter for future recipes.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for what I was making.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> purchased this for my wife and she loves this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Super fast shipping!  Will definitely purchase from again. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sceptic but I gave the organic Shea butter a try.  I loved it. Smooth and easy to work with.  I&#x27;m sure I am going to purchase much more.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter So MUCH! I deep conditioned with it &amp; added coconut oil! And my hair felt like heaven!  It was so moisturized!!  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin but if it works on my hair it&#x27;ll definitely work on my skin. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I made a night cream with it using coconut oil and young living essentional oils, called face lift in a jar</li>
            <li> Great product. And love the free ebook</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter in a cream I make.  It is fantastic on our skin.</li>
            <li> I found a recipe for body butters and this was one of the ingredients. I ordered and am waiting one other ingredient. In the mean time I used a small portion and applied to my face before putting on foundation and it is great. I am not as young as I want to be but after a couple of days my face and neck have shown a more healthy glow. Smoothed out fine lines. Can&#x27;t wait to try with recipe.</li>
            <li> This is the best raw shea butter I have ever tried. Soft enough to make my own skin and hair products. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Shea Butter and I absolutely love it!  I have been using cocoa butter to make my lotion and while I liked it, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the overwhelming white chocolate scent.  When I made my lotion with Shea Butter instead, it was a wonderful scent and I will be purchasing more to make other products!</li>
            <li> Great quality and quick shipping. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, nice piece. Seems to be one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to the shea butter party, but it feels like high quality shea butter (comparing it to shea butter from Sprouts). I like the ability to use both raw and whip it or melt it into something different. The raw shea butter is great for really dry skin, and as a natural lip balm, because it&#x27;s more solid and less oily than if you whip it. I love that the purchase comes with an e-book, there are a lot of really awesome recipes and just interesting information to learn about Shea butter and skin care in the book. The sellers are really responsive to questions or emails.&lt;br /&gt;For context, I initially purchased this to make lotion bars. It works great for everything I&#x27;ve tried! definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> headline says it all, pliable, smooth, good for many uses</li>
            <li> Packaging needs help,  the product is hard to remove from the package and store properly. I ended up having to soften it and put into a large glass jar. Otherwise, the product melts well and incorporates well.  It has all the moisturizing properties that I&#x27;ve come to expect from shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use this in my original shea butter hair moisturizer recipes exclusively. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the yellowish/orange gritty mess that you can get from others.  This shea butter is smooth, consistent and melts with hand temperature (as it should). Great price. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> so impressed with this product, im handing out samples to friends.  its taken me a long time to find such a premier, unadulterated shea butter experience at such an incredibly reasonable price.  will purchase this again and again.  many thanks.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product. When I received it, i took a small amount from the package and rubbed it on the back of one hand. I noticed an immediate difference in the skin on the treated hand. It was incredibly soft and felt smoother(younger) than the skin on the other hand. Even Hubby could feel the difference. Now several days later after only one application, the skin feels the same. Im thrilled at how good this is for my skin and also excited that it is unrefined and 100% organic. I dont love the smell, but it fades within a couple of hours of application. Its well worth the smell to get these results from a product with no harmful man made chemicals. I plan to use it on the ends of hair to help split ends and on my scalp for hair growth as well as on my skin. The book is a nice little bonus. No problem with download and its actually a really nice book with great and easy recipes. Makes me feel like Im getting more bang for my buck. Love it. Will suggest to others and will purchase again. No problems with delivery. The company is professional and I feel that they appreciate my buisness.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, I&#x27;m not like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Shea Butter.  My skin is beginning to show aging and I was looking for something to provide lasting moisture, without a bunch of chemicals.  This is a very good product for what I was looking for.  I have been using it plain for a week now, warming it in my hand and spreading on arms and legs, which then stay hydrated and soft for at least 24 hours.  The seller is very attentive and interested in assuring my satisfaction.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Some of the best shea butter ever. I use this seller for all of my shea butter purchases. Was delivered quickly and packaged perfectly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, I used this for making body butter and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> works great for all my homemade stuff.</li>
            <li> Used this shea butter to make lip balms and body butter lotion. Love how soft it leaves your skin. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> use this in a little bit of everything</li>
            <li> My daughter and I spent the afternoon making up different creams and lotions with the Shea butter and essential oils! LOVE IT! So smooth and soft and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made a heavy duty pain cream for me, one for my daughter&#x27;s eczema, a sleepy time lotion for the kids and some lotion for feet and chest for the upcoming flu and cold season. And we&#x27;ve only used 1/2 lb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used product about two weeks, not daily but maybe every other day.  I like it very much because the texture is easy to apply and it&#x27;s feels rich.  Seems to heal minor scrapes and insect bites quickly.  I would buy again and recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth&lt;br /&gt;Houston</li>
            <li> Shea Butter so good for skin!</li>
            <li> I have recently bought my second batch of this raw shea butter, and I love it! I use it in the raw form right after the shower. I have had very dry skin on my body since my early childhood, and have always used moisturizers after I shower. This shea butter is a better &amp;#34;24-hour&amp;#34; moisturizer than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. It also is great for my sensitive skin. I also pat a TINY bit on my face after the shower, and no break outs! The only thing is that some people don&#x27;t like the smell.... I actually really like the smell, but either way, it fades within the first hour.</li>
            <li> Why use products full of chemicals when nature feels, smells and works this great. Best quality Shea Butter I have used. It heals rashes and cuts.....Smells edible. I will try your cocoa butter next.....thank you for this high quality product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Highly recommend to everybody - and their follow-up after the purchase was unbelievable!!  I&#x27;ve purchased this multiple times.  GREAT quality product!!</li>
            <li> It came to me sealed, and at the correct weight. The smell is a little strong, but it&#x27;s not bad. I love making my body creams from this, they come out light and easy to rub in. The best part for me is I don&#x27;t have to melt the butter to get any leaves and twigs out. That is a lifesaver for me as a beginner, so I deal with heating the mixtures only half as much.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and product is of great quality</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and rich, but I&#x27;m not fond of the smell. Makes my skin very soft, and works well in sunblock too!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was just what I wanted. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m loving it to make our lotions, and lotion bars. Came packaged as pictured, smells fantastic, and works really well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only Shea butter I have purchased and it is wonderful! I wish I would have found it sooner! It was recommended by wellness mama and I love love love it!!!!! So soft and creamy. Very good quality and not grainy :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived prior to the anticipated date. I used it to make homemade essential oil deodorant and couldn&#x27;t he happier with the result. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> We purchased this to help with my daughter&#x27;s eczema after finding out she&#x27;s allergic to coconut oil, many of today&#x27;s moisturizers have some amount of coconut oil. We decided to go with as few ingredients as possible and thought &amp;#34;why not Shea&amp;#34;. This Shea has a sort of sculpting clay consistency that melts away when rubbed between the hands. If you&#x27;ve never used Shea before (like us) know that it feels a little waxy on the skin but absorbs very quickly leaving soft supple skin behind. I have started using this, exclusively, as our moisturizer. It simply works. She no longer has those rough spots and my skin has never looked to smooth and beautiful, well perhaps as a baby.</li>
            <li> this stuff is magical!! Perfect for my oily skin! Its the perfect moisturizer!! I use it for my whole body and its even perfect for my stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!!  Great value and great product!!</li>
            <li> love it , got it fast and my skin seems to enjoy it as well - thank you</li>
            <li> Great quality of Shea butter I will be ordering again and different products. I&#x27;m was so happy when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and the customer service is beyond great; I received an answer to a question within minutes on a Saturday evening!! Very good for eczema.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and flaky after applying this product</li>
            <li> Plopped a dab on my teen&#x27;s chin acne (had 2 really red pimples), and within an hour, they were looking almost &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. PLUS, I love love love how my skin is feeling after only a day.</li>
            <li> I was recommended Shea Butter by my pedicurist, and after some research found this one to have the best reviews. I emailed the company and requested a sample, received it immediately and it truly deserves the Great reviews !!  Have used it on my heels that were very dry/cracked and what a difference.  Have also used on my elbows and hands; Wow, makes them so soft.  I can honestly say this has had a huge benefit for my skin.  Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Use as lotion for skin and facial moisturizer. I like the consistency of this shea butter</li>
            <li> This is wonderful Shea butter!! I use it all winter long and never have dry skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have made several lotions already.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an amazing and affordable product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I&#x27;m planning to use this Shea Butter to make body butters for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> The best dark spot ever it doesn&#x27;t reduce dark spot but remove completely all you need its patience because it takes time.</li>
            <li> I recently received my shipment of ivory shea butter from Better Shea Butter, and I absolutely love it!!! The highest quality shea butter I&#x27;ve ever come across, it makes my dry skin baby soft:) I would also like to add that I could not be more pleased with the customer service, which has been incredibly helpful and friendly, and the free e-book that comes with the order is packed with useful recipes. Thank you, BetterShea, for amazing product and service!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Four out of five because of smell. I made a recipe with cocunut oil and essencial oils, and found it very hard to mask the Shea smell, still practicing..  My teenage daughter who has eczema does not like the smell mixed with her skin.   found it very soft, not greasy. One of the best things to put on skin, so teenage daughter has to deal with the smell.</li>
            <li> Simple! This stuff is great! Without going into all the details, I was able to put down my RX cream that I have been using for a year. No more scratching, and my skin has not been this smooth in years!&lt;br /&gt;Isabella is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product &amp; great customer support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing / using shea butter. As a resent natural, I&#x27;m trying to get my hair staples in order, my hair has been battling dryness since my big chop. I&#x27;ve done A LOT of research and this brand had the best reviews and ratings. I whipped it up with coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, avacado oil, Jamaican black castor oil, sweet almond oil, and vitamin E oil. I ended up with TWO 12OZ jars worth !!!! This is definitely a staple in my hair care now! My hair is so soft now and the shea butter cream really helps seal in the moisture. I&#x27;ve seen shea butter cheaper at my local beauty supply but I chose this one because it had the best reviews as far as quality, quantity, and customer service... And now I see why.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the bomb!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;m completely sold on this!  I&#x27;ve used it to make body butter and it&#x27;s so soft and creamy - my skin loves it.  I also want to thank the owner for her prompt follow up. Great customer service!!</li>
            <li> Really great quality, just wish it was packaged differently.  Since it is so soft, it being shrink wrapped makes it a little troublesome to get to it all.  It would be better if it were packaged in some type of solid container.  However, this is really a minor issue, because again, the quality is superb!</li>
            <li> Using it to make chapstick.  Came well packaged.  Nice product!  Would order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter source that I found that is organic.  And the price is great for the amount that you get.  Shea butter has so many benefits an I&#x27;m glad to have found a seller that sells true organic raw shea butter. I melt it down and mix it with my fav oils, then I let it harden and whip it with my hand mixer and it makes a great cream that I use as soon as I step out the shower.  Yes it is somewhat thick, but once your skin absorbs it, your skin feels naturally smooth, not oily.  You skin will glow, feel great and even out.  This is great for anyone with sensitive skin because it&#x27;s not packed with all the chemicals and fragrances.</li>
            <li> I only use this shea butter! It is such great quality!!! I love using this for homemade body butter. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works great for what we need it for. We are finding that it has a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> I have liked the quality compared to other brands I have used. I would order again. Great for dry skin and eczema!</li>
            <li> Have ordered this a few times to make custom lotion with essential oils. High quality product!</li>
            <li> Good product and a lot of helpful information. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is amazing! Quality processing which created an amazing smell, and texture.  Thank you, and I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it to make my own body butter. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this item for all of my DIY body butters and in spa treatments. Clients love it.</li>
            <li> Works great and wonderful customer service from company. They love their customers and their product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Because of this wonderful Shea Butter, I have carefully crafted my very own Body Butter Company titled. &amp;#34;Organically Yours&amp;#34;. Thank you so much for your speedy response and delivery. I will be ordering once again from you. this you can count on. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a refined 100% shea butter from the now brand and thought I liked it till I tried this. HUGE difference! This is more like butter and clay then the other stuff which was harder, lighter colored and had less of a smell. I turned mine into a whipped up concoction with some organic coconut oil and essential oils. And it feels great! It is oily but absorbs fast my skin actually feels better hours later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is worth a try!! I didn&#x27;t like the idea of using it by itself so that&#x27;s why I whipped it with coconut oil into a lotion. By itself it can be a little crumbly and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive the e-book like it mentions in the description. Maybe that will come later by email?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!! So happy I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I emailed about the ebook and they responded quickly, fixing the problem. Great customer service!!</li>
            <li> I bought the Shea butter to make my own lotion. When I opened the bag for the first time I was blown away by the wonderful smell! This product was everything I was hoping for. It blends very well with the other ingredients for my lotion. I will definitely be purchasing from them again!</li>
            <li> First time user of Shea Butter. It worked up beautifully in my lotion~smelled good. Order was prompt. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  Good stuff - high quality. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with making my own body butters and this is fantastic. I use coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vegetable glycerin and essential oils in my recipe.</li>
            <li> Very good product! I used it on a skin irritation  on my elbow, instant relief, irritation  was gone after about 6 days! Makes my skin look and feel so healthy, i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff is amazing. It smells so good, and is the perfect texture. It is a little more than I normally spend for unrefined shea butter, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Used it to make lotion bars.  They turned out wonderful with YL essential oils!</li>
            <li> Comes packaged as shown. The big difference between this and several other brands/types of Shea butter (which I have purchased and used) is that this is very soft. It is not hard and crumbly, as many are; it is not grainy, as most are; it is not pre-whipped and full of air, as some are. This is a wonderful product and very easy to use. However, if you have used other Shea butter in the past in various recipes, whether lip balm or hand lotion, be aware that you may need to alter your recipes slightly if you use this product. Because it is naturally soft instead of hard and crumbly, your finished product will also be softer. This is not a bad thing! For my lip balms I simply increased the amount of beeswax in the recipe and for my Shea lotion I added a little &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; butter (like mango or cocoa) so the consistency would turn out more firm at the end. If you&#x27;re just making a whipped body butter you shouldn&#x27;t need to alter the recipe. Oh, I should mention that the scent is mild and pleasant. Some kinds of Shea can be on the stinky side but both times I&#x27;ve purchased this product it has been grayish-white with a light scent.</li>
            <li> i just started using this product to make eczema cream for my son.  i had several questions along the way and am very happy to say that the gal at this company responded immediately. wow! that hardly ever happens, right :-).  anyway she answered my questions and off and running i am.  i have ordered another batch and just got done making my christmas presents (hello whipped lavender/ lemongrass body and hair cream).  thank you for helping me make lovely products for my skin that are natural.</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff. Will try the yellow next time. there was a slight gray color when whipped it up for the lotion body butter but it did not impact my love for it at all! Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is excellent! If you want an economical, all natural, vegetarian, super luxurious moisterizer this is it. It has  a very light earthy odor that disappears as it is rubbed into the skin. I bought it for my chemical sensitive daughter, and the whole family ended up using it. Good effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and seemed to be of consistant quality.  I made body butter with coconut oil, etc. and it turned out great, although it took a lot of essential oils to cover up the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34;, and odor is still present.  It is not an unpleasant smell, but hard to cover up...it does not linger on the skin.</li>
            <li> Best ever, this company is great to deal with and the product is the best. My favorite is a facial cream recipe that I use and it definitely has messed wrinkles and dryness. Will order over and over again. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Great quality, and the smell is oh so awesome chocolate.  I use this for lotions and hair conditioner, and a little goes a long way.  It soaks into the skin quickly and keeps skin soft.  For hair and scalp, use on the ends of the hair unless you&#x27;re doing a scalp therapy before washing your hair.  Lots of recipes out there to make.  Experiment and find a favorite.  Happy with my purchase, and will happily purchase again.</li>
            <li> High quality, fair price, overall excellent product!</li>
            <li> I just bought it recently but wanted to share how soft it is and how amazing it smells! I bought the SHEA and COCOA and mixed them together with some Vitamin E! So far so good. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is doing miracles to my skin. The seller is wonderful. They&#x27;ll answer all your questions and help you with any issues. Also, it was great to get the recipes eBook with a ton of options for all kinds of conditions.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> great stuff! I use it for child&#x27;s eczema. its texture is much smoother and softer then others and it arrives really fresh and packaged well. thanks for such great product! beats the petroleum creams for sure. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my Shea Butter purchase. It arrived promptly and well packaged. I&#x27;m currently experimenting with organic, nbatural recipes for &amp;#34;body lotion bars&amp;#34; and this product was a great addition to my Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, Organic Bees Wax, Vitamin E, and drops of an essential oil. I will be purchasing more of this Raw Shea Butter in the future!</li>
            <li> I thought that this was the same as the other order that I placed. It&#x27;s not. This shea butter is creamy and nice but it is way less than my last order. My last order lasted about 6 months. I don&#x27;t see this lasting my family very long.</li>
            <li> this product itsa miracle for my hair!!!love it love it love it</li>
            <li> Product is great, packaging is great.  I keep buying it! :-)</li>
            <li> Good product. Great company!</li>
            <li> Everything about this was positive the packaging arrived in a timely matter and was easy to work with smooth and wonderful I would use this seller again</li>
            <li> Not even sure where to begin.  I love Shea Butter and have ordered from several different sites over the years, but I will never from them again!  I loved the way it was packaged in a resealable package.  It was soft and doesn&#x27;t have any grit.  I received it in a timely manner.  I just really loved this shea butter so far!  I mixed it with my emu oil and it keeps my skin so soft all day since I have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> The *Best* Shea Butter by far!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful and I love that it came with an eBook so now I can make my own creams. I highly recommend ordering this and they also have a coco butter product I will be getting as well!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter. It&#x27;s perfect for the winter months. I whip mines with castor oil and my skin stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my skin and hair with awesome results. A little goes along way, I will definitely be purchasing again. Great customer service as well!!</li>
            <li> Has not let me down yet and I have ordered multiple times. Good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I saw a video on the benefits of Shea butter for the hair, so I decided to try it, best decision ever!. Not only was it good for the hair, its good for the skin too.  I am attributing my successful to this awesome product from Better Shea Butter.  Their Shea Butter is surely 100%.  It has a nice consistency, it&#x27;s easy to cut and distributed into separate containers, mixes very well with other oils, melts easily over a steam bath while maintaining it&#x27;s rich Shea butter smell.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it on my skin, put on my feet with cotton socks at night and use it as a deep conditioner for my hair.  I happen to like the slightly smokey scent.  It melts in your hand immediately and there&#x27;s no greasy feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay a fortune for products that are 1% shea when you can get 100% shea at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing for making body butters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream-like paste.  The smell is not great bit is not terrible either. I used to mix it with coconut oil first but nowi got used to the smell so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.  It helped my dry, cracked,  peeling skin through the winter.  I&#x27;ll definately order again. It last for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> great products have been using for years no problem with shipping and price is great</li>
            <li> Silky smooth lotion with this Shea butter</li>
            <li> This is the first timei have ordered Shea butter from your company and i am delighted! The package shipped quickly ,weighed, and the product is exactly the high quality i was seeking. Look forward to ordering again</li>
            <li> Love this butter for all kinds of recipes. It comes soft and fresh to my door!!! Will order again and again and again!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shea butter I have ever ordered or used. I will look no further and will order this over and over again!</li>
            <li> First, kudos to the vendor on the speediness of my order...less than a week! AND I live in Guam, so thank you for that!  The product is excellent.  Coconut oil is my daily moisturizer, but lately my skin has been very tight and dry and the coconut just hasn&#x27;t been cutting it. I did a little research on how to treat dry skin naturally and found many great reviews about shea butter.  This product is raw and organic so I wanted to give it a try.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I used it before bed last night, took a shower in the morning but since my skin felt so moisturized I just topped it with coconut oil and my skin was happy the entire day! It may be too heavy for me for daytime use so I&#x27;ll just continue to use it right before bed.  I would recommend this to anyone who might need something a little richer than coconut oil. One final note, the vendor also provides a free shea butter recipe booklet....how awesome!</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own lotion and it works great..... It works so great I am actually just using it by itself for lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this product, high quality, excellent for making creams and lotions</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this shea butter.  It makes the best body butter!</li>
            <li> What can I say besides this is an amazing product!! The quality is great.... I actually really liked the packaging it makes it easy to access your product as well as keeping it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shea butter on my face. ..hair and even followed the directions in the ebook to make a body cream!! The next project will be the sun screen..... Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Good product, nice nutty smell and good smooth consistency but the packing is messy, plastic wrap, and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells better than many of the other brands of shea butter that I have used.  I like to ivocry shea a bit better than the yellow since it seems easier to melt and mix and its scent is not quite so overpowering.</li>
            <li> We ordered our Shea butter for our 7 month old daughter with severe chronic dermatitis. We use it to whip up a body butter for her. After the first use, her skin was so supple. The owner has messaged us personally to check on our satisfaction and then again to check on us.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is prompt and above standard, and the product is far above average. We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> How have I gone without this product??? Used it to made body butter and lip balm. Delivery was great and product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect Shea Butter for my body butter bars. I use it for everything to my hair, skin, and even to soften my feet. The packaging is great and the Shea Butter is so smooth as melts to the touch. I definitely look forward to purchasing more products from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Mild smell, very smooth, no lumps, super hydrating, very pure. I use it all over my skin, and daily on my face. Very thick and oily, but that&#x27;s what I like. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. I really lOVE this shea butter. the quality is exactly like the one,&lt;br /&gt;I use back home in Nigeria. so soft and creamy. i use it for my hair and skin, and i am not disappointment at all</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter so I&#x27;m not sure what it is typically like, but this has been working really well in my homemade lotions. Also feels great just rubbed into skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this only to find my mom using it all, haha!  Apparently, she loves it, too!  It is solid, yet so creamy and warms up easily in your hands.  Smells wonderful and I can&#x27;t wait to utilize the free recipe book!  Finally, their customer service is amazing.  I highly recommend this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> Smells like typical shea butter.  Well packaged in a thick bag with a resealable zip top.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful!  My 6 month old has suffered with eczema since he was a little over two months old and I have tried many products.  I prefer to treat holistically and wanted to give this a try since his skin was beyond dry.  He felt like a reptile, not a baby :(  After two days of applying the shea butter, I have seen a HUGE difference.  His skin is no longer red and patchy, but soft like a baby&#x27;s skin should be.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Excellent customer service and follow up</li>
            <li> Shea butter was grainy and does not melt easily on your skin.  Its winter and freezes quickly.  Made a hugh mess. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I just recently got into lotion making since my son is allergic to a lot of lotions. This shea butter is the perfect addition to my ingredients. It smells great and really great on the skin on its own.</li>
            <li> this butter good but not as expected as it would soften and smoothen my skin ( I have normal to dry)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this Shea butter. Comes packaged well (sealed in plastic inside the bag) and is great quality. I have purchased twice and very happy both times.</li>
            <li> Customer service has been wonderful. I havent had a chance to use this for all the reasons I bought it yet but I have been using in on my face and it feel amazing. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great and affordable raw Shea butter!! I&#x27;m in love! Company is great and provided recipes to help in making my own cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be fine for my beard.</li>
            <li> This Unrefined Organic Shea Butter is a great product to purchase if you are looking for a natural hair and skin moisturizer for yourself or as a gift. This particular brand comes in both ivory and yellow. I have used two other brands of Shea Butter and wanted to try this one because of the creamier texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This Shea Butter comes in a plastic Ziploc bag that you can continue to use or you can easily remove the butter and store it somewhere different. I prefer, to store the butter in something different because once you start to run out it gets harder to get it out of the plastic. I use this on both my hair and skin at least weekly and have ordered it for almost everyone I know. So far, everyone loves it almost as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With regular use, once every day to two days, my skin is noticeably softer and my skin tone is more even. If I continue to use it regularly, I have noticed that my stretch marks will appear smaller and less noticeable. However, for reducing the look of stretch marks specifically I have found that Raw African Shea Butter[[ASIN:B0009MHJE4 African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold) 8 Oz.]] works a lot better. Although because it doesn&#x27;t have the creamy texture this brand has it is much harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am a big fan of Shea Butter. When used regularly my skin and hair are soft and supple, scars heal faster, and I do not have to be paranoid about my dark skin looking dry or applying lotion multiple times a day. This is my second favorite brand of Shea Butter. The texture makes it easy to use and the scent is pleasant and not heavy. I love ordering this for friends and family who are looking for a natural and versatile moisturizer. The packaging it comes in is good for shipping but I prefer to store the Shea Butter in a reused body butter container. I would definitely buy this product again or for someone else.</li>
            <li> Lovely, high quality Shea butter.  The recipe book they include is a wonderful addition.  The seller interaction was A+</li>
            <li> Nice Product.  I used it to make body butter and packaged in small jars for a bridal shower favor.  Came out great.</li>
            <li> I had never used Shea butter, the first one I ordered was very grainy and it only works if I melted it first. This one is so much more creamy and soft  that I was able to rub it into my skin without heating it first. I was not very happy about the free book that you need to go to their website to download I was required to use my Amazon Secret code to get the book and I was reluctant to do so but I did and then I did not even get the book.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. The company was good about following up with my purchase. I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before so didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Seems to have worked fine for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> Great for making body butters!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re making our own deodorant now and this is GREAT! Thank yoU!</li>
            <li> Love the Shea Butter! It is great for making all kinds of DIY beauty products. I have made lip balm, lotion bars and plan to make more. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My favorite shea butter! Makes wonderful lotions, just made another batch. Will be back for more soon. Great seller!</li>
            <li> while I really didnt enjoy the batch of shea butter that I got, the customer service was amazing! They emailed me just to see if I liked the product and enjoyed using it. When I said I really didnt like it much they apologized and refunded my money right away. Very refreshing and nice.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service! Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is the answer to your problem. Absorbs rapidly and softens your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit up front that this is my first time using unrefined shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands or sellers, but this shea butter is so amazing I will not be purchasing from anyone else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a neat little brick, just as the picture shows, and is within a baggie in the raw shea butter bag which is also pictured (both are resealable). So far I&#x27;ve made two batches of whipped body butter (from a recipe I found on the internet) and made a face cream from the recipe book that&#x27;s given to you with the purchase of this shea butter. Everything has been amazing and my skin looks ridiculously healthy! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting colder where I live, so the shea does take a bit of working with, whether it be the brick or the face cream that I made, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. When I put this on my skin it is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be re-purchasing as Christmas is getting closer and I would love to give out some homemade gifts. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love it, amazing instant results!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I get headaches from using this product.  But I am sure its a great product for someone else.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and customer service !  Worked perfectly for making body butter.</li>
            <li> I love my Shea Butter</li>
            <li> The product comes in a resealable package. I used it to make a creamy at home hair product. the results were great. I did not receive the free skin book which I was looking forward to using.</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter ever fab company too</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  I found the e-book interesting but I like to keep things simple and just put it between my fingers to melt and then put on my face morning and night.  Been using for several months now.  I&#x27;m going to share with my neighbor because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product and even better customer service.  They checked with me 2 times to make sure I was able to download the free recipe guide.  I bought it specifically to make body butter which turned out to be spectacular.  Now I can&#x27;t wait to try their recipes.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter!!! It cuts easily, melts quickly and made my foot balm a dream!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Just received this Shea butter in the mail and used it in my first balm recipe.  The purity, consistency, and scent were perfect, and it blended like a champ.  I&#x27;ll be using Better Shea Butter products from now on!</li>
            <li> It came as described. It&#x27;s my first time using/working with shea butter, so I&#x27;m not really sure what to compare it to. Made some lotion bars today with it today and it melted down just fine. I&#x27;m a happy camper thus far!</li>
            <li> Great product! Solved my skin problem! Only thing that worked!</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it hor my hair and for my skin. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I used this as an ingredient for Wellness Mama&#x27;s Bug Bars and it worked well. My Bug Bars did not melt, even in the hot car over summer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Love this! And the seller is super sweet!</li>
            <li> Feels good on my crusty feet lol. Awakens your face so u don&#x27;t look sleepy. Not too greasy. Don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Great for making homemade lotion!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it in my beauty routine.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It works beautifully, and it costs so much less than the fancy schmancy brands in &amp;#34;skin care&amp;#34; shops and departments.  My knuckles, hands, feet, and cuticles were cracked and dry.  No More!!  A little goes a very long way and , by all means, use the recipes that come with it to whip it up into a lighter consistency and add your favorite essential oils...although I do not add fragrance to mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the testing process, but so far I really like.</li>
            <li> Never used shea butter-- it&#x27;s got an odd smell, but it served its purpose for the homemade products I was making.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing shea butter and I am very happy with the product and results. I whipped it into a lotion and it is so very smooth. There is a slight earthy/ nutty scent to it. Looking forward to experimenting with the shea butter.</li>
            <li> Made sunscreen with it and love it</li>
            <li> i bought the ivory butter and use it all over my body and face everyday and in just a few days i have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin feels and looks, i highly recomend it isspecially if your prone to dry flaky legs like i am. when you first put it on it seems a bit heavy and greasy especially if you dont heat it up first but once it soaks into your skin its like heaven</li>
            <li> This is great Shea Butter, not real odoriferous, can be covered up with essential oils.  This butter is sold as &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but unrefined Shea Butter is never white, as one reviewer already noted.  This butter is indeed the color of raw Shea Butter, more of a cream color, perhaps a little lighter than others I&#x27;ve bought.  I use a lot of Shea butter, so I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  Take note that this butter is higher priced because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s not certified organic.  Although this is certainly a great butter, as I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that much better to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Great quality and fast service.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of Better Shea Butter. Love how it makes my skin feel. Nice smell. Definitely will be ordering some when the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! High quality and great price. And so much less greasy than coconut oil!</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought two, one for me and my friend and we absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Butter from various sources for years primarily on my hands...I&#x27;m a hand drummer and when I used natural cowhide drumheads, they would suck out the oils from my hands... Lately I have used this particular brand/source and bottled my own to share with family and friends... One friend raves about it due to his hands cracking severely from Bar tending and continuously washing his hands without gloves...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great Shea butter. It is very soft and pliable. The smell is on the &#x27;smokier&#x27; side, but it becomes less noticeable when blended with other oils. Overall, this is a good butter and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are already familiar with Shea Butters. If you&#x27;ve never used unrefined Shea before though, the smoky nutty smell can take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that I had some questions and concerns about this butter, which I spoke to the seller about, and she was quick to address my issue and very generous in her response! You don&#x27;t see a lot of sellers giving such great customer service. I would most definitely but this again, for the quality AND the great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have bought a couple different packages of shea butter from Amazon and this was the best yet!  Packaged great, super smooth butter, great smell!</li>
            <li> Great product. It is smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t have a great smell, but this is just the nature of shea butter. It claims to be organic, but I don&#x27;t see that it is certified organic...? Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It is great shea butter for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described! I used it already in my first batch ever of Shea body butter. I will definitely be purchasing more in the very near future.  It is so soft, it&#x27;s insane!  Why didn&#x27;t I know about this earlier?  I&#x27;m never going back to store bought lotions!</li>
            <li> So smooth and rich. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I am using it in lotion,sunscreen and lip balm.</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter out there and great customer care with emails.  This has a creamy delicious Shea nutty smells. Not gritty at all. I melt it to make my own facial night moisturizer adding essential oils to it.  I&#x27;ve purchased other brands but this is the BEST</li>
            <li> Really happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s softer than I expected and mixes well with other products like coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast shipping and amazing follow up by the business. My skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> Loooooove this stuff!! I learn a new way to use it all the time! Recently my husband had a horrible bicycle accident and completely pulled the skin from a rather large section of his knee. It was awful, oozing and red and not even gauze or cloth was ok to put on it as it would stick and hurt when we changed the dressing. We applied Melrose oil from YoungLiving and then after a few days it scabbed over (thankfully the oil killed the pain and kept the infection at bay). Then we started putting this shea butter on it. Oh boy did it start to heal fast!! We couldn&#x27;t believe it!! Just a few days and it was remarkably better, and a week or so later it was virtually healed. Amazing stuff!!! It&#x27;s great on my crazy dry face, on my hands, and I have used it on burns with great results. Keep a jar in your house!! It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter from other vendors, but this one is by far the smoothest &amp; most effective. Other ones I tried were grainy (although I didn&#x27;t know how smooth shea butter could be at that time) and tended to stay on my skin as an &amp;#34;oily barrier&amp;#34; that came off easily when I washed my hands or if my skin got rubbed with clothes or towels, and I had to reapply. This shea butter gets absorbed quickly and does not leave that sticky feel as much other ones. This is the only shea butter I feel comfortable putting on my face, and I do believe the seller&#x27;s claim that it is non-comedogenic. I have acne prone combination skin, so I only use tiny bit under my eyes and spread it onto cheeks. For body, I make whipped shea butter and use it once in the morning and once in the evening after shower. This shea butter smells pretty much like other shea butter, with the hint of nutty scent which I like, but my family didn&#x27;t really like the smell so maybe it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers say the seller is super friendly and helpful. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> great quality product!</li>
            <li> Great quality Shea butter!</li>
            <li> Just started using it and so far I love it!! I love the smooth texture and when applied to your skin it goes on just as smooth and silky not too greasy just perfect for me. I will be a regular customer and will also recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Great butter, not grainy and really smooth.  Makes your skin look AWESOME if you just use it daily for 30 days.</li>
            <li> I made facial cream using the raw shea butter and I love it!  I have very sensitive skin and have had no negative reaction so far.  The shea butter was very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;m using it to make my own beard and mustache waxes. This product is a great way to do that. Takes some experimentation with all the other ingredients I&#x27;m using but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product. I have certainly found my supplier for Shea butter. Nothing but goodness!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is wonderful. It comes double packaged, which is nice and it smells fresh--I couldnt wait to use it. I will be purchasing from here again in the future, but it may be a while becuase this stuff lasts a long time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packaged. Product is great and has helped all of our chapped hands here on the east coast during this bitter cold.  I will be buying more!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product . I whipped it with almond oil for my face and I have an amazing night cream !&lt;br /&gt;I also whipped with Argan oil for my daughter&#x27;s hair , it makes it soft and straight with no even greasiness .&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great for making your own beauty products</li>
            <li> I liked that it came in a thick plastic bag that I could heat up</li>
            <li> Amazing, gorgeous, luscious Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter for my hair &amp; skin !! It works wonders !! Love the shea butter! !</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter!!  I made a body butter with the Shea Butter and it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shea butter!!! :-) I purchased a yellow shea butter last time,3lbs it took me a year to use it all,and I was pretty much happy with it.UNTIL NOW,This ivory shea butter,is much lighter and softer,and absorbs better into my skin.Last shea butter was actually annoying to put on.NOW I put this on at LEAST half my body every night :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure if the last order,of the yellow was &amp;#34;grade a&amp;#34; or not.Being my first shea butter purchase,I didnt know the difference,NOW I DO. I will NEVER purchase anything else. Thank you :-)))</li>
            <li> I want high quality body care products without all the chemicals.  I also have a lot of allergies and want to have more control over the ingredients in my products.  This company provides excellent customer service and will answer questions promptly. I feel empowered to give this a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter specifically because I am pursuing a healthier lifestyle in general, and this shea butter is both organic and unrefined- in other words &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;.  I was really surprised and very happy that my purchase came with a free downloadable recipe book.  So I made the shea and coconut body butter, and it is absolutely wonderful!  It&#x27;s easy to make, the directions are very clear, and I have a wonderful jar of rich, creamy completely natural body butter that is working wonders on my dry winter skin.  Excellent product and I will definitely order again!  Packaging is exactly what&#x27;s needed- no more, no less, no waste!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter!!! It melts beautifully into the skin and adds a lovely glow to my face when left in over night. The smell is amazing and earthy, but in no way offensive or overpowering. There is nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to after bath skin creme.  If you have extremely dry skin, this will keep you hydrated all day while correcting the dryness.  There has been great improvement in my complexion since diligently using it after baths and showers.  I placed some in a small container and carry it in my purse as a hand creme also.</li>
            <li> Much better than the tub of shea butter I was ordering from another site.</li>
            <li> i have never bought shea butter, so I have nothing to compare it to. I don&#x27;t love the smell but it does make my skin soft. fast shipping and good communication. thank you.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m normally extremely, well, cheap, with the ingredients I buy for my beauty product projects.I&#x27;m more of the old school French cuisine theory where even the lowliest ingredient can be elevated by good technique, or something. I was looking for shea butter for a hand balm and almost bought one of the other first page search results that was far far less expensive. Then I read its reviews and it sounded awful. In an uncharacteristic fit of excess I sprang for this one instead and ohhhh my gods above and below, it&#x27;s heavenly. It&#x27;s like frosting. I wanted to eat it with a spoon. It&#x27;s worth every penny and then some. If you were waffling at all on buying this brand or not, waffle no further, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> In the last six months, I have purchased three different kinds of she butter for my hard lotion and body butter. This is the only one that I had a negative reaction to. I have read that some people react differently to different shea butters because of the latex content and now I believe it. This product was not grainy and the weight was spot on. I hate throwing stuff out but I can&#x27;t use this. Their cocoa butter is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, it is the smoothest, softest ivory shea I&#x27;ve ever bought. It actually looks exactly like the picture! and it was perfect for my hair conditioner,</li>
            <li> This arrived in great shape and is exactly what I hoped for! I was making body butter and it seems very pure and fine. Happy!</li>
            <li> Good product. ..I only wish it could come in a container instead of plastic bag...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 packages so far of this Shea Butter and in comparison to others I have bought, this one is super creamy with a pleasant scent.  I use it in whipped body butters that I sell and I&#x27;ve had nothing but compliments and raving reviews and I believe it&#x27;s due to this high quality Shea butter!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the owner is fabulous to work with!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a high quality Unrefined Organic Shea Butter, this is the one to buy!  I will never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter before and loved it but this is even better that the stuff I had had previously. It is easier to apply to the skin because it is soft and malleable. I love the smell of it. And my skin already feels the benefit after only one application. I have dry patches of skin that already look and feel a lot softer! I love that you only have the one ingredient so you can feel safer that there are no nasty surprises in here. And its very reasonably priced for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand for the first time because of the positive reviews. I was not at all disappointed. I used the Shea Butter 3 different ways this past weekend and the result for all 3 ways was amazing.  First... I used it as a detangling conditioner in my 4yr old daughters&#x27; hair. I simply melted a small amount of Shea Butter and applied it to her hair while at the sink. I massaged it through and I immediately noticed my daughters&#x27; hair began to soften. I was able to comb it through without one single tear from my daughter or myself. Once I rinsed it out I was able to run my fingers through her hair with ease. It rinsed out quickly.  Second... I used the Shea Butter as a hair moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t used heat to dry my daughters&#x27; naturally kinky curly hair in over 6 months. I simply flat twist her hair and let it air dry overnight. I used the Shea as moisturizing product. First I had to soften the Shea Butter in a blinder so I could use it more easily. Then I applied it to each section of her parted hair and styled it accordingly. I loved the end result of shiny, moisturized coils.  Third...I used it as a body butter. It left my skin feeling soft and silky. It absorbs quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my clothes. I also allowed my 9yr old daughter to use it as a body moisturizer and she loved it as well.   I highly recommend this product. I have already forwarded the link to my family and friends and I will most definitely be purchasing this Shea Butter again. The price is perfect and the quality is AMAZING!  ***UPDATE**** I&#x27;ve been using this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and we all use it as a body moisturizer. After a few weeks, I can tell you that I will not use anything else. The quality and price is amazing. Our hair never looked healthier. The Shea has also cleared dark marks on my face and has lightened my stretch marks. Overall this product is a must have in my home. I will be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I made lip balm and hand cream and it was wonderful!</li>
            <li> I order this along with Coco Butter and Mango Butter and I love it. I have made so far a body butter smoothie for my skin and lip balm. They turned out awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product, great transaction!</li>
            <li> I bought this one after reading a ton of reviews all over amazon and the internet. I wanted to start making my own soaps and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived quickly and customer service was friendly and enthusiastic. I was really impressed with the guide they provide for free with the product too. It has several easy recipes to follow that made getting started less intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was a little different than what I anticipated but I kind of like it. I made a whipped lotion with lavender, vanilla, vitamin E and avocado oil the the smell is nice! The nuttiness goes well with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made a face &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; cream and used the shea with tea tree oil (and a dash of peppermint for smell). I&#x27;ve used both the cream and lotion and like them a lot. Time will tell as to wether this will be good for my skin or not but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I saw on u-tube that this product mixed with some olive oil will help eliminate stretch marks.  I have a nice figure and like to wear a bikini but I still have stretch marks after 35 years:(  I tried this mixture and was pleased to see after several months it did start to diminish my deep marks.  It takes time and patience and with consistency it does work.  I massage the mixture on my abdomen once a day.  I have been doing this for a year with great results.  The marks are not totally gone, but they are hardly noticeable now.  It is messy to mix but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I use this to make homemade skin and hair butter for my son and myself! It leaves my skin soft and refreshed! We are on our third purchase of this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter will be ordering more.  Service was great.</li>
            <li> More than met expectations. Well packaged. Great Quality.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! It does wonders for my skin. It moisturizes, softens lines and roughness, fades scars. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the free guide for uses that was emailed to me was very useful and greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; so far has worked really well in the recipes I&#x27;ve used it in. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter!!! Will definitely order again when needed. It&#x27;s perfect for my homemade lip balm, deodorant and sunscreen, and many other recipes I need it for.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter!  Excellent quality, creamy, dissolves smoothly into skin.  Will be purchasing this from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing! I mixed up a whipped shea buttter recipe I found online to help my eczema. I&#x27;ve been seeing positive results after one week of use. This goes on like butter and it&#x27;s so smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like other creams I&#x27;ve used. I will be reordering again when I get low. This is our families new miracle cream. It&#x27;s so soft and lovely. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have continued to have excellent transactions, and have received superior products, over the course of several months. This Organic Shea Butter is the best I&#x27;ve found- perfect for my homemade lotions and diaper cream. I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of different brands and found that this one looked best. I loved it so much that this is actually my second time buying it. Works really well in my lotion recipe or by itself.</li>
            <li> I ordered the yellow shea butter and am officially hooked.  Better Shea Butter is much better than other butters I have tried.  The yellow butter is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this pproduct;. When it arrived I was pleased how it came in a ziploc bag and in another seperte package.  I use it mixed with oils and it was easy to blend in.  There were no clumps and it wasn&#x27;t heavy on the skin like other so called Shea Butter products.  I will continue to order this product from here.</li>
            <li> The best of the best its a very good quality shea butter and organic!! customer service great highly recomment plus they offer great ideas for DIY projects!!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter works miracles for skin moisturizing. Rubbing just a little bit into your hands leaves them silky soft, and afterwards the skin does not get dry immediately after an exposure to water as it does after using even very high end hand creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butter does not smell like a nice perfume, but neither is it supposed to; it has a light smell of natural plant butter. Also, the butter is not absorbed into skin immediately, you’d need to give it several minutes; and that, again, I think is to be expected from a butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in reviews of some other shea butter products, I read that those products were not clean: the products were contaminated with some dirt and particles. This shea butter  seems to be very clean and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with how smooth my hands are after using the product, and I will definitely buy it again, and would recommend it to anyone as a hand cream over Dior, Ahava, Mary Kay, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> I was ordering a product that claimed to be Organic, however it was NOT certified organic.  Received this Shea butter and love it.  Terrific ebook of recipes to download too:-)</li>
            <li> Used this for my DIY sunscreen. This was amazing soft and smoothe!! I&#x27;ve used other Shea butters but this was the best by far!</li>
            <li> I like this shea butter a lot because it is so soft and easy to work with. I just added coconut oil to it, mixed the 2 together with my fingers and I use that as a moisturiser for myself and my 3 year old. Some raw shea butter varieties are very flaky and/or get hard and are difficult to mix, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because I am making my own natural cosmetics and I needed it as one of the ingredients of moisturizer.  You can sense the specific shea butter smell but this is a sign that it is a real one not processed.  If you would like to try to make your own homemade cream please checked out my recipe and step by step instructions under this link[...]</li>
            <li> I, recently, purchased this product and I am very pleased with my purchase. I had read the reviews before purchasing and was a little thrown off by the packaging thinking that it may be difficult or messy to use without a traditional container. Despite my concern, I purchased it and it arrived just as it is pictured. Very neatly packaged, not messy.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great moisturizer. I shower and put it on while I am still a bit damp adding a dab of castor oil and my skin is soft and not greasy. I use the shea butter only on my face - no breakouts, face is beautiful and soft. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, good quality, works really well to make body butter with.  Kept it in the fridge and it has kept well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, super smooth and creamy.  My hands felt like magic after we made lotion bars and body butter.</li>
            <li> would buy again.  melts well, high quality.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, aroma, and resealable packaging of this shea butter.  I use it to make homemade body butter, sunscreen, lip balms, and more!  It is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The absolute highest quality Shea butter I&#x27;ve come across! This is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price. Worked great in my homemade sunscreen and lotions. I recommend refrigerating it upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and this winter has been rough on my skin. I&#x27;m out in it all the time walking to the train or waiting on the bus. I&#x27;m also a flight attendant, so my skin is dry anyway. I made some lotion back at Christmas and used this product. I used the leftover on my feet and hands for a while and then ran out. I liked the lotion I made, but I missed the super-concentrated moisture the Shea provided. It was the only thing that healed my scaly feet and hurting hands...I just ordered more and have been using it on my face. Yes, my face. It&#x27;s that bad here and I had suffered from wind burn on my cheeks. Needless to say, it&#x27;s not a problem any more. . I also had dry patches all over my legs that are gone. I will always keep this product stocked at all times. Also, if you use it on your body as an extra treat for dry skin before bed, you will wake up with newborn-like skin. It&#x27;s natural, doesn&#x27;t kill or get tested on anything, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Always reliably great product and fast shipper. Excellent customer service and price point.</li>
            <li> Great company to deal with. Good product.</li>
            <li> Very smooth texture. Great for my children&#x27;s very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have been more concerned with what I put on my skin. Reading reviews from other shea butter products/sellers left me worried about obtaining the real and undiluted shea butter product. This shea butter is cream colored (not white) and has a smell that is not perfume-y, but natural smelling. It arrived well-packaged, but interestingly in a ziplock bag. When I went out to Better Shea Butter&#x27;s website I found out that they source their shea butter from \\&quot;fair local trading efforts in Africa\\&quot; and use \\&quot;minimal packaging material to lower environmental impact.\\&quot; Using the product at night on my dry hands, I noticed that it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; onto your skin nicely with body temperature. For a few minutes your hands will have a slight sheen but it quickly absorbs in and is not a stain-hazard to clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I made whipped body butter with shea butter, coconut oil, and almond oil.  It turned out beautifully!  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I found this shea butter to be of excellent quality, good texture, etc. I would recommend to anyone &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this to make lotion and moisturizer for my hair and I love it</li>
            <li> Very nice to work with when I made both a body balm and lip balms. This was my first time. The company owner contacted me personally via email to see if I had any questions. She clarified that YES, it is ok to put their shea butter in the fridge which is different advice from what I had read on the internet. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant, Helpful and prompt responses. Product is good and the Shea butter recipe book is great</li>
            <li> A huge raw Shea butter(1LB) is inside the bag!&lt;br /&gt;It is soft like soap, so easy to cut by knife.&lt;br /&gt;(I use jars to keep it fresh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it. We use it for face, fingers and other dry skin area of body.&lt;br /&gt;It works!  After, skin is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was also fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So far so great. Have used it with delight in my hair and also to make a natural homemade deodorant. Great speedy service and a fabulous product. I was going to buy a less expensive Shea Butter but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the product.  Leaves your skin feeling luxuriously soft. The only thing preventing five stars is the ziplock packaging is difficult to close once you get the Shea butter on the bag.  Would be great if it was in some type of container that was easy to open and close. But assuming it is packaged like this because most people use it to make a different end use product.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has literally saved my skin! I started making my own lotions and shaving creams and will never go back to using commercial moisturizers/shaving creams again. I have ordered this product twice and will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I used it to make deodorant!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Also,  appreciate the follow up to see if I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product...love making DIY recipes with this Raw Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> I made lotion with the Shea butter, it melted beautiful and helped make a nice end result.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing from this seller for this shea butter and it&#x27;s wonderful. I was making my salves and balms with just beeswax but didn&#x27;t like the hard texture I was getting. I added this into my recipe and it&#x27;s smooth as, well, butter. I love the feel, smell and it&#x27;s affordable. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve really liked it so far and will continue to come back here when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this butter!  It&#x27;s packaged well and sealed tight (in fact, hard to get out of the bag, so you know it&#x27;s sealed). I&#x27;ve made only one body butter so far but plan to make more! I had a hard time getting the ebook so I contacted via Facebook and the next day I received attachment. I can&#x27;t wait to try the recipes. They look simple to whip together. Overall very happy with purchase. Very smooth block of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Excited to put this into use!  Purchased for at home EO recipes.</li>
            <li> The reviews were positive which is why I ordered the item. I love , love this Shea butter. I have tried various brands in the past and will definitely order again . Easy to use , not stiff and hard like others . Texture Reminds me of kids silly putty</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from atopic dermatitis and eczema, I have spent an unreasonable amount of money on products over the course of many years - most of which did not work.  I have seen immediate results while incorporating this into my skin care regime.  Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from any skin condition, this product will soften extremely dry skin IMMEDIATELY.  I am so glad I bought this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on expensive, chemical and perfume filled lotions; go natural and use this stuff.  It is so much better for you.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging that the product comes in and that it&#x27;s double bagged so everything isn&#x27;t super greasy from the shea. It&#x27;s a nice even block as well and it&#x27;s easily cut into smaller sizes as needed. As for the quality itself, it goes on really smoothly and is great at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I received the butter within about 5 business days. It worked amazingly for making my own body butters and lotions. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Love it! Hefty size, nice packaging, came quickly!</li>
            <li> Shea butter works great in homemade whipped body butters.  I just wish it was odorless.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Loved the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I like this product, great for lotions and balms I mix with bees wax.  Not crazy about the scent, a bit more pungent then lanolin.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils and use it for my body and natural hair. Great buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good on skin. Love the way my skon feels now.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great.  Packaging well done.  I was able to download the free ebook easily.  The sheabutter itself is quite greasy, not actually moisturizing, on my skin.  BUT IM NOT GIVING UP YET.  I need to apply it once in the morning, and again in the afternoon to keep the dry skin feeling at bay.  But each time I apply it my face has a very shiny look.  I&#x27;m looking for recipies to make a more &#x27;lotion&#x27; like cream that doesn&#x27;t have such a greasy look.</li>
            <li> I love that my bar came marbleized with yellow &amp; white shea butter.  It is soo silky soft on my skin.  Better than any shea butter I have used before.  Now I want the cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but I already notice the difference! My skin is soft &amp; smooth &amp; a little bit goes a long way. Definitely will be repurchasing &amp; I&#x27;m hoping to try some of the recipes as soon as get a chance.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing raw Shea butter. I have made a natural oil mixture for my baby bump and a zinc oxide cream to treat sea lice. I am pleased with the results of both.</li>
            <li> This is very good Shea Butter. It is fresh, light in color, and very creamy. It melts perfectly when making my lotions and creams. I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item twice and both times it has been great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the ivory Shea Butter. I melt it and use it on my skin and hair/scalp.My skin feels so soft all through the day. I have used both the yellow and ivory shea butters and I must say this one was by far the best!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, exactly as described. The free recipe that was included also came in handy.</li>
            <li> not only is this shea butter a great quality that works great the customer service is amazing! You get a free ebook full of recipes and and additional info you need!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and I have developed eczema as an adult so I thought this would be great for me. I waited until after I completely used it make a review... I used this everyday and night and I had to reapply throughout the day, the smell is something you get use to but it just didn&#x27;t provide my skin with the lasting moisture needed I purchased a mango shea butter from a local store in my area and its more costly and the container is smaller but its the only thing that seems to work.</li>
            <li> I was searching for the perfect raw Shea butter. I was blown away that this product had a five star rating of 2000 reviews combined. So I bought it, tried it, and now love it. I love that it mixes well with my other oils and I love that the product comes in a re-sealable zip lock bag. The texture of this product is smooth and has a very nice, natural scent. If you&#x27;re looking for a raw Shea butter, I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s all around the best raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very organic and natural, you can tell by the smell. Multiple uses and great product. Wonderful for hair and skin, better than anything at your drugstore, I promise!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Have made acne cream and lotion so far that works and smells amazing.  I love that it comes with a recipe book too.  The customer service was awesome, prompt and thorough.  Above and beyond.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very easy to work with. Extremely satisfied with my purchase! Got it super quick too!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to make my own lotions and it is fantastic.  Leaves skin very smooth.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, Very smooth texture (not grainy at all!), pleasant smell (not strong). Will buy again. Great product!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent quality. Has a natural smell, very pleasant, spreads on the skin and leaves it nourished and moist. The package is excellent and durable. Very satisfied! I downloaded a book about shea butter, too. Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> I use this in homemade lotion and it works great. Much better than buying the store bought lotions with all the additives and preservatives.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that when I do free shipping Amazon uses Fed Ex...who give my package to the post office... making my package always late!!! I dislike that.  But as for the shea butter, I love it.  Smells good, easy to use.  I bought it for making lotions with it.  So far I&#x27;ve only made one kind but I&#x27;m quite happy I listened to the other reviewers and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I especially love this shea better than the yellow I bought(not from this company). The yellow was especially waxy. I&#x27;m not sure why though. Totally gross feeling. But this one here I will purchase again for sure. Shipping was very quick, the shea arrived packaged in a clear zip bag, inside of the brown zip bag. Very nicely done. I&#x27;ve waited for about 4 weeks or so to post because I wanted to try my shea butter mixture on my face before commenting. I must say, I&#x27;ve seen remarkable changes in my face. I had a crease on my cheek that was really bothersome to me. With the shea, I&#x27;ve noticed that much of the wrinkling and dry skin has gone away. From now on, I will forever use Shea butter. Thank you for providing such a wonderful product for us women!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter for my first attempt at making my own body cream. I found it easy to work with and it made a fantastic body butter.  I also received a free e-book with recipes for all types of creams and lotions.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.  The company has great and attentive customer service and clearly wants to make sure their customers are happy with their product.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. This shea butter is packaged very professionally, it has a fresh nut aroma, kind of earthy, and it is a lovely ivory color and creamy smooth. I just followed a recipe from the e-booklet you get free with a purchase and it turned out great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> great product I added a little extra virgin olive oil just to help soften the shea butter so I could put it on my skin and it feel great on. Will purchase from this store again.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter.. I use it on my feet. Put on a nice pair of socks after a long day of walking at work and wala. Comfort. Next day feet are relaxed and ready for more miles.</li>
            <li> i made my first batch of homemade lotion.  this shea butter is smooth and creamy.  my skin feels softer already!</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my skin super soft</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Shea butter I purchased. It adds a beautiful consistency to the body butters I am making.</li>
            <li> The source of this product is iffy. Label was put on straight and has a barcode though, it states for external use only, and has an incomplete phrase at the very bottom of the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says &#x27;ncare&#x27; which is clearly supposed to say &#x27;skin care&#x27; but they chose to make themselves look sketchy instead of more professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, at the bottom of the label, it also says &#x27;New&#x27; is if they expect some batches to be old.  Even if some are old, I&#x27;m sure they still have &#x27;new&#x27; on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I will come back with a review on how well this works for my gf&#x27;s strechys as she grows in her pregnancy</li>
            <li> Really awesome stuff.  I use it from head to toe.  This particular brand is excellent quality.  I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refill a small dish that I keep in the shower and use it after everything is clean.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Shea Butter I ordered. It is one of my favorite products, as I have ordered more than once. I would totally recommend the product as well as the company for its short shipping success. I was under the impression that I ordered an organic shipment the second time around and was slightly sad when I discovered it was not in fact organic Shea Butter. Nonetheless, I am sure I will order again when my supply runs low. The organic kind, of course.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best shea butter I have tried and will stick with this brand for all my handcrafted body products from here on out!!</li>
            <li> Great product, used it right away in a home made lotion. Long lasting, keeps your skin hydrated all day. Very natural and only a slight scent associated with it (i got the ivory Shea) . Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Top quality very smooth and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Shea Butter before - since this one had great reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m new at DIY moisturizers etc. and thought I&#x27;d give some a try. So far I have made several and think I like the ones using the Shea Butter the best.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast; however, the Shea butter had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Incredible, smooth texture and outstanding customer service. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I like the butter but still have problem to download  the free recipes book, cause I didn&#x27;t get the link. Isabella send me two e-mails (which was nice, thank you) but the link wasn&#x27;t attached, I replied asking for the link but nobody responded to it? and it wasn&#x27;t in my package either.</li>
            <li> It is really good and amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just wonderful! I think it is more moisturizing than coconut oil and has helped with my dry itchy winter skin. I use it all over my body. I&#x27;m amazed at the affordable price of this luxurious product!</li>
            <li> Congratulations Isabella the Owner of  Better Shea Butter on its great quality !!! I am fabricating from home a deodorant. It is a product with a cause. All the money we recieve is destined to cancer patients that get their treatments in the towns public hospital and live in extreme poverty here in Guadalajara, Mexico. The shea butter is the only ingredient I cant find in Mexico and  It is very important to me to bring it from the US. I am very interested in looking for the recipes on the Ebook because I like to make my familys personal care products. Thanks very much!!! Lucia Chidan</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Organic Shea Butter.  It was shipped quickly and came packaged really well.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and it is bringing healing to some scares and moisture to my skin.  I use just a small amount on my face each day and my skin is looking so much better!</li>
            <li> I used this Shea butter to make my first batch of body butter and lotion bars. They came out awesome! Since I&#x27;ve never used Shea butter before, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Shipping was fast and the product was easy to work with. It was the consistency of crumbled feta cheese, ivory colored and had a mild scent. Perhaps I was lucky and received a good batch. I was happy with my purchase and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter.  You don&#x27;t need much to get results, using it on dry hands and feet.  Can&#x27;t wait to use some of the recipes that I downloaded.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase. It was nice and fluffy soft and smells great. It helped me make a fantastic batch of chapsticks and will be going in my deodorant project next! After purchasing shea butter from another seller I was not impressed and had it refunded, this product is amazing and the costumer sevice was great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my dry skin (mainly my hands and elbows which get very dry during the winter/Spring) and it&#x27;s so much more effective than other lotions. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my ripped calluses (from working out) and they seem to be healing a lot faster! I&#x27;m very excited about this product!</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of Shea butter and this is by far my favorite! I will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> The shea butter is silky smooth, but the best thing was the free recipe book you get to download upon receiving your order! Thank you so much. Made one of the recipes a few days ago and I love it! Highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fantastic price!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of organic shea butter.  I have tried a few others and found the ivory from this brand to be the best quality.  I use it to make whipped shea butter and I have everyone in my family obsessed with it as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is awesome. This was my first time using this Shea butter to make body butter and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Used it to make chemical free, safe sunscreen using Young living essential oils! My son and I have used it for several days. Commercial sunscreens broke my face out. This stuff has caused no problems at all!</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service. I used it to make lotion. Was great. The scent is a bit strong but a little peppermint essential oil fixed that! I love the texture and that I only need to use a little bit of it b/c of the richness. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this..feels so good on my skin it makes it really soft and I truly believe that it&#x27;s helping the appearance of my stretch marks. Well I mix the shea butter and organic coconut oil. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times on my hair and its so so. I do also love the wood nutty smell of the product.</li>
            <li> Very good and love it.</li>
            <li> I really liked that this product was raw, unrefined and organic.  It makes wonderful body butter and can be added into so many DIY recipes.  This product literally melts into your skin.  I saw some complaints about the color and smell, but this is a unrefined product and shea butter does have a natural scent.  I personally don&#x27;t find it offensive and would rather apply this product on my skin than those nicer smelling creams and lotions that you can buy that are loaded with additives and chemicals.  Customer service has been great.  I liked this product so much that I bought it again.</li>
            <li> I made my first BODY BUTTER using this Shea butter works wonderful. I love it!!!  A great purchase made , will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Use it on my hands at night with gloves.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used the Shea Butter to make homemade organic body butter for dry skin(along with a few other organic ingredients). It came out great! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> great product!  Loved the recipes.  Trying them all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have prior experience with Shea butter, so I have to assume this is good quality. It looked nice and felt nice but it really did have an unpleasant sour smell to me. Thankfully I am just using it to make soap mainly. It was very well packaged and the customer service is good. Happy thus far. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I already made a body butter from this Shea butter, coco butter, a little coconut oil and jojoba oil. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  I made luxurious body butter.  Coconut oil Shea butter and oils.  Best out there for dry aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I researched and researched  for this and was so pleased with my purchase!  It was just what I wanted and needed.  Very nice quality.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have never used shea butter before or any other brand to compare this to. I like it so far. I did go to the beach and got some extra sun on the calf of my legs and behind the knees. I immediately applied apple cider vinegar that day and the next and applied the raw shea butter morning and night and have not peeled. I wish it was easier to apply though. That is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. That is probably something you just have to get used to with a raw product.</li>
            <li> I use this directly on my skin in the winter to prevent that really dry skin. I like the fact that it is all natural and has no synthetic material added. I warm a small amount in my hand to warm it up and then I can apply it very easily.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have never smelled raw Shea butter before, so maybe this is how it normally smells, I can&#x27;t really describe the scene but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it alone. Fortunately I was combining it with cocoa butter and coconut oil to make whipped body butter, so the smell was masked by the other ingredients. The butter IS smooth and melted easily. Shipping was fast too! Overall despite the smell, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> So creamy and wonderful!  My skin and hair are so happy! I love the recipes too!  I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my better Shea butter &amp; free recipes! I have made 4 lotions so far &amp; my skin smells &amp; feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This Ivory Shea Butter is extremely smooth and moisturizing. Unlike other shea butters I have tried, it is not &#x27;grainy&#x27; at all and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I use it on my eyelids. I will definitely re-order this shea butter!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  I will by again!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time getting raw unrefined Shea Butter and I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the packaging, but I transferred it to a large mason jar so no problems there!&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing, I mix it with coconut oil to use as body moisturizer in the winter and it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s Unrefined, it has a bit of a sandy texture to it, which rubs out between your hands but I like to apply immediately to body to exfoliate a little!</li>
            <li> Shea butter seems to be old, its smelling hence returning the product.</li>
            <li> Lovely (: I use this for my skin care line and I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
            <li> Really loved it.  I used it to make some homemade eczema cream for my son.  It was packaged well and worked great.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying shea butter for years. I recently started purchasing it on amazon because it was more convenient. I purchased this brand before and it was great. When I purchased it again, it had a funny smell too it. It did not smell like shea butter. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not because it looked like shea butter and it did what it needed to do for my hair needs, but I was thrown off because I know what it is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, using it every day and my skin is soft, the only thing is on the package i didnt see any sign of organic shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I ever had!  This stuff is awesome, I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for all of my trouble spots - elbows, heels, knees, etc., and I use it all over! Better Shea Butter as a company is great, too. They follow up with you after your order to make sure you&#x27;re satisfied and the free ebook of recipes and tips is great. The Shea Butter itself couldn&#x27;t be better. I put a little into a small container that I keep by my vanity and use it every day and every night before bed, and my skin has never been softer. I even use it on the ends of my hair to help moisturize. I love this product and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying trying new recipes by mixing in essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My son has dry, itchy skin and even prescription lotion with steroids didn&#x27;t work. In less than 2 weeks, his skin is smooth, soft and the blemishes are clearing up! I am a believer and will be ordering this from now on!</li>
            <li> the butter is fresh and work very well</li>
            <li> the extra info on how to use it was great too</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on other reviews and I am SO PLEASED!  The product is packaged well and is fantastic quality.  It&#x27;s almost crumbly so it makes it easy to scoop out and melt in your hands and apply.  I have been using it as body lotion - it smells so wonderful!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this butter.  It is great.</li>
            <li> I used this today to make magnesium body butter. Nice neutral clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to using it often.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service! I was contacted by the seller to make sure I had received my product and if all was well. I used this to make a whipped body butter and it was absolutely heavenly! The consistency was perfect!</li>
            <li> I wanted to start making my own body butter bars and Shea Butter is a must! After hours of research on the best product (for the best price), I came across this Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter which not only had the best reviews, but also the best price (win win!)... After whipping up a couple batches of my lotion bars, I can honestly say this stuff lives up to the hype! Easy to use- unlike others, it is not hard to scoop out desired amount. Feels amazing on your skin. And the customer service is top notch! Thank you Better Shea Butter for a quality product at a fantastic price! I look forward to trying other products from this company... I am thinking of adding some Zinc next time to start making my own sunblock :)</li>
            <li> OMG !!! The difference between this and the other brand was like the distance from here to the sun!!! The other product was yellow, hard and had an smell to it. I mixed it for a long time and still it had hard bits in it.... This product was soft, smooth only had a lite plsasent smell. It took the oils very nicely and wiped up easily and ended up with the texture of a thick milk shake. I WILL be buying this and only this shae butter in the future. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own sunscreen &amp; bath products.  Great quality!</li>
            <li> i ordered this for making my own stretch mark cream and my baby&#x27;s skin care products. i like the smell of it. It smells so natural. And i like my cream so much!</li>
            <li> This is VERY good quality shea butter.  I waited to write the review until I had a chance to actually use it.  I made soap with it and would have to say it added a really nice texture to the soap and helps keep my skin hydrated.  I&#x27;ll be buying my next batch from the same vendor.</li>
            <li> I just used this product in a batch of Magnesium Lotion I made.  The Shea Butter worked very well, and I have plans on ordering from this supplier again when I run out.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Best Shea butter out there! I will be ordering from this company for now on!</li>
            <li> The quality of this shea butter is awesome. Love the texture and feel of this butter,very fresh. Shipping was great as well came quickly overnight. Would buy this product again and would reccomend this seller as well! Thank you for a great quality product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. Melts quickly, absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Purity is guaranteed - excellent product.</li>
            <li> Product was great!  Exactly what I was expecting.  Good quality product and customer service.</li>
            <li> This is the only shea butter I will order online.  I have really dry skin in the winter, and I just whip this up with some coconut oil and what ever other natural oils I have in my house and no more dry skin.  I wish they sold it in larger packages, but other than that, its a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning to create my own bath, hair and skin products.  This is the best value and highest quality Shea Butter so far.  I&#x27;m really enjoying how versatile and easy to use this product is.  The website is fantastic with recipes and suggested uses.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is just what I was looking for.  It works wonderfully as a moisturizer, and I love the earthy aroma.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes in the ebook.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this shea butter. I used it to make lotion bars and they are fabulous. It came packaged very well and I worried it might even be a bit melted since we were experiencing some warmer weather. Nope, it was in great condition.</li>
            <li> Due to the heat in the palm Spring area my Raw Shea Butter was completely melted. The jar did not leak but the bar steep out of it&#x27;s packaging. Will not order it again in the summer months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter in terms of its chemical properties, but I have been using various products that claim to be &amp;#34;100% natural organic shea&amp;#34; for years and this is the best product I have come across. It is soft, smells very mild (unlike other products I have used), melts smoothly and mixes well with other oils to make really wonderful skin creams/body butters etc... The package also came with instructions and even more downloadable information.</li>
            <li> My first time using shea butter to make lotions, and this one is great. A quality product, and the free recipes were very helpful to a novice like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the customer follow up, and the cordial, upbeat tone of communication. So rare these days! The owners care what you think, and they care that you are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having fun making homemade lotions, and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Super moisturizing and was in great shape when I received it.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and they send you plenty so you can make your creams for a good time. I have already made enough to share with 2 other people - just divided the batch into 3 containers - they love it also</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with raw unrefined shea butter. I have used the refined prepared shea butter products in the past and never realized how little of the natural product actually remains in those creams. I&#x27;ve also done alot of research online as to what makes a quality shea butter, however that&#x27;s still no replacement for actual use of different seller&#x27;s preparations. This shea butter has a fresh, natural smell and melts in your hand to a smooth consistency. Will definately order from these sellers again.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter was delivered quickly. It was a bit melted when I received it as it was 115 degrees outside. The package had no leaks at all and I just popped it in the fridge to harden it up. The smell of the Shea butter is wonderful- earthy and nutty. I had a chance to try it out just as a (body) skin moisturizer - Fab! Fab! Fab! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion all the time and this shea butter works really well. I keep it in the freezer until I need it.  Will buy more from here for sure.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Make Your Skin Feel soft and shiny ,That&#x27;s All .</li>
            <li> Best shea butter available.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great quality, and great customer service.  It also included a link to a shea butter recipes ebook.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again. Very happy with this purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use for skin and hair. No chemical smelling. Good natural smelling.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthier after I used it for the first time. I am happy as I don&#x27;t have to expensive skin care products.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVEEER!!! Better than any moisturizer i have... And i like investing in great skin care. Very thick and may stick to your sheets when use at night ( if youre not wearing pants, socks or long sleeves) but TOTALLY WORTH IT! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is fantastic! So wonderful for the skin. Makes my body butters so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great supplier and the recipe book that you receive with the order is very useful!</li>
            <li> I loved how this felt, but the smell was a little overpowering for my taste. I used tons of EO to try and cover up the smell and it was impossible.</li>
            <li> I bought both this shea butter and the cocoa butter from this company, and I am pleased with both products. The shea butter is clean and smooth, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes. The company also has a website where you can enter your Amazon order number and then download an e-book with 21 recipes for hair, face, and body products using all natural ingredients, in case you are looking for recipe ideas.</li>
            <li> It s great product. I m very satisfied to use face,hair and body.</li>
            <li> I made lotion bars that turned out amazing with this Shea butter, the butter looks and smells as it should and the end results are fantastic. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have never used Shea Butter before so I have nothing to compare it to (that&#x27;s why the scope of &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;).  This Shea Butter does have a smell but it is not altogether unpleasant.  It is very smooth (not grainy) and is easy to break off the bar and melt.  The company contacted me to make sure I got the recipes e-book (which I had not yet) and they sent it to me right away.  It&#x27;s a nice PDF with lots of recipes in it.  Excellent service!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. I use it on my face, in homemade lotions, everywhere! I can&#x27;t wait to use it up so I can buy more. I would definitely buy again and from this seller!</li>
            <li> I just love it butter, the quality is excellent! And shipping really great! Thank you so much for amazing service, Liliya!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Using today to make lotion bars. Love that it comes with the free online recipe book!  Update; almost a year later and this is the only place I will buy from shea from to make my lotion. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> E-book bonus! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great seller communication. Very fast shipping. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Buttery, non-greasy, and very moisturizing. The free ebook has wonderful simple recipes and a true bonus.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter arrived exactly as shown in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent...it has a ...slightly... nutty scent, not grainy at all, very nice, very smooth, very fresh.  I weighed it when it arrived and it was slightly more than 1 pound, so that was good.  I use it straight on my hands like lotion after washing them, it hydrates, is soft, and not sticky (after it soaks in a bit).  All natural, doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty chemicals that most moisturizers have.  I like it very much.  There are less expensive Shea Butter sites, but I&#x27;m unsure of the quality, maybe they are just as good.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to Shea butter so it is hard to rate  the product. Some have commented that it has a smell but raw unrefined Shea butter should have a smell, that it is solid but still soft and creamy.  These are indicative of good not bad quality. (The smell by the way is not entirely unpleasant, just not fragranced like processed shea butter).  I paid the extra for next day delivery and received it timely. I had no problem downloading the sellers ebook.  Pleasant purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> Works grate used for hair treatment and skin treatment</li>
            <li> Awesome Shea butter. It melts wonderfully and feels great. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be very good. I have only used it for a few days and notice more hydrated skin. It comes in a plastic resealable bag, says it&#x27;s new packaging, I don&#x27;t know what it use to come in. I don&#x27;t know how to get the free downloadable ebook that is mentioned.</li>
            <li> I use this wonderful shea butter in a recipe for magnesium balm. It is smooth and not grainy like some other oils when it is applied to the skin. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter and so many people have told me that I Shea butter comes &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and have to melt before blending with my coconut oil and vegetable glycerin.  This was not the case.  It was  packaged beautifully and is soft.  I was able to blend it right from the package.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The shea butter I received is WONDERFUL. It arrived in perfect condition and I have used it everyday since I received it.  I will reorder when I am all out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product! Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the recipes that came with this purchase but i have been using the shea butter since i got it. My feet, hands and face love this butter. One use and the difference in my skin is unbelievable! The best creams out there can&#x27;t do what this shea butter does in one use. Amazing product! I will be buying many more. I bought the white raw shea butter but now I want to get the yellow shea butter from this seller. The seller is amazing as well, her name is Isabelle and she answered all my questions in my emails quickly. Very please customer I am...with product and customer service!</li>
            <li> The consistency worked out well for my first try making a whipped body butter.  It seems to work well with the recipe</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Seller packaged it well and shipped it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus.....link to e-book download for recipes!  :)</li>
            <li> The shea butter is very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy! Smooth and rich, very nicely packaged. Love it and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Good product at good o rice.</li>
            <li> excellent,  will order again</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing value and quality! Packaged simply, but wrapped securely. Definitely recommend it for homemade skin care recipes.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! Worked wonderful in my home made body butter. No over powering smell, very moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. I&#x27;ve already used some in a batch of bar soap and also love what it does in my hair. Also, they followed up soon after to check on my level of satisfaction, appreciated that.</li>
            <li> Luv Shea butter natural from Africa. Skip fancy store lotion with &#x27;Shea butter&#x27; if u want soft. Scent with natural oils. Small amount. Used for years.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is of excellent quality, we have been using it for homemade hair products and skin moisturizing and have been more than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I made the Shea body mousse that was provided in the recipe manual. It came out great! I put it on my knees, elbows, and sunburned forehead and they are all nice and smooth this morning. I can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> new to using  pure shea butter  (trying to phase out chemically lotions in my life.)  Its not as greasy as coconut oil. Its thick but rubs into the skin pretty easily. It smells like a bunch of peanuts sat by a camp fire for awhile. My recipe is 4oz of this (weighed on scale) melted in a double boiler with 1.4oz coconut oil and then I put some essential oils in to kill the smell. Mix until all is liquid, put in fridge s it firms up again, then when cool whip with hand blender.  I have found that lighter oils like floral , and fruity don&#x27;t mask the smoked smell enough. Mixing pepper mint, tea tree, eucalyptus and lemon oils makes this smell fresh and feel tingly / refreshing on the skin. It feels more greasy than regular lotion when you rub in. After about an hour its pretty much absorbed. The next day when I wake up my skin feels soooo good and hydrated and feels that way until I shower and even after when I put more on. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular store bought lotion. im loving garden of edensgarden.com for essential oils ( hint 6 pack pick your own usually comes out cheaper than singles) back to this shea though..  It came pretty quickly in the mail. So far petty satisfied. I just keep the block in a large ziplock and squeeze pull pieces off as needed</li>
            <li> This is he most amazing she&#x27;s butter I have found. It is silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> No complaints,  it&#x27;s good stuff. Homemade shea coco butter lotion with costco&#x27;s organic coconut oil to replace lotion bar from Lush. I dont make the bar because i dont like to use beeswax which is used to keep it solid. All in all saves me a ton of $$$$.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I read a few reviews beforehand and was apprehensive about the purchase - some complained about the packaging. This product is raw, organic shea butter and the packaging gives it that natural feel. I have zero complaints. Will restock once product runs out.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shea butter I have ever purchased! I highly recommend this product. It is truly the best you can buy.</li>
            <li> Received it within 2 days of placing the order, to my surprise the texture is a little different (a little grainy) than the previous shea butter I purchased but, the last shea butter wasn&#x27;t raw or organic.  I rubbed it on my hands and it went away. I applied it directly to my face as well and it felt wonderful. Will give a feedback a few months from now.</li>
            <li> Very good quality shea butter.  I modified one of the recipes in the company&#x27;s free e-book and made an all-natural hair/scalp moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good bulk product!  I made some great smelling lotions with this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, so here are the impressions from a butter virgin: no unexpected smells (some reviews mentioned chemical smells). Smelled like a natural nut butter to me. Came in a nice 1 lb block, wrapped in plastic wrap then placed inside a baggie. The color reminded me of natural cheddar (white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I cut it for my recipe, sliced nicely, only slightly crumbly. I was melting down, so a few crumbles made no difference to me. A couple reviewers said the shea butter was unusable because it was too crumbly to be smoothed onto your skin. Seems to me you can cream or whip the butter to get a better texture if that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loved the body butter I made using one of the recipes from the booklet you receive with your purchase. Lots of recipes I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for my dry hand. The only way I was able to relieve the dryness has been constant application of oils and moisturizer and to limit handwashing and wearing rubber gloves. Almond oil helps too</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is great! I&#x27;ve used it for the last couple of days and my skin is extremely soft and moisturized. I didn&#x27;t know a eBook of recipes was included so I threw away the packaging with the instructions on how to download it. Isabella, the owner, was gracious enough to email it to me. Great customer service!!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> There is Shea butter and then there is Shea butter. This is some of the best I &#x27;ve ever had. But, if you want the ebook you will have to dream it up- I have tried everything and no dice</li>
            <li> Received the shea butter rather quickly and the product is AMAZING.  Packaging is great, the shea butter is a wonderful consistency and I will be ordering from this customer again.  As the owner of Charshay Essentials, I use shea butter in one of my products and it works beautifully.  Knowing the shea butter is unrefined and organic is important to me as a manufacturer of healthy body care products.</li>
            <li> Great product! Came sooner then I expected it to and made a great natural deodorant out of it! Thanks Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> this shea butter is great.  I use it on my face and body as a moisturizer and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  When I got a bad sun burn this shea butter helped the healing process.  Every so often my sister breaks out in a painful rash and the shea butter has also helped soothe that.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I totally liked this product, it did just what I wanted it to do. Great quality, I will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> It was a great shea butter to work with. thanks.</li>
            <li> So far really amazing! I thought I already submitted a review but apparently not...&lt;br /&gt;The butter arrived on time and I was able to download the recipe book easily. The butter was clean, solid and smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;I made shea-coconut body lotion and am loving it so far! The friends who tried it love it as well and I&#x27;ve been getting requests to make some for everyone...</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says it is. Came very quickly and smells exactly like any other ivory African shea butter I bought. From reading other reviews I thought there was going to be a recipe to make products from it but there was not.(update) there was a recipe book in the shea butter. The butter had melted and leaked out the plastic bag it was in. It solidified over the small recipe book. Now that I&#x27;m getting toward the end of the package I have found it</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter!  I am ready to make lotions, sunscreeen and balm now. The customer service has been wonderful also! Very thoughtful.</li>
            <li> Received this product very fast. Was packaged exactly like in the picture and was also sealed in a plastic ziplock bag. It does smell buttery as true Shea Butter and feels soft and not hard like a brick. I am planning on using this Shea Butter to make into a hair and body Whipped Cream (with added oils) so I&#x27;m so excited to try it out! Would buy from again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also looked for mold as other buyers had listed they found and I have not found any on mine. Great value!</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and the smell is just as it is supposed to be. It melts well and makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible.  It&#x27;s smooth/not grainy, smell not strong/able to wear, and with just some patience, melt in your hands and place on skin. The product leaves your skin wonderfully smooth. I recommend it very highly.  CG</li>
            <li> This is the best raw shea butter I have ever purchased!! Price is good and the product is great! I make a lot of creams and lotions and love this product!! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The quality is great. Bought for use in my body butters, but I like to use shea butter as-is as well. It feels smooth and absorbs into my skin very quickly. Will be ordering more as needed.</li>
            <li> It was a good product</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m going through it so fast I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li> As described.  I can&#x27;t wait to make multiple household personal care products with this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Package came in tact and solid.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used Shea butter for years but unfortunately can not find any in my new location. It was delivered in two days and was super fresh and smooth. No complaints. I will say that I did not receive any information on how to contact the seller in case I was not pleased with the product but that was not necessary anyway,</li>
            <li> The BEST SHEA BUTTER! I have used other brands of Shea in the past, until I came across this one, Better Shea Butter. Top notch quality, so smooth, with a pleasant scent and texture. I make all my own body care products and household cleansers so I do a lot of ordering for the products I need. I have never had such a positive experience with a company before in all my experiences. The owner herself, Isabella, takes the time to check on the product, ask if you have any questions, and provides wonderful recipes to use with the Shea butter. This company is truly committed to their customers. I have had a few questions about recipes and have gotten prompt, thorough, courteous responses every-time. Better Shea Butter goes above and beyond my expectations. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Nothing complicated, Just rancid oil. Buy somewhere else... :(</li>
            <li> I find this Organic Shea Butter of superior quality, once you learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Ordered during the summer and it came as a melted blob with a slightly unpleasant smell.  Had to return it.  Other brands in screw top containers have arrived fine with a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipper</li>
            <li> perfect for my DIY body butter.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and the smell is not loud</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to arrive in liquid form, because of the summer heat. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not. It was still solid, and not even overly soft. I am using this as an emulsifier in homemade body butters and lotions. It absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves skin very soft. It really takes care of those rough, dry, cracked heels. It&#x27;s a great product alone or combined with other oils, and it keeps my body butters whipped and creamy, instead of allowing them to melt back into oil. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of the product, and I doubt it&#x27;ll be my last. It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My skin just loves this stuff. When I use it regularly all my bumps, blemishes and stretchmarks start to disappear. I like this stuff particularly because you can keep it in the resealable bag it comes in as well as take out a little bit for use in other stuff without aerating the whole batch (as is what happens in tubs). I have at it for a few months now and it still hasn&#x27;t gone rancid and I love how fresh it is.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!  Perfect for my skin and natural hair!</li>
            <li> NOTE: I shop on Amazon constantly and I never write product reviews. After getting this tonight and putting it on my body, I had to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly sensitive to the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; of things I eat and use on my skin. (Call me woo-woo, but those who know what I mean... well.. they know exactly what I mean.) This stuff is incredible. It was emanating light beams when I took it out of the packaging. It&#x27;s soft, buttery, and 100% organic. It left my skin feeling fantastic AND I don&#x27;t have to worry about my daughter accidentally ingesting it. (Call me paranoid, but if you are a parent, you know exactly what I mean.) I have used coconut oil for the past couple years, but it never leaves my skin moisturized - it actually often leaves it drier than when I started. This product is great and I can tell the company is fabulous based on the aforementioned light beams. Good ju-ju in this little package of butter.</li>
            <li> I whipped this up with some Coconut Oil and Black Castor Oil for a hair mask.  Seemed to work just fine.  Smooth feeling.  I found the scent of the Shea Butter to be unpleasant, which is the reason for 4/5 stars.  My mom thought the same thing.  Not sure if that&#x27;s how it should smell or if something happened in the mail.  I just know it stinks.  This scent has not carried over to my hair, fortunately.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> wonderful&lt;br /&gt;it is really wonderful</li>
            <li> Was for my wife, and she said it is ok.</li>
            <li> excellent shea butter</li>
            <li> So amazing. Great product. I even use it in my one year old. I put it in a container and melt it with my blow dryer to soften so I can apply it. Great seller, even checked to see if I liked it. I have tried everything for my dry skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> I received it in it&#x27;s packet as shown in the photo.  Very pleased with the contents. Not destroyed or crumbled or discoloured.  I was rather nervous especially because I was receiving these in Sweden from a friend that took the delivery in Boston and knew that returning would be quite a hassle.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin and this shea butter moisturizes my skin throughout the night. It ls kind of greasy which is why I don&#x27;t have to apply too much of it to get my skin moisturized. I like it and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST shea butter I have ever bought! Very creamy and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome Shea. Just completely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I never go out of my way to write product reviews but this seller and product stood out. I had never used Shea Butter before so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Rest assured, thanks to the AMAZING and personable customer attention from this Shea Butter seller, I now love every bit of it. The eBook for recipes is truly an A-Z for any skin and it&#x27;s fun to make your own body butter. I use a round, air-tight tapper ware to store it in the bathroom so it&#x27;s not messy and the rest is up to your imagination. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> OMG, great quality! This is the first time I&#x27;ve made my own creams and lotions and I&#x27;m hooked! Starting with quality products is key. Better Shea Butter even offers great recipes to try. I&#x27;ve ordered some of their other products as well and expect the same great quality.</li>
            <li> Used this to make salve and love it! Fast shipping, great product. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Received smells like cigarette !! not fresh! waste of money! horrible smell impossible to keep it on face. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I got this to make body butters and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this organic shea butter. Made my first batch of cream.. wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because you hear about people experience with getting a bad batch. I can definitely tell you this is worth the investment! Its all natural and raw. I can not tell you in words how satisfied I am with the shipping and the Shea Butter. They day I got it is the day I start putting the Shea butter to use. I will always order from them going forward. Thank you so much guys for the proper business etiquette and also with handling the Shea butter. I wish there were more people out there like you.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time order this product and i love it on my skin and hair! Keeps me moisturized all over, especially for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am really excited to try new recipes with Shea Butter. I am just now getting into making my own lotions and other household items for cleaning etc. This Shea butter is great and very affordable!  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I bought from a really expensive shop and found this online for much cheaper and since it had really good reviews decided I could make my own for a lot less expensive. Boy was I right. Very good quality product, smells good, packaging was great too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I make my own body lotion and body butter.  This shea butter is easy to work with and is a nice addition to my home made products.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews, I ordered the shea butter.  It came as expected two days later.  The ebook was a wonderful addition  and I&#x27;ve already  made one of  the recipes.  I am looking forward to making more!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoyed it</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived just as expected and works great. It feels different than slathering on chemical filled, store bought moisturizer and takes a little getting used to, if you haven&#x27;t used shea butter before. But after a few days of use, my skin is looking better than ever and has not broken out at all!!!! I blended the shea butter and a little lavender oil with a hand mixer. I apply it after washing my face with hemp seed oil. My pores are smaller and my skin is clearer than ever before!</li>
            <li> Used it to make lotion bars and it is just fine</li>
            <li> This isnt the real shea butter that comes from my homeland, but it works for the time being.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is very smooth and creamy.  It makes lovely body butters.  I also appreciated the body butter e-book included.</li>
            <li> We made Body Butter with Better Shea Butter and it&#x27;s perfect.  As a base, the Shea Butter absorbs wonderfully and the texture is silky.  We love it.</li>
            <li> Works well in my homemade body butter...  Skin feels so much better with it. It stores well</li>
            <li> I use this for many homemade recipes. It gives my lotions a wonderful scent. It is a bit crumbly when raw, but blends perfectly when I melt it down with the other ingredients. I just keep it in a sealed ziploc in a drawer, and it has kept well.&lt;br /&gt;While I did not take advantage of it, the seller followed up with extra recipes and tips. When it is time to reorder, I will definitely come back to this product/seller.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged--just as pictured. Nice and soft. Thank you so much!  Will try the recipes soon.</li>
            <li> My first body butter batch using this Shea Butter turned out great.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it in more cool body butter recipes!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just what I expected</li>
            <li> Shea butter is great. Love the quality and ship time.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user. I like the way it feels!! It is really good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great packaging, and they sent an email along with a bunch of lotion recipes. It melted easily, is incredibly moisturizing, and made great solid lotion bars. Can&#x27;t have asked for anything more.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I plan to use this for a more natural skin care product.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing! It is easy to work with, and has so many uses. I have made a hair pomade, sunscreen, and I am planning to make body lotion and lip balm. This product is cost effective, because I am saving so much money on other products. A little of this product goes a long way! The only criticism I have is that instructions for downloading the recipie book were not in the box. I had to contact the seller, but there are lots of recipies using Shea Butter on the web, so I had other recipies to work with until I got the book that comes with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is moisturizing, but not greasy, and absorbs quickly. It has a mild shea butter smell, (barely discernible), but if you don&#x27;t like the smell you could alway add an essential oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to make my homemade body products.</li>
            <li> I got the product within 2 days and it was exactly what I wanted. The vendor emailed to make sure I was happy within a day of receipt. I misplaced the instructions for downloading the ebook; within minutes after sending an email, I received the book as an attachment.  I will definitely buy from Better Shea Butter again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing although a bit gritty. It does keep my skin very soft. Ive been meaning to go the recipe site and get some ideas but haven&#x27;t had a chance yet. Ive been adding a lot to my body butter I already had which makes the shea butter go on smoother plus really hydrates. This is a great moisturizer and I live where it&#x27;s hot and dry.</li>
            <li> I received it way before expected, and was able to dowload the receipes right  away, I also received an email from the sellers letting me know if I have problems to call or email that is excellent customer service.  I made the lavender body butter cream  and it came out great, I use it on my face after the shower because my face gets so dry and it stayed very moist as it drys, I also used it on my hair after I washed and rinsed it before I combed it out and it made my hair moist and easy to comb thru I did not need a detangler , I have very course hair after I put it on I let dry naturally to see if it got hard, it was still moist  and soft, and of course I use it on my body as well arizona is very hot  and dry so this is very nice to have I have a little container I carry in my purse for my hands and my lips. Awesome products. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Best skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used and I am now a lifetime fan.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells. I bought it to make homemade deodorant but it was too odorous to use. Not sure how to make use of the rest of this block of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, good color...not too odoriferous...mixed with all the other oils I blend in......wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love Better Shea Butter!  It has great color, no offensive odor, and it readily absorbs into my skin - no greasy feeling or residue.  I&#x27;ve used it in two skin care recipes, and am very pleased with my results.  This company has the best customer service, period.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and keep coming back to this one. As soon as I get it, I take it out of the plastic bag and put it in a glass container.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own lotion for my sensitive skin.  I am really happy with it!  It has a rich creamy texture.  It melts really nicely when you are combining it with other ingredients.  It also whipped up beautifully into a wonderful body cream.  I am really pleased with this purchase.  The vendor sends a recipe book via email when you purchase this shea butter.  I already had a recipe I wanted to try, but I am looking forward to also testing out some of theirs.  This is a good price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has severe case of dry skin and Eczema. She has been using this product using recipes mentioned on &amp;#34;Better shea butter&amp;#34; website- results have been very good so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep you guys updated but would recommend it based on current results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and some jars to put them in.  It arrived in a plastic bag.  I softened the shea butter to put into containers.  I had hoped that it would retain its white silky texture.  It darkened, even tho there was very little heat used to soften it.  So it is a dark yellow now, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, because it was highly recommended for use in essential oil body and face recipes. It has great consistency and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived in two sets of resealable packaging. It was soft and easy to work with. The color was a creamy white/off-white and smells like earthy shea butter. There is no rancid smell or anything. I can&#x27;t wait to use this for my shea butter mixes.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Was very happy to receive the free ebook of recipes and tips on how to work with and use the Shea butter. I used it in a lotion bar. Feels luxurious all by itself! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I received it very promptly and it was exactly what I was expecting. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent overall and I love the packaging too. Thank you very much. I made a great body butter with this product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product!  Can&#x27;t wait to make sunscreen with it!</li>
            <li> Product is just like advertised, great for anything really.  I&#x27;ve ordered three times from this supplier and each time the item was shipped promptly, packaged correctly, and the free ebook of recipes is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I made the recipe for eczema cream from the pdf book and so far so good. My daughter&#x27;s skin feels so moist,  smooth and the yellow shea butter gives her skin a nice tan glow. I will check in later and write more about the progress with her eczema as the time goes by .</li>
            <li> This was my first order of Raw Shay Butter .  The product came fast and is a high quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! I use it every day and cannot believe how great my skin looks. And feels. I will recommend this product to everyone. I actually kind of like the smell but my husband does not. I will try some of the recipes and see if I can make it more sweetly scented. It is addicting !!</li>
            <li> This is such a soft shea butter, much better than what I have purchased elsewhere before.  I was pleasantly amazed at the high quality for such a great price!  I made some body butter with this, and it works like a charm.  I will definitely buy from this company next time I am in need of shea butter products.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered from dry skin nearly all my life, but this stuff has made my skin softer than ever before! its a little greasy and takes awhile to soak in so I suggest using it at night before bed. By the time you wake up your skin will be transformed.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and this is a good price.  l love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff...leave it to mother nature!  I have loved what it does for my feet, which I tend to neglect. Looking forward to using it for other things. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of Raw Shea Butter. I decided to try it mostly for discolorations and stretch marks on my body. I read reviews of people applying this to their face, which left me totally aghast (lol). I have very oily skin, and each and every time I apply a cream/moisturizer to my face, I&#x27;d break out. So the idea of applying a butter to my skin had me really skeptical. But I decided to give it a go, and Raw Shea Butter does *not* clog my pores (like most commercial products do).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been clearing up my skin (face and body).&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is becoming so *even*.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I started using it in my hair***. My hair looks GLOSSY. Shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at this product.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin easily, though. It takes hours to absorb, so I only apply it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;***(I mix the raw shea butter with coconut oil when applying to my hair).</li>
            <li> Simply the best Shea butter I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  Pliable and easy to use as a skin conditioner or melt with other ingredients to make homemade lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Such a great pure product. Mixed it with coconut oil and vitamin E to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I have read a couple of articles and seen some videos on how to make your own homemade body butter and I wanted to try. I can&#x27;t believe I just made my very first homemade beauty product. Thanks to this shea butter. The quality is so smooth. I used olive oil and some scented oils and the consistency of my product is almost perfect and the smell, just like my favorite Olive Body Butter from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter.......and the service....thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &#x27;shea butter&#x27; world so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The package arrived on time. I&#x27;ve never seen shea butter raw but it worked absolutely fabulous in the recipe for homemade body lotion. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter. Plan to purchase more in the future. We use it as a natural moisturizer in our house and this has proven to be a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, great quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you!!! for  offering such great quality she butter, here is one happy customer who is a Shea fan for life!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Concerned, thoughtful seller. Such a great experience I bought another product from them immediately. Love the e-recipe book.</li>
            <li> Just made lotion with it - feels amazing!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered as promised. The natural fragrance is not overwhelming. It works really well to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> I love my shea butter</li>
            <li> Very nice shea butter ans super&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product. This is the real deal and just what my skin needed. Fast delivery, well packed and comes with a recipe book you can download.</li>
            <li> So nice in my lotion bars</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I made a natural shave cream with it and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been through many sites and have purchased shea butter. This company is the only one I use now. It is pure. The color texture and smell is perfect. I use it from head to toe. It is hard to find good quality shea now that it has become popular. This one I will recommend to anyone. Especially if you have natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter! Smells great &amp; easily absorbed &amp; really quick shipping to boot. We could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Loved the Shea butter worked great for my homemade lotions .</li>
            <li> Made a lotion with this product that turned out great! Will order again when I need more.</li>
            <li> grrrrreat !  and I love the shea butter ladies free recipe book too</li>
            <li> Loved!  Made my own &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; and will be making lotion soon!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the unrefined organic butter and I must say it is awesome.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews but my experience has been nothing but positive.  I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great product. First time to order shea butter and I really like it. Service was great. Responded to a customer care question quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this company and this product.</li>
            <li> great quality products and superb customer service... highly recommend...</li>
            <li> Always good! Love to whip it up with either mango butter or cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am using it in combination with essential oils and it is absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this shea butter, and would have given it 5 stars except for one thing.  My package was supposed to be a 16 oz. package and it weighed only a little over 12 oz.  Disappointing...</li>
            <li> I finally got around to making my first batch of body butter and made a little mistake when it came to scenting.  It couldn&#x27;t have worked out better. I accidentally grabbed the cacao essential oil instead of the almond and the fragrance is divine. I am planning on making the soap next. This body butter is so luxurious and I have never used anything that&#x27;s make your skin feel as good as this does. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of your recipes. Thank-you for providing such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My father has alzheimers. I use Shea butter to use as a sort of diaper rash cream, but my own mix, as it is not only cheaper but better quality. My recipe includes natural beeswax, shea butter, zinc oxide and rose hip oil. It works 100 times better than the store-bought stuff. No rashes, no skin burn, and the shea butter I purchase here is perfect for said recipe.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is wonderful. And the ebook provided by the seller has some great recipes. I&#x27;ve already made the acne cream for my teenagers and the wrinkle cream for me. We are happy and lookin&#x27; good!</li>
            <li> I loved the product entirely, except for it&#x27;s crumbly texture-- hard to use as is, except by picking up a crumb of it.  Otherwise lovely.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like the smell and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;It feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have never bought anything like the Organic Shea Butter before so I have no comparison. So far I have used it only once but I loved it... I made some body butter with the essential oils that I have.  My next purchase will be the organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> All is good thank you</li>
            <li> I received this Shea butter for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This unrefined organic Shea butter was perfect for my whipped peppermint Shea butter body cream.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Shea butter in an insulated brown paper bag and the Shea butter was inside a little Ziploc bag nicely sealed.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that when I went to cut some of the Shea butter it was not hard at all which made it better for me to cut the portion that I needed for my peppermint body cream.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first attempt at making a whipped Shea butter peppermint cream and the results came out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I melted the Shea butter with coconut oil then I added the peppermint oil and the olive oil and argan oil. I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes then took it out and whipped it with a hand electric mixer to get a nice creamy consistency. The result was beautiful ivory whipped peppermint shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;I still have plenty of the shea butter left over so I can&#x27;t wait to make some more and give it as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! My daughter has horrible eczema, so we mix this, almond oil, and a few essential oils and it is GONE!</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand several times and it is by far the best Shea Butter out there. Great Price and Quality. I use for eczema and other skin aliments on my kids and myself. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter great quality, excellent  shipping  and customer  service  I will  definitely  order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a bit of shea butter in the past, since I prefer it to the chemicals in hand lotion.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve bought.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any of the hard, pebble-sized chunks you sometimes have to break down in raw shea butter.  It is very smooth, and melts in the hand almost instantly, making it easy to apply to the skin... just as easily as hand lotion actually.  Good product at a good price!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully on my skin.  Thanks  so much!</li>
            <li> Great shea butter!  Very creamy and smooth.  I have thrown all my lotions away that I used to use. If my skin was extremely dry, which is a lot of the time, it would turn red and sting after putting regular lotions on.  (They contain alcohol that actually dries out your skin-read the label)  My daughter has the same problem.  So we started looking for something different.  We tried many different lotions and creams, even some recommended by pharmacists.  The best seemed to be vaseline or bag balm until we tried shea butter and coconut oil.  Ahhhh!  My skin says thank you! It soaks in so soothing and isn&#x27;t overly greasy, what a wonderful product.  That being said not all shea butter is equal.  I have bought some in the past that was gritty. Although it did work it just doesn&#x27;t feel nice getting rubbed in.  Thank you for a quality product and timely shipping.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love it! We use this for a variety of homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started with essential oils and decided to make my own wrinkle cream for the first time..i used this shea butter as a main component and I just love it! Easy to work with and I thought the price was great!</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would be the natural answer to my children&#x27;s eczema. All of the lotions, creams and soaps recommended by their doctors are full of chemicals and not only did they hate the stinging but I hated the ingredients. So I searched high and low for the best natural alternative and kept coming back to Shea butter. After reading reviews I knew I had to give this product a try. I am so glad I did! First of all, I love how pure it looks and smells when it arrives. The packaging is great. It is very thick and if you&#x27;re using it straight off of the block (without warming it) it does take a bit of encouragement to melt it down yourself. However whether you do it that way or warm it to soften, when applied to the skin it is silky smooth and instantly feels hydrating. So far my child with the more mild eczema has shown such improvement, the little dry patches are visible but I can&#x27;t feel them anymore, which is huge progress. (It&#x27;s been less than a week!) Anyone who deals with eczema knows what I mean. The child who has severe eczema and has more rashy skin than dry patches is also showing improvement but a little slower which I anticipated. Trying to hydrate the skin enough that it isn&#x27;t so itchy so that the rashes have a chance to diminish is a process, however the fact I have a product I can now apply with no crying or discomfort whatsoever is huge. Not only that but I&#x27;m completely comfortable with what I&#x27;m putting on their skin. I&#x27;m even using it myself because I love the feel and smell of it and can always use more moisture on my own skin!</li>
            <li> Great value! I no longer pay the hefty price for Shea butter from the store.</li>
            <li> Now this is what I call excellent butter! The butter itself is great, the packaging is excellent and it keeps it fresh, it looks nice, the bag is durable and it&#x27;s within another bag inside that one to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t dry. The customer service is excellent as well. If this is the first time buying or the millionth, you would want to try this!</li>
            <li> Great Product. No odor that I could smell and its consistency is just right. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great pure product!  Delivery was super fast.  I had a question about the product and I received an incredibly prompt and helpful response.  The ordered also included a link for a free download for a &#x27;recipe&#x27; book, which has been great as I&#x27;ve just started mixing up my own body and face butters.  Thank you Shea Butter Lady!!</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year and a half ago and Im still using it. I use this mostly in the summer time because it is a great long lasting moisturizing although it would make more sense to use this in the winter. I always use another lotion on top of this because i dont like the smell but this is a must have if you have very dry skin or just want a long lasting moisturizer for a great price.</li>
            <li> nice product and good quality</li>
            <li> I noticed the ratings were better on this product than the one I was using, so I decided to give it a try. So far, I agree with everyone else. My whipped body butter is Dreamy creamy now!</li>
            <li> Shea butter was great for the lotion I made. Nice consistency and made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I made the most amazing whipped body butter with this shea! I did equal parts shea butter and organic coconut oil, then whipped it until light and fluffy. At that point it was usable, but I didn&#x27;t care for the nutty smell of the shea butter. I added about 10 drops of lavender essential oil and mixed again. Holy. Cow. This stuff is incredible! I&#x27;ve been using it head to toe after showering and have noticed a major difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my go-to product from now on. No more overpriced, fancy French creams that are only 20% shea butter!</li>
            <li> Seeing as this is my first time using the product I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too, but it is as expected and has helped my skin in various ways. I haven&#x27;t used it a lot since I got it either to give a very detailed review. My only complaint I would say is it smells like a food product, like butter or something. I mostly noticed it when my wife used it. When I used it I didn&#x27;t notice it much, but I did notice it when my wife used it.</li>
            <li> I am from Spain and teaching Spanish in the States during the summer and this is one of the best shea butter I&#x27; ve ever bought. I arrived on time and Isabella sent me an email with the ebook, she is really nice and really wants to help. I think I will buy more shea butter before August.</li>
            <li> Just got this Shea butter and already loving it! Used it to make sunblock which turned out great! Very excited to make some of the recipes they recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own lotions, creams and cosmetics. Although I just started to use it, I am enjoying the quality of this Shea Butter. It is so rich! I have used it together with cocoa butter to make a body butter. It is so moisturizing and creamy, but most importantly there are no chemicals in it! I would recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter! I made face lotion using one of the recipes I received with my purchase. The lotion turned out wonderful. I have been using it for a week and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great shea butter. I use it to make my own body lotions. The smell is very subtle, the butter was soft and smooth (not grainy like some others).</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  Comes in a durable, zipseal bag.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Arrived looking like the picture. But it was gritty like sand, cannot use as is. I&#x27;ve tried to make body butter with it but the lotion became gritty after a few days. I read that if you melt it and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down, it would be &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;. Experimented with that using about ~3 oz of the shea butter. Nope, still looks and feels grainy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter itself is definitely higher quality than what I ordered afterwards from another seller, in that it was not in any way &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; but unfortunately the shea butter from both share the same gritty, unpleasant texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched on youtube and read that good quality shea butter is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep looking. :|</li>
            <li> Smells WONDERFUL and &#x27;clean&#x27; like Shea should. Great for my salves and balms. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This is the first time using raw shea butter, but the way it absorbs into my skin, moisturizes and softens is superior to any type of oil/butter/lotion I&#x27;ve used previously. I needed something more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; than what I&#x27;ve been using for regular dry skin. I bought it to help moisturize and nourish my skin as it stretches during this pregnancy and I&#x27;m feeling very optimistic about it. So far it&#x27;s been great for my hands, feet and belly. Absolutely loving it. I wish I had this during the drying winter weather in Wyoming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived as shown in the picture. The color is consistent throughout, the scent is light and kind of nutty. I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> This is the best raw, unrefined shea butter I have found anywhere.  It&#x27;s consistently high-quality, order after order!  And it&#x27;s truly unrefined.  Nothing has been done to mess with the nutritional value or the texture.  I use this product straight, blended with a bit of clove oil, as an all-over body moisturizer, and with no scent added as a facial moisturizer.  I am completely awestruck at the change in my skin since I began using pure shea butter.  I am 40 years old and was still plagued occasionally with acne...not anymore!  And the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes? GONE.  My skin is smooth, soft, and comfortable, and glows like it never has in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use this, combined with organic coconut oil and a few drops of peppermint oil, as a deodorant.  I decided the store-bought antiperspirants that cause breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s are not for me or my niece, and we went natural a few weeks ago.  90 degree heat in Kentucky wearing a black business suit to meetings, walking three or four miles daily, and NO body odor.  Google shea butter deodorant recipes and get yourself off the fast track to diseases caused by store-bought products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and use it.  You will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Live this shea butter!</li>
            <li> I never could put Shea Butter on my face but this one is amazing. I have oily acne prone skin, most product with a heaviness to them would break me out not this butter. This is my second order I will continue to use it as long as it remains the same.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good customer service.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels good. 2nd time purchasing from this company and quality is consistant.</li>
            <li> using this for pregnancy stretch-mark prevention, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I plan on whipping it up with a cocoa butter and that will improve the smell. the product itself it great, good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Melts to a creamy texture as soon as I rub it between my hands. I used it to make a tea tree oil acne spot cream and it is working like magic!</li>
            <li> So far I have made chap stick and deoderant and loving it!! It is very creamy and leaves my skin soft!! Will be ordering again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it for my hair and skin. It keeps my naturally coily hairs FRIZZ to a minimum. I would however like to see a different sized Ziploc bag for storage. The one that ships is way too long. After using for a few days it became messy.  Nevertheless I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 separate orders of this 100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter, and love it! I have made many products with this Shea Butter; it melts beautifully!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is simply awesome! After reading a lot of reviews and comparing different manufacturers, i decided on this one and I am so gald i got this. The product comes with a card that gives you the link to different recipes that you can use. I had a couple of questions regarding the product and I received the replies within 24 hours. Excellent product and excellent customer service! If you are looking for a good 100% raw organic shea butter, i would definitely recommend you to get this one and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it in conjunction with coconut oil to make some lotion and everyone loved it!</li>
            <li> Very nice....creamy and easy to use</li>
            <li> Love the Shea butter! I made a recipe for my sons eczema and used this Shea butter! Great seller, awesome product, and quick shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Shea butter!!!</li>
            <li> This worked on the skin better than all the other medicated creams that we tried... I wish I would have used this first.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It was delivered promptly. The shea butter has a creamy color and it smells like I expected. I&#x27;ve purchased twice from this seller since I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of organic, raw Shea butter. I got it to make my own shaving cream with coconut oil and olive oil. It works wonderfully! I can&#x27;t compare the Shea butter to anything else, since it&#x27;s my first purchase, but I will definitely buy this brand again. Simply because, it was a good size for the prize and arrived very quickly (thanks, Prime).</li>
            <li> Amazing! Price can&#x27;t be beat. So moisturizing and sinks right in. Will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used it to make a body butter for my baby and it is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it on myself a few times as well and love it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted!  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves a diy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter. She just started making natural skin care products and really loved using this and the Shea butter</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter. I have made some wonderful skin products.</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter ever. The packing is a nice touch with the natural look. The best thing is the actual product. The weight and everything was described perfectly. I use it for my hair and skin. I do also like the recipes they provided on the card. I will be only purchasing my Shea butter here from now on.</li>
            <li> Used in my lip balm, seems like it moisturizes good. Very bad scent and quite hard but other than that it seems like a great product</li>
            <li> Easily the BEST Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased!!! Has a very mild scent, is super soft and easy to work with. I actually like the smell of this Shea butter whereas all others I&#x27;ve purchased (especially from large name suppliers) the smell was so overwhelming that I had a hard time using the product! Love this Shea and will continue purchasing from Better Shea Butter... Because it really is BETTER!!</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter,  but it is NOT 16oz. Mine is 13oz. I weighed it. I don&#x27;t care for the scent - it&#x27;s not good or bad - but the scent dissipates quickly, so I don&#x27;t mind. It melts quickly,  and is easy to use. I&#x27;ll be trying some of the recipes. I&#x27;d give it a 5 if they hadn&#x27;t shorted on the amount.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! And that says a lot since I&#x27;m such a picky person. Honestly wish It came in a larger amount and would last longer without mixing it with other products but without a doubt, I will be purchasing from this vendor from now on ☺️ I think I&#x27;ve found a staple!</li>
            <li> Great for DIY projects and homemade products. No overwhelming or weird smells or textures. It has a noticeable scent but it&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s not bad. I thought it was great quality. For my last chapstick batch, I used a different Shea butter brand and I think it made my final chapstick product a little grainy and unpleasant, but this brand is top notch!  Edit: I&#x27;ve tried other Shea butters, and even tried using cocoa butter instead for my projects, and I have regretted all of them. This is still my favorite. Ends up with the smoothest product without any strange smells. It&#x27;s definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Using it in homemade body butter.</li>
            <li> It was perfect. I use it for my skin and hair as I do mix it with other oils. And I love the recipe guide from online.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It blends very well with various essential oils and has worked wonders on my dry &#x27;winter skin&#x27;. Would definitely re-order again.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this raw Shea butter. I love it!! I have psoriasis and I use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Erica Dennin</li>
            <li> Great seller to work with!  Product was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft! It&#x27;s really help. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely moisturizing. I used it in a whipped lotion with coconut oil and lavender essential oil and it came out feeling very greasy and takes a long time to soak in. The recipe I used was 1 part coconut oil to 1 part shea butter so maybe less coconut oil? I also used it in lip balm with coconut oil, beeswax, and a touch of sweet almond oil. That turned out great and works extremely well. The shea butter alone does take a long time to soak into my skin, though. It is very moisturizing but I hate the greasy feeling. I have no prior experience with raw shea butter so nothing to compare it to but the smell is too strong for me as well. I am glad I tried it but I am going to try cocoa butter next time to see if that suits my particular desires better.</li>
            <li> this is the best!!!!!!!!! i make my own cream for my eczema that my dermatologist was thrilled with!!!! it also works GREAT</li>
            <li> As expected. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Most amazing shea butter there is.</li>
            <li> Works for great for extreme dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very good Shea butter. Been using it for about 6 months without any issues.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have very sensitive skin, eczema and this works wonders. I receive compliments on the healthiness and glow of my face. It has many benefits and it is organic. I use this product from head to toe. My daughter has started using this on her face for acne.</li>
            <li> I am still discovering ways to use this product. Excellent as lip balm, body lotion base, hair conditioner (used sparingly), and a tiny bit inside the nostrils temporarily clears my spring-allergy-induced sinus congestion. Initially loved how it conditioned the skin on my face, but after a couple of days&#x27; use noticed that area was beginning to break out a bit -- not anywhere else, however. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Not only does this fix dry skin immediately, its actually healed and reduced some of my face and hand skin issues like bags under eyes, thin under eye skin, and general hand dryness. Great natural product!</li>
            <li> No complaints. The smell took a bit to get used to. Love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> Used this, some cocoa butter, beeswax and coconut oil to make some lotion bars. Came out great.  Will use this company again.</li>
            <li> In my transition to natural, homemade cosmetics (no more parabens for me), I decided to make a moisturizer using unrefined organic Shea butter, jojoba oil and a few skin-friendly essential oils. Well, my skin has been thanking me ever since. Although a homemade shea butter moisturizer is not as fluid and frothy as commercial products, the results were beyond my hopes. My skin feels silky smooth and so comfortable and supple. I will never go back to commercial moisturizers. I am looking forward to trying many of the ebook recipes provided by this merchant after purchase. They have thought of everything.</li>
            <li> Mixed this with essential oil and coconut oil, whipped it up and it&#x27;s wonderful for the face and body!</li>
            <li> Came perfectly wrapped and packaged. Used some to make homemade shaving cream for my husband. He loved it. Left him with a clean shaved  and moisturized face. The essential oils I used covered the smell of the shea.</li>
            <li> My skin is super (was) dry. This Shea butter has saved my skin. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter from this comapny for over a year now and I am extremly happy with the product. I get so many compliments about how beautiful my skin is as well as how smooth and delicate my face it. I have even been told that I look as if I am wearing make up while being au natural. It is very good for wrinkles as I am told I look 10 years or less younger. I love it. I highly recommend this brand. It is 100%.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, great packaging. Seems to be wonderful product. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I loved the Shea Butter. I have already made a few things with it and each are great. Would highly recommend this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another bottle of lotion again! Mixed with some organic bees wax and coconut oil, it makes a killer petroleum free pomade. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter I have ever used! I use to buy the de~luxe pure shea butter from drugstore, and have been using for the past 8 months. the moment I open the package and this organic unfrefined shea butter is not comparable . thank you.</li>
            <li> Beautifully smooth Shea butter. Wonderful for my homemade whipped body butter. So smooth and soft. Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff.  Healed the cracks on my skin that nothing else would.</li>
            <li> I was a little worries buying this after reading some reviews but this Shea butter is so soft and has a lovely light fragrance. Came packaged well and slices easily and melts well for my bath products. Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love this  shea  butter  it makes my skin so soft very  good on the  feet and legs smell good also.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the instructions on how to download the recipes - otherwise love it!</li>
            <li> I use it to make my son Ethan&#x27;s dermatitis trouble skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home made Dermatitis cream for Ethan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use homemade cream-  2-4 oz&lt;br /&gt;3/4 jar of  100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter heated to 80% melted, ( not over heated)&lt;br /&gt;  Bland in 1/4 jar of oil&lt;br /&gt;Pure Organic Argan oil or&lt;br /&gt;Organic Pure Fractionated Coconut oil or&lt;br /&gt;Pure Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, or&lt;br /&gt;Cold Pressed Jojoba Oil or&lt;br /&gt;Avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;Or mix up any oil above&lt;br /&gt;8-12 drops of Melaleuca essential oils (tea tree oil)&lt;br /&gt;Renowned for its cleansing and rejuvenating effects on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Promotes healthy immune function&lt;br /&gt;Protects against environmental and seasonal threats&lt;br /&gt;8-12 drops of chamomile essential oils&lt;br /&gt;Has a therapeutic, calming effect on the skin, mind and body&lt;br /&gt;Soothes the system of the body.&lt;br /&gt;Supports a healthy inflammatory response&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon of Oregon grape tincture&lt;br /&gt;Option 1 : Frankincense essential oils -few drops&lt;br /&gt;  (Helps build and maintain a healthy immune system.

            <li> Great product and service. I use this product with my essential oils for face cream and pain cream. Can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can make with this new shipment!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d no idea how many different uses for Shea Butter, nor the variety of products it could be mixed with so am very pleased with the booklet of recipes. I try to not use chemicals, but organic creams are expensive, so I&#x27;ll be making a face cream, using shea butter, coconut oil &amp; either avocado or almond oil, but am interested also in the many other uses.  Thus far, I&#x27;ve used on its own on my face - take care here as it pulls on the skin a bit when applying, but once on, feels super. I&#x27;ll know more after trying a couple of recipes, but am looking forward to using.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is soft and easy to break apart by hand.  It comes with an excellent recipe book.  I made coconut-shea body butter today.  All of the ingredients are natural and easy to get.  It is a rich, easy to use body butter that is very moisturizing.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product is mild and non-irritating.  This is a great product to save money.  I will be using it to replace higher priced products purchased from a specialty store.</li>
            <li> Omg WOW. This is my first time buying shea butter and I wanted to make a diy lotion so I ordered and this is just amazIng. I tried it alone and I also made a body butter and I&#x27;m just amazed with it. I love it. Thank you so much!! Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of Shea butter to use in homemade lotions, lotion bars, and deodorant. Some of them do not melt smoothly or feel grainy. This Shea butter smelled great-not too strong and melts amazingly. It is soft right out of the package. I will be ordering this brand again!</li>
            <li> Used this in an eczema balm for my kids and it worked like magic clearing up their rashes.</li>
            <li> Its doing what it is supposed to do, only better.</li>
            <li> I started using it this week and I loved the texture and smell.  I am a gardener, and often my legs and arms dry out from the season changes and frequent showering.  I wanted to use a moisturizer that is toxic free but feeds my dry skin.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great product</li>
            <li> Awesome product for your hair! I loved it. I mixed in the raw Shea butter with olive oil and almond together and my hair looked amazing! I loved your Shea butter!</li>
            <li> Loved this product and found it to be great quality!</li>
            <li> this is a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, and the Package was sealed perfectly and it was in great conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone and buy it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and Excellent service! I recommend it to many of my friends and family.  This is my second time buying this product, the service is always great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Smooths my skin it was so dry and this really help!! this is my 2nd order!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Great packaging</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my skin was suffering. My skin was actually cracking and hurting.  So far, this Shea Butter is relieving the dryness. I&#x27;ve also mixed it with some vitamin E and olive oil, which is a little greasy but I really like it. Anyway, I would recommend this to others whether you&#x27;re in the desert or not.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it for my skin and my sons eczema!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great shipping service!</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin feeling baby soft and does not clog my pores. I mix it with tea tree oil to help fight blemishes, and always wake up looking better than when I went to bed.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter! this is my second purchase - I use to make a lotion with coconut oil and essential oils.  No more dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li> Bought this Shea Butter for my sister. She loves it. It soothes dry skin without feeling greasy. I would absolutely buy it again. This time for myself.</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!!  I made a whipped butter with cocoa butter, coconut oil, and sweet almond oil...love it!!</li>
            <li> I like this, and have been using it as a body moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and like using a one-ingredient product. It&#x27;s very rich and moisturizing. When I first received it, it smelled very smoky. The customer service was great -- they told me they thought it was the plastic wrapper in the summer heat and asked me to remove the wrapper and let it sit out for 2 days and they would replace it if it still smelled smokey.  Sure enough, the smell went away and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Super, I whipped it up, added my oils and I have a wonderful body butter!</li>
            <li> This worked great in making my own lip glosses and creams. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I cannot express how happy I am with my purchase of this Organic Shea Butter! I finally made the Whipped Lavender Body Butter recipe that I had found online. Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m going to throw out every store bought lotion I own because I&#x27;m not going back to store bought chemical lotions!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! And the seller was very helpful. I&#x27;m about to order another pound for home experiments. The book is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is truly pure shea butter. First of all it&#x27;s the consistency of packed brown sugar. Very granular. I&#x27;ve never seen shea butter like that. Secondly, the &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; version is not ivory. It&#x27;s a pale yellow. Makes me think they blended it with another butter (whatever that darker yellow stuff is). Lastly, it&#x27;s oily and greasy, leaves a serious shine which other true shea butters I&#x27;ve used do not do. Others I&#x27;ve used absorb well and just leave a bit of a glow, like if you use it on your legs it should make the skin look bright not shimmery/oily. I also have used pure unrefined shea butter on my face before but I would never want to put this stuff on my face. This product went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> Made my first body butter with this product and it turned out great</li>
            <li> Came as part of a gift I&#x27;m making.  It was a whole week early!  Now maybe I can get it done and there for Christmas!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used this to make body butter for the first time, it was was easy to work with. The end result was exactly what I hoped. I will probably never buy moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> I tried several Shea butters and this brand is by far the best! It goes on smooth and has a wonderful nutty smell, I use it on my son with eczema and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product superior but so is the customer service.</li>
            <li> Packaging was well done and arrived sooner than I expected. ( Not complaining). I have used it two times as a carrier oil for body butter and I was very pleased with the results. I will be ordering it again. I did down load the e-book and plan to try some of the recipes.</li>
            <li> I just got this in today.  It shipped quickly and well packaged.  I have never tried any true Shea butter, but this stuff feels amazing; extremely smooth when applying.  Nutty smell I&#x27;m not big on, but I&#x27;d rather have that then perfumes in it.  I will probably order the Cocoa butter from this vendor as well!</li>
            <li> I have used it to make body butter and lip balm, and both turned out great! I love the quality of this shea butter and am happy the smell of it is really mild. I have very sensitive skin, and have been having lots of issues with breakouts and rashes and since using my homemade stuff, my skin feels and looks great. It&#x27;s really easy to make your own stuff if you have quality products, and this is a good one. You can use it to make body butter, lip balm, salves, conditioner, and scrubs and more so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Used this in a recipe to make home made body butter and it worked great! It melted smoothly and evenly in a double boiler. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> My first order was in August 2014. My second, before I ran out, was in December. I use it without adding anything to it for my face, neck, hair/scalp, under-arm deodorant, and a dry spot that shows up from time to time on one leg. I leave it in the bag except for what I am using. What I use I put it in a Anchor Hocking 6 Ounce Glass Custard Cup With a Snap On Lid. Travels well. Warm or cold it goes on easily. In some places I stay the temperature is 60 degrees, so I put some under my arms, on my face, and then my leg. I go back and rub it in because my body warms it quickly. I use what is on my hands to rub into my hair and scalp. Pure. No additives. No aluminum. Works great for me</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer- gives my face beautiful glow and great moisturizer especially during the winter months!</li>
            <li> So smooth. I will buy from you again.</li>
            <li> Good for cosmetics. Not gritty so there isn&#x27;t extra processing needed.</li>
            <li> Love the product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product and company! My items arrived on time and in great condition.  Since I received my shea butter I have made body butter, lotion, lip balms and hair masks and everything turned out great!  This shea butter smells fantastic and is very good quality.  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s legs are incredibly dry and get very ashy.  Using this shea butter just one time has made the skin on his legs much, much better.  He&#x27;s six and enjoys warming up the shea butter in his hands to make it smooth before he puts it on his legs - this stuff is a hit.  It&#x27;s great for my dry heels too.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but I had to do a review on this shea butter. This is by far the best shea butter I have ever brought. This shea butter is very smooth and not gritty. I am African American and I have 4c  hair. Any African American who has this type of hair. KNOWS IT IS THE DRIEST of any hair type!. This shea butter leaves my hair very soft &amp; easy to manage. It does not leaves a white residue on my hair. Just a healthy shine. I also use this butter on my lips, under eyes, body. I&#x27;m in love with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> i love it, its smooth, goes easily into the skin and leave it nice, i use it even during the day as moisture. i don&#x27;t use any other product, its perfect</li>
            <li> Great value for a great product. I make lotion bars, lotions, and lip balms with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter. It is light and fluffy as well as odorless .  I use it on my skin and hair. It is also good for clearing skin blemishes such as pimples.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to make some homemade deodorant, and she loves it. I was also having problems with psoriasis, and putting this Shea butter on has made my skin very moisturized. I have had problems finding a cream or lotion that would penetrate the dry patches, but I have definitely found one now.&lt;br /&gt;The block is a pretty good size, and seems like it will last awhile. My wife has made her deodorant, and we both have used it for a skin moisturizer, and there is still a lot left.&lt;br /&gt;We both love the fact that this product is unrefined, raw and organic. We know what we are putting on our skin, and I know our skin will thank us for not putting chemicals on it instead.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - We love this product and will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Isabelle (the Owner) did a great job seeing that we were satisfied with our purchase the first time!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter! It&#x27;s a staple in all my lotions; great for rejuvenating older, dried out skin! I would not risk buying another brand. This company is apparently doing it right --- superior quality at a reasonable price ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product a few times and it works great for my body butter, soaps, and lip balm. Its a soft butter and easy to work with. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service! Awesome product, and the packaging is very responsible as well. Definitely would recommend this</li>
            <li> A very nice product. I have used it in a few different recipes, and like it. It is my first time buying shea butter, and I&#x27;m happy to have it to try various natural recipes, such as lip balm.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase.  Prompt receipt of items purchased.  Very decent for the price.  Quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this Shea butter! Very mild smell, creamy texture, and by far the best moisturizer I have ever used!! I already &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; up a body cream using avocado oil and lavender and can not emphasize how much better my dry skin feels! Gave some to my daughter and she wants me to make a batch for her! Fast delivery and great packaging! Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the shea butter! It came just as described in the product info. I appreciate having the recipe book as well. I&#x27;ve been looking into healthier more natural ways to moisturize my skin and being new to all of the options, I appreciate having the recipes. I definitely plan on trying some of Better Shea Butter&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised.  I liked the packaging and the quality of the product.  Used in my hair last night after washing it and it simply melted into my locks.  I will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> love it and my skin loves it</li>
            <li> I used the unrefined organic shea butter in my mixture when I created my own shea butter and coconut oil moisturizer. It smells wonderful, I heart the scent of shea butter, and it&#x27;s great for your hair. My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, but shea butter, in combination with a few other products, helps keep her hair happy and healthy. It was also packaged properly and arrived in block form as shown. I will probably purchase from this seller again. Make your own hair care products and save money! Watch my tutorial. DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!!! Just got it to make my own facecream with some essential oils. Very greasy going on (night time) but I wake up with much healthier, more vibrant skin. My skin is also clearing up of breakouts. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Unrefined Organic Shea Butter! Purchased to make Eczema Crème for my granddaughter. Superior quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company, Better Shea Butter, is truly outstanding. Wonderful recipes available and easy access to support, if ever needed. They have earned my continued business!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged.  Was exactly as promised and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before. I&#x27;m very impressed! It&#x27;s like silk on my skin. I will definitely be ordering this again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> My number one staple product in my skin care routine. I swear by this stuff!! I put it on at night as it&#x27;s very rich. It&#x27;s calmed my acne, fades my scars and I wake up with plump, glowing hydrated skin. This is also the only stuff that has worked on my toddlers eczema. The price is great and This 1lb will last me forever but I will absolutely reorder from this vendor when I run out.</li>
            <li> The seller was awesome delivered as promised. I loved the shea butter Excellent product</li>
            <li> I made lotion with this shea butter and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> I just made my first whipped shea butter recipe and it was just how it would look it in the recipe book that comes free.  A little messy but that&#x27;s fine since my hands were very soft after I got everything together.  My ends have never felt smoother, so once my current block goes out I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I use it to make my own body lotion and it it wonderful for our dry, winter, skin!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great. It melts at the touch, is soft, and doesn&#x27;t have any weird stuff in it (like the batch I got from another company.) Will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> Best I have bought will continue to purchase this brand. Great recipe book that comes as download. Made 2 different items the day I looked at the book. Plan to make others.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using Shea Butter.  So glad I picked this one, love it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. This is  clearly a high quality Shea butter, and well worth the price. I will be a repeat customer for sure! And I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very nice Shea butter. I will be purchasing again.  I made my own natural lotion and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is Authentic!!! I have only be using it for 4days now and let me tell you...this butter works like Magic. I can see the brown spots on my skin even out tone wise, my skin feels softer and smoother at the same time. I am very happy to have found Better Shea Butter. It is definitely worth the price!!! :)</li>
            <li> I especially love the scent of this unrefined shea butter. Also, I like that it&#x27;s texture is griddy because it is more malleable for hand applications. I mainly use my shea butter in my body butters and find that this one is a little less dense, so I have to add larger amounts of the shea to get a better consistency. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to create a natural face lotion using essential oils. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks so not sure if it&#x27;s making a difference yet, but it feels great on my skin. However, this butter came very nicely packaged with no signs of mold like others mentioned. It was very easy to melt and mold into a lotion. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase this product and create new lotions. The customer service is excellent!</li>
            <li> I made hand cream using my Young Living Essential Oils and it turned out great.</li>
            <li> So far so good. will order again</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it to make lip balm, hand cream, and baby cream</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy.  Absorbs into skin beautifully. Used it to make a natural sunscreen as well as some lavender body butter.  Both products turned out wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in such a simple package. It smells good, and is easy to blend with other ingredients to make a fabulous body butter. Yay for organic!! The recipe book that comes with it as a download is super helpful too!</li>
            <li> This Shea is heavenly!!! My family loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product.  Great price for raw unrefined organic shea.  Weight was correct.  I made my first batch of whipped shea, and it turned out great at a fraction of the price I used to pay for the product in store.  And the bonus recipe book is a fun add.</li>
            <li> In the winter my daughter&#x27;s skin gets dry and scaley.  I have tried many products and spent alot of money to try to heal her skin.  Finally, after watching a few Youtube videos I decided I would attempt to make my own body butter.  This shea butter arrived promptly, was easy to work with and in less than a week we have seen remarkable improvement in her skin. I am truly thankful this worked.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Came earlier than expected.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the recipes.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my skin every day, simply to keep it young,  tight, supple, smooth and moisturized well into old age. Simple as that. It works really well, and the only problem is, I have to apply it, leave on for about half an hour and get it off because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin. It just sits on the outside?&lt;br /&gt;If anybody knows how to actually get this stuff into our skin let me know.</li>
            <li> Love it already made lotion with It. It is as amazing as I had read it was.</li>
            <li> Good communication, great product. Love the fact that recipes are sent, hope they turn out as good as they sound! Can&#x27;t wait to try several!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Pure, Organic and unrefined just what I ordered.  Thanks for such a great shea butter. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my hair, but have been using it on my skin and the results have been awesome.Felt the difference immediately. Softness. Smoothness. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I did not receive the recipe booklet but I most definitely recommend it. I will be ordering more, I love the way my skin feel after bathing in it.</li>
            <li> Hi there!  I am very pleased with the quality of this Shea Butter. It was just as described</li>
            <li> No problem with the seller.  Just didn&#x27;t like the shea butter itself</li>
            <li> Having never purchased shea butter before, I was not really sure what to expect from this product, and simply ordered by relying on all the positive reviews... So glad I did!  This stuff looks, smells, and feels great! It also arrived well-packaged and speedily. A positive purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Smells ok. Looking forward to using it in soaps.</li>
            <li> It was grainy when I mixed it with Hemp and essential oils... And I broke out in acne on my body when I used it. I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll be using this butter.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Melts great and thickens up nice when whipped.</li>
            <li> My feet are incredibly dry and now living in Chicago they look truly awful.&lt;br /&gt;I was on the internet looking for a remedy as nothing had been working and I saw mention of using Shea Butter.  Naturally I then look on Amazon which is my go to place for research and found this product.  It arrived quickly and when I opened the packet I was a little taken aback - purely because I hadn&#x27;t expected it to look like a lump of lard.  However I was also quite excited  - to see this natural product made me realise what great value it was over a lotion with Shea butter in it.&lt;br /&gt;I quickly used the Shea butter and i just cannot believe the results.  I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it hasn&#x27;t &#x27;fixed&#x27; the hard skin completely - (i keep forgetting to use the product) but as long as i can remember to moisturise every day with this butter, my feet look and feel better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and lovely. Feels fantastic on the skin. I bought it to put in homemade mustache wax recipe, and will likely try it in several diy recipes.</li>
            <li> I made some whipped shea butter from this and my boyfriend loved it!! quality product that will not disappoint!!</li>
            <li> Nice texture. Sadly, both Shea Butters had a rancid, smokey scent.</li>
            <li> Smells rich and earthy and it&#x27;s so creamy! My skin loves it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction and product!</li>
            <li> Just received  and it looks wonderful and smells real good. plan on making hand lotion for girls @ work. Thanks for a really good product.</li>

            <li> Love how I can easily mix it with coconut oil to apply to my hair. My hair stays soft and manageable throughout the day. This shea butter is also one of the few products that I can put on my skin without breaking out! The packaging is great and the recipes are sweet addition to my order! Love it!!!</li>

            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this produce, needless to say I LOVE it!  I combine it with organic coconut oil and tea tree oil for a moisturizer for my face &amp; body, it&#x27;s the best!  YES, do purchase it!!!</li>

            <li> I love the shea butter! Much better than anything I have bought at the stores, my skin feels soft and supple after using it, this definitely a daily thing I will use and I will continue ordering this when I run out. Also, a little bit goes a long way..I estimate one order to last me months maybe a year</li>

            <li> Very high quality! I used this to make a whipped body butter and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter seems like great quality. It came in a butter block and its cream colored. The texture is nice. It has a fresh nutty smell. I used this to make some eczema and body lotions by adding essential oils.</li>
