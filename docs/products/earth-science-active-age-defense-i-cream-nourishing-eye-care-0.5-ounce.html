            <li>The best eye cream I&#x27;ve found--and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>great product, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>This product feels great around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I am a forty something woman and feel that this is a great product for my age range.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 and trying to take really good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is good for the price and does what&lt;br /&gt;I would expect, which is moisturize.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and smells pleasantly, but very lightly, of melon.</li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Environmentally safe hair-,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this brand.</li>
            <li>Some of the better eye cream out there.</li>
            <li>Once I got more and started using it at night and during the day, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this eye cream.</li>
            <li>but I have found another product that works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice amount of extra moisture around the eye area and has a wonderful fresh melon scent.  </li>
            <li>Package and cream were brand new in great condition.</li>
            <li>Great product not too greasy and agreeable with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for smoothing fine lines and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Very nice natural eye cream from a company in Santa Barbara.</li>
            <li>Price is excellent and ingredients are similar to MUCH, MUCH higher-priced products.</li>
            <li>This seems to be perfect for a late 30 something maybe 40 something (?) skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and dissipates instantly and smells fresh and feels so good.</li>
            <li>Like others said it works well under makeup and is natural, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I just finished using my 1st tube of this product and really enjoyed using this product so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another tube of it.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with ingredients sometimes, and this product has an awesome assortment of enriching stuff: glycerin, aloe vera, squaline, calendula, melon fruit, licorice root, honeysuckle, ginseng root, primrose oil, avocado oil, jojoba seed oil, corn oil, and shea butter and more.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this product is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice product to smooth those out and just improve the overall appearance of the skin around my eye.</li>
            <li>Must incorporate many other factors to age gracefully :)  ..</li>
            <li>Non greasy, and seems to soak right in and eliminate lines.</li>
            <li>It blends right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased another product by Earth Science that was recommended by a plastic surgeon on Dr. Oz, which I use and like very much.  </li>
            <li>This product seems like one of those &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; products, when you put it on your eyes look good, but after a few hours it has a reverse effect.</li>
            <li>No dramatic improvements, but I have never found any face or eye cream that has done so.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much improvement by way of fine lines and wrinkles but it seems to be keeping them from growing larger.</li>
            <li>Being 27, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent product</li>
            <li>I use a heavy duty eye cream at night, but during the day I wear this because it works much better under makeup.</li>
            <li>I think I am going to stick with my normal moisturizer and not use this ever again.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s gone, and my eyes feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>A common issue I&#x27;ve had with eye creams is that they flake up on my skin, either when used on top of a regular moisturizer</li>
            <li>not other eye cream has done this to me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice natural eye cream from a company in Santa Barbara. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or skin at all. Package and cream were brand new in great condition. Website says: \\&quot;Environmentally safe hair-, skin- and body-care without irritants, soaps, petroleum, toxins, heavy metals, artificial colors, animal ingredients or parabens\\&quot;. Not tested on animals. Made in USA. Website is earthsciencenaturals.com. I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this brand.</li>
            <li> Some of the better eye cream out there. Great price too. Non greasy, and seems to soak right in and eliminate lines. I ran out and noticed a disgusting difference in my eye areas. Way too many lines and bad skin texture. Once I got more and started using it at night and during the day, I noticed a difference.  This seems to be perfect for a late 30 something maybe 40 something (?) skin.</li>
            <li> I am not completely sure if I see a difference with this product or not, but I can tell you that I like the way my skin feels when I use it.  I use it in combination with a much more expensive eye cream and the combination of the two make my eyes look youthful.  Maybe it is all in my head, but I plan to keep buying this product as the extra moisture gives me the kick that I need.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on the smell. It&#x27;s so light and dissipates instantly and smells fresh and feels so good. After my last eye cream being way too perfumey, this is a relief. I think the smell is solely from the ingredients. Just a hint of melon, and then it&#x27;s gone, and my eyes feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;ve found--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  This also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this eye cream. It goes on smoothly and smells pleasantly, but very lightly, of melon. It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing. I am obsessed with ingredients sometimes, and this product has an awesome assortment of enriching stuff: glycerin, aloe vera, squaline, calendula, melon fruit, licorice root, honeysuckle, ginseng root, primrose oil, avocado oil, jojoba seed oil, corn oil, and shea butter and more. Each night I look forward to using it to prevent wrinkles. I&#x27;m 28 and trying to take really good care of my skin. My budget isn&#x27;t that big. Luckily, this product is inexpensive. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> age is aging.  Must incorporate many other factors to age gracefully :)  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..</li>
            <li> Like others said it works well under makeup and is natural, which is nice. No dramatic improvements, but I have never found any face or eye cream that has done so.</li>
            <li> Another product from Earth Science that I like. There products are all priced well and myself I have never had any reaction from the items that I use.</li>
            <li> great product, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another product by Earth Science that was recommended by a plastic surgeon on Dr. Oz, which I use and like very much.  Which was why I decided to give the eye cream a try.  It is good for the price and does what&lt;br /&gt;I would expect, which is moisturize.</li>
            <li> A common issue I&#x27;ve had with eye creams is that they flake up on my skin, either when used on top of a regular moisturizer and/or when makeup is applied afterwards.  This product does not flake up.  It blends right into my skin.  It adds a nice amount of extra moisture around the eye area and has a wonderful fresh melon scent.  I have not noticed much improvement by way of fine lines and wrinkles but it seems to be keeping them from growing larger.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy duty eye cream at night, but during the day I wear this because it works much better under makeup. Price is excellent and ingredients are similar to MUCH, MUCH higher-priced products.</li>
            <li> I quit using this after a few days because it made my eyes burn and blur - not other eye cream has done this to me.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product but I have found another product that works much better for me. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Dried out and irritated my skin for about a week. No returns are allowed.</li>
            <li> Sinks in and soothes ... No irritation or fuss.. Great product not too greasy and agreeable with sensitive skin.  Very light and I see improvements.</li>
            <li> Being 27, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles but I am starting to get little crows feet on the corner of my eye. I thought this would be a nice product to smooth those out and just improve the overall appearance of the skin around my eye.

Then when you wake up in the morning you look like Dracula with wrinkled disgusting eyes. I think I am going to stick with my normal moisturizer and not use this ever again. It doesn&#x27;t work longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Great for smoothing fine lines and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I just finished using my 1st tube of this product and really enjoyed using this product so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another tube of it. This product feels great around the eye area. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy or clogging pores. I am a forty something woman and feel that this is a great product for my age range.</li>
