            <li>I love these masks.</li>
            <li>Love these masks.</li>
            <li>Some of them are ok, but not all of them.</li>
            <li>They are very hydrating and provide you with a gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li>Love them so much!!!</li>
            <li>Work great the longer you left on and worked even greater as moiturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with these, they make my skin so soft, and the fit is nice.</li>
            <li>I like trying different ones first to see which one is best for my skin.</li>
            <li>Super recommended!</li>
            <li>I removed one star because these don&#x27;t fit my face as well as some masks.</li>
            <li>Came fast worked amazing</li>
            <li>I love Etude House stuff anyway, but these have been so soothing and fun.</li>
            <li>It was really sticky and after I used this, my face was kind of sticky too.</li>
            <li>The seller was very nice to give me 3 extra pcs and a lot of samples.</li>
            <li>I especially love the honey, propolis, and vitamin complex versions.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail very fast and I have liked everyone I tried so far!</li>
            <li>but thus far they&#x27;ve helped soothe some sunburn and made my face look bright and clear for an interview.</li>
            <li>Some other brands are lighter and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing as good of a job.</li>
            <li>I love Etude House&#x27;s sheet masks since they&#x27;re a nice, thick fabric and the serum that&#x27;s on them</li>
            <li>Very mousturizing and calming!</li>
            <li>they are designed for a pretty small/narrow face.</li>
            <li>The first mask I used was called a mango milk mask.</li>
            <li>:) I only use these once a week because I don&#x27;t want to pamper myself too much, and I don&#x27;t think I have problematic skin at all.</li>
            <li>I really really like this product</li>
            <li>For the price these really can&#x27;t be beat-</li>
            <li>I got this a while ago, and I really don&#x27;t think this is working on me.</li>
            <li>so you get a nice long facial from it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t really notice a difference from one mask to the next as far as the main ingredient is concerned.</li>
            <li>Fit is a little wonky but not terrible.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Decent sheet masks with moderate hydration.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a fun little mini-facial that you can do any day of the week.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them will be buying again</li>
            <li> These are great! I love Etude House&#x27;s sheet masks since they&#x27;re a nice, thick fabric and the serum that&#x27;s on them is thick as well. Some other brands are lighter and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing as good of a job. I haven&#x27;t used every one of these yet but thus far they&#x27;ve helped soothe some sunburn and made my face look bright and clear for an interview. They&#x27;re a fun little mini-facial that you can do any day of the week. I like to put one on and sit for 30 min or so reading. I removed one star because these don&#x27;t fit my face as well as some masks. The eye holes are a little small/off but it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t kind of adjust to.</li>
            <li> I love these. I sorted them by what they do (brightening, moisturizing, pore tightening, etc.) and try to change up the one I use every so often. I&#x27;m thrilled with these, they make my skin so soft, and the fit is nice. They take a long time to dry up so you get a nice long facial from it.</li>
            <li> The fit was great except for the eyes, but nothing to worry about. Very mousturizing and calming! Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Came fast worked amazing I like trying different ones first to see which one is best for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this mask set as you have plenty of options to test out. I really enjoyed the Royal Jelly, Green Tea, and Vita Complex. I deducted one star because some of the masks have different expiration dates (2015 and 2016) so I am trying to use the 2015 masks first before they go bad.</li>
            <li> I have used about 5 of these now and I am in love with them. Definitely will be re-purchasing!</li>
            <li> amazing products will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> These masks are great and have a good amount of extra serum. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love them so much!!! I have sensitive skin so&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared they would irritate my skin or break me out but nope! my skin feels great! Still can&#x27;t pick a fav.</li>
            <li> Awesome variety and non-irritating</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft. Feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the cute packaging. Decent sheet masks with moderate hydration. Fit is a little wonky but not terrible.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product, it makes my skin smoothly and brightly. The price is good too &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li> very easy to use and love it</li>
            <li> For the price these really can&#x27;t be beat- I especially love the honey, propolis, and vitamin complex versions. This is a great sampler pack to figure out what works best for your skin. I would say that if you have a wider face these may not fit as well- they are designed for a pretty small/narrow face. Tons of serum in every pack- enough to keep for an extra use!</li>
            <li> These came in sealed well. The seller was very nice to give me 3 extra pcs and a lot of samples. Super recommended! :) I only use these once a week because I don&#x27;t want to pamper myself too much, and I don&#x27;t think I have problematic skin at all. I just need this as a form of relaxation before I start another 60 hours workweek. :))</li>
            <li> Love these masks. They are very hydrating and provide you with a gorgeous glow. Downside, as with any mask, is that you need to use them on a regular basis to maintain. Luckily, the packs are fairly inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Also - I don&#x27;t really notice a difference from one mask to the next as far as the main ingredient is concerned.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast, great packaging. I&#x27;m excited to try this out because my skin has been very dull lately! I was a little confused because when I first opened the package the mask facing towards me was The Face Shop blueberry mask, but It turns out that I received an extra mask!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail very fast and I have liked everyone I tried so far! No issues with any on my skin</li>
            <li> Work great the longer you left on and worked even greater as moiturizer</li>
            <li> I love these masks. I love Etude House stuff anyway, but these have been so soothing and fun. I even got my husband to wear one and it helped his skin, too. There is such a variety here so there is a mask for all your needs. I use them once or twice a week, and my skin is loving it.</li>
            <li> All the varieties of masks included in this collection are very nice. Very hydrating and refreshing. I pop mine in the fridge for about 5 minutes before I place this sheet mask on my face. It&#x27;s a weekly routine. Makes me feel like a princess, and my skin feels great!!!</li>
            <li> Not as thick or moist as other brands.</li>
            <li> Love these masks. Wide variety to address different issues.</li>
            <li> I got this a while ago, and I really don&#x27;t think this is working on me. The first mask I used was called a mango milk mask. It was really sticky and after I used this, my face was kind of sticky too. So I had to wash my face every time I used them. Some of them are ok, but not all of them.</li>
