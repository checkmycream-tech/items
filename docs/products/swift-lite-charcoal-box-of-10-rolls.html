            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>Swift lite self-lighting charcoal is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This box is great.</li>
            <li>and I am really happy with my decision.  </li>
            <li>I think you can spare another minute! :-P )</li>
            <li>Good price, great quality--</li>
            <li>This is a good quality of charcoal at a great price.</li>
            <li>It is easy to ignite and the packaging is perfect for extending its shelf life.  </li>
            <li>These are really good charcoal blocks.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these!</li>
            <li>Your tobacco should taste just fine (or atleast as good as with any quick-light coals).</li>
            <li>but after a good blasting, does fine.</li>
            <li>It lights quickly and stays at a good temperature for waves of smoke.  </li>
            <li>Lasts for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>The plasticized foil wrapper keeps these safe from humidity.  </li>
            <li>I will definately buy more from this supplier and resins too..</li>
            <li>Good stuff, easy light, burns kind of fast</li>
            <li>Lights easily</li>
            <li>They light really easy compared to others I had tried.</li>
            <li>(if you follow directions: light at edge).</li>
            <li>Light after one try, instead of after 10 minutes of trying.  </li>
            <li>They are nice however they are smaller than the last ones I ordered they burn great .</li>
            <li>The price was right but the charcoal takes a bit of effort to light and get going.</li>
            <li>burns fine if you can handle having hot coals around your house.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and quick delivery</li>
            <li>You MUST wait until all of the chemicals burn off first!</li>
            <li>themselves are good; relatively as expected, as I&#x27;ve used this brand before.</li>
            <li>It burns clean, is packed very efficiently and for 100 charcoal pieces this was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this long lasting charcoal.</li>
            <li>Start very fast but also burn for a long time and just hot enough to create a good burn on the resins i use.</li>
            <li>However for some reason the coals i received are smaller (and yes, seem to have more quick-burning chemicals, with a more pungent odor) than the ones of the same brand that I purchased at my local market.</li>
            <li>thanks .</li>
            <li>It has a wood burning smell at first but then goes away after it&#x27;s completely lit.</li>
            <li>Nice size - bigger than ones I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li>I have bought other charcoal tablets to burn resins and they take ages to light and then go out..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the hold-up, given they were shipped from New Jersey and I live in Philadelphia.</li>
            <li>These are harder to find than some of the other brands, but they work so much better!  </li>
            <li>I used to buy these at a local metaphysical store, but due to some life changes I have not been able to get there to buy any from them.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with other where the block does not light correctly and therefore it does not make for a good experience.</li>
            <li>Everyone I have used so far lights correctly and uniformly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sitting and staring at my shiny new tobacco for over 2 weeks (tobacco which was, by the way, shipped Standard from Georgia and, even despite a shipping order error at first, arrived within 3 days flat).</li>
            <li>So far I am in the second package (they came with 10 rolls, I think 10 tablets in each roll) and ALL the charcoal lit with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>Although the briquettes are smaller than the kind we used previously, they lasted a long time and only 2 were needed (rather than the usual 3) for a whole service.  </li>
            <li>Hold the coal away at arms length (far away from your face) and light it evenly it until you see all of the chemicals burn away (when it stops looking/sounding like a sparkler), the coal glows red on on both sides (sometimes giving it a little blow helps - again only AFTER the chemicals burn off!), and there is little to no smoke coming off the coal...THEN put it on the hookah screen/tin foil and smoke away!</li>

            <li> Ordered on May 20th - Slated to Arrive on May 30th (Which still seems long for priority shipping) - Finally arrived June 5th.</li>
            <li> Please smoke responsibly - there are a million and one hookah forums online; if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, take the few minutes to look it up!</li>
            <li> Difficult to light initially,</li>
            <li> Saves on incense as you don&#x27;t have to try to huddle your incense onto the single lit spot in hopes it will burn.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve already spent all of this time reading Amazon reviews on charcoals...</li>
            <li> For those people who complain about the chemical taste the coals add to their smoke -  I assume most of this is common knowledge, but it is VERY dangerous to directly inhale those chemicals, so on the offchance that there are people who don&#x27;t know this yet: You should NEVER under any circumstance be putting the coal immediately on the hookah.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how long they took to arrive - supposedly I received free priority shipping?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t risk carbon monoxide or other poisoning!!</li>
            <li> If you are tasting those chemicals, you likely didn&#x27;t wait long enough - again very very dangerous.</li>

            <li> Great Product! Lights easily (if you follow directions: light at edge). I love it! I use it for burning sandalwood chips and powder and frankincense and myrrh. Nice size - bigger than ones I&#x27;ve previously used. Lasts for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how long they took to arrive - supposedly I received free priority shipping? Ordered on May 20th - Slated to Arrive on May 30th (Which still seems long for priority shipping) - Finally arrived June 5th. I don&#x27;t understand the hold-up, given they were shipped from New Jersey and I live in Philadelphia. I&#x27;ve been sitting and staring at my shiny new tobacco for over 2 weeks (tobacco which was, by the way, shipped Standard from Georgia and, even despite a shipping order error at first, arrived within 3 days flat). I only ordered from this seller because of the close proximity from which they were being sent (and thus, in my mind, the speed with which they would arrive). I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coals themselves are good; relatively as expected, as I&#x27;ve used this brand before. I&#x27;m a big fan of quick-light charcoal, and this brand has served me well for the price. However for some reason the coals i received are smaller (and yes, seem to have more quick-burning chemicals, with a more pungent odor) than the ones of the same brand that I purchased at my local market. Hm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**JUST A NOTE: For those people who complain about the chemical taste the coals add to their smoke -  I assume most of this is common knowledge, but it is VERY dangerous to directly inhale those chemicals, so on the offchance that there are people who don&#x27;t know this yet: You should NEVER under any circumstance be putting the coal immediately on the hookah.

Please smoke responsibly - there are a million and one hookah forums online; if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, take the few minutes to look it up!

            <li> These work great. Start very fast but also burn for a long time and just hot enough to create a good burn on the resins i use. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These are harder to find than some of the other brands, but they work so much better!  Light after one try, instead of after 10 minutes of trying.  The charcoal disks are also a bit larger. Very happy.</li>
            <li> They light really easy compared to others I had tried.</li>
            <li> burns fine if you can handle having hot coals around your house.</li>
            <li> They are nice however they are smaller than the last ones I ordered they burn great .</li>
            <li> The plasticized foil wrapper keeps these safe from humidity.  Holding one area in the lighter flame (use tongs!) lights the entire briquette as the fire sparkles and pops throughout.  Saves on incense as you don&#x27;t have to try to huddle your incense onto the single lit spot in hopes it will burn.  Burns thoroughly.  Good price, great quality--I&#x27;m glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, easy light, burns kind of fast</li>
            <li> These are really good charcoal blocks. I used to buy these at a local metaphysical store, but due to some life changes I have not been able to get there to buy any from them. I also like the idea of buying them in bulk instead of in individual packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a problem using these yet. Everyone I have used so far lights correctly and uniformly. I have had issues with other where the block does not light correctly and therefore it does not make for a good experience. I use these to burn home made incense. I would recommend this product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Swift lite self-lighting charcoal is a great product.  It is easy to ignite and the packaging is perfect for extending its shelf life.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to determine what brand of self-lighting charcoal to purchase.</li>
            <li> The price was right but the charcoal takes a bit of effort to light and get going.</li>
            <li> I got some charcoal before and it was a disaster. This box is great. So far I am in the second package (they came with 10 rolls, I think 10 tablets in each roll) and ALL the charcoal lit with no problem at all. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Burns even and burns fully.  It has a wood burning smell at first but then goes away after it&#x27;s completely lit.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this long lasting charcoal. It burns clean, is packed very efficiently and for 100 charcoal pieces this was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for use at the church and was told by the thurifer (the incense person) that is was really terrific.  It lights quickly and stays at a good temperature for waves of smoke.  Although the briquettes are smaller than the kind we used previously, they lasted a long time and only 2 were needed (rather than the usual 3) for a whole service.  We&#x27;ll be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have bought other charcoal tablets to burn resins and they take ages to light and then go out..these ones fizz and crackle and glow almost immediately..I will definately buy more from this supplier and resins too..thanks .</li>
            <li> I have bought a different brand of charcoal before and I was undecided about trying this brand. Finally I decided to buy it and I am really happy with my decision.  This is a good quality of charcoal at a great price.</li>
            <li> Forget matches, cigarette  and BBQ lighters and break out a blowtorch (literally).  Difficult to light initially, but after a good blasting, does fine.</li>
