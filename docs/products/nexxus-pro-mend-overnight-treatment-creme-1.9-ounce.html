            <li>After one use it worked great.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy about it,</li>
            <li>Been using it for years and works great for my hair</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t wanna keep getting a trim 4 to 6 wks.  </li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>It goes great with the Nexxus pro mend straightening lotion.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for a while, the best one yet for split ends! :)</li>
            <li>:) AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>and I loved it; I noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really good Treatment.</li>
            <li>They dnt do a good job.</li>
            <li>, I Loved that product alone, at that time I  was using Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting all four products but surprisingly even the shampoo/conditioner alone will help</li>
            <li>Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I love it so perfect for my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>its okay, doesn&#x27;t work any better than cheaper conditioners, still think caratin is the best leave in out there</li>
            <li>The Pro-Mend line truly is one of the best hair care products out there right now.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is amazing</li>
            <li>so idk ...... it does smell nice though, &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy ..</li>
            <li>I also bought the daily leave-in treatment, and it smells great and works as an excellent styling aid for the tips, too (easier to curl).  </li>
            <li>She said she liked it, that it worked</li>
            <li>The absolute best split end product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product because after just one use I could see a difference in my split ends.  </li>
            <li>The product shipped fine and was delivered in good time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the BEST Overnight hair cream treatment I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and tangles instantly after combing or washing it, damaging the ends, so I thought that I would use one of the Pro Mend products, and this was the best rated.  </li>
            <li>how many ways I tried application.</li>
            <li>This overnight treatment made my severely fried, over-processed highlights look/feel silky and swingy, like healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than the leave-in that you are supposed to use during the day, and</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair feels and smells.  </li>
            <li>my ends seemed much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was interesting.</li>
            <li>Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.</li>
            <li>I love this line from Nexxus, it works so well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>So this is a win-win for me :)</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and bouncier after just 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li>Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once since then,and i love it.</li>
            <li>Better than any leave in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And of course if your ends are too damaged, you&#x27;d do better trimming them.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is more managable, shinier all the way to the tips, and feels sooooo soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>I love the leave in and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>product itself is ok</li>
            <li>Split ends seems to disappear (temporarily) and my hair is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Of course it works better the longer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have as many split-ends as I had.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li>It does not make any &amp;#34;magic trick&amp;#34; but it does make most of my split ends invisible.</li>
            <li>work is fantastic I bought 2 more for my friend and I recoment my sister and she order 2 more .</li>
            <li>I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.</li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so true for my hair get more healthy...</li>
            <li>This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what happens if it improves even more.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and is highlighted every 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.</li>
            <li>I think if you know how to section your hair when applying product you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products, they have seen great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>This product makes me hair so gorgeous and soft and you can see the difference when you use it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the whole Promend set (shampoo, Conditioner, daily treatment and over night treatment) and my hair is wonderful now!</li>
            <li>My hair texture was improved overnight and my hair looks significantly healthier.  </li>
            <li>I love to get creative with my hair on the cheap.. as a natural wavy/fine/blonde-haired girl</li>
            <li>All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great</li>
            <li>The next morning I looked at my hair and was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something</li>
            <li>so when I got everything in the mail I was super excited to try this product hearing about it for a couple months.</li>
            <li>well I used every night and it didn&#x27;t really do much and on top of all that it cost a lot</li>
            <li>I love this and will probably buy more in the future!!</li>
            <li>As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super-light weight and my hair feels amazing the next day.</li>
            <li>My hair almost always appears greasy when using leave in products, it was not dirty looking when using this stuff either.</li>
            <li>its working miracles and binding all split ends, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look freshly cut or anything too drastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.</li>
            <li>Although it grows at a normal pace about 1/2 inch a month, you couldnt tell because it used to break so easily.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in conjuction with many other Nexxus products but the results have been proven to work on my hair to achieve really healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>I woke up and felt a difference right away</li>
            <li>, I use it both day and night on my hair and it makes my hair feel silky soft and makes my curly to wavy wild hair a lot more manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year and have tried to take great care to wear it up</li>
            <li>my ends were super soft and seriously couldn&#x27;t find that many split ends my hair used to be covered!!!</li>
            <li>After the first treatment I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>My hair is slowly starting to get healthy again</li>
            <li>so it gets pretty damaged,so my hair needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I tried the day cream product as a standalone first.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it is only temporary, but nothing a reapplication won&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li>I think it strengthens and smooths my hair even better than Its a Ten.</li>
            <li>After the first night&#x27;s use, I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li>At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.</li>
            <li>This will bind your ends, but you still need to moisturize your hair regularly and take care of it if you want it to be healthy.</li>
            <li>This cream works like a dream, on the first use you notice a difference.</li>
            <li>This was just the first use</li>
            <li>The shampoo , conditioner and daily treatment keep your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>The overnight works better than the regular Nexxus pro-mend treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I started using this product several months ago, and my hair stylist noticeds that I didn&#x27;t have as many split ends.</li>
            <li>I am going to order a bunch to make sure I don&#x27;t run out as they discontinued it in my local store.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it more at night, but occasionally in the morning on damp hair.</li>
            <li>but I cannot say my hair ever got any split ends after the first two uses I have not needed to used it again after those two times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite products and will be making another purchase sooner than later!</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li>I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product because this is the only product that really fights frizz and fly-aways .</li>
            <li>On my best day, I have Diana Ross hair, thick slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had better luck using L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 for her particular problem.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been pregnant though my hair looks like an old broom</li>
            <li>I used more than the product called for -- probably twice as much -- because my hair is long and was severely damaged.  </li>
            <li>(it has a strong smell), but I&#x27;ve found it works even if I&#x27;m short on time.</li>
            <li>The Pro mend products have been the Only thing to help my hair since I have been pregnant!  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>It was very creamy</li>
            <li>My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     </li>
            <li>Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li>I used it on the tip of my hair and on my eyebrow-length bangs (which were very damaged/split because I flat-iron every day).  </li>
            <li>and I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  </li>
            <li>curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.</li>
            <li>This product repairs your hair&#x27;s structure and will eventually make it stronger and very shiny.</li>
            <li>You can also leave it in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t need to be washed out, but if you add too much you will want to.</li>
            <li>- haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like sleeping with it in my hair</li>
            <li>two days I noticed split ends here and there but not as much as before.</li>
            <li>No miracle but its really helps.</li>
            <li>I have used this twice and can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I didn&#x27;t really like the leave in since it made my hair sticky and matted.</li>
            <li>No more split ends and my hair feels super healthy.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference it made right away, thank you...</li>
            <li>I still have a full bottle under my sink, because I went back to using my coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>, I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break.</li>
            <li>This morning, after I showered, I feel like i have a whole new head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I still had the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; that you get where you individual follicles still go different ways even though they are more mended together.      </li>
            <li>Your traditional hair moisturizer or oil will do the same or probably better.  </li>
            <li>I went back to Nexus and used this overnight treatment and within a week my split ends were vanishing by the 2nd week my hair looked healthy again.  </li>
            <li>Highly rec.</li>
            <li>I use it before bed, smoothing it on my hair before putting my hair into a high ponytail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this among many others supplies for my extremely dead hair.</li>
            <li>I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     </li>
            <li>Totally worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li>Probably assumes normal use which means NOT over-applied.</li>
            <li>I normally pick at my split ends</li>
            <li>Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is really susceptible to split ends even though I hardly do any heat styling at all (mostly air dry, rarely curl or blow dry).</li>
            <li>I started out using the promend night treatment alone on my hair before I was pregnant because it was dry, tangly, staticy, and color teated</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>When I bought this I hoped for the best but was prepared to be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that really works!</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft!</li>
            <li>When I awake in the morning and take the ponytail down, my hair looks fantastic</li>
            <li>I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     </li>
            <li>nothing thus far has met its match as far as results go!</li>
            <li>just so were clear</li>
            <li>also so I can&#x27;t really tell how each product works individually.</li>
            <li>The one thing I do find, is that I need to use additional products to help aid in the soft shiny area...</li>
            <li>The next time I styled it straight.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged after getting a perm last summer.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;ve used it as much and as often as I:</li>
            <li>&quot; I get compliments like, \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so pretty\\&quot; and \\&quot;How do you get your hair</li>
            <li>Wish I did not waste my money on it.</li>
            <li>I realize that nothing can completely cure split ends, but this glues them together basically.</li>
            <li>Really, the ONLY way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off.  </li>
            <li>I knew the rest of the line probably wouldn&#x27;t benefit my hair type since I use products for natural hair.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST it made my ends really dry like I wanted to wash it out</li>
            <li>I will keep using it since I love the quality, the scent and that it makes my hair incredibly soft and reduces the blow dry process by half of the time.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of coloring (especially to a very light blonde), blow drying, washing &amp; styling so my hair is usually prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li>I usually have a ton of split ends even though I am pretty good about getting cellophane and l&#x27;anza treatments, but after only one use the next day I found substantially less all over my head.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>it fixes ends and prevents future breaks, did not ruin my hair(mild curly) and its the only one in the market that works, im willing to pay $15 for it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who still loves this stuff so much, I am going to sell my other five bottles on Ebay, for six dollars per bottle, and New York tax and postage are not included.  </li>
            <li>and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.</li>
            <li>My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  </li>
            <li>SUPER DUPER highly recommend this product now, because it has ridiculously changed the way I view my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>I spent so much time and was hoping this would work...</li>
            <li>But this might have saved me from prematurely cutting a good length of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love having long hair, but the up keep is hard, all the constant trims.</li>
            <li>medium blonde (not color treated), greasy roots dry/frazzled ends, wavy to curly, fine follicles but thick</li>
            <li>This product, however, took my curly/wavy hair to BONE STRAIGHT hair due to overuse.  </li>
            <li>Not a single one.</li>
            <li>I have middle of my back length hair, Naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>- I use it about once a week - smells a little funny - almost unscented, but hoping that it will help my split ends on my hair.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;nt leave a residue or anything,it just makes your hair soft and with nearly no spilt ends.</li>
            <li>and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.</li>
            <li>This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that my color seems to wash out a little more if I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner every other day, so instead I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner once a week &amp; put the overnight cream in every other day.</li>
            <li>I will tell you readers about each product, good and bad.</li>

            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t wanna keep getting a trim 4 to 6 wks.  </li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> It goes great with the Nexxus pro mend straightening lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a while, the best one yet for split ends! :)</li>
            <li> :) AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> and I loved it; I noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Really good Treatment.</li>
            <li> They dnt do a good job.</li>
            <li> , I Loved that product alone, at that time I  was using Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I recommend getting all four products but surprisingly even the shampoo/conditioner alone will help</li>
            <li> Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I love it so perfect for my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> its okay, doesn&#x27;t work any better than cheaper conditioners, still think caratin is the best leave in out there</li>
            <li> The Pro-Mend line truly is one of the best hair care products out there right now.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing</li>
            <li> so idk ...... it does smell nice though, &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy ..</li>
            <li> I also bought the daily leave-in treatment, and it smells great and works as an excellent styling aid for the tips, too (easier to curl).  </li>
            <li> She said she liked it, that it worked</li>
            <li> The absolute best split end product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product because after just one use I could see a difference in my split ends.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped fine and was delivered in good time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the BEST Overnight hair cream treatment I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and tangles instantly after combing or washing it, damaging the ends, so I thought that I would use one of the Pro Mend products, and this was the best rated.  </li>
            <li> how many ways I tried application.</li>
            <li> This overnight treatment made my severely fried, over-processed highlights look/feel silky and swingy, like healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than the leave-in that you are supposed to use during the day, and</li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair feels and smells.  </li>
            <li> my ends seemed much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was interesting.</li>
            <li> Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.</li>
            <li> I love this line from Nexxus, it works so well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> So this is a win-win for me :)</li>
            <li> My curls are more defined and bouncier after just 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once since then,and i love it.</li>
            <li> Better than any leave in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> And of course if your ends are too damaged, you&#x27;d do better trimming them.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is more managable, shinier all the way to the tips, and feels sooooo soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> I love the leave in and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> product itself is ok</li>
            <li> Split ends seems to disappear (temporarily) and my hair is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Of course it works better the longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as many split-ends as I had.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> It does not make any &amp;#34;magic trick&amp;#34; but it does make most of my split ends invisible.</li>
            <li> work is fantastic I bought 2 more for my friend and I recoment my sister and she order 2 more .</li>
            <li> I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.</li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so true for my hair get more healthy...</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what happens if it improves even more.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and is highlighted every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.</li>
            <li> I think if you know how to section your hair when applying product you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products, they have seen great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> This product makes me hair so gorgeous and soft and you can see the difference when you use it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the whole Promend set (shampoo, Conditioner, daily treatment and over night treatment) and my hair is wonderful now!</li>
            <li> My hair texture was improved overnight and my hair looks significantly healthier.  </li>
            <li> I love to get creative with my hair on the cheap.. as a natural wavy/fine/blonde-haired girl</li>
            <li> All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great</li>
            <li> The next morning I looked at my hair and was thrilled!</li>
            <li> Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something</li>
            <li> so when I got everything in the mail I was super excited to try this product hearing about it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> well I used every night and it didn&#x27;t really do much and on top of all that it cost a lot</li>
            <li> I love this and will probably buy more in the future!!</li>
            <li> As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super-light weight and my hair feels amazing the next day.</li>
            <li> My hair almost always appears greasy when using leave in products, it was not dirty looking when using this stuff either.</li>
            <li> its working miracles and binding all split ends, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look freshly cut or anything too drastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.</li>
            <li> Although it grows at a normal pace about 1/2 inch a month, you couldnt tell because it used to break so easily.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in conjuction with many other Nexxus products but the results have been proven to work on my hair to achieve really healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> I woke up and felt a difference right away</li>
            <li> , I use it both day and night on my hair and it makes my hair feel silky soft and makes my curly to wavy wild hair a lot more manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year and have tried to take great care to wear it up</li>
            <li> my ends were super soft and seriously couldn&#x27;t find that many split ends my hair used to be covered!!!</li>
            <li> After the first treatment I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> My hair is slowly starting to get healthy again</li>
            <li> so it gets pretty damaged,so my hair needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tried the day cream product as a standalone first.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it is only temporary, but nothing a reapplication won&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> I think it strengthens and smooths my hair even better than Its a Ten.</li>
            <li> After the first night&#x27;s use, I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.</li>
            <li> This will bind your ends, but you still need to moisturize your hair regularly and take care of it if you want it to be healthy.</li>
            <li> This cream works like a dream, on the first use you notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This was just the first use</li>
            <li> The shampoo , conditioner and daily treatment keep your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> The overnight works better than the regular Nexxus pro-mend treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I started using this product several months ago, and my hair stylist noticeds that I didn&#x27;t have as many split ends.</li>
            <li> I am going to order a bunch to make sure I don&#x27;t run out as they discontinued it in my local store.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it more at night, but occasionally in the morning on damp hair.</li>
            <li> but I cannot say my hair ever got any split ends after the first two uses I have not needed to used it again after those two times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite products and will be making another purchase sooner than later!</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li> I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product because this is the only product that really fights frizz and fly-aways .</li>
            <li> On my best day, I have Diana Ross hair, thick slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had better luck using L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 for her particular problem.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been pregnant though my hair looks like an old broom</li>
            <li> I used more than the product called for -- probably twice as much -- because my hair is long and was severely damaged.  </li>
            <li> (it has a strong smell), but I&#x27;ve found it works even if I&#x27;m short on time.</li>
            <li> The Pro mend products have been the Only thing to help my hair since I have been pregnant!  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> It was very creamy</li>
            <li> My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     </li>
            <li> Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li> I used it on the tip of my hair and on my eyebrow-length bangs (which were very damaged/split because I flat-iron every day).  </li>
            <li> and I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  </li>
            <li> curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.</li>
            <li> This product repairs your hair&#x27;s structure and will eventually make it stronger and very shiny.</li>
            <li> You can also leave it in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t need to be washed out, but if you add too much you will want to.</li>
            <li> - haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like sleeping with it in my hair</li>
            <li> two days I noticed split ends here and there but not as much as before.</li>
            <li> No miracle but its really helps.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I didn&#x27;t really like the leave in since it made my hair sticky and matted.</li>
            <li> No more split ends and my hair feels super healthy.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference it made right away, thank you...</li>
            <li> I still have a full bottle under my sink, because I went back to using my coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> , I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break.</li>
            <li> This morning, after I showered, I feel like i have a whole new head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I still had the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; that you get where you individual follicles still go different ways even though they are more mended together.      </li>
            <li> Your traditional hair moisturizer or oil will do the same or probably better.  </li>
            <li> I went back to Nexus and used this overnight treatment and within a week my split ends were vanishing by the 2nd week my hair looked healthy again.  </li>
            <li> Highly rec.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed, smoothing it on my hair before putting my hair into a high ponytail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this among many others supplies for my extremely dead hair.</li>
            <li> I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     </li>
            <li> Totally worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> Probably assumes normal use which means NOT over-applied.</li>
            <li> I normally pick at my split ends</li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is really susceptible to split ends even though I hardly do any heat styling at all (mostly air dry, rarely curl or blow dry).</li>
            <li> I started out using the promend night treatment alone on my hair before I was pregnant because it was dry, tangly, staticy, and color teated</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> When I bought this I hoped for the best but was prepared to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works!</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft!</li>
            <li> When I awake in the morning and take the ponytail down, my hair looks fantastic</li>
            <li> I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     </li>
            <li> nothing thus far has met its match as far as results go!</li>
            <li> just so were clear</li>
            <li> also so I can&#x27;t really tell how each product works individually.</li>
            <li> The one thing I do find, is that I need to use additional products to help aid in the soft shiny area...</li>
            <li> The next time I styled it straight.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged after getting a perm last summer.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;ve used it as much and as often as I:</li>
            <li> &quot; I get compliments like, \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so pretty\\&quot; and \\&quot;How do you get your hair</li>
            <li> Wish I did not waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> I realize that nothing can completely cure split ends, but this glues them together basically.</li>
            <li> Really, the ONLY way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off.  </li>
            <li> I knew the rest of the line probably wouldn&#x27;t benefit my hair type since I use products for natural hair.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST it made my ends really dry like I wanted to wash it out</li>
            <li> I will keep using it since I love the quality, the scent and that it makes my hair incredibly soft and reduces the blow dry process by half of the time.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of coloring (especially to a very light blonde), blow drying, washing &amp; styling so my hair is usually prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a ton of split ends even though I am pretty good about getting cellophane and l&#x27;anza treatments, but after only one use the next day I found substantially less all over my head.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> it fixes ends and prevents future breaks, did not ruin my hair(mild curly) and its the only one in the market that works, im willing to pay $15 for it.</li>
            <li> Anyone who still loves this stuff so much, I am going to sell my other five bottles on Ebay, for six dollars per bottle, and New York tax and postage are not included.  </li>
            <li> and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.</li>
            <li> My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  </li>
            <li> SUPER DUPER highly recommend this product now, because it has ridiculously changed the way I view my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> I spent so much time and was hoping this would work...</li>
            <li> But this might have saved me from prematurely cutting a good length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love having long hair, but the up keep is hard, all the constant trims.</li>
            <li> medium blonde (not color treated), greasy roots dry/frazzled ends, wavy to curly, fine follicles but thick</li>
            <li> This product, however, took my curly/wavy hair to BONE STRAIGHT hair due to overuse.  </li>
            <li> Not a single one.</li>
            <li> I have middle of my back length hair, Naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> - I use it about once a week - smells a little funny - almost unscented, but hoping that it will help my split ends on my hair.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;nt leave a residue or anything,it just makes your hair soft and with nearly no spilt ends.</li>
            <li> and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.</li>
            <li> This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that my color seems to wash out a little more if I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner every other day, so instead I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner once a week &amp; put the overnight cream in every other day.</li>
            <li> I will tell you readers about each product, good and bad.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little below my shoulders and literally half of it was full of split ends and damage.</li>
            <li> so I also use other products to help with that, so like I said, it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it does make my hair soft, de-tangled and silky.  </li>
            <li> I used a different shampoo that left my hair dry and with lots of split ends.  </li>
            <li> I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use.</li>
            <li> I either flat iron or curl my hair every day,and my hair is thin,so it was damaged.</li>
            <li> I press my roots and flat iron my hair for work anyway</li>
            <li> my hair: Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen</li>
            <li> It seemed to help a little, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the promises made by Nexxus.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> It will smooth your hair and stop the frizz, but you won&#x27;t see any dramatic frizz fixing long</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with dry brittle hair that constantly fall out.</li>
            <li> have not yet tested how long this lasts.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, my ends feel soft and not at all crunchy.</li>
            <li> it feels awful on my hair and kind of smells funny</li>
            <li> I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner)</li>
            <li> I have changed to other shampoos and I end up going back to Nexus.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is also dry and brittle and prone to split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is prone to breakage because its so dry.  </li>
            <li> Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product on dry hair covering all my ends</li>
            <li> I use it every time I blow dry my hair and it has helped out a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and tends to have split ends because I straighten it every day</li>
            <li> One of the Nexxus products that my wife had ordered for dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.  </li>
            <li> Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me to my ends and leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m typically curling/straightening hair along with blow-drying on the daily.  </li>
            <li> Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> I used Nexxus Pro Mend just once -- just one evening, and washed it out the next morning, roughly seven hours later, and washed it out using my usual Therapee and Humectress.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, and I am amazed how well it worked on my split ends.</li>
            <li> Be careful though</li>
            <li> I shower or wet the ends so its damp.</li>
            <li> She said buying the Nexxus products she needed was an expensive experiment and just doesn&#x27;t think they were worth the money they cost.</li>
            <li> However, I live in a harsh winter weather state and by the time winter is over my hair has usually suffered.</li>
            <li> Although I had less split ends, my hair was not as soft as it usually is.</li>
            <li> After I washed and conditioned my hair normally, I twisted my damp hair while applying my normal deep conditioner and the nexus to my ends.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though.  </li>
            <li> After trying the shampoo&amp; conditioner you&#x27;ll want the other products.</li>
            <li> In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a struggling college student with a taste for the finer things, and usually that means that I have to skimp on things such as hair cuts</li>
            <li> I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoos, so I dont have anything by Nexxus to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a small amount and put it on my ends and left it in overnight.</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times, but wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;Wowed\\&quot; like some of the other comments.</li>
            <li> I am so ashamed in the name of all other companies trying to copy this.</li>
            <li> Other companies say the have mending treatment to bind the ends together</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, but due to the use of chemical products such as perms and coloring my hair was shedding severely.</li>
            <li> it instantly bonds the hair together so that you don&#x27;t have hardly any frizz at all.</li>
            <li> I have died my hair blonde a few times over the past nine months and my hair became prettt damaged at the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it TOTALLY works, I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> I am Black and Hispanic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;After a day and a half (</li>
            <li> My thick, long hair can absorb a dollop that is the equivalent in size to three stacked quarters, apply to ends only&lt;</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time knowing which areas are coated and which are not, but a little does go a long way</li>
            <li> It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning</li>
            <li> Before resorting to cutting too much off, I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> your hair feels dried out.</li>
            <li> I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in -</li>
            <li> you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.  </li>
            <li> This product seems rather gimmicky, but I a product junkie</li>
            <li> I curl my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it.</li>
            <li> was late as usual, let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> My other issue with this product is it is hard to tell how well it has coated the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, if your hair is stiff in the morning this means you probably over applied.     </li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it -</li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED WORTH</li>
            <li> Recently I freaked out because my split ends were so bad, and instead of opting for a shorter cut, I decided to see what my local drug store had to offer for a girl like me in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply it to damp hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I have no further use for this stuff, and Biotin and Vitamin Supplements for Hair are expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> Thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work like everything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-YOU SHOULD NOT CAUSE YOUR HAIR TO BE STIFF WITH THIS!</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair first to the worst head of knots in the morning...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find though...</li>
            <li> you have to at least try</li>
            <li> I was considering cutting it once again but because of the Nexxus products my hair was revived INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> my hair was icky and sticky...</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> NO MORE SPLIT ENDS!  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I did seriously a miracle occured</li>
            <li> It did not really do much good.</li>
            <li> The past few months I have been trying everything and was to afraid to chop all my hair off</li>
            <li> But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered</li>
            <li> I have had really bad split ends ever since I started straightening and blow drying my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get at the base, or scalp.</li>
            <li> but thinks the products are too expensive for what they are.  </li>
            <li> I randomly bought this on clearance as well as the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks.</li>
            <li> so disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I was unable to acheive any length because of my ends!</li>
            <li> When I was about to purchase this I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy this along with the rest of the nexxus promend system and you will not be disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this among many others supplies for my extremely dead hair. I have the leave in treatment, shampoo and conditioner also. My hair is slowly starting to get healthy again but I use different brands of shampoos and conditioners also so I can&#x27;t really tell how each product works individually.</li>
            <li> work is fantastic I bought 2 more for my friend and I recoment my sister and she order 2 more .</li>
            <li> I use this product every time after I am done wash/condition my hair.  It definitely binds the split ends together.  I forgot that I had it, and when I was straightening my hair one day, I realized how split the ends were.  I have colored-curly hair.  The next time, and every time after, I wash/condition my hair, I use this product.  It really works.  The one thing I do find, is that I need to use additional products to help aid in the soft shiny area...</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, and I am amazed how well it worked on my split ends. I usually have a ton of split ends even though I am pretty good about getting cellophane and l&#x27;anza treatments, but after only one use the next day I found substantially less all over my head. My hair almost always appears greasy when using leave in products, it was not dirty looking when using this stuff either. Although I had less split ends, my hair was not as soft as it usually is. Additionally, I still had the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; that you get where you individual follicles still go different ways even though they are more mended together.      My other issue with this product is it is hard to tell how well it has coated the hair. I usually apply it to damp hair and I have a hard time knowing which areas are coated and which are not, but a little does go a long way so I would suggest applying the product in front of a mirror. Also, if your hair is stiff in the morning this means you probably over applied.     The directions say to wash out in the morning, but I never do and my hair is not greasy through the work day.    hair type: medium blonde (not color treated), greasy roots dry/frazzled ends, wavy to curly, fine follicles but thick</li>
            <li> I have been using beauty and hair care products for 40 years and I have NEVER been astounded with a product as I am with this one! It is truly awesome! I have very long hair that is also dry and brittle and prone to split ends. I&#x27;m attending a wedding in a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t want to cut it beforehand. I tried this product ONCE and I am in awe of how well it works!!!  Almost NO split ends to be seen! ONE USE! I will use this product regularly for the rest of my life. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Finally! A product that actually does what it promises to do!&lt;br /&gt;Now,if someone could actually do the same for mascara and undereye concealor,I&#x27;b be in Heaven! Thank you,Nexxus!!!</li>
            <li> After trying the shampoo&amp; conditioner you&#x27;ll want the other products.</li>
            <li> Buy this along with the rest of the nexxus promend system and you will not be disappointed.  After the first treatment I noticed a difference right away.  NO MORE SPLIT ENDS!  My hair also felt smoother and silkier.  Highly rec.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product because this is the only product that really fights frizz and fly-aways . When you  put it on your hair it instantly bonds the hair together so that you don&#x27;t have hardly any frizz at all. My hair is fine and is highlighted every 6 weeks so it gets pretty damaged,so my hair needs all the help it can get. This is the only product that works for me.</li>
            <li> It did not really do much good. I felt it made my hair feel sticky no matter how many ways I tried application. Could not stand how that felt...</li>
            <li> wish I could return this...waste of money.</li>
            <li> This overnight treatment made my severely fried, over-processed highlights look/feel silky and swingy, like healthy hair. I use it before bed, smoothing it on my hair before putting my hair into a high ponytail. When I awake in the morning and take the ponytail down, my hair looks fantastic so I don&#x27;t wash out the treatment, in fact, i use it throughout the day as a smoothing agent. This stuff is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  I have to admit, I use it both day and night on my hair and it makes my hair feel silky soft and makes my curly to wavy wild hair a lot more manageable and smooth.  I like this better than the leave-in that you are supposed to use during the day, and wish this one came in a larger size.  A little goes a long way though.  I use this and the pro-mend conditioner and I love the way my hair feels and smells.  I can only hope my split ends are being mended but even if they aren&#x27;t, I still like this product.  My hair is curlier since using this product so I do believe that it does help the ends of my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure its working miracles and binding all split ends, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look freshly cut or anything too drastic.  I still notice fly-aways and frizz from time to time so I also use other products to help with that, so like I said, it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it does make my hair soft, de-tangled and silky.  I really recommend this product! It will just make your hair feel really good!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling. I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks. I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair. I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment. It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning my ends seemed much more hydrated. I then washed it out with the shampoo. I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized. I hate when you wash out shampoo and your hair feels dried out. The conditioner was interesting. It was very creamy and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film. I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in - you should definitely leave it on for the recommended time. My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme. It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair. My hair felt fully saturated with moisture and I was worried that it would be very weighed down. The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair. The next time I styled it straight. I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it - I&#x27;m guess that is how it works. This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends??? I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use. I don&#x27;t even know how that is possible, but they are gone. I still have some - but I have to search for them instead of seeing tons of them every time I look. So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of coloring (especially to a very light blonde), blow drying, washing &amp; styling so my hair is usually prone to breakage.  I love this line from Nexxus, it works so well for my hair.  The only issue is that my color seems to wash out a little more if I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner every other day, so instead I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner once a week &amp; put the overnight cream in every other day. So this is a win-win for me :)</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair a lot since my hair is curly and I have split ends this didn&#x27;t really work that well I used every night and it didn&#x27;t really do much and on top of all that it cost a lot so I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus products since I was a child, and have only  used Therapee Shampoo and Humectress Conditioner.  My hair is very fine, and tangles instantly after combing or washing it, damaging the ends, so I thought that I would use one of the Pro Mend products, and this was the best rated.  I used Nexxus Pro Mend just once -- just one evening, and washed it out the next morning, roughly seven hours later, and washed it out using my usual Therapee and Humectress.  I had to go to a funeral that morning, was late as usual, let my hair air dry (it was August), and hurried to the church while sweating all the way.  Two days later, the skin on my forehead where I had sweated (no reason to lie and say perspired) looked as though I had been sunburned, my hair had disappeared up to three inches back from where it used to be, my scalp had peeled, and both my scalp and forehead felt as though I had had a massive sunburn.  It is nine months later, and my hair is beginning to come back in one place, there is hair coming back all over my entire scalp, where the skin had been burned away. One can now see three inches of my scalp under my hair, where my scalp could never be seen before, and my scalp still stings.  Anyone who still loves this stuff so much, I am going to sell my other five bottles on Ebay, for six dollars per bottle, and New York tax and postage are not included.  I have no further use for this stuff, and Biotin and Vitamin Supplements for Hair are expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged after getting a perm last summer. I started using the leave-in treatment along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner around Thanksgiving and my hair now looks and feels healthier! My curls are more defined and bouncier after just 2-3 uses. The Pro-Mend line truly is one of the best hair care products out there right now. Totally worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy. I have had some breakage in the back of my head.  I have been using satin pillowcases to reduce breakage and a satin nightcap on my restless nights to stop snarls.  But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered and I&#x27;m going a  lot longer in between haircuts.  I tried the day cream product as a standalone first.  It will smooth your hair and stop the frizz, but you won&#x27;t see any dramatic frizz fixing long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried the overnight treatment in combination with the leave in treatment.  My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  I tried the leave in conditioner for 1 week before adding the overnight.  I tried the overnight cream with the day cream for 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I decided to splurge and try the Nexxus ProMend shampoo and conditioner.  2 days.  In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.  I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.  Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  The bottle says in 3 days use you will see results.  So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.  The conditioner you leave on for 3 minutes, comb through, I recently switched to the Tool Structure Shower Detangling Comb (http://www.amazon.com/Tool-Structure-Shower-Detangler-Comb/dp/B003JMWOR8) .  Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  The leave in conditioner you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.  I used more than a quarter sized amount to nourish all my ends and the troubled back spot.  For the nigt time treatment you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.  I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  In the morning, wash it out. I followed with the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner and started all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  I also like John Freida&#x27;s Frizz repair shampoo and conditioner.you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.

            <li> I never saw anything happen with my hair .. so idk ...... it does smell nice though, &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy ..</li>
            <li> I either flat iron or curl my hair every day,and my hair is thin,so it was damaged.After one use it worked great.I&#x27;ve used it once since then,and i love it.It does&#x27;nt leave a residue or anything,it just makes your hair soft and with nearly no spilt ends. Better than any leave in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in moisturizing or sealing my ends.  Your traditional hair moisturizer or oil will do the same or probably better.  I still have a full bottle under my sink, because I went back to using my coconut oil.  And of course if your ends are too damaged, you&#x27;d do better trimming them.  This product will nor fix the problem.</li>
            <li> From years of blow-drying, flat-ironing, and cutting my hair too infrequently, I have terrible split ends.  Like, embarassing split ends.  I used this product and it TOTALLY works, I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.  My hair texture was improved overnight and my hair looks significantly healthier.  I used more than the product called for -- probably twice as much -- because my hair is long and was severely damaged.  I also used it two nights in a row.  This morning, after I showered, I feel like i have a whole new head of hair.  I am SO happy about it, that I had to tell the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tested how long this lasts.  I am sure it is only temporary, but nothing a reapplication won&#x27;t fix.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for silky, tangle-free hair. I&#x27;ve used Its a Ten leave-in conditioner for years until I found some of this stuff discounted at the salon. Haven&#x27;t stopped buying it since! I think it strengthens and smooths my hair even better than Its a Ten.</li>
            <li> This product ACTUALLY WORKS!  I used it on the tip of my hair and on my eyebrow-length bangs (which were very damaged/split because I flat-iron every day).  After the first night&#x27;s use, I could see a difference.  WOW.  I also bought the daily leave-in treatment, and it smells great and works as an excellent styling aid for the tips, too (easier to curl).  WOW!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using it for years and works great for my hair</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a struggling college student with a taste for the finer things, and usually that means that I have to skimp on things such as hair cuts so I can have it colored properly, and as a style-a-holic (and beauty counter employee) I love to get creative with my hair on the cheap.. as a natural wavy/fine/blonde-haired girl, I&#x27;m typically curling/straightening hair along with blow-drying on the daily.  Recently I freaked out because my split ends were so bad, and instead of opting for a shorter cut, I decided to see what my local drug store had to offer for a girl like me in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The treatment was 9.99 at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;-Worked overnight like a miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;-Use once, or twice a week&lt;br /&gt;-this works through washes/heat styling as well, I just notice that after 2-4 days the ends start re-appearing&lt;br /&gt;-YOU SHOULD NOT CAUSE YOUR HAIR TO BE STIFF WITH THIS! Its meant to BIND not drench.  My thick, long hair can absorb a dollop that is the equivalent in size to three stacked quarters, apply to ends only&lt;br /&gt;-washing it out in the morning is NOT necessary, and is also stated on the box that it is not necessary. Probably assumes normal use which means NOT over-applied. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SUPER DUPER highly recommend this product now, because it has ridiculously changed the way I view my hair.  My hair is more managable, shinier all the way to the tips, and feels sooooo soft.&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this, you are probably considering purchasing this or a similar product.  I wish I could do you the favor of buying it because it is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Background:  I have middle of my back length hair, Naturally curly/wavy hair (Think Halle Berry in \\&quot;Their eyes were watching God\\&quot;) I am Black and Hispanic.  My hair is prone to breakage because its so dry.  Although it grows at a normal pace about 1/2 inch a month, you couldnt tell because it used to break so easily.  I use this product in conjuction with many other Nexxus products but the results have been proven to work on my hair to achieve really healthy hair. I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below. I will tell you readers about each product, good and bad. Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Therappe Shampoo - It smells great and I really have no complaints. I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoos, so I dont have anything by Nexxus to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome! I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner) But none compare to the moisturizing power this stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me - At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers. It truly, truly does repair split ends, but only temporarily.  This should not be used as a cure-all.  This will bind your ends, but you still need to moisturize your hair regularly and take care of it if you want it to be healthy. This product, however, took my curly/wavy hair to BONE STRAIGHT hair due to overuse.  Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair. Obviously, it changes the structure of your hair when it binds the split ends, so be warned if you have curly hair this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  Especially if you&#x27;ve used it as much and as often as I: once a week for about 2 years. Since it works so well for me, I continue to use it only on my ends while I allow my curls to growback. For my African American readers: It looks like a perm is growing out of my head; curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends. I press my roots and flat iron my hair for work anyway so I dont look too funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing out the Pro-Mend, I use Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor - Reconstructors add protein to your hair making it stronger.  Be careful though, I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break. This product repairs your hair&#x27;s structure and will eventually make it stronger and very shiny. All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash my hair with Nexxus Therappe Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me to my ends and leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash out the Promend and apply Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor on my entire head (except my edges). Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair. Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something domestic)&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;6. Heat Style my hair: Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;After a day and a half (EVERY WEEKEND!!!) of repeating this process, my hair is probably the shiniest and bounciest hair you will ever see. It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all. As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair. Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow, I wish my hair could be like that\\&quot; I get compliments like, \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so pretty\\&quot; and \\&quot;How do you get your hair so soft?\\&quot; Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family. Although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products, they have seen great results.</li>
            <li> This is for the ends of your hair only. Be careful not to get at the base, or scalp. You can also leave it in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t need to be washed out, but if you add too much you will want to.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I hoped for the best but was prepared to be disappointed. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year and have tried to take great care to wear it up so the ends stay protected. However, I live in a harsh winter weather state and by the time winter is over my hair has usually suffered. Before resorting to cutting too much off, I ordered this product. My review is only based off of two nights of use. But so far, I&#x27;m really happy. I took a small amount and put it on my ends and left it in overnight. The next morning I looked at my hair and was thrilled! I immediately noticed a difference. After combing and styling, it was the best it had looked in months.     Now, I don&#x27;t believe that anything can permanently mend split ends. And I will see how this works over time. But this might have saved me from prematurely cutting a good length of my hair. For now, I&#x27;ve added it to my daily hair routine. Next I&#x27;ll be trying the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in. I&#x27;m really glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works! It&#x27;s so hard to find though...nothing thus far has met its match as far as results go!</li>
            <li> This product seems rather gimmicky, but I a product junkie so I had to give it a try. I used it a couple of times, but wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;Wowed\\&quot; like some of the other comments. This is a short-term fix if you truly don&#x27;t want to trim your ends.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference it made right away, thank you...</li>
            <li> I love the leave in and the conditioner. But this over night product does  nothing for my think hair. Wish I did not waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a while, the best one yet for split ends! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff! I&#x27;m not even kidding. On my best day, I have Diana Ross hair, thick slightly coarse hair. I love having long hair, but the up keep is hard, all the constant trims. This cream works like a dream, on the first use you notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fine and was delivered in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok - haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet - I use it about once a week - smells a little funny - almost unscented, but hoping that it will help my split ends on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I had used it just one time and I loved it; I noticed a difference in my hair.  I go to the salon almost twice a week and I always blow-dry my hair; and this helped me to revive my split ends.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference when I use this product. Split ends seems to disappear (temporarily) and my hair is much more manageable. I don&#x27;t really like sleeping with it in my hair (it has a strong smell), but I&#x27;ve found it works even if I&#x27;m short on time. I&#x27;ve applied it and then shampooed an hour or so later, used it over night, and had it in my hair all day with a bun. Of course it works better the longer you leave it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad split ends ever since I started straightening and blow drying my hair everyday. My hair is a little below my shoulders and literally half of it was full of split ends and damage. The past few months I have been trying everything and was to afraid to chop all my hair off I&#x27;m also trying to grow it out lol. I ordered the conditioner and leave in treatment as well, so when I got everything in the mail I was super excited to try this product hearing about it for a couple months. Thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work like everything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I used this product on dry hair covering all my ends I have really thick hair so I had to use alot. AT FIRST it made my ends really dry like I wanted to wash it out just so were clear I&#x27;m talking about the overnight one. I resisted my urge and left it in all night thank god I did seriously a miracle occured lol. I woke up and felt a difference right away my ends were super soft and seriously couldn&#x27;t find that many split ends my hair used to be covered!!! This was just the first use I&#x27;m excited to see what happens if it improves even more. I realize that nothing can completely cure split ends, but this glues them together basically. It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t wanna keep getting a trim 4 to 6 wks.  :) AMAZING!!!! YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using product for about 2 weeks.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle and I didn&#x27;t get one.  It seemed to help a little, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the promises made by Nexxus.  Really, the ONLY way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off.  I will keep using, but I doubt that I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love it so perfect for my hair so smooth! It&#x27;s so true for my hair get more healthy...I love it!</li>
            <li> I have died my hair blonde a few times over the past nine months and my hair became prettt damaged at the ends. I stopped straightening my hair and that just helps so it doesn&#x27;t get worse.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product. I shower or wet the ends so its damp. Then I comb my hair and put in the nexus overnight stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY RESULT&lt;br /&gt;Within two days I noticed split ends here and there but not as much as before. I normally pick at my split ends but I couldn&#x27;t find any to pick off.  Good product! I recommend. No miracle but its really helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexus Products for 5 years now. I have changed to other shampoos and I end up going back to Nexus.  I used a different shampoo that left my hair dry and with lots of split ends.  I went back to Nexus and used this overnight treatment and within a week my split ends were vanishing by the 2nd week my hair looked healthy again.  I highly recommend this product.  I also suggest that you use the daily treatment after you have repaired your hair.  The shampoo , conditioner and daily treatment keep your hair looking healthy. I curl my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it.</li>
            <li> The overnight works better than the regular Nexxus pro-mend treatment I&#x27;ve used. I like the smell of it, it&#x27;s super-light weight and my hair feels amazing the next day. It works like a charm for my Asian hair. No more split ends and my hair feels super healthy.</li>
            <li> its okay, doesn&#x27;t work any better than cheaper conditioners, still think caratin is the best leave in out there lol...</li>
            <li> I mean...why do I need this if I have the leave in cream? I don&#x27;t wash my hair enough to merit me using this ???</li>
            <li> Really good Treatment. I use it every time I blow dry my hair and it has helped out a lot. I don&#x27;t have as many split-ends as I had.</li>
            <li> Having curley hair you always have split ends! I noticed a differance the next morning. Thank you. Wonderful you have to at least try</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and tends to have split ends because I straighten it every day and I also color it. I started using this product several months ago, and my hair stylist noticeds that I didn&#x27;t have as many split ends. She told me to keep using the pro-mend line by Nexxus.</li>
            <li> One of the Nexxus products that my wife had ordered for dry, damaged hair.  She said she liked it, that it worked okay but thinks the products are too expensive for what they are.  She&#x27;s had better luck using L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 for her particular problem.  She said buying the Nexxus products she needed was an expensive experiment and just doesn&#x27;t think they were worth the money they cost.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with dry brittle hair that constantly fall out. My hair is thick, but due to the use of chemical products such as perms and coloring my hair was shedding severely. I used this product once and immediately noticed a difference in the feel and texture of my hair. I was considering cutting it once again but because of the Nexxus products my hair was revived INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> my hair was icky and sticky...I tried it on dry hair first to the worst head of knots in the morning...then next night tried it with damp hair. next morning I washed it and I swear my hair looks worst...so disappointing. I spent so much time and was hoping this would work...nope...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous. It goes great with the Nexxus pro mend straightening lotion. I love this and will probably buy more in the future!!</li>
            <li> This product makes me hair so gorgeous and soft and you can see the difference when you use it. I had no problems with the seller or shipping and the price was unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 years now. I love it! I am so ashamed in the name of all other companies trying to copy this. They dnt do a good job. Other companies say the have mending treatment to bind the ends together but its a lie, they never work. ( I know I tried) I moved and cannot find Nexxus anywhere so I decided, hey 3 years have passed maybe they stole the formula and all these products work just as well. NO.NO they didnt. Not a single one. I couldnt help it anymore and bought it online. Thank god! This is amazing it fixes ends and prevents future breaks, did not ruin my hair(mild curly) and its the only one in the market that works, im willing to pay $15 for it. It is awesome!</li>
            <li> The Pro mend products have been the Only thing to help my hair since I have been pregnant!  I started out using the promend night treatment alone on my hair before I was pregnant because it was dry, tangly, staticy, and color teated, I Loved that product alone, at that time I  was using Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  Since I have been pregnant though my hair looks like an old broom and it didn&#x27;t seem like there was anything I could do!  I use to be a hairstylist so believe me when I say I tried EVERYTHING! I decided to try the whole Promend set (shampoo, Conditioner, daily treatment and over night treatment) and my hair is wonderful now! I recommend getting all four products but surprisingly even the shampoo/conditioner alone will help</li>
            <li> The absolute best split end product I have ever used.  I am going to order a bunch to make sure I don&#x27;t run out as they discontinued it in my local store.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great!! I recommend everyone to try this product!! Love it</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> I liked this product because after just one use I could see a difference in my split ends.  Others noticed as well and asked if I had changed something about my hair.  I tend to use it more at night, but occasionally in the morning on damp hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and can really feel a difference. I have fine hair that is really susceptible to split ends even though I hardly do any heat styling at all (mostly air dry, rarely curl or blow dry). I applied at night before going to bed... it feels awful on my hair and kind of smells funny (perfume-y) but in the morning I could feel it rinse out of my hair when I showered. When my hair dried, my ends feel soft and not at all crunchy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When I was about to purchase this I was very skeptical. I decided to take a chance and I never regretted it. I am on a relaxed hair journey and I started off with a lot of split ends I didn&#x27;t however want to trim them until my next relaxer. This product made it look as if I had no split ends at all. I have heard that it is temporary but I cannot say my hair ever got any split ends after the first two uses I have not needed to used it again after those two times. How I used it was I replaced the moisturized and seal step after washing my hair with this I applied it as if I was moisturizing and sealing then wrapped my hair by morning I was amazed at my hair. Oh and it smells like yogurt. I don&#x27;t eat yogurt but the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% African American with natural hair. I&#x27;ve been trimming my hair myself but I was unable to acheive any length because of my ends! As soon as I cut them I would have split ends a week or two later! I randomly bought this on clearance as well as the leave in conditioner. I knew the rest of the line probably wouldn&#x27;t benefit my hair type since I use products for natural hair. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t really like the leave in since it made my hair sticky and matted. The overnight cream was heaven sent though. After I washed and conditioned my hair normally, I twisted my damp hair while applying my normal deep conditioner and the nexus to my ends. Co washed it out in the morning and viola! My ends were perfect! I knew I wasnt just seeing things either because my hair was easier to detangle and styling my hair is faster than ever. And I applied this stuff over a week ago! I think if you know how to section your hair when applying product you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Loved It! Loved it! Love it! It&#x27;s the BEST Overnight hair cream treatment I&#x27;ve ever used so far. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products and will be making another purchase sooner than later!</li>
            <li> Great product. It does not make any &amp;#34;magic trick&amp;#34; but it does make most of my split ends invisible. I will keep using it since I love the quality, the scent and that it makes my hair incredibly soft and reduces the blow dry process by half of the time.</li>
