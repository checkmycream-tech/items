            <li>/&gt;My first impression of Delicious Chocolat is of dutch-processed cocoa powder, like Droste.</li>
            <li>MORE CHOCOLATE NEEDED!</li>
            <li>Wow....this perfume smells so amazing.</li>
            <li>get Delicious Chocolate it will pull him right in. :-)</li>
            <li>I might buy a couple more bottle in case it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li>After the perfume dries it smells more like pipe tobacco, musk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I absolutely LOVE \\&quot;Delicious\\&quot; Cotton Candy.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it smelled more like cologne than perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different from Delicious Cotton Candy,but I like it just as much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more to say...</li>
            <li>Great for nurses or others who dont want to offend others with a loud fragrance.</li>
            <li>first when spraying  Delicious it smell very different, and as it settles in.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap, dime store perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Light chocolate fragrance.</li>

            <li>I love the experience of this scent, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to recommend Delicious Chocolat as a perfume given its strength &amp; longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>guess you really can&#x27;t by scent online without having actually smelled it in person first.</li>
            <li>I love this dark, dry, woody oriental fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a little stronger smelling, you get the scent of chocolate while keeping in the sweet catagory.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a realistic, sensual, chocolate perfume for a long time, and I thought I had finally found it...</li>

            <li> and the fragrance didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> But the other reviewers are correct when they claim it doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> but sadly it lasts a mere 10 minutes before turning to a soft, warm vanilla musk for the next 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry chocolate.</li>
            <li> EDT actually lingers for the usual four hours that toilet waters usually last, plus  somewhat longer.</li>
            <li> Now the chocolate is a bit wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth the $25 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This cologne layers well with other scents but has little staying power on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s yummy paired with Chanel&#x27;s &amp;#34;Mademoiselle Cocoa&amp;#34; and Lancome&#x27;s &amp;#34;Tr&amp;eacute;sor.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the idea of smelling like chocolate is so decadent...</li>
            <li> It smelled thick and dry.</li>
            <li> It has a very heavy musky scent and wears off in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> As soon as I sprayed this on my wrist, I started getting a headache, and the smell was only faintly chocolate.</li>
            <li> How disappointing, I found it to be too heavy and dense.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> she stinks too bad for this to work</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed that this perfume didn&#x27;t smell like I was expecting</li>
            <li> Very nasty.</li>

            <li> Wow....this perfume smells so amazing. It smells like chocolate but with a hit of spice. I might buy a couple more bottle in case it&#x27;s discontinued. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> I love the experience of this scent, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to recommend Delicious Chocolat as a perfume given its strength &amp; longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of Delicious Chocolat is of dutch-processed cocoa powder, like Droste. It&#x27;s a dry chocolate. Then Delicious Chocolat gets boozy, reminding me of chocolate liqueur (creme de cacao). Now the chocolate is a bit wet. Lastly the vanilla presents itself. Wow, I want to pour myself a Kahlua right about now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly the quality I was looking for in Delicious Chocolat, but sadly it lasts a mere 10 minutes before turning to a soft, warm vanilla musk for the next 1-2 hours. Vaseline has helped extend the life to 3-4 hours. However, Vaseline softens the scent, and it changes the quality &amp; clarity of the progression on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 5 out of 5 for the experience&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 2 out of 5 as a perfume</li>
            <li> This perfume is definitely not for children. It has a very heavy musky scent and wears off in just a few hours. Unless you plan to drench yourself you will find that you smell like fabric softner after only 2 hours.  Also, I can&#x27;t say that it smells like chocolate!  I chose it because I thought it would give me a real chocolate smell, but it only smells like this for a few minutes. After the perfume dries it smells more like pipe tobacco, musk and vanilla. It&#x27;s not really worth the $25 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I absolutely LOVE \\&quot;Delicious\\&quot; Cotton Candy. I have been looking for a realistic, sensual, chocolate perfume for a long time, and I thought I had finally found it... I was wrong. As soon as I sprayed this on my wrist, I started getting a headache, and the smell was only faintly chocolate. In my opinion, it smelled more like cologne than perfume. I did not like this AT ALL. And because I find the smell so horrendous, I can&#x27;t give it away. I don&#x27;t want anyone else to suffer.</li>
            <li> Yuck, sort of haz a chocolate under note but is too covered by what smells like grandmother thrift store perfume. Very nasty. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> This cologne layers well with other scents but has little staying power on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s yummy paired with Chanel&#x27;s &amp;#34;Mademoiselle Cocoa&amp;#34; and Lancome&#x27;s &amp;#34;Tr&amp;eacute;sor.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the idea of smelling like chocolate is so decadent...</li>
            <li> MORE CHOCOLATE NEEDED!</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a sent. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.The price was to much to pay for such a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed that this perfume didn&#x27;t smell like I was expecting and the fragrance didn&#x27;t last long at all. I will stick to my cotton and delicious.</li>
            <li> she stinks too bad for this to work</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift last year and the lady was AMAZED!, her husband told her it was the best perfume she ever wore.</li>
            <li> Delicious  Chocolate by Gale Hayman  smell so good. its a daytime perfume for any age ( such 21- 40)at first when spraying  Delicious it smell very different, and as it settles in. oh my goodness it smells so so good. i would tell any woman who loves a different sent this is the one. oh and if you want to snag that guy. get Delicious Chocolate it will pull him right in. :-)</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more to say...All the guys in my house (myself and two teens) likes the smell of the gal (my wife) who wears this.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviewers that claim how awesome this perfume is I bought this to treat myself. How disappointing, I found it to be too heavy and dense. It doesn&#x27;t smell really chocolately to me. It smelled thick and dry. One test squirt on my arm &amp; I reeked all day. It smells like cheap, dime store perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I did give this to my 16 year old daughter and she loved it, but I didn&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you really can&#x27;t by scent online without having actually smelled it in person first.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.  Well packaged.  Neat.  Trustworthy. Took about 2 weeks I think.</li>
            <li> This smells really good. Would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it had any staying power.</li>
            <li> I find this fragrance is just Fun to have on, it&#x27;s a change from cotton candy, It&#x27;s a little stronger smelling, you get the scent of chocolate while keeping in the sweet catagory.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. Light chocolate fragrance. But the other reviewers are correct when they claim it doesnt last long. Great for nurses or others who dont want to offend others with a loud fragrance. I will buy again</li>
