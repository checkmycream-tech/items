            <li> In my personal opinion is a fragrance to go to sleep, smells of talc, which is not bad but not good for other occasions.</li>
            <li> Had to get it again after a long while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> compartment looks broken as well!</li>
            <li> It is making a weird noise.</li>
            <li> Frankly, Ill probably order from somewhere else and chuck this piece of crap they sent me.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I love this fragrance...but...Amazon sold me a box that was so old that the font is from another generation of packaging.  Hell, I can&#x27;t even find that packaging on a Google image search without significant effort.  How do I know that it is old stock?  The samples I had from Sephora from a couple weeks ago smell different than what comes out of the bottle Amazon sold me.  Frankly, Ill probably order from somewhere else and chuck this piece of crap they sent me.</li>

            <li> Another good fragrance from Carolina Herrera, but I prefer 212, I probably won&#x27;t buy another 212 Sexy Men when I run out, but I will buy 212.... simply 212 ( the gray bottle )</li>

            <li> I like a lot this fragance, but my girlfriend love it and that&#x27;s why I bought it again... the problem about this cologne is that it doesn&#x27;t last too much. I have one from Calvin Klein that lasts at least 3 times more than 212 sexy, though 212 smells terrific!&lt;br /&gt;The compartment looks broken as well! It is making a weird noise. I&#x27;ve had three of this product before and I&#x27;ve never heard similar sound!</li>
