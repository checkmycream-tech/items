            <li>so LOVELY color!!  </li>
            <li>I love Gelish Products,  because the appearance of my nails is always perfect, without the damage that acrylic nails can cause.</li>
            <li>Now I say this one is just ok, the color is not as even as CND, does not look as perfect as CND ones.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so i could see the color, amazing, beautiful, but</li>
            <li>that will not allow bright colors</li>
            <li>if your looking for a good neutral color that isn&#x27;t too tan</li>
            <li>It takes 3 Coates to get a good color.  </li>
            <li>The gelish polish is good  </li>
            <li>All Gelish polish is good quality.</li>
            <li>I think this color would look good by itself, too.</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>Would look good on anyone.</li>
            <li>One coat would look good</li>
            <li>Very happy with this polish, the color is very pretty with good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this color and can&#x27;t wait to be able to buy more nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>I love to have great looking nail</li>
            <li>That being said, I used a lighter color over the top and it turned out great.  </li>
            <li>Cute color, great price.</li>
            <li>it gives a nice shear coat which works good for a job you have</li>
            <li>love the gelish colection!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>If anyone has any suggestions I would love some feedback!  </li>
            <li>Lovely color!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Still love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li>Will be using more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great color and easy off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving Gelish and the staying power this polish has.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice color, but would have liked just a hit of shimmer to the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a really nice color.</li>
            <li>I can do my own nail</li>
            <li>I have my own system.  </li>
            <li>Package Came fast, color is perfect!</li>
            <li>I even tried putting my polish in a warm bowl of water, which helped the consistency to be thiner and went on better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cute and springy :)</li>
            <li>Looks great true color</li>
            <li>It came quickly and the price was great.</li>
            <li>I did have to improve my skills on applying polish perfectly because mistakes and imperfections show up very clearly.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE gel polish!</li>
            <li>Used with Gellish Basix and its still holding strong!</li>
            <li>My cheap 36 watt UV lamp works perfectly to cure it, and it&#x27;s just as good as the last gel manicure I paid for at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>Very light color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very light pastel color.</li>
            <li>You can easily gel your own nails instead of going to a salon to have them done.</li>
            <li>I love gelish and exhale</li>
            <li>Much better faster smoother with richer more opaque coverage than OPI.</li>
            <li>I love the gel polishes.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on this color, both from my instructors and from men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>I gave a 3 star mostly because I Love the color</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I make sure to take my bottle with me when I get a mani just in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pro yet, but with time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the formula, color and the size.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a better deal than any of the shellac colors.</li>
            <li>I love gelish polish.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>It is more cost efficient to purchase your own polish on amazon and gelish has been really great so far.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>Love this gelish color.</li>
            <li>Love the soak off feature.</li>
            <li>Bride\\&quot; layered over the top of it for some added bling.  </li>
            <li>Maybe Vegas Nights on top will hide the streaks</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I love gelish  polish.</li>
            <li>I knew i would love that color and everybody who see my nail</li>
            <li>i will buy more colors now</li>
            <li>Better gel polist out there.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>so I added Silver Sand on top.</li>
            <li>I would describe it more of strawberry yogurt.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Essie polish and their adorable pinks and nudes.  </li>
            <li>This shade of pink has been perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to purchase more colors.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and set.</li>
            <li>It peeled off easily but ruined the surface of my nail.</li>
            <li>and once you do the two coats, which you must, it is very bold.</li>
            <li>The gel comes off easily with acetone.</li>
            <li>It lasts and lasts and makes my nails so strong.</li>
            <li>I also love using it with a glitter top coat - such as Waterfield or Good Gossip.</li>
            <li>Gelish is the absolute best, and I love Pink Smoothie just as much as I have loved all my other awesome colors.  </li>
            <li>The polish works fine</li>
            <li>I wish there was an accurate color chart for these products out there......</li>
            <li>plus, this comes in huge size.</li>
            <li>I have a handful of light gelish colors</li>
            <li>It does not level off so the application appears even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does not give the effect of a light, nude, translucent shine on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Also looks fantastic with a coat of \\&quot;June</li>
            <li>I love the color, fabulous for the summer, and it&#x27;s good qualify, it holds for a solid 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is still a great color, just not that more pink bubble bath color</li>
            <li>I love doing my own french manicures and this is the best shade of pink for doing that!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful opaque light pink.  </li>
            <li>Love how she displays the colors on REAL nails!</li>
            <li>I am excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to clean the nails after curing with rubbing alcohol, or the surface will be tacky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to do a lasting manicure at home.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite gelish polish so far, it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty but just too light for me.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute perfect pink nail color out there!</li>
            <li>Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This color is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li>But still good price and actually save money for me at salon.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, unfortunately, I am not a very big fan of the color.</li>
            <li>The only thing, the color is tricky and will show imperfections, so you will need a good nail treatment .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark skinned and wasn&#x27;t sure what would look good on me in the Gelish line.</li>
            <li>Pale, pretty and perfect.  </li>
            <li>It looked good on my super short nails.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d do it quickly and peel it off.</li>
            <li>I just started using the gel nail polish and wanted a collection of nice colors I love pink</li>
            <li>As with most of the lighter gellish colors, I noticed some cracking in the polish as it got older.  </li>
            <li>this is a super cute color, a classic bright, crisp light pink.</li>
            <li>Beautiful when going for a slightly more natural color but still want a little pop.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>Really like the gel nails and the harmony light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use, but I can see wearing it for weddings, or for springtime.</li>
            <li>is my favorite color so far.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good neutral/pale pink.  </li>
            <li>I own a lot of the Gelish products and this is the ONLY one that I have difficulty applying.   </li>
            <li>I was looking for a gelish color that would go nicely with a French manicure.</li>
            <li>but the fact that you&#x27;re paying about what it costs for the mini size in stores makes it worth the chance.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this so pretty.this as a french manicure is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This one will take lots of practice to get just right.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in a long time that I&#x27;ve used a light color and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>that said, this is my least favorite of the seven or eight bottles of Gelish color that I own -- and one the rare occasions when I do try to use it, I end up soaking it off within a day or</li>
            <li>As long as we don&#x27;t pry and scrape with our nails, the polish will stay on and look nice.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful color, but extremely sheer, it runs like water on the nail so you have to dry it right away...</li>
            <li>I had a professional Gelish application and loved the results, but can&#x27;t afford to pay for it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I also tried Light Elegant -- but found the shimmer in Taffeta to be more subtle and to my liking.</li>
            <li>Works great and last a couple of weeks when applied properly.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colors, it is a very cute pink very similar to the the picture shown.</li>
            <li>Its a very nice soft pink.  </li>
            <li>color of this one is pretty, although I expected more intelligent one, not as childish as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally hooked on gelish as my favorite soak off product.</li>
            <li>I just hope thats not too much!  </li>
            <li>This was my first time doing gel polish nails</li>
            <li>The color is a nice pink</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gelish polish resists chipping better than standard nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>really a nude pink looks very elegant.</li>
            <li>Sure enough it&#x27;s opaque, which I thought I wanted, but with this color I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>pretty color</li>
            <li>The color is nice and looks exactly like a pink smoothie.  </li>
            <li>My clients love this with a french manicure.</li>
            <li>I currently am wearing it with waterfield (4th finger accent) and have gotten tons of compliments :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have preferred it if it had a bit of sparkle or was more sheer.</li>
            <li>Definitely a pretty color on fingers.</li>
            <li>This was the first gelish polish I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the shade I was going for.</li>
            <li>This usually only takes me 2 coats to get a good color which is nice because it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get good coverage with 2 coats, and it runs to the side quickly.</li>
            <li>This pink is a very nice light pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a baby pink color without the pearly sheen, so you can say its matte, but the top it off makes it and all gelish colors super shiny,like glass.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its a little hard to use, because the color is so light its not quite sheer, but its easy to see where there is more or less paint on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not one of my favorite colors, but Harmony Gelish is still an excellent brand!</li>
            <li>My mistake is that I cut my nails off short before my manicure, because I thought it would be a bit more sheer and thus would look natural and trendy.</li>
            <li>This pink is great for french manicures, or wearing alone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect pale OPAQUE pink.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a matte, opaque, pale pink finish -- this is the perfect polish for you.  </li>
            <li>Two coats for a more sheer look, three coats for a more opaque pink.</li>
            <li>Light enough to be neutral but pink enough to look great on toes in summer.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it may have been a little too pink, but after all the nails were done and the white tips were on top, it all came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would look great on people with darker olive or bronze skin tones, but I naturally have ivory skin, so I&#x27;m not sure about the color.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have been on the lookout for a very light pink for some time now -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty light pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pink if you want a pink color.  </li>
            <li>Very girly.</li>
            <li>I also like the IBD for structure but nobody can touch the great coverage of gelish for thin coats.</li>
            <li>The color didn&#x27;t apply very well.</li>
            <li>I have brown skin and was very concerned about buying nail polish online because I couldn&#x27;t really see how it would look.</li>
            <li>Its a very milky looking color.  </li>
            <li>Applys very well not gooey.</li>
            <li>, I was ready to take off the nail polish and start again.</li>
            <li>I really like this color, but if I want to get it at it&#x27;s fullest coverage</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pink polish.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The color is much smoother in person than in the picture and bottle.</li>
            <li>It is really girly with some sparkle over it.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s the larger .5oz size needs 2-3 coats for a streak free finish.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color.  </li>
            <li>it was not curing very well and did not cover my nail well.</li>
            <li>used this polish in conjuction with Gelish Basix Kit and an LED light I bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li>and no matter how much I shake it, it doesn&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li>With an initial investment under $100 I can now do my own nails on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great light pink, so subtle and clean looking.</li>
            <li>I love Harmony Gelish product, but like the other reviewer, the color did not apply evenly.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in LOVE with Gelish over any other soak-off product.  </li>
            <li>and I think that it may be due to my technique and that professionals would have better luck with getting 1 or 2 coats streak-free.</li>
            <li>She uses the Gelish \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;Top It Off\\&quot;, but with other polish.</li>
            <li>I own Desert Sand, Reserve, Black Cherry Berry, Simple Sheer and Elegant Wish.  </li>
            <li>This is such a lovely baby pink color, with no sparkle, only the shine from the top</li>
            <li>I am normally a dark polish wearing chic but I love this color for a break in between.  </li>
            <li>so i have to add a lighter color on top to tone it down.</li>
            <li>uv light seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>Three coats left a nice color pink.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Gelish is a high quality product - one of the hardest shellacs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to see that stores are starting to sell Gel polish, so the next day I bought different  color &amp; different brand from the store, and it worked perfectly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this color, but the consistency is a little on the runny side, so when you apply the polish it can leave streaks.  </li>
            <li>The closest thing I can compare this shade to is the light pink nail polish on a classic Barbie doll.</li>
            <li>Light pastel like pink.</li>
            <li>I usually opt for bright reds, corals, and sometimes a nude shade or hot pink.</li>
            <li>Light pastel pink</li>
            <li>which normally happens whether I have polish on or not.  </li>
            <li>After trying several different colors in an effort to get a nice, sheer, neutral finish, I settled on Taffeta, which has quite a bit of shimmer but looks shiny and neutral on my nails.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun color but be warned that the color is slightly different than picture.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried several different gel polish but this is far better than any out there.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll do it right and use the polish remover in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even wear this color all winter long because it is clean looking, classy and timeless.</li>
            <li>Everything is new so should work</li>
            <li>I got this with Water Field and Sheek White to make peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie.</li>
            <li>The color is okay, but it&#x27;s an opaque baby pink, and not sheer.  </li>
            <li>A little darker pink than expected but super cute and super durable polish.</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are also easy to come off.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this color for anyone who likes a lighter pastel shade of pink and not the flaming bright pink colors.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw other reviews saying this was opaque</li>
            <li>I think this might be pretty with a sheer glitter overtop.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually wear pastel colors on my nails.</li>
            <li>This is a true baby pink color</li>
            <li>True creamy pink  and not peachy.</li>
            <li>and so the two coats I did are not solid like the other colors I own but also not meant to be sheer...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re going to use one coat and add other colors as design to it.</li>
            <li>I think I was hoping it would go on more sheer with less coats, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s def a mild soft color, esp against my African American hands.</li>
            <li>The color on here is VERY accurate, PINK!!!!!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light, even a little lighter than the photo.  </li>
            <li>Love this color but it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li>I do dishes, take care of a 2 year old and work on the computer a lot.  </li>
            <li>It is opaque with 2 coats, a comparison to Opi mod about you, Essie raise awareness, in regular polish to give u an idea or a google swatch reference.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and 2 two coats for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>but I do not want to keep paying for something that I have to keep getting fixed.</li>
            <li>Completely flat/opaque - no shimmer at all.  </li>
            <li>Do not use on clients - they will be very upset because it does not last.</li>
            <li>3 coats for completely opaque look.  </li>
            <li>I think I received an old bottle, it seems like it&#x27;s separating</li>
            <li>I have two small girls, a husband, and a full time job, so I do not have much time to polish my nails.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a pale cotton candy pink, with no shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice pale pink color.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice opaque pale pink color.  </li>
            <li>I was worried with some of the other reviews for similar Gelish colors they would be too sheer, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>This color is a very subtle pink and is great if that is the color you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>This color is so soft and subtle, makes us feel all innocent inside.  </li>
            <li>I love the dressy look with this subtle color.</li>
            <li>I wear this color all the time either as a bright summery color or (now that it&#x27;s winter) just as a base coat to paint over with regular polish to keep my nails strong.</li>
            <li>I like the color, very classy soft pink, but it can be very streaky.</li>
            <li>The other hand just needed practice, because I&#x27;m not used to applying polish with my right</li>
            <li>But it is a pretty pink and worked as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty pale/soft pink.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous pink color, really pale pink, it requires 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the gelish little princess and although it looks ok, it wasn&#x27;t as pink as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Cute pink color to be natural or use for a French Manicure... or lighten up a darker red or pink shade.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, part of the reason we love Geish is because it lasts so long when you put it on, so you may as well have a color that you won&#x27;t tire of after a few days!</li>
            <li>The most pale pink on the market I believe.</li>
            <li>and I generally use Harmony Gelish brand, but I do not like this color!</li>
            <li>Other people seem to really like it!</li>
            <li>Color was nice but left little black bubbles.</li>
            <li>If I apply 2 thin coats, I&#x27;ll get a very light coverage.</li>
            <li>Is is not a clean pink, it has a little more of a muddier color, maybe a little more purple ish than pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re going to like the color since it&#x27;s not always accurate to what you see online</li>
            <li>I think the pink was a little too \\&quot;bright,\\&quot; as I was looking for a more sheer color.  </li>
            <li>One extremely thin layer of the opaque polish, then the white tip, and then the opaque polish again to make the manicure appear a bit more natural.  </li>
            <li>The color is great, but the polish itself seems to be watered down or a fake brand in a Gelish bottle.</li>
            <li>Not a single chip in over 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>This is the first pink I found that has a flat sheen.</li>
            <li>I really like this gelish and this color is really subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply extra thin</li>
            <li>Pink Smoothies is a lovely opaque pale pink.</li>
            <li>Lovely subtle baby pink color.</li>
            <li>This new color is baby pink.  </li>
            <li>It was really unforgiving and every little mistake shows up.   </li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty, but its very hard to keep it on your nail without it slipping and sliding at first.</li>
            <li>I love the color, but it&#x27;s extremely uneven and hard to work with.</li>

            <li> I love Gelish Products,  because the appearance of my nails is always perfect, without the damage that acrylic nails can cause.</li>
            <li> Now I say this one is just ok, the color is not as even as CND, does not look as perfect as CND ones.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so i could see the color, amazing, beautiful, but</li>
            <li> that will not allow bright colors</li>
            <li> if your looking for a good neutral color that isn&#x27;t too tan</li>
            <li> It takes 3 Coates to get a good color.  </li>
            <li> The gelish polish is good  </li>
            <li> All Gelish polish is good quality.</li>
            <li> I think this color would look good by itself, too.</li>
            <li> Looks good.</li>
            <li> Would look good on anyone.</li>
            <li> One coat would look good</li>
            <li> Very happy with this polish, the color is very pretty with good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this color and can&#x27;t wait to be able to buy more nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> I love to have great looking nail</li>
            <li> That being said, I used a lighter color over the top and it turned out great.  </li>

            <li> it gives a nice shear coat which works good for a job you have</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great color and easy off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving Gelish and the staying power this polish has.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice color, but would have liked just a hit of shimmer to the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a really nice color.</li>
            <li> I can do my own nail</li>
            <li> I have my own system.  </li>
            <li> Package Came fast, color is perfect!</li>
            <li> I even tried putting my polish in a warm bowl of water, which helped the consistency to be thiner and went on better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cute and springy :)</li>
            <li> Looks great true color</li>
            <li> It came quickly and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I did have to improve my skills on applying polish perfectly because mistakes and imperfections show up very clearly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE gel polish!</li>
            <li> Used with Gellish Basix and its still holding strong!</li>
            <li> My cheap 36 watt UV lamp works perfectly to cure it, and it&#x27;s just as good as the last gel manicure I paid for at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Very light color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very light pastel color.</li>
            <li> You can easily gel your own nails instead of going to a salon to have them done.</li>
            <li> I love gelish and exhale</li>
            <li> Much better faster smoother with richer more opaque coverage than OPI.</li>
            <li> I love the gel polishes.  </li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on this color, both from my instructors and from men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li> I gave a 3 star mostly because I Love the color</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I make sure to take my bottle with me when I get a mani just in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro yet, but with time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I love the formula, color and the size.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a better deal than any of the shellac colors.</li>
            <li> I love gelish polish.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> It is more cost efficient to purchase your own polish on amazon and gelish has been really great so far.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> Love this gelish color.</li>
            <li> Love the soak off feature.</li>
            <li> Bride\\&quot; layered over the top of it for some added bling.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Vegas Nights on top will hide the streaks</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I love gelish  polish.</li>
            <li> I knew i would love that color and everybody who see my nail</li>
            <li> i will buy more colors now</li>
            <li> Better gel polist out there.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> so I added Silver Sand on top.</li>
            <li> I would describe it more of strawberry yogurt.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Essie polish and their adorable pinks and nudes.  </li>
            <li> This shade of pink has been perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to purchase more colors.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and set.</li>
            <li> It peeled off easily but ruined the surface of my nail.</li>
            <li> and once you do the two coats, which you must, it is very bold.</li>
            <li> The gel comes off easily with acetone.</li>
            <li> It lasts and lasts and makes my nails so strong.</li>
            <li> I also love using it with a glitter top coat - such as Waterfield or Good Gossip.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the absolute best, and I love Pink Smoothie just as much as I have loved all my other awesome colors.  </li>
            <li> The polish works fine</li>
            <li> I wish there was an accurate color chart for these products out there......</li>
            <li> plus, this comes in huge size.</li>
            <li> I have a handful of light gelish colors</li>
            <li> It does not level off so the application appears even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does not give the effect of a light, nude, translucent shine on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Also looks fantastic with a coat of \\&quot;June</li>
            <li> I love the color, fabulous for the summer, and it&#x27;s good qualify, it holds for a solid 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is still a great color, just not that more pink bubble bath color</li>
            <li> I love doing my own french manicures and this is the best shade of pink for doing that!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful opaque light pink.  </li>
            <li> Love how she displays the colors on REAL nails!</li>
            <li> I am excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to clean the nails after curing with rubbing alcohol, or the surface will be tacky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to do a lasting manicure at home.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite gelish polish so far, it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty but just too light for me.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute perfect pink nail color out there!</li>
            <li> Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This color is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li> But still good price and actually save money for me at salon.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, unfortunately, I am not a very big fan of the color.</li>
            <li> The only thing, the color is tricky and will show imperfections, so you will need a good nail treatment .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned and wasn&#x27;t sure what would look good on me in the Gelish line.</li>
            <li> Pale, pretty and perfect.  </li>
            <li> It looked good on my super short nails.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d do it quickly and peel it off.</li>
            <li> I just started using the gel nail polish and wanted a collection of nice colors I love pink</li>
            <li> As with most of the lighter gellish colors, I noticed some cracking in the polish as it got older.  </li>
            <li> this is a super cute color, a classic bright, crisp light pink.</li>
            <li> Beautiful when going for a slightly more natural color but still want a little pop.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> So pretty!</li>
            <li> Really like the gel nails and the harmony light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for everyday use, but I can see wearing it for weddings, or for springtime.</li>
            <li> is my favorite color so far.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good neutral/pale pink.  </li>
            <li> I own a lot of the Gelish products and this is the ONLY one that I have difficulty applying.   </li>
            <li> I was looking for a gelish color that would go nicely with a French manicure.</li>
            <li> but the fact that you&#x27;re paying about what it costs for the mini size in stores makes it worth the chance.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this so pretty.this as a french manicure is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This one will take lots of practice to get just right.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in a long time that I&#x27;ve used a light color and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> that said, this is my least favorite of the seven or eight bottles of Gelish color that I own -- and one the rare occasions when I do try to use it, I end up soaking it off within a day or</li>
            <li> As long as we don&#x27;t pry and scrape with our nails, the polish will stay on and look nice.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful color, but extremely sheer, it runs like water on the nail so you have to dry it right away...</li>
            <li> I had a professional Gelish application and loved the results, but can&#x27;t afford to pay for it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I also tried Light Elegant -- but found the shimmer in Taffeta to be more subtle and to my liking.</li>
            <li> Works great and last a couple of weeks when applied properly.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors, it is a very cute pink very similar to the the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice soft pink.  </li>
            <li> color of this one is pretty, although I expected more intelligent one, not as childish as this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally hooked on gelish as my favorite soak off product.</li>
            <li> I just hope thats not too much!  </li>
            <li> This was my first time doing gel polish nails</li>
            <li> The color is a nice pink</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gelish polish resists chipping better than standard nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> really a nude pink looks very elegant.</li>
            <li> Sure enough it&#x27;s opaque, which I thought I wanted, but with this color I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> pretty color</li>
            <li> The color is nice and looks exactly like a pink smoothie.  </li>
            <li> My clients love this with a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I currently am wearing it with waterfield (4th finger accent) and have gotten tons of compliments :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have preferred it if it had a bit of sparkle or was more sheer.</li>
            <li> Definitely a pretty color on fingers.</li>
            <li> This was the first gelish polish I have used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the shade I was going for.</li>
            <li> This usually only takes me 2 coats to get a good color which is nice because it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get good coverage with 2 coats, and it runs to the side quickly.</li>
            <li> This pink is a very nice light pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a baby pink color without the pearly sheen, so you can say its matte, but the top it off makes it and all gelish colors super shiny,like glass.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its a little hard to use, because the color is so light its not quite sheer, but its easy to see where there is more or less paint on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not one of my favorite colors, but Harmony Gelish is still an excellent brand!</li>
            <li> My mistake is that I cut my nails off short before my manicure, because I thought it would be a bit more sheer and thus would look natural and trendy.</li>
            <li> This pink is great for french manicures, or wearing alone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect pale OPAQUE pink.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a matte, opaque, pale pink finish -- this is the perfect polish for you.  </li>
            <li> Two coats for a more sheer look, three coats for a more opaque pink.</li>
            <li> Light enough to be neutral but pink enough to look great on toes in summer.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it may have been a little too pink, but after all the nails were done and the white tips were on top, it all came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would look great on people with darker olive or bronze skin tones, but I naturally have ivory skin, so I&#x27;m not sure about the color.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for a very light pink for some time now -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty light pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great pink if you want a pink color.  </li>
            <li> Very girly.</li>
            <li> I also like the IBD for structure but nobody can touch the great coverage of gelish for thin coats.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t apply very well.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and was very concerned about buying nail polish online because I couldn&#x27;t really see how it would look.</li>
            <li> Its a very milky looking color.  </li>
            <li> Applys very well not gooey.</li>
            <li> , I was ready to take off the nail polish and start again.</li>
            <li> I really like this color, but if I want to get it at it&#x27;s fullest coverage</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pink polish.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The color is much smoother in person than in the picture and bottle.</li>
            <li> It is really girly with some sparkle over it.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s the larger .5oz size needs 2-3 coats for a streak free finish.</li>
            <li> I love the pink color.  </li>
            <li> it was not curing very well and did not cover my nail well.</li>
            <li> used this polish in conjuction with Gelish Basix Kit and an LED light I bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> and no matter how much I shake it, it doesn&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li> With an initial investment under $100 I can now do my own nails on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great light pink, so subtle and clean looking.</li>
            <li> I love Harmony Gelish product, but like the other reviewer, the color did not apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> I have fallen in LOVE with Gelish over any other soak-off product.  </li>
            <li> and I think that it may be due to my technique and that professionals would have better luck with getting 1 or 2 coats streak-free.</li>
            <li> She uses the Gelish \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;Top It Off\\&quot;, but with other polish.</li>
            <li> I own Desert Sand, Reserve, Black Cherry Berry, Simple Sheer and Elegant Wish.  </li>
            <li> This is such a lovely baby pink color, with no sparkle, only the shine from the top</li>
            <li> I am normally a dark polish wearing chic but I love this color for a break in between.  </li>
            <li> so i have to add a lighter color on top to tone it down.</li>
            <li> uv light seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Three coats left a nice color pink.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Gelish is a high quality product - one of the hardest shellacs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see that stores are starting to sell Gel polish, so the next day I bought different  color &amp; different brand from the store, and it worked perfectly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this color, but the consistency is a little on the runny side, so when you apply the polish it can leave streaks.  </li>
            <li> The closest thing I can compare this shade to is the light pink nail polish on a classic Barbie doll.</li>
            <li> Light pastel like pink.</li>
            <li> I usually opt for bright reds, corals, and sometimes a nude shade or hot pink.</li>
            <li> Light pastel pink</li>
            <li> which normally happens whether I have polish on or not.  </li>
            <li> After trying several different colors in an effort to get a nice, sheer, neutral finish, I settled on Taffeta, which has quite a bit of shimmer but looks shiny and neutral on my nails.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun color but be warned that the color is slightly different than picture.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried several different gel polish but this is far better than any out there.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll do it right and use the polish remover in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even wear this color all winter long because it is clean looking, classy and timeless.</li>
            <li> Everything is new so should work</li>
            <li> I got this with Water Field and Sheek White to make peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie.</li>
            <li> The color is okay, but it&#x27;s an opaque baby pink, and not sheer.  </li>
            <li> A little darker pink than expected but super cute and super durable polish.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and are also easy to come off.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this color for anyone who likes a lighter pastel shade of pink and not the flaming bright pink colors.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw other reviews saying this was opaque</li>
            <li> I think this might be pretty with a sheer glitter overtop.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually wear pastel colors on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a true baby pink color</li>
            <li> True creamy pink  and not peachy.</li>
            <li> and so the two coats I did are not solid like the other colors I own but also not meant to be sheer...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re going to use one coat and add other colors as design to it.</li>
            <li> I think I was hoping it would go on more sheer with less coats, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s def a mild soft color, esp against my African American hands.</li>
            <li> The color on here is VERY accurate, PINK!!!!!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light, even a little lighter than the photo.  </li>
            <li> Love this color but it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I do dishes, take care of a 2 year old and work on the computer a lot.  </li>
            <li> It is opaque with 2 coats, a comparison to Opi mod about you, Essie raise awareness, in regular polish to give u an idea or a google swatch reference.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and 2 two coats for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> but I do not want to keep paying for something that I have to keep getting fixed.</li>
            <li> Completely flat/opaque - no shimmer at all.  </li>
            <li> Do not use on clients - they will be very upset because it does not last.</li>
            <li> 3 coats for completely opaque look.  </li>
            <li> I think I received an old bottle, it seems like it&#x27;s separating</li>
            <li> I have two small girls, a husband, and a full time job, so I do not have much time to polish my nails.</li>
            <li> Kind of like a pale cotton candy pink, with no shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice pale pink color.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice opaque pale pink color.  </li>
            <li> I was worried with some of the other reviews for similar Gelish colors they would be too sheer, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> This color is a very subtle pink and is great if that is the color you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> This color is so soft and subtle, makes us feel all innocent inside.  </li>
            <li> I love the dressy look with this subtle color.</li>
            <li> I wear this color all the time either as a bright summery color or (now that it&#x27;s winter) just as a base coat to paint over with regular polish to keep my nails strong.</li>
            <li> I like the color, very classy soft pink, but it can be very streaky.</li>
            <li> The other hand just needed practice, because I&#x27;m not used to applying polish with my right</li>
            <li> But it is a pretty pink and worked as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty pale/soft pink.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous pink color, really pale pink, it requires 3 coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gelish little princess and although it looks ok, it wasn&#x27;t as pink as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Cute pink color to be natural or use for a French Manicure... or lighten up a darker red or pink shade.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, part of the reason we love Geish is because it lasts so long when you put it on, so you may as well have a color that you won&#x27;t tire of after a few days!</li>
            <li> The most pale pink on the market I believe.</li>
            <li> and I generally use Harmony Gelish brand, but I do not like this color!</li>
            <li> Other people seem to really like it!</li>
            <li> Color was nice but left little black bubbles.</li>
            <li> If I apply 2 thin coats, I&#x27;ll get a very light coverage.</li>
            <li> Is is not a clean pink, it has a little more of a muddier color, maybe a little more purple ish than pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re going to like the color since it&#x27;s not always accurate to what you see online</li>
            <li> I think the pink was a little too \\&quot;bright,\\&quot; as I was looking for a more sheer color.  </li>
            <li> One extremely thin layer of the opaque polish, then the white tip, and then the opaque polish again to make the manicure appear a bit more natural.  </li>
            <li> The color is great, but the polish itself seems to be watered down or a fake brand in a Gelish bottle.</li>
            <li> Not a single chip in over 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> This is the first pink I found that has a flat sheen.</li>
            <li> I really like this gelish and this color is really subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply extra thin</li>
            <li> Pink Smoothies is a lovely opaque pale pink.</li>
            <li> Lovely subtle baby pink color.</li>
            <li> This new color is baby pink.  </li>
            <li> It was really unforgiving and every little mistake shows up.   </li>
            <li> and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty, but its very hard to keep it on your nail without it slipping and sliding at first.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it&#x27;s extremely uneven and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Not to pale yet not to intense.</li>
            <li> It is flat, which was very different from what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This is the darker true pink smoothie color, in my experience there are a few pink smoothies on the market.</li>
            <li> Its a very heavy pastel pink, visualize the light pink crayon.  </li>
            <li> Did not go on smoothly, chipped and peeled pretty badly.</li>
            <li> But this is a pretty pale pink.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much I&#x27;ll wear it.  </li>
            <li> but it also doesn&#x27;t look flat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend another pink color if you are looking for something sheer (for French manicures).</li>
            <li> It is a pretty pastel pink but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend for a French manicure, especially if you like the base to be more pink than transparent.</li>
            <li> I love everything I&#x27;ve bought from Gelish but this is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> totally baby pink.    </li>
            <li> I will say that this color is pink, not sheer.  </li>
            <li> pink and white manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, its a bubble pink and</li>
            <li> I always use a thin layer for the first, but I tried applying a thicker one on the second</li>
            <li> But it was really pretty once I got it on thin enough.</li>
            <li> Very soft pale pink color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flat pink with no shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND products only and at some point decided to try some other products.</li>
            <li> it didnt dry was sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pale enough to use for a French manicure if you like.</li>
            <li> this is not a color for french manis -- the color is too dark for it.</li>
            <li> only downside for me with this shade is that it has a slight lilac hue to it that I&#x27;d prefer it didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a big goopy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a little girl color in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish soak off Pink Smoothies 01408</li>
            <li> and I used pink smoothie.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a neutral pink.</li>
            <li> Xx baby pink must have.</li>
            <li> color is an opaque, pinky pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pink as it looks on here and it peeled off like the gel strips do, didn&#x27;t have to soak off nail.</li>
            <li> So recommend  for pink color lover</li>
            <li> I like this pink.</li>
            <li> The polish arrived a lot faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the pink shades of nail polish.</li>
            <li> If you do not put enough on it will be uneven.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a baby pink/soft bubble gum pink color.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to apply one cost carefully to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li> I was dreading that it might look too baby pink, but instead it&#x27;s a subtle, modern pink, with a slight sheerness to it.</li>
            <li> Pink smoothie..</li>
            <li> But if you put to much on it will be thick and uneven.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT SEEMED USED AND DRY!!</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned black woman and this color is WAY too pink for my french manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some bad reviews about the other light colors being too sheer</li>
            <li> I goes with all outfits and jewelry, and can be layered with other colors.  </li>
            <li> My other fingernails looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other colors by this brand, so</li>
            <li> The first coat I do very very thin so that it looks sheer, then on the second coat I apply a very thick coat to get the shiny surface that I want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first gelish mani - and I did struggle with the streakyness of it, I ended up using four very thin coats of color...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little harder than some of my other colors to apply, maybe I just need three coats?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was looking for a neutral color with a little pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell the actual color of each gelish nail polish but this color is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I found this color to be very pretty,I thought I could use it for a french manicure, but i was VERY wrong.</li>
            <li> If you are not a professional this color may be difficult to apply and get a professional look.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this color, along with the base coat, top coat and UV lamp to do Gelish at home.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bubble gum pink or childish color.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a real pink.</li>
            <li> I love to wear it as a base for nail art.</li>
            <li> a few companies even Sally&#x27;s, sell colors that look expired, making pink smoothie a lighter pale pink that has hints of gray.</li>
            <li> it is a durable color because after a week and a half I had no chipping, perhaps just because I used 3 coats, along with Shellac base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> This is the perf baby pink!!</li>
            <li> This probably was not a wise choice for a pale pink color, considering its so different from what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> word of advice - I typically do two coats of color.  </li>
            <li> I typically keep my gel nails for 2 weeks with no issue but this color started to get some cracking and imperfection after about 9 or 10 days.  </li>
            <li> but this one always leaves the black bubbles when I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a shimmery pink, it looks just like a strawberry smoothie - thick pink.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and thus I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this is baby girl pink.</li>
            <li> Very pale creamy pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pale pink.  </li>
            <li> It took 3 coats to get full coverage, which isn&#x27;t too bad for a pale color.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but it seemed a little watery to me</li>
            <li> Its a little pinker than OPI bubble bath and the coverage is opaque with 2-3 coats.  </li>
            <li> and it works a little</li>
            <li> but this was a little darker than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I have very weak natural nails, yet with this polish my nails don&#x27;t break or split</li>
            <li> After a few days, the polish on the tips of the nails on my forefingers had chipped off.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like having to remove my gel after just a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s icky pink...</li>
            <li> So, between the base coat &amp; 3+ color coats &amp; top coat, I ended up with a lot of polish on my nails and it looked thick and unattractive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a youthful color, and I&#x27;m 30, so I&#x27;m not sure about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product worked well, but the color is less subtle than the picture.  </li>
            <li> No more nail salon for me.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s them or just the one I got.</li>
            <li> I like the base color to be pale pink with white tips.</li>
            <li> However, be warned that this color is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> If you want it to look like the color swatch in the picture you have to apply at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> It would cost me at least $30 at the salon.</li>
            <li> So, you need to put on at least three, if not four, coats before the streakiness goes away and the color smooths out.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was overly thick as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but then it was a thick layer of polsih.  </li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this color for a week and have gotten 3 random compliments on the color fr other women.</li>
            <li> The color did not go on evenly, and I need at least 3 coats, which isn&#x27;t too bad; however I was looking for the sheer effect.  </li>
            <li> Not a very bright color!</li>
            <li> a bad mix of Pepto Bismol and Bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> This color every time after about 2-3 days will fade to a weird yellowish pink color to the point it looks so bad that I end up removing it.</li>
            <li> I hate the color, it is a pepto bismal pink,</li>
            <li> but I was unfortunately a little disappointed with the coverage.  </li>
            <li> This one is what I wanted for times when I didn&#x27;t want to be too flashy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to do everything, from very thin coats to thicker coats.  </li>
            <li> Apply very thin coats and will probably need 3.</li>
            <li> Polish runs very thin</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle or something</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.      </li>
            <li> but the HATE the application of it.</li>
            <li> but I hated the color.</li>
            <li> This polish is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good service and products as described!</li>
            <li> Very light color. If you want it to look like the color swatch in the picture you have to apply at least 3 coats. It&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re going to use one coat and add other colors as design to it.</li>
            <li> Love how she displays the colors on REAL nails! It helps with deciding on the color you would want to buy!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw other reviews saying this was opaque but I was unfortunately a little disappointed with the coverage.  It is supposed to not go on sheer but it seemed a little watery to me and so the two coats I did are not solid like the other colors I own but also not meant to be sheer...  It was really unforgiving and every little mistake shows up.   I love gelish and exhale is my favorite color so far.  I think this might be pretty with a sheer glitter overtop.  just my two cents.  Other people seem to really like it!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this nail polish. It lasts and lasts and makes my nails so strong. I have very weak natural nails, yet with this polish my nails don&#x27;t break or split and they are allowed to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me with this shade is that it has a slight lilac hue to it that I&#x27;d prefer it didn&#x27;t have. The closest thing I can compare this shade to is the light pink nail polish on a classic Barbie doll.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish Products,  because the appearance of my nails is always perfect, without the damage that acrylic nails can cause.Harmony Gelish soak off Pink Smoothies 01408</li>
            <li> opaque and no shine- if your looking for a good neutral color that isn&#x27;t too tan then this is the way to go! love the gelish colection!</li>
            <li> this is a super cute color, a classic bright, crisp light pink. Reminds me of barbie. Very girly.</li>
            <li> Love this color but it is hard to work with. Streaky and inconsistent texture. If you are not a professional this color may be difficult to apply and get a professional look.</li>
            <li> I have a handful of light gelish colors but they all have a frost sheen. This is the first pink I found that has a flat sheen. Its a little pinker than OPI bubble bath and the coverage is opaque with 2-3 coats.  I&#x27;m totally hooked on gelish as my favorite soak off product. Much better faster smoother with richer more opaque coverage than OPI. I also like the IBD for structure but nobody can touch the great coverage of gelish for thin coats. I&#x27;ve seen some bad reviews about the other light colors being too sheer but that is not a problem with this color. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This product is close to the color on the picture. Light pastel like pink. I got this with Water Field and Sheek White to make peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie. Very cute and springy :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and I am very happy with it.  It stays on for about 3 weeks. My daughter and her friend also used it and they are very happy with it as well</li>
            <li> I found this color to be very pretty,I thought I could use it for a french manicure, but i was VERY wrong. I am a dark skinned black woman and this color is WAY too pink for my french manicure. The color on here is VERY accurate, PINK!!!!!.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good neutral/pale pink.  I think the pink was a little too \\&quot;bright,\\&quot; as I was looking for a more sheer color.  I possibly chose the color incorrectly.  The color didn&#x27;t apply very well. The color did not go on evenly, and I need at least 3 coats, which isn&#x27;t too bad; however I was looking for the sheer effect.  I love Harmony Gelish product, but like the other reviewer, the color did not apply evenly.  I would recommend another pink color if you are looking for something sheer (for French manicures).</li>
            <li> I love the gel polishes.  This one is what I wanted for times when I didn&#x27;t want to be too flashy.  It&#x27;s really light, even a little lighter than the photo.  Great for weddings, or the beach.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous pink color, really pale pink, it requires 3 coats.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors, it is a very cute pink very similar to the the picture shown.</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely baby pink color, with no sparkle, only the shine from the top it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first gelish mani - and I did struggle with the streakyness of it, I ended up using four very thin coats of color... I just hope thats not too much!  I will need to find another similar shade thats easier to apply.</li>
            <li> It takes 3 Coates to get a good color.  But it is a pretty pink and worked as described.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in LOVE with Gelish over any other soak-off product.  I own Desert Sand, Reserve, Black Cherry Berry, Simple Sheer and Elegant Wish.  This new color is baby pink.  I was looking for the sheer color of a French manicure overcoat and no frost.  The color is okay, but it&#x27;s an opaque baby pink, and not sheer.  Not sure how much I&#x27;ll wear it.  I wish there was an accurate color chart for these products out there......this one is actually the color of the sample picture...totally baby pink.    Also, Elephant Deals is the BEST company out there for product quality and speed of shipping.  VERY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this color, along with the base coat, top coat and UV lamp to do Gelish at home.  I had a professional Gelish application and loved the results, but can&#x27;t afford to pay for it on a regular basis.  With an initial investment under $100 I can now do my own nails on a regular basis.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Essie polish and their adorable pinks and nudes.  This color is very reminiscent of Essie&#x27;s Mademoiselle color.  It&#x27;s a perfect pale OPAQUE pink.  I was worried with some of the other reviews for similar Gelish colors they would be too sheer, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  It&#x27;s a flat pink with no shimmer.  I&#x27;m loving Gelish and the staying power this polish has.  I do dishes, take care of a 2 year old and work on the computer a lot.  Not a single chip in over 2 weeks!  Plus my nails didn&#x27;t rip or break which normally happens whether I have polish on or not.  Gelish is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time doing gel polish nails and I used pink smoothie. The color is a nice pink but I put 3 coats on because on coats 1 and 2 you can see the polish streaks. Three coats left a nice color pink. You can see it on the pictures that I posted.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail!  I love the dressy look with this subtle color. I will recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a neutral pink. I work in a field in which we are required to wear neutral polish. I have brown skin and was very concerned about buying nail polish online because I couldn&#x27;t really see how it would look. This shade of pink has been perfect. It is flat, which was very different from what I&#x27;m used to. It looked good on my super short nails. I did have to improve my skills on applying polish perfectly because mistakes and imperfections show up very clearly. (I used youtube videos to learn) I have received many compliments on this color, both from my instructors and from men. I&#x27;m very happy with this color and can&#x27;t wait to be able to buy more nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> I use this color all of the time, and I always get compliments.  I goes with all outfits and jewelry, and can be layered with other colors.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful color. It is timeless. The photos don&#x27;t do it justice. This color is a must have if you are planning on attending a formal gathering. It goes with everything from shorts to evening gowns.</li>
            <li> Or maybe a strawberry milkshake.  Its a very milky looking color.  Its a nice color, but would have liked just a hit of shimmer to the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a little hard to use, because the color is so light its not quite sheer, but its easy to see where there is more or less paint on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not one of my favorite colors, but Harmony Gelish is still an excellent brand!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier! The color is perfect. I posted a photo. My cheap 36 watt UV lamp works perfectly to cure it, and it&#x27;s just as good as the last gel manicure I paid for at a fraction of the cost! Just remember to clean the nails after curing with rubbing alcohol, or the surface will be tacky.</li>
            <li> This color was a lot darker than I thought it was going to be so i have to add a lighter color on top to tone it down. The gelish polish is good  I just wish the color was lighter.</li>
            <li> This is the darker true pink smoothie color, in my experience there are a few pink smoothies on the market. a few companies even Sally&#x27;s, sell colors that look expired, making pink smoothie a lighter pale pink that has hints of gray. This is the perf baby pink!! It is opaque with 2 coats, a comparison to Opi mod about you, Essie raise awareness, in regular polish to give u an idea or a google swatch reference. Applys very well not gooey. 3 coats has lasted 7days flawlessly. No lifting. Xx baby pink must have.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in a long time that I&#x27;ve used a light color and I am so glad I did.  This is a beautiful opaque light pink.  It is not a bubble gum pink or childish color.  Just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the color.  Had to use 3 coats but I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely use this color again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty pale/soft pink.  I gave a 3 star mostly because I Love the color but the HATE the application of it. I own a lot of the Gelish products and this is the ONLY one that I have difficulty applying.   It does not level off so the application appears even and smooth.  This polish however ends up looking splotchy no matter what I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried to do everything, from very thin coats to thicker coats.  Nothing works!  Extremely disappointed.      If anyone has any suggestions I would love some feedback!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Gelish polishes are great -- and this one is no exception.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to do a lasting manicure at home.  that said, this is my least favorite of the seven or eight bottles of Gelish color that I own -- and one the rare occasions when I do try to use it, I end up soaking it off within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is an opaque, pinky pink.  It is not sheer.  It has no shimmer.  It would not work for a French manicure.  It does not give the effect of a light, nude, translucent shine on the nails.  If you are looking for a matte, opaque, pale pink finish -- this is the perfect polish for you.  After trying several different colors in an effort to get a nice, sheer, neutral finish, I settled on Taffeta, which has quite a bit of shimmer but looks shiny and neutral on my nails.  I also tried Light Elegant -- but found the shimmer in Taffeta to be more subtle and to my liking.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this polish, the color is very pretty with good coverage.  It came in a timely manor and everything was as promised.</li>
            <li> Lovely color! I have two small girls, a husband, and a full time job, so I do not have much time to polish my nails. I have to use Gelish to keep my nails up.  Gelish is the absolute best, and I love Pink Smoothie just as much as I have loved all my other awesome colors.  It is opaque with just two coats, and it looks so feminine!</li>
            <li> This pink is great for french manicures, or wearing alone.  It is opaque and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice - I typically do two coats of color.  The first coat I do very very thin so that it looks sheer, then on the second coat I apply a very thick coat to get the shiny surface that I want.</li>
            <li> Great color and easy off. It&#x27;s like a bubble gum pink. I did my friends nails for her wedding and they turned out great.</li>
            <li> I like the color, very classy soft pink, but it can be very streaky. Apply very thin coats and will probably need 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND products only and at some point decided to try some other products. Now I say this one is just ok, the color is not as even as CND, does not look as perfect as CND ones.&lt;br /&gt;The color of this one is pretty, although I expected more intelligent one, not as childish as this one.</li>
            <li> Cute pink color to be natural or use for a French Manicure... or lighten up a darker red or pink shade.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before I bought it. It is a beautiful color, but extremely sheer, it runs like water on the nail so you have to dry it right away... I ddi 4 coats so i could see the color, amazing, beautiful, but oh my too sheer!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Gelish polish to use with my UV system. Along with the Gelish, I also bought the Gelish Basix kit. It was easy to apply and set. I did three coats. One of my hands looked great. The other hand just needed practice, because I&#x27;m not used to applying polish with my right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish polish resists chipping better than standard nail polishes. I&#x27;m not one to baby my nails. I pry and scrape things with them. After a few days, the polish on the tips of the nails on my forefingers had chipped off. My other fingernails looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of a week, I was ready to take off the nail polish and start again. I thought I&#x27;d do it quickly and peel it off. Big mistake. It peeled off easily but ruined the surface of my nail. Next time, I&#x27;ll do it right and use the polish remover in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, gel nails are not bulletproof. As long as we don&#x27;t pry and scrape with our nails, the polish will stay on and look nice. Otherwise, expect chipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this color, but if I want to get it at it&#x27;s fullest coverage I have to use 3 coats or so. I always use a thin layer for the first, but I tried applying a thicker one on the second and it works a little but I noticed some streaks. If I apply 2 thin coats, I&#x27;ll get a very light coverage. That&#x27;s okay though I still like it.</li>
            <li> This is a true baby pink color but it&#x27;s difficult to apply. Polish runs very thin so it&#x27;s hard to get good coverage with 2 coats, and it runs to the side quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pink polish.  Pale, pretty and perfect.  Works great and last a couple of weeks when applied properly.</li>
            <li> Gelish is a high quality product - one of the hardest shellacs.  This color is my absolute favorite and I get a lot of complements on.  I make sure to take my bottle with me when I get a mani just in case the salon doesn&#x27;t have it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pink as it looks on here and it peeled off like the gel strips do, didn&#x27;t have to soak off nail.</li>
            <li> This is such a great light pink, so subtle and clean looking. This usually only takes me 2 coats to get a good color which is nice because it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty, but its very hard to keep it on your nail without it slipping and sliding at first.</li>
            <li> Color is kinda pinky purplish. But still good price and actually save money for me at salon. So recommend  for pink color lover</li>
            <li> I like this pink. All Gelish polish is good quality. They last a long time and are also easy to come off.</li>
            <li> This is a fun color but be warned that the color is slightly different than picture. Is is not a clean pink, it has a little more of a muddier color, maybe a little more purple ish than pictured. It is still a great color, just not that more pink bubble bath color it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Doesnt feel like nail polish. Didn&#x27;t work well with uv light seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t dry. Looked and felt like liquid paper.</li>
            <li> Really like the gel nails and the harmony light.  I&#x27;m not a pro yet, but with time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  I will say that this color is pink, not sheer.  It looks like a real pink. pink and white manicure.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, part of the reason we love Geish is because it lasts so long when you put it on, so you may as well have a color that you won&#x27;t tire of after a few days! Pink Smoothies is a lovely opaque pale pink. It&#x27;s pale enough to use for a French manicure if you like. I love to wear it as a base for nail art. I also love using it with a glitter top coat - such as Waterfield or Good Gossip. Changes the color somewhat too. A must have basic color for your Gelish collection</li>
            <li> Very pale creamy pink. Great for spring.  Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> it didnt dry was sticky.</li>
            <li> I love the formula, color and the size. It is definitely a better deal than any of the shellac colors.</li>
            <li> I love gelish polish. I have tried others but nothing compares not even more expensive products. This pink is a very nice light pink. Its a very solid Color.</li>
            <li> This color is great! It&#x27;s a baby pink color without the pearly sheen, so you can say its matte, but the top it off makes it and all gelish colors super shiny,like glass.</li>
            <li> Lovely subtle baby pink color. Beautiful when going for a slightly more natural color but still want a little pop. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, unfortunately, I am not a very big fan of the color. It is a Bubble Gum color and once you do the two coats, which you must, it is very bold.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite gelish polish so far, it&#x27;s so cute. The polish arrived a lot faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of gelish colors to do my gel myself at home. This color every time after about 2-3 days will fade to a weird yellowish pink color to the point it looks so bad that I end up removing it. I love the color but I don&#x27;t like having to remove my gel after just a few days. Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but this is the only color that seems to do this.</li>
            <li> I really like this gelish and this color is really subtle and pretty. You can easily gel your own nails instead of going to a salon to have them done. It is more cost efficient to purchase your own polish on amazon and gelish has been really great so far. I have several gelish products and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> Thank you for contacting me when you ran out of this product.  Thank you for sending it to me when you received this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a really nice color. Only thing is that it&#x60;s going to be a lot lighter than you can see on the picture.</li>
            <li> Not a very bright color! Don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color.  It goes on evenly and 2 two coats for complete coverage.  It&#x27;s a very pale pink.  Just beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love this gelish color. really a nude pink looks very elegant. I highly recommend this so pretty.this as a french manicure is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> A little darker pink than expected but super cute and super durable polish. Love the soak off feature. Used with Gellish Basix and its still holding strong!</li>
            <li> Looks great true color</li>
            <li> it gives a nice shear coat which works good for a job you have that will not allow bright colors</li>
            <li> I am normally a dark polish wearing chic but I love this color for a break in between.  Also looks fantastic with a coat of \\&quot;June Bride\\&quot; layered over the top of it for some added bling.  Will be a great color for Spring as well!</li>
            <li> I love to have great looking nail but I do not want to keep paying for something that I have to keep getting fixed. I can do my own nail so this is while I added this product as an additional to my nail collection and I am so happy for this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I did not care for this product at all. Did not go on smoothly, chipped and peeled pretty badly. The consistency was overly thick as well.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the colour.</li>
            <li> I do not usually wear pastel colors on my nails. I usually opt for bright reds, corals, and sometimes a nude shade or hot pink. This probably was not a wise choice for a pale pink color, considering its so different from what I&#x27;m used to. I read the reviews, and thus I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this is baby girl pink. Kind of like a pale cotton candy pink, with no shimmer. Sure enough it&#x27;s opaque, which I thought I wanted, but with this color I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s such a little girl color in my opinion. I think I was hoping it would go on more sheer with less coats, but no. There is no applying this color in a sheer fashion, it would just look blotchy. It took 3 coats to get full coverage, which isn&#x27;t too bad for a pale color.&lt;br /&gt; My mistake is that I cut my nails off short before my manicure, because I thought it would be a bit more sheer and thus would look natural and trendy. But with the short nail it just makes me look like I&#x27;m trying to be a kid. It&#x27;s a youthful color, and I&#x27;m 30, so I&#x27;m not sure about it.&lt;br /&gt;It would look great on people with darker olive or bronze skin tones, but I naturally have ivory skin, so I&#x27;m not sure about the color.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a durable color because after a week and a half I had no chipping, perhaps just because I used 3 coats, along with Shellac base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I love everything I&#x27;ve bought from Gelish but this is disappointing.  After 3 coats of color it still looks streaky.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying to make it work because I like the color.  Maybe Vegas Nights on top will hide the streaks</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gelish color that would go nicely with a French manicure. I like the base color to be pale pink with white tips. I&#x27;ve tried the gelish little princess and although it looks ok, it wasn&#x27;t as pink as I had hoped. This color is exactly what I was looking for. At first, I thought it may have been a little too pink, but after all the nails were done and the white tips were on top, it all came out beautifully. There are streak marks, unless I do 3 coats. I&#x27;m not a professional and I think that it may be due to my technique and that professionals would have better luck with getting 1 or 2 coats streak-free. I think this color would look good by itself, too. It&#x27;s not too shimmery but it also doesn&#x27;t look flat. Overall, I would highly recommend for a French manicure, especially if you like the base to be more pink than transparent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife along with the [[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]] as a gift. The Basix kit works well, but this polish did not cover evenly even after two coats. She uses the Gelish \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; and \\&quot;Top It Off\\&quot;, but with other polish.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute perfect pink nail color out there! It is a pretty pastel pink but is not overwhelming. Perfect for every day wear. I even wear this color all winter long because it is clean looking, classy and timeless.</li>
            <li> Great polish pretty color I just started using the gel nail polish and wanted a collection of nice colors I love pink</li>
            <li> Love the color.  It is perfect and goes on nicely.  The gel stays on for a couple of weeks with out lifting or chipping.  The gel comes off easily with acetone.</li>
            <li> This color is a very subtle pink and is great if that is the color you are looking for.  I have been on the lookout for a very light pink for some time now - but this was a little darker than I had hoped.  That being said, I used a lighter color over the top and it turned out great.  It&#x27;s a great pink if you want a pink color.  I would recommend it for that!</li>
            <li> I hate the color, it is a pepto bismal pink, not what I thought the picture looked like. Otherwise I love gelish  polish.</li>
            <li> Cute color, great price. It&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re going to like the color since it&#x27;s not always accurate to what you see online but the fact that you&#x27;re paying about what it costs for the mini size in stores makes it worth the chance. Loved this one!</li>
            <li> The color is nice and looks exactly like a pink smoothie.  Its a very nice soft pink.  Great spring color.  I did have some rippling with application, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t deal with.  As with most of the lighter gellish colors, I noticed some cracking in the polish as it got older.  I typically keep my gel nails for 2 weeks with no issue but this color started to get some cracking and imperfection after about 9 or 10 days.  Still love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Color was nice but left little black bubbles. I have over 30 Gelish polishes but this one always leaves the black bubbles when I use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE gel polish! The color is awesome too! This stuff stays on for 10-14 days! Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost. It would cost me at least $30 at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the pink shades of nail polish. This color hits the spot. Not to pale yet not to intense. However, be warned that this color is hard to apply. If you do not put enough on it will be uneven. But if you put to much on it will be thick and uneven. This one will take lots of practice to get just right. Still a great color.</li>
            <li> The polish works fine but I hated the color. It&#x27;s icky pink... a bad mix of Pepto Bismol and Bubble gum pink. I do my gel nails at home and I generally use Harmony Gelish brand, but I do not like this color! I did one nail and then threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own french manicures and this is the best shade of pink for doing that!  I have my own system.  One extremely thin layer of the opaque polish, then the white tip, and then the opaque polish again to make the manicure appear a bit more natural.  I get tons of compliments whenever I do my french gelish manicure.  Just be sure to apply extra thin otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a big goopy mess.</li>
            <li> Love this color, but the consistency is a little on the runny side, so when you apply the polish it can leave streaks.  It&#x27;s not a shimmery pink, it looks just like a strawberry smoothie - thick pink.  So pretty!</li>
            <li> The color is much smoother in person than in the picture and bottle. My clients love this with a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Great color! Reminds me of a baby pink/soft bubble gum pink color. Looks good. Light enough to be neutral but pink enough to look great on toes in summer. Will be using more!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried several different gel polish but this is far better than any out there. plus, this comes in huge size. LUVE it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this color of the Gelish nail polish and she uses it on a very regular basis.  I would definitely recommend this color for anyone who likes a lighter pastel shade of pink and not the flaming bright pink colors.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice pale pink color.  It works well with the gelish mini set.  It is really girly with some sparkle over it.</li>
            <li> I knew i would love that color and everybody who see my nail gave me compliments. so LOVELY color!!  i will buy more colors now</li>
            <li> This color is so soft and subtle, makes us feel all innocent inside.  The most pale pink on the market I believe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty light pink.  Completely flat/opaque - no shimmer at all.  So, you need to put on at least three, if not four, coats before the streakiness goes away and the color smooths out.  So, between the base coat &amp; 3+ color coats &amp; top coat, I ended up with a lot of polish on my nails and it looked thick and unattractive.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of this specific brand of gel nail polish so I know my Gelish. This polish is terrible. The color is great, but the polish itself seems to be watered down or a fake brand in a Gelish bottle. Tried multiple times to use, finally threw it away. Do not use on clients - they will be very upset because it does not last.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT SEEMED USED AND DRY!!</li>
            <li> I wear this color all the time either as a bright summery color or (now that it&#x27;s winter) just as a base coat to paint over with regular polish to keep my nails strong. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a Gelish addict of 2 months. I do it myself at home. And am always looking to expand my color collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a neutral color with a little pink. I&#x27;m dark skinned and wasn&#x27;t sure what would look good on me in the Gelish line. But this is a pretty pale pink. Would look good on anyone. The pic I will try to post is w/ 2 coats. One coat would look good but you&#x27;d have to apply one cost carefully to avoid streaking. Ive been wearing this color for a week and have gotten 3 random compliments on the color fr other women. And hubby loves it.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by this color. I was dreading that it might look too baby pink, but instead it&#x27;s a subtle, modern pink, with a slight sheerness to it. Two coats for a more sheer look, three coats for a more opaque pink. It&#x27;s great for everyday use, but I can see wearing it for weddings, or for springtime.</li>
            <li> Better gel polist out there.  3 coats to get rid of opacity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, its a bubble pink and okay. It&#x27;s def a mild soft color, esp against my African American hands. I&#x27;ve only done it with 2 coats and it does appears a tad &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34;. Next time i&#x27;ll try 3 coats. I currently am wearing it with waterfield (4th finger accent) and have gotten tons of compliments :-)</li>
            <li> Very soft pale pink color.  Gelish is a very good brand of products. I am a glitter nut so I added Silver Sand on top.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty but just too light for me. True creamy pink  and not peachy. Plus it&#x27;s the larger .5oz size needs 2-3 coats for a streak free finish.</li>
            <li> The product worked well, but the color is less subtle than the picture.  Its a very heavy pastel pink, visualize the light pink crayon.  I&#x27;d have preferred it if it had a bit of sparkle or was more sheer.</li>
            <li> Package Came fast, color is perfect! Definitely worth the price. Planning on purchasing more colors to add to my collection!!!</li>
            <li> I love the pink color.  I am excited to use it.  It came quickly and the price was great. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little harder than some of my other colors to apply, maybe I just need three coats?  But it was really pretty once I got it on thin enough.</li>
            <li> Definitely a pretty color on fingers. No more nail salon for me. I&#x27;m so excited to purchase more colors. A must buy!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, fabulous for the summer, and it&#x27;s good qualify, it holds for a solid 3 weeks. The only thing, the color is tricky and will show imperfections, so you will need a good nail treatment .</li>
            <li> This was the first gelish polish I have used.  I love the color and it was easy to apply. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> this is a nice opaque pale pink color.  not frosted, shimmery or sheer.  3 coats for completely opaque look.  warning:  this is not a color for french manis -- the color is too dark for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell the actual color of each gelish nail polish but this color is just what I was looking for. Pink smoothie.. I would describe it more of strawberry yogurt. Light pastel pink</li>
            <li> Love the color. It&#x27;s exactly the shade I was going for. it&#x27;s a very light pastel color. I only am giving it 3 stars bc it was not curing very well and did not cover my nail well. The shade came out &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34; where I could still see some underneath color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this polish in conjuction with Gelish Basix Kit and an LED light I bought at the same time.  Everything is new so should work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish remains tacky, smudged, and the color did not evenly coat my nail.  Even after 2 coats, It still was not even shading.  I tried 3 coats on a couple nails and that helped the look but then it was a thick layer of polsih.  I even tried putting my polish in a warm bowl of water, which helped the consistency to be thiner and went on better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m happy to see that stores are starting to sell Gel polish, so the next day I bought different  color &amp; different brand from the store, and it worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 3 stars for the color, but lost 2 stars bc it didn&#x27;t evenly shade my nail.</li>
            <li> I think I received an old bottle, it seems like it&#x27;s separating and no matter how much I shake it, it doesn&#x27;t mix well. I love the color, but it&#x27;s extremely uneven and hard to work with. I haven&#x27;t used any other colors by this brand, so not sure if it&#x27;s them or just the one I got.</li>
