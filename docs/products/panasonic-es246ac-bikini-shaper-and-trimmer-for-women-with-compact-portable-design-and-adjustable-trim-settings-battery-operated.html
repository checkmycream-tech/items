            <li>Once I cleaned out, it worked great again.</li>

            <li>Reliable, great price, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Maybe people with skim and dainty pubic hair don&#x27;t need that kind of tool</li>
            <li>Used it and it felt awesome so better than a razor.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>I use the shaper and trimmer to help my wife look her best in today&#x27;s more revealing bathing suits.  </li>

            <li>but it works good for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li>this proved easier to maintain - and good cost savings too. .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bargain.  </li>
            <li>Did not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li>I could return this in good concious (after using it), I would -</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>A good deal for the product.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheap shaper and this one works real good</li>
            <li>This one is just as good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>Battery life is good too.</li>
            <li>Good size, doesn&#x27;t snag or pinch.</li>
            <li>It was a great price, keeps everything trimmed nicely.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a really good trimmer</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Shaper &amp; Trimmer is a good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s so good that I even recommended it to my cousin and anyone</li>
            <li>Does a good job of triming the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it died.</li>
            <li>The trimmer lasts a fair amount of time before needing the batteries to be replaced.</li>
            <li>If you want to split the difference between looking like you have not gone through puberty yet, and looking like a feral guinea pig, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, sturdy build.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for what it is.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I read the good reviews and purchased it.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped.......</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good price, but turns out I won&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i loved it..</li>
            <li>Noise level is good.</li>
            <li>Attractive color and nice weight.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it is going to be good.  </li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic trimmers before and they have always been good.</li>
            <li>Works good, though nicks sometimes.</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon and got it based on its good reviews.</li>
            <li>He loved it and couldn&#x27;t find another one to replace it.</li>
            <li>and you will have a good result.</li>
            <li>This did the trick and keeps everything at a good length.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a good quality trimmer but just doesn&#x27;t cut it in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li>but this is good for the price.</li>
            <li>thought it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>The good, it trims well and doesn&#x27;t catch the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The not so good:  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Was supposed to be good for the shower</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>one must perhaps need to go all winter without trimming the bikini area to get good use of it.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic bikini trimmer does a good job of taming the bush.  </li>
            <li>The power level is good.</li>
            <li>This worked good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I changed batteries and seemed to work good again.</li>
            <li>I like that it takes batteries, rather than rechargeable because I don&#x27;t have good luck with rechargeable gadgets.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is compact with surprising power for two AA batteries.</li>
            <li>I wish I could show you how good I look.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>This was a good shaver when it worked.</li>
            <li>Great for pubes, works nice without pulling or not trimming.</li>
            <li>Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that the length is adjustable and I can get a fairly close shave without having to worry about razor burn!</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who like 1 to 2 mm of beard vs clean shave.</li>
            <li>Works great, trims consistently, battery life is excellent!</li>
            <li>Works great, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in your hand, its easy to use, and best of all it&#x27;s afforable and it DOESN&#x27;T hurt like maybe a wax would.</li>
            <li>After most of the hair was gone I was easily able to trim the landing strip I leave to the perfect manicured length.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for when your man is coming over and you need to get cleaned up quickly.</li>
            <li>For a pregnant person this is the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its function, size, and portability.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; trimmer, and it works great for my girlfriend, but I use it too, and we both love it.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with that and was able to see then</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very safe trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love it, great product for my needs.</li>
            <li>works great, love this shaver..</li>
            <li>tidy seems like a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Safe, easy to use and works brilliantly!</li>
            <li>And this product is no way perfect (like the rather loud motor noise), but for the price this is great and I have nothing to complain.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is the most well-made trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>But boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>This was outstanding!</li>
            <li>When I first got this bikini shaper it was great!</li>
            <li>Pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is sure to keep your lower pubic area neat and tidy!</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>And I know my partner is glad I stopped stealing his electric razor for the job!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic trimmer is absolutely excellent and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If you want to just trim some hair, be sure not to put in on closest shave!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this machine!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>The first one that we purchased, was bought over five years ago and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this bikini trimmer!</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>What I like most about this shaver is it does not cut me!</li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with it anymore!</li>
            <li>Great product, works well and is easy to use.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It works well, but it&#x27;s not some amazing thing that will change your life.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>used with baby powder as recommended by another review and worked amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing works amazingly.</li>
            <li>an amazing trimmer..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>But i gritted my teeth and started in -- it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This shaver has amazing reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, uses AA batteries, does a great job, and is compact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s cordless, it trims, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely.</li>
            <li>Well, I can honestly say after doing MUCH research within the \\&quot;bikini hair-removing\\&quot; area, this was the best thing I could have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, until it broke now.</li>
            <li>It does not come with a case, so buy your own (I got a pencil case from Target for it).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just kind of clunky to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kind of have the OCD to cleanliness.</li>
            <li>I want to add my enthusiastic review to the chorus.</li>
            <li>nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>This product is very well designed, and at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>Being battery-operated was nice, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush it comes with is handy.  </li>
            <li>Nice for trimming the bikini area without shaving too closely to cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Nice power.</li>
            <li>Nice product that works well.  </li>
            <li>This shaper/trimmer is a nice tool to use to keep things tidy.</li>
            <li>and I can do it without thinking or honestly without even looking.</li>
            <li>but I like to keep my area nice and neat</li>
            <li>From the cheapest to the kind that&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the guard, but it is a nice option to have if you needed it.</li>
            <li>My husband bought some Gillette razor before I got him his own.  </li>
            <li>excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li>The wireless/battery situation is also nice.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer when it works.</li>
            <li>nice but</li>
            <li>Gets everything trimmed up and tidy</li>
            <li>Far superior to the Philips HP6376/10 Philips Bikini Perfect.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a nice ballsack trimming device</li>
            <li>The adjustable head is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>You basically have to pre-trim before using this vibrator thing to tidy up.  </li>
            <li>the built-in adjustable guide is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I got this trimmer because nothing makes you feel sexier than your husband lovingly telling you, &amp;#34;nice thigh-brows, honey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very durable and excellent battery life.</li>
            <li>i just use it to keep my lady parts tidy in-between waxes.  </li>
            <li>It &#x27;ll help to keep you nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Now it will be a pleasure instead of a chore to keep the bikini area neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice close trim without the itch.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that needs an efficient and an effective way to maintain their bikini area but is not looking for a hairless result.</li>
            <li>This shaver has came handy to do touchups on my husband&#x27;s haircut when in a pinch for time..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Trims nicely and evenly.  </li>
            <li>This product very very nice .. smooth ship ..</li>
            <li>The trimmer worth purchasing!!!</li>
            <li>I use it about 2x per month, and take care to oil and clean it after each use, but it has been great.</li>
            <li>Great to use as a clean up beforehand tool.</li>
            <li>My problem was that I was not using it as directed, and also although they did specify a particular direction to cut in, I found best results going in every direction imaginable.</li>

            <li>other Panasonic shaver has been working great for over 12 years and my Panasonic cordless drills have been working great for over 20 years!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome machine, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, and does exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Works great, and I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, very quick and easy to get a neat bikini line.</li>
            <li>but I must say a very good Trimmer cuts very close)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great, economical option for me.</li>
            <li>By far the best bikini trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It worked okay when it worked, but was nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>and i love the neat and tidy results.</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be honest, on some more</li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer I (as well as my husband) have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I had that for two years before it just wasn&#x27;t suitable to use in the shower anymore.</li>
            <li>very convenient, incredibly inexpensive for the performance, has continued to cut well for months, and it looks like replacement blades are affordable.</li>
            <li>Perfect for what I wanted so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a frequent trimmer and you need a perfect trim throughout</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, but after shopping around, I picked the Panasonic since it was good value and seemed to have a good reputation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and painless!</li>
            <li>so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong after a year or so!</li>
            <li>Made tidy work of all excess hair on both of us and made for a fun foreplay activity exploring the nether regions!!</li>
            <li>The two occasions it worked, it was a great product-very fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later, I&#x27;m happy to say that this trimmer works great.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Gives a good clean, sparse look on the shortest trim level.</li>
            <li>and i actually liked how it looked -- sooooo much neater -- and i was happy with it then.  </li>
            <li>But since it was very handy and convenient I ordered another one and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly as the packaging says; it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great, but if you don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; of post trimming, then it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li>Great product, cuts evenly, yet gently!  </li>
            <li>Love this so much so easy !</li>
            <li>But it still works fine and never missed a beat!</li>
            <li>Ok so...most people have very fine, sparse hair..</li>
            <li>And the guard is on the head very securely so I don&#x27;t worry about any slips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap, you have to squeeze each side of the end piece to adjust it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, it works on batteries</li>
            <li>but this was very cheap.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to be made of very cheap material.</li>
            <li>It is very light to hold and contained all parts I paid for.</li>
            <li>This didnt give me any razor bumps and came out very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The size is great, love the guard, and it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it takes batteries instead of having to plug it in to charge, and the adjustable guard is handy &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to use, gets the job done and leaves everything nice and neat.</li>
            <li>the guard comes off for easy cleaning, and it&#x27;s effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li>so the power is much better - it has a nice ,sleek shape and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works very smooth and felt really safe.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, does exactly what it is supposed to do: provide a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li>A huge relief when it comes to wearing swimsuits!</li>
            <li>Would not pay more than $10.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the one redeeming quality the trimmer has is that it did not give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lil device and bought extras for my daughters.</li>
            <li>so it is much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit more power</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a trimmer :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Nothing works better .</li>
            <li>I wish more items would be sold like this.</li>
            <li>I hope they never change this product - best personal shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Maybe a more streamlined shape and not so square an end would be better.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>You can take the guard off so it trims close, and use the guard to trim hair to the appropriate length.</li>
            <li>Powered through pretty successfully.</li>
            <li>Make sure you register the product so you can use the warranty.</li>
            <li>so it cuts more at once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 5 different types of trimmers over the years and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I remove the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch.  </li>
            <li>Highly satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it works</li>
            <li>I love the price for it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Works FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you get batteries ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Trust me buy it and you will love it</li>
            <li>The plastic needs to be more \\&quot;anti-stat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all-around great product.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>After about 30 minutes without the guard on and also shaving with cream and a razor, my overgrown bush now had become mostly smooth(with some prickly spots).</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love how you can adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this item.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just received it and tried it out and am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this product to anyone who is timid to blades around there pubic area.</li>
            <li>A LOT better on my areas</li>
            <li>I should have paid more money and bought a chargable type.</li>
            <li>I like the wahl much better, but I already bought this one.</li>
            <li>Stores seems better for some stuff.</li>
            <li>Now bump and irritation free!</li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li>I have used it several times already, and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Ok guys, don&#x27;t get in a snit,  but yes I use this bikini shaver for my mustache and sideburns,  </li>
            <li>can I say, but this is one of my better buys</li>
            <li>pulls hair sometimes and does a ok trim, i don&#x27;t see how it being heated enhances it, i wish it won&#x27;t snag hair</li>
            <li>and she was satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>In love.</li>
            <li>But it sure does work.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this compared to the Braun Bikini Shaver.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic has more length settings to choose from and it&#x27;s made in Japan.  </li>
            <li>Better quality in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Also great for women who want to keep a gentle length and do not like the pro look.</li>
            <li>I somehow even managed to make myself bleed on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it ladies, we&#x27;ve all stared at our area helplessly with a pair of scissors in our hands, hoping something better would come along.</li>
            <li>If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion.</li>
            <li>You can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  </li>
            <li>plus is that it comes with a form showing you how you can order more parts if you need to.</li>
            <li>The top is adjustable and can come off for shaping up the edges</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this trimmer WHILE it worked</li>
            <li>I do, however, shave the bikini line and the area &amp;#34;that matters&amp;#34;, but up top, I use this on 1</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more?</li>
            <li>these are the better ones out there in the market.</li>
            <li>this is definitely better.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This baby performs better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also appropriate for bikini season.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite trimmer still.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>wife has used it and likes the product says it is better than anything else she has used.</li>
            <li>I used another brand for many years without any problems.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>, I will agree that this doesn&#x27;t give you the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; look, but it sure gets close.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, to clean, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for friends.</li>
            <li>but this could have been much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It trims better than a lot of trimmers that I have used.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Feeling safe while grooming in this area has never happened until I got this trimmer.</li>
            <li>but I make sure I don&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>There are better choices.</li>
            <li>Works great, very convenient</li>
            <li>I love being able to change batteries myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>, i used it many times with no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple years and use it more in the spring/summer as one would expect.</li>
            <li>This shaver was perfect, it doesn&#x27;t nick me, because since I can&#x27;t see, I am just moving it back and forth.</li>
            <li>I am even able to take the guards off.</li>
            <li>I just think that should have more attachments to adjust but for what I need is Ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>after buying i&#x27;m 100% sure to recommend this product to all..</li>
            <li>This is an OK trimmer.</li>
            <li>is a grand fiasco of foliculitis.  </li>
            <li>yeah, this is definitely the best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I had mine set at about 2 and trimmed off more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>But yeah, I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Two, I like to shave my bikini area more like a Brazilian type shave than just a bikini line.</li>
            <li>you for your answers! :3</li>
            <li>I definately recomend this product and have a feeling my husband might be borrowing it. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t detect any heat from it, nor am I sure why you would want a heated bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is perfect for keeping things properly groomed without razor burn.</li>
            <li>it is that safe.</li>
            <li>After fighting shaving bumps for most of my life, I took the advice of my boyfriend and bought a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was iffy about getting this, as I was not to sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it before a trip that involved bathing suits and at 6 months I could not see below my tummy.  </li>
            <li>i felt safe using it.  </li>
            <li>I will be using it more and have already recommended it to my sister.</li>
            <li>Great purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The guards on it make sure that you won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the Clio</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love using it to trim my down-there.</li>
            <li>and it broke after I dropped it one too many times.</li>
            <li>I also love the that it is battery operated and does not use ac charger.</li>
            <li>I wont go into detail, but it does work well :)</li>
            <li>The Braun is excellent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and I highly recommend it for both men and women!</li>
            <li>Much better than getting razor burn.</li>
            <li>We have used so many different brands, types and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, my husband loves this thing.</li>
            <li>But it got lost during my latest move, so</li>
            <li>Love that the attachment can be removed to use alone.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Battery operation MUCH more convenient than plug-in&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>I love this product , it is all I am going to use from now on.</li>
            <li>The trimmer attachment on my husbands electric razor works 10 times better.</li>
            <li>Really does great work on the legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li>One of the better ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li>There are probably better ones out there</li>
            <li>It was working ok for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>Removed guard for most of my shaving.</li>
            <li>I like it much better then trying to cut with scissors or using a razor.  </li>
            <li>The guard also has nice smooth corners and doesn&#x27;t snag on looser skin.</li>
            <li>SURE NOT TO USE IT IN OR AROUND WATER BECAUSE IT WILL KILL THE MOTOR.</li>
            <li>Hair clings to the plastic by static electricity.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more durable.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries in it, and even when they are fully charged this trimmer has started making more noise than it once did and seems like it&#x27;s struggling a bit more.</li>
            <li>Otherwise though, I love it.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t obtain it (safely).</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Shaving my bikini area seems more like torture...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am not 100% satisfied because it doesn&#x27;t do the job neatly.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I have had many bikini trimmers.</li>
            <li>more run-time:&lt;br /&gt;Battery</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it but it will have to be more often.</li>
            <li>It is simple to operate and serves its purpose perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love this item..</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could tell you how wonderful this product is, especially since Dr. Oz himself recommended the thing on a show.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>and before I knew it, hair was trimmed low perfectly.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have stated, the guard is adjustable (or even removable, if need be).  </li>
            <li>Not that much better than the $10 bikini trimmers.</li>
            <li>and I used the lowest guard setting to trimmer the most of it.</li>
            <li>: )</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean, the battery life seems good, its an appropriate size/weight and seems like a quality machine.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has lasted me many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works great and is very powerful compared to the kind I used to use and a much wider top</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its supposed to do... TRIM!!!</li>
            <li>you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>So far so good with this trimmer for taking care of the bikini area!</li>
            <li>you get a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming and even does a decent job shaving.    </li>
            <li>fabulous product, very easy to use</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li>Love this easy to use and safe.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very light.  </li>
            <li>Used it to shave my head, very smooth shave and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review products but am so happy with this product that I felt compelled to do so.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer in January 2010 and loved it the from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s been working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I was on the search for a good trimmer and this one works very well!</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday and just as good as the first one.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good for a battery-operated trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I guess 2 years is a pretty good run nowadays.  </li>
            <li>I got mine a long time ago and it is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Trims perfectly and lasts a long time even with Alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li>Has lasted me a while on its first batteries with biweekly use and good maintenance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect little handy device.</li>
            <li>and it DEFINITELY isn&#x27;t worth the price!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 3 years now, and the original batteries still work!</li>
            <li>I love the attachment and this is so easy to use since it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
            <li>Easy, fool proof, and safe.</li>
            <li>Safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is really easy too use, and it doesn&#x27;t have too many features.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was able to get everything trimmed fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The top comes off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best bilkini trimmer available.  </li>
            <li>The guard is good with the different levels for length and the battery life is also good.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from the Panasonic brand, which is normally superb, and this isn&#x27;t the cheapest trimmer out there.</li>
            <li>Honestly I had low expectations when I ordered the product, but with all the great reviews this Panasonic trimmer has received I figured what the heck</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and nice range of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li>so easy to get a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>dont like being clean shaven because that region develops ingrown VERY easily for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean, as well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re patient you could cut your own hair and save the money on the very first use,&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and its nice that I can set the length for a closer or set trim.</li>
            <li>As is the description, doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave because it is a trimmer, but definitely does an excellent job as a trimmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it worked perfectly, it wasnt a totally clean close shave, but if it was you&#x27;d risk ingrown hairs and this removes the risk entirely!</li>
            <li>It does a very good, even job and has 5 different settings so that you can have the hair length you prefer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better option than shaving, but it won&#x27;t do 100% smooth shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size - slim and light, feels good in the hand, not too loud.  </li>
            <li>Great for decreasing thickness and maintaining hair without getting rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This bikini shaper has been great so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this would be ok for touching up, but I won&#x27;t be using it when I need to get the full \\&quot;haircut\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it works great so far.  </li>
            <li>I would use it for trimming and touching up, not for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and so far she says it works great.</li>
            <li>Perfect length and not too rough.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old Panasonic trimmer that worked great for years.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap bikini razor for years that worked much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I was like, how come so many people thought this was fantastic</li>
            <li>This works great for potentially sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It does sound like a vibrator, but honestly there are so many workarounds for problems like that that it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>with a hand mirror available, and without a top on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a product like this before, so I can&#x27;t really provide a good review here without something to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done without leaving any nicks or cuts, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on contours.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something good and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, and for the price it is definitely a good buy if you don&#x27;t care too much about length, because, in my experience, adjusting the head for trimming doesn&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the largest/longest trimmer head would be good for thinning but all the heads are really shavers...</li>
            <li>But good stainless steel trimmer.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is great to use as a moisturizer afterward, 100% natural and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, quick and easy!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for keeping things tidy down there, it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>really could not be more satisfied with this purchase!  </li>
            <li>Probably the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Super easy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer, does the job wonderfully and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Having used other body hair trimmers and razors, I can say at this price point, this is the best.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really easy to use</li>
            <li>The trim settings are easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Made my life easy.</li>
            <li>The easy to clean design makes it even better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not meant to be used with the plastic head and does easily pull/cut at the skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Who knew bikini line maintenance could be this easy?</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and painfree.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works fantastically with the guard head on, trims easily without snagging.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as easily and</li>
            <li>Easy to store and would be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li>and it cleans so easily</li>
            <li>My sideburns grow very quickly and curl out so that I look like I have wings, set this at number two and with one swipe makes them look as if I just came from a barber shop.  </li>
            <li>But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Just take it easy around your bits.  </li>
            <li>The shape makes it easy to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easier to store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works really well to keep everything nice and neat :-)  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, just slide the switch.</li>
            <li>Easy to change comb length.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The upside is it&#x27;s not a noticeable bruise, so still more attractive than red bumps on porcelain skin!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have had this since 2005, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this five years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver that is very comfortable in the hand and shaves nice and close without nicking .</li>
            <li>It works ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This works great as a ladies personal trimmer, no nicks, good speed and easy to use, but it really didn&#x27;t trim as close as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend happily bought this for me, upon request, when I decided I wanted to try going bare.</li>
            <li>In general, a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall a great trimmer if you not worrying about nicks is the most important thing you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good product due to the \\&quot;Good Housekeeping\\&quot; seal of approval.  </li>
            <li>This allows me an tidy look which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m trimming down there, I want to be using the best and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I have used it for over a year now and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li>It works fine but for some reason the shape and design just feels clunky to me.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li>An inexpensive trimmer that does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I used it once, and the battery power was fine.  </li>
            <li>The product lives up to its description and does a fine job of that.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and a  extremely light weight.</li>
            <li>That being said, this thing works for my mankini area just fine, but be forewarned: it&#x27;s no industrial strength weed eater.</li>
            <li>so i could use another shaver for fine tuning.</li>
            <li>But i decided 1/2 inch was fine</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to use.</li>
            <li>For women, or men, out there who want their hair finely trimmed, leaving the guard on defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>very quick, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as a cheap plugin trimmer I have, but still works well.</li>
            <li>I am super pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean out afterwards.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was easy to assemble and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful motor, SAFE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, etc.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li>However FABULOUS for keeping things clean &amp; super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Makes everything very easy and fast!  </li>
            <li>If you like a little \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming, this is definitely a great buy!  </li>
            <li>This little shaver is a wonderful (and under budget!)</li>
            <li>This little thing is perfect.</li>
            <li>This little diddy is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>this is the perfect little tool.  </li>
            <li>This little machine is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>This particular razor was great for the first 3 uses.</li>
            <li>great little trimmer... gives a nice close finish without pulling or pain.</li>
            <li>It work great and the best part for me it shaves as close as I like without leaving bumps or cutting myself as would happen with a razor.</li>
            <li>There is one HUGE CON -</li>
            <li>This trimmer is comfortable to hold, which is important for those of us with carpal tunnel syndrome, and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hairy at all, so I didn&#x27;t think I needed something that was huge and rechargeable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth pubic area, this is not for you, because it doesn&#x27;t get razor close.  </li>
            <li>Simple design, no flash and a great product.</li>
            <li>works great for men&#x27;s private areas, too!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get a smooth shave, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>It is simply a trimmer that is great for maintenance.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cut my skin (unlike a horrid Remington one I had), it gave me a close trimming, and I could clean it easily.</li>
            <li>Was it perfectly smooth?</li>
            <li>so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be a smooth shave, but I was hoping it would leave stubble, and not just shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, but I have to clean it twice during each use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in your hand and the trimmer guide works well.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer from Amazon in 2002 and have happily used it until it just decided to die on me recently.</li>
            <li>This was very helpful in keeping things neat in between many MANY doctor visits and huge for money saving when Bliss charges $70 and up for a wax</li>
            <li>I bought this product after comparing similar items and reading reviews and this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I put some baby powder on my skin before using this and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>it is worth of its cost.i love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Great price since I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It does not pull hair, is ouchless and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And,,, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer, though I really wish it was waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well on cheap batteries.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They work great also but it takes forever and they rust if you do not care for them properly.</li>
            <li>I was justified in my purchase.  </li>
            <li>It was also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I like the look of this trimmer, very sleek and has nice grips to hold it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like to razor shave it smooth.</li>
            <li>No, you will not be smooth.</li>
            <li>This product works great and the batteries last for ages.</li>
            <li>it shaves close, easy to clean and no hair bumps.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it won&#x27;t get you totally smooth or bald.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more fun if you have your partner help.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is the best trimmer I have used, and I have used quite a few.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, very sturdy and performs nicely.</li>
            <li>It gets as close as I like and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great to just trim the downstairs especially for the summer. ^_^</li>
            <li>Will it remove all of the hair leaving you porn star smooth?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at taming the forest when it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim very well and it kind of hurts or tugs at the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is quite, trims well with no pulling or irritation, and is easy to clean.</li>

            <li>great product at a great price- not like the cheap pencil thin $7 ones</li>
            <li>But I liked it so much that I purchased another one.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great concept but defiantly on the pricey side especially when it snags and pull hair!</li>
            <li>Do not speak smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great for occasional use.</li>
            <li>Works really great, the adjustable guard makes it so you can trim up howver short</li>

            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a day, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice, very well trimmed and groomed areas.</li>
            <li>If you want to go completely smooth, then you will need to wax.</li>
            <li>Was easy to put together for use and clean.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But this is fantastic, none of those issues (of course this doesn&#x27;t shave, just trim)</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maneuver.</li>
            <li>so far....I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It does not give you a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was initially scared to use this, but after reading the reviews, I was like &amp;#34;oh, I can do this too!&amp;#34; I was able to neatly trim it rather quickly...and nicely, I might add :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth knowing. :)</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to something buzzing between my legs, I&#x27;m quite comfortable with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its cheap and for reason.</li>
            <li>Batterie powered so you can take them in the shower (without the water running) for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of trimming to the same length.  </li>
            <li>it really is the next best thing to shaving.</li>
            <li>The guard does a good job at keeping area trimmed short and safe from nicks.</li>
            <li>Trimming action is good for the price we pay.</li>
            <li>I was then able to use another shaver for a clean look for a quick vacation at the beach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome two double A batteries and its ready to rock...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this awesome trimmer at least 20 times (too many to count)</li>
            <li>Works good so far.  </li>
            <li>good, solid product and made in Japan  :-)  </li>
            <li>So far, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>this is a very gud trimmer, very easy to use and since it is a trimmer, not a shaver,results are fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product because its the right size and doesn&#x27;t cut you or grab at you like others do.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t experienced any pulling while the different settings work well and gives a clean and precise shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>pulling at my hairs and just generally not doing a great job of trimming.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for getting a nice close shave without the razor burn I normally experience from a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Very easy and safe to use, i agree with other review every lady should own one of this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite know why the product is labeled &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; since it clearly is not.&lt;br /&gt;However, I love the product and it feels safe and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes it quick and easy to take care of the lady business.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to the extent</li>
            <li>You will not get a quick, easy once-over trim with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is quick, easy, painless, since it doesn&#x27;t catch the skin and is something I wished I had purchased years ago.  </li>
            <li>And its super easy as its battery operated.</li>
            <li>Works as described and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and quickly to use.</li>
            <li>Zero pulling, zero room for error, quick, easy, lifesaver.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It the perfect size, not too large, but big enough that I covers good &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; while shaving.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and very affective, at keeping the nether regions well groomed.</li>
            <li>A great tool, especially while pregnant.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>Trims real close quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller, good quality, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is so easy, fast, and safe to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my original one broke after years of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great, and it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li>Great as long as you use the guard.</li>
            <li>Avoiding debilitating razor burn is worth it!</li>
            <li>I usually have the best luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>, IT IS SO EASY FAST CLEAN AND NEAT,, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver so much that I had to write a review!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more consistent and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li>A very safe way to trim a sensitive area.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure everyone shaves their vag in the shower.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty close, which I&#x27;m glad to see.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So worth buying!  </li>
            <li>It makes a sound like &amp;#34;i will rip your skin off moahha&amp;#34; but it is really not painful at all.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and was soo excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>its small, no cord, and works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a long time now, and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, light and shaves just the right length.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, though, those issues are very minor, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t as clean and snappy of a job as I thought it would be,</li>
            <li>I wish it were waterproof though.... that would make clean up easier.</li>
            <li>I can stay and feel clean using this product alone.</li>
            <li>Gentle, efficient, and really makes the region look good.</li>
            <li>My super calloused feet are now smooth.</li>
            <li>No wonder why this is one of the most popular personal trimmers that I have researched online.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Clean Cut</li>
            <li>do go ahead and clean the blades, yes</li>
            <li>Keeps me neat and clean.</li>
            <li>Helps me feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is not a razor so do not expect to be completely clean shaven.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I tried taking it apart to clean it out and broke it, so I&#x27;d not recommend that.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; trim.  </li>
            <li>However, if you just want to clean up your areas and keep it neat</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect it to clean off everything.</li>
            <li>If you dont want a complete bald shave and want to trim the pubic area as close as possible this is perfect.</li>
            <li>but it will clean up the area for waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>so how are you supposed to clean it after you use it?</li>
            <li>Just try to keep water out of the inside and if it does happen or fills with hair, just clean it out.</li>
            <li>and that would be pretty dang exciting... and more ecological and economical for me, too!</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m loving being so neat -- and am not missing the experience or the price of getting waxed!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and works very well for multiple trim levels even very short not quit shaven smoot, but good.</li>
            <li>SO happy to have finally find this product, tried others but they just weren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Great little hair trimmer, light, easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, very precise and seems quite safe.&lt;br /&gt;There are different options about hair</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use though you have to make the hair stand up right under the blade for it to cut.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, trims just right amount.</li>
            <li>but I think for the price having working fine for 5 years is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliating, lotions, special shaving cream, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to clean</li>
            <li>Up until it got wet, it did a great job as a grooming aid</li>
            <li>The adjustable attachment for the blade is a nice feature and lets you control exactly how much you want to remove.  </li>
            <li>personally was hoping it&#x27;d mimic the results of shaving, so I took off the guard head and used it that way and surprisingly</li>
            <li>It arrived early which is always nice.</li>
            <li>Good, basic, durable.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and so far it is still working after six months.</li>
            <li>Use clipper disinfecting spray like Andis Cool Care Plus after using.</li>
            <li>I just won&#x27;t be able to give you much advise as mine didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that the product actually met my expectations!  </li>
            <li>Okay I really don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but I was compelled to write this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this, not expecting much, but BOY am I glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Solid construction good color.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you lose that top part or drop it and accidentally step on it or something, you&#x27;re gonna wanna replace just that part instead of the whole trimmer.</li>
            <li>But is does trim close enough to give you a good alternative rather than shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li>The reviews turned out to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for more than a year on one set of batteries and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>If you put this on the closest shave, you will get just about as good as a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for a full shave.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have loved if they added is a storing case.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a workhorse or a full shave.</li>
            <li>Returned for full refund.  </li>
            <li>Might be good if it had actually worked longer.  </li>
            <li>This works really quickly and cleanly for maintenance grooming.</li>
            <li>Also quick to clean.</li>
            <li>It cuts just close enough and all at a good price.</li>
            <li>t works very well and has battery power for or more shaves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely painful</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe what a quick and clean job it did.  </li>
            <li>This bikini trimmer does a good job overall.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the free shipping.</li>
            <li>it takes a really long time and a lot of your own added coercion for it to pick up most of your hairs to pull them into its blades.</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews for this product before I bought it and most were positive and the price was decent</li>
            <li>I love this very much and it is very gentle</li>
            <li>Powerful, consistent, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up (to my knowledge), but other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li>I want it but other than that it&#x27;s great, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I CANT LIVE WITHOUT THIS TRIMMER! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The first time it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>i can quickly trim unwanted hair all over.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get a super close shave</li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t seen many similar products (most are razors, not adjustable trimmers), I decided to try and replace the one I already had.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to ANY pregnant woman.  </li>
            <li>Nice design, great user experience, but poor quality.</li>
            <li>Arrived super quickly too.</li>
            <li>As a longtime shaver and waxer, I switched to trimming when I became pregnant and could no longer see.</li>
            <li>this device works quickly , painlessly and  does just what you want it to do-cleans up the area so that you won&#x27;t be embarrassed by unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and bought this machine to avoid waxing at the time.</li>
            <li>Although that was great for the nooks and crannies, I much prefer the size of this one for regular maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a perfect trimmer though, especially for the bikini area that shaves closer without occasional nicks or cuts.   </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product is as advertised.</li>
            <li>it does get super close to the skin, though.  </li>
            <li>It trimmed very well and is easy to clean it too.</li>
            <li>Hygienic and QUICK.</li>
            <li>(When you&#x27;re 6 months pregnant, out of sight is out of mind).</li>
            <li>Product as described, quick shipping to NZ.</li>
            <li>I bought it when I was pregnant</li>
            <li>For those looking to get super close</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a combo with a razor), but they always died out quickly</li>
            <li>sometimes I&#x27;ll need to use a comb to stand the hair up quickly followed by the trimmer.</li>
            <li>You could go completely bare by going over that with a razor, but this looks pretty good in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This got pretty good reviews, better than other shavers, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, love the different lengths to choose from, love the narrow size for good angling to get that bikini weather short trim!!</li>
            <li>Love this product: small, cute and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good little beast, definitely would recommend for lighter use than what we put it through though lol</li>
            <li>My request to man or female purchase this product .. 5 stars really its very nice</li>
            <li>The clipper (Definately not a shaver) does a great job, but the batteries wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and gets a good trim down.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful little trimmer that I have found to be very useful - it doesn&#x27;t cut too close (nor does it completely clear all hair), but it does just what it is supposed to (which is trim hair).  </li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Its a smooth ride ;)</li>
            <li>Compared to other trimmers I have owned, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to use on even the most private areas and to keep clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very safe, so you can use close to the very private areas.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased</li>
            <li>Everything was nice, neat, and barely there.</li>
            <li>but I definitely liked my other trimmer better.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it won&#x27;t give you a completely smooth shave, but if you just want to trim this product is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>this is great for keeping things down there under control.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and is not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and more durable than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I love using my new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great, just as expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>easy to use, very functional.</li>
            <li>Makes trimming fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>although there are plenty of good reviwes for this item ( and that was the reason I have orderd this) but it cut my skin every single time that i used it.</li>
            <li>After having looked for years to something like this, I bought it to dity up and it is absolutely fab!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>this your first time?&amp;#34; - Ha!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li>Only thing that could make it better would be if it was water resistant!</li>
            <li>After reading all other reviews and after trying it for myself, I can honestly say EVERYONE IS 100% CORRECT!</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, too!!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li>Worked exactly like I&#x27;d hoped it would!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to take apart for cleaning, and it&#x27;s pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>This trimmer, as a trimmer, is fantastic it has lasted for about year so far is still running strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, I love that it has the different settings.</li>
            <li>I like that it has multiple lengths, and it is also very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>You get a clean, even trim, so much easier than what it used to be!</li>
            <li>I clean the head thoroughly between uses with either hot soapy water or just pouring alcohol on the trimmer head and the shaver.</li>
            <li>This does the job just fine, but you have to remove the guard to get any real work done.</li>
            <li>I want more power, so I&#x27;ll buy a second one, but if you want mild trimming, this product is good enough.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got this great little number system by the way,</li>
            <li>Love the little brush that comes with it that helps keep it tidy.</li>
            <li>This little thing is way more effective and reliable than my rechargeable trimmers were.  </li>
            <li>Great for expecting mothers or anyone whose had a mishap using scissors down there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing you could use it for other areas of the body, like trimming sideburns or neck hair, if you wanted to, making it versatile, cheap, quick and effective.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product so much quicker then shaving.</li>
            <li>Very close and precise shave or adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>If you are anti apilator and waxing, this trimmer is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Have used this handy contraption several times since purchase and no complaints.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This one is powerful and it seems durable.</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>In all seriousness though, having used it twice at this point, it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>good design, simple and work very well.</li>
            <li>I can use it without worrying about hairs being pulled or skin being caught even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I liked what it did the one and only time it worked, though!</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Useful for keep you fresh for the week.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies, but this product is gentle and effective for the bikini line.</li>
            <li>Its also fun to take in who&#x27;s turn is it to get pampered.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re left to figure out on your own how to get them in there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ditched my old one and got this one.</li>
            <li>Over the years, in search for perfect shaving, ~$4000 spent in experimenting; only Panasonic shavers came close to DE razors for acceptable results.</li>
            <li>and I thought maybe something with a  smaller head would be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is so much better than my old trimmer, a Remington rechargable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take the bulk off the fur off, especially if I intend on shaving smooth later.</li>
            <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t uber sensitive, maybe you will have better luck, but I won&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>The shaper and trimmer is a simple, yet effective design.</li>
            <li>So useful (I don&#x27;t know how I survived before this thing).</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush is a nice accessory as it helps get the tiny hairs out of the blades.</li>
            <li>Not so fun when you&#x27;re trimming your pubic area.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have any tools to put in or take off and that it is especially designed for bikini hair.</li>
            <li>One, It looks like a really nice trimmer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>so I decided to go more natural.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products like this one and the Panasonic is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Now my wife can keep her enormous bush nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li>For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong motor - decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update August 2013: bought a replacement because the razor seemed to be dulling, was taking quite a bit longer to get the same results, kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>I agree with others that a case/bag would be nice, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got more power than my old trimmers and because of the design</li>
            <li>I like to keep as neat and tidy as possible.  </li>
            <li>As many others have noted, this is *not* going to give you the amazingly soft, post-professional wax feel.  </li>
            <li>It requires batteries which is nice because you can take it anywhere without a plug yanking you back.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Like most or all of the other reviewers, I love this.</li>
            <li>So many other better products on the market.</li>
            <li>I though not 100% safe trimming but much better than other ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The more pregnant I got, the less I was able to...uh...see things...</li>
            <li>My first one and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Gets you nice and clean with minimal irritation and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I know its not really meant to give you a nice clean close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fast and easy and great for my sensitive skin that would always get red and bumpy after shaving with a normal razor.</li>
            <li>I got it after reading all the other reviews and I have to agree with everyone about how good a trimmmer it is.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the how close the blade gets to the skin, it would be nice to get a really close clip, but the 1/4&amp;#34; is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was more than pleasantly surprised to try this product and take advantage of how unbelievably easy and smooth this trimmer makes the entire process (as well as the end result).  </li>
            <li>This product is high-quality and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price was right and does the job.</li>
            <li>The shaver didn&#x27;t pull at my skin -- you have to hold it right</li>
            <li>This shaver is just the right size for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I just received it today and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a bunch of money for those trimmers where you switch combs, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The adjustment setting are just right.</li>
            <li>Except I end up nicking myself every time if I don&#x27;t put it against the skin at the right angle.</li>
            <li>She is right.</li>
            <li>they were right.</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>So I couldn&#x27;t use this right away because I had to buy Batteries (btw, you need batteries for this...)</li>
            <li>gone through a bunch to find the right one.</li>
            <li>Also, I should note that as someone who has sensitive skin, I was able to get a pretty darn close shave without any razor burn, rashes, or ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li>For lazy days, remove the top cap and it becomes nice shaver that gives the looks of one-day shave.</li>
            <li>I suffer from terrible razor burn and ingrown hair after shaving, so this has been a pleasant and welcome relief to keeping my bikini area tidy.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I really couldn&#x27;t find anything to clean up the area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to clean and keep from getting clogged.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer!</li>
            <li>A great little trimmer that will work for anyone&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li>Worth the money, works great, have multiple razor level options (0 to 5), small and light weight, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Works great, may buy a second one for my guy so he can clean up if he wants, it has different settings on the guard that are all useful</li>
            <li>(My previous trimmer had cost 1/4 as much and lasted 15 years -- and worked great.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get through a whole shave with out having to stop and allow it to cool.</li>
            <li>There must be a pretty good little motor inside, because it does the job quickly and well, just as advertised.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product, trims hair down there no problem.</li>
            <li>but suffice to say this little guy keeps you nice and neat...and no annoying cords get in the way.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>and Panasonic wants to charge you more than the original cost of the entire set....</li>
            <li>I only recently had to replace it and was so happy when I found it on Amazaon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair from the trim end and the battery seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well and is completely painless so you are able to get into hard-to-reach crevices.</li>
            <li>I think the spring metal that forms the on/off switch is too soft and corrodes too easily.  </li>
            <li>I would never be outgoing enough to go get a wax, nor brave enough to do it myself.</li>
            <li>Sometimes had problems actually turning on despite fully charged batteries, but overall it worked great.</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first 4 times but it completely died!</li>
            <li>Only used once, but it was fine!</li>
            <li>My main concern was safety!!  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle too.</li>
            <li>wife like it very much.</li>
            <li>Wife tried it and said it just would not cut very much so she quit.</li>
            <li>Back to order a new one because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Panasonic uses high speed and a special blade design on these so they do not pinch or bruise.</li>
            <li>It is not so loud, but I do not like color, but it is fine.</li>
            <li>--I can see why it&#x27;d be useful to trip a beard a certain length,</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer to replace an older trimmer that I had that just didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power to give a good trim - this one is far superior to my other one -</li>
            <li>We have special clippers for the dogs which I would NOT want near my jewels!!</li>
            <li>Good little shaver</li>
            <li>I found this to be a good little shaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to trim to various lengths.  </li>
            <li>Great for those hard to reach places</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a little bulky and not the easiest to maneuver but does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Its a small light weight trimmer which is easy to use and quite portable, making it easy to take it with you while travelling.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten specifically for the bikini area</li>
            <li>I used it at it&#x27;s lowest setting with the guard first and then cleaned up without the guard.</li>
            <li>-it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I got a pretty close shave that way.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first bikini shaver/trimmer I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>The guard is nice but does not shave as close as I would like, so I just remove the guard and shave carefully to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s ManGroomer works better for following the curves in.</li>
            <li>I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to trim as short as I want.  </li>
            <li>I think that the 11 years of use I got out of it was acceptable (and it cost $10 more back when I got it)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing and could NEVER go back to razors alone.</li>
            <li>After reading loads of reviews, I was pretty keen to buy as a replacement for my Braun FG 1100, which I&#x27;d had for ages.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only the mons that get irritated, so you might try that to get the smoothest results where it counts most :</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was looking</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>;-).</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaper and trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 5 years</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my personal Panasonic Bikini Shaper and Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>It seems as if Panasonic cares about its reputation and most likely reviewed and tested it thoroughly before sale.</li>
            <li>Minimal tugging and nice results.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li>This bikini shaper is much better than the last one I used.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it was made for.</li>
            <li>I decided on this one after reading several customer reviews, and am very pleased with it thus far.  </li>
            <li>The first one of these I purchased came apart inside.</li>
            <li>I was worried about ordering because I thought I&#x27;d just revert back to razors, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Just bought this recently and love it.</li>
            <li>Its pretty foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Panasonic items &amp; have absolutely no complaints with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Only cons I noticed are if your using the guarded the hair must be straight or you have to go over it multiple times which isn&#x27;t a problem for me because most times I don&#x27;t even use the guarded.</li>
            <li>This was the first trimmer I had ever bought.</li>
            <li>The first trimmer that I bought stopped working after I accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>the most basic trimmer that you can get.  </li>
            <li>and I had lost the brush with the first trimmer I bought</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Gets a bit hot.</li>
            <li>Wish there was something magic that wasn&#x27;t fraught with the possibility of bodily injury.</li>
            <li>exactly as described and what i was looking for</li>
            <li>This must be a much higher quality shaver.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove all the hair, like a razor, but it get pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly how stated in the product description.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve definitely paid more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it takes regular batteries instead of being charged - anytime I need to use it</li>
            <li>Only thing that would make this better would be a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>and it still works as well as the first day.  </li>
            <li>First let me start off by saying: I&#x27;m a dude.</li>
            <li>I need to use it once every week to keep it consistent.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my first one within a year</li>
            <li>actually don&#x27;t use the purple top.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>It took many passes over the same area to do anything.</li>
            <li>It is not as nice as I expected</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb like attachment on top lets you choose between 4 different hair lengths.</li>
            <li>It does get a bit hot</li>
            <li>First thought my trimmer wasn&#x27;t working when I first put batteries in because it was already on the on switch.</li>
            <li>Works better for coarse kinky hair (4c hair).</li>
            <li>When i first started using this trimmer</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the help!</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this product out and used it the first day.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>A grown person with actual pubes, however, will be better off using duct tape.  </li>
            <li>The bikini shaper and trimmer works quiet well for trimming the bikini area and more</li>
            <li>but I love that u can choose different lengths would definately recommend</li>
            <li>If you are looking to be completely hair free; I suggest a brazilian wax or comparable procedure as this is a trimmer not a stripper.  </li>
            <li>I had the first one for about two years</li>
            <li>Several years ago, I had bought a Panasonic bikini shaper / trimmer, and it lasted many years.</li>
            <li>When I first did, after praying all saints for strength, I found myself so surprise</li>
            <li>but my first one was on a charger and the charger mysteriously stopped fitting and wouldn&#x27;t charge</li>
            <li>At first, I was uncertain how to use this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve had so I cannot compare to others.</li>
            <li>But it works and keeps a charge more than 2 mins which was the problem I had with the last shaper I had.</li>
            <li>It still works as well as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>Love this and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the product description says what it will do.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t scream modern woman, hear me roar!  </li>
            <li>and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what i need it to.</li>
            <li>This review is bases on my first use.</li>
            <li>I do not feel it is a trimmer that can be used to properly groom , or more like</li>
            <li>It stopped working after first use...</li>
            <li>First it forgets where it&#x27;s supposed to grow, then it starts growing where it&#x27;s not suppose to grow.  </li>
            <li>First against the hair growth, then from the inside toward the out.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a skin-close cut, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use several bikini trimmers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>i love that it&#x27;s smaller</li>
            <li>first time I purchased a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first trimmer</li>
            <li>for the Bikini area, it was EXACTLY what you would hope to be.  </li>
            <li>I have more coarse hair</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will not look for an alternative</li>
            <li>It came exactly as the package indicated.</li>
            <li>only wished it was rechargeable or waterproof,  but that would cost more</li>
            <li>The short setting is perfectly safe with the guard of course.</li>
            <li>I was okay with trying something different for the plumbing repair</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, spend an extra $10 and buy a slightly better one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over a year...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, has several setting for different lengths, comes with a slipcase, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.      </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend if your looking for that super close trim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get it completely smooth but the surface feels like if you would have shaved the day before with the little prickly hair which is fine for me!</li>
            <li>I even needed a quick touch up on my legs before going out and it left me looking and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>If you want to experiment; buy this one, cheap and open all  parts and see, clean, and close - capable.</li>
            <li>I really kind of scared to use this since I had prior nightmares with razors and shavers, but wow!</li>
            <li>Now remember its for people that don&#x27;t want a really close shave that its completely shaven , but that&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer attachment  is essential for a nice, painless trim (you don&#x27;t want to go wacking away at lengthier hairs without trimming them down first), and allows for better shaping.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has many different length settings, which is also appreciated, and the attachment that adjusts for length very sturdy (not so with my old remington, where I broke one of the attachments fairly easily after about 2 years of use).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries, and I usually use it for about 5 minutes or so each time I trim, once a week, so, the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>So most of the hair is still laying flat and doesn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good value - seems to work well, though I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;ve even recommended it to several of my girlfriends, who have been equally as pleased.</li>
            <li>what a good little trimmer this really was.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised since the plastic is obviously VERY flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>makes hair soft and clean shaven look.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried it mostly dressed and sitting on the toilet - which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you&#x27;re into picking fuzz out of</li>
            <li>I love mine so much, I am buying a second for our vacation home.</li>
            <li>That makes this as good as the drug store razor/trimmers but more expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO much easier than regular shaving, and I&#x27;ve never been able to stand waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull hair, completely painless &amp; no razor bumps, the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>Very useful altough not as effective as I was expecting, it&#x27;s kinda hard for it to catch shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I have more than received my monies worth from the first and expect the same from this new one,  very flexible to use.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and small, so it&#x27;s easy to use and customize.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Overall, a really great, inexpensive little trimmer -- does what it says in a pretty short time, and gives many options.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is much wider than other bikini trimmers, which means I can trim more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way this little hand held shaver that helps me to feel &#x27;kept clean&#x27; in an area that isn&#x27;t in view to anyone else to see but me.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick and makes grooming pretty satisfying since it makes everything even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect (and powerful) bikini trimmer, easy to handle for smaller hands like mine, and gets into the creases and tight spots without any trouble.</li>
            <li>That was a mistake, it barely trims and is made cheaply.</li>
            <li>Really dissapointing as this is the first bikini trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go totally bare and smooth, and was looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is the first trimmer I have ever tried and I am really content with it.</li>
            <li>I want to make sure we have it around for a long time.</li>
            <li>Slick, Sleek, and good for a man.</li>
            <li>It will trim super super short if you remove attachment, doesn&#x27;t pull &amp; isn&#x27;t painfull at all.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to have hair down in those nether regions but keep it looking trim and tidy.</li>
            <li>This product is fine if you just wanted to trim down the bikini area but not if you want it smooth for swim suit season.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it but feel I may have to get out a mirror and work hard to move exactly with the way the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, even with this fault.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a pain-free, easy way to get rid of the bikini line that won&#x27;t kill your wallet (because that&#x27;s a big deal when you&#x27;re in college like I am)</li>
            <li>simple, easy and adjustable.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased- especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Fast but got hot fast.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use, does what it says.</li>
            <li>Saves time, easy to use, no bumps and this is coming from someone who has tried numerous products.</li>
            <li>Trims sensitive areas quickly without nicking skin.</li>
            <li>i was really surprised at how quickly it was getting the hair off, zip, zip...</li>
            <li>I decided I did not want anymore bikini waxing and needed to resort to trimming myself, This was easy to use and shaved just enough.</li>
            <li>It is imperative that you use the trimmer on a completely dry area for a better shave, and use baby powder or cornstarch.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, it has 5 &amp;#34;sizes&amp;#34; of trimming and you only need 2</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I use it to get as close as possible and then i go over the area with my razor, its a very quick once over.  </li>
            <li>Also love how you can shave dry, so you can touch up whenever.  </li>
            <li>I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I just got a new one because basically this little thing does a good job.</li>
            <li>I chose this one due to the high amount of positive reviews, but I haven&#x27;t liked this one at all.</li>
            <li>I am a large, tall woman, who had difficulty shaving my genital area with a razor.</li>
            <li>Oh well... maybe I got a dud, but one thing is certain:</li>
            <li>I did not like it at all, it is too large for the area of use.</li>
            <li>If I had to recommend a trimmer to any of my friends I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I could see where this could plow through a large quantity of longer hair quite well</li>
            <li>It took MANY passes over the same areas and pulling the skin very taut, sometimes holding hairs straight up to get them to go through the guard, to get a half-way decent trim.</li>
            <li>Its nice and small so it fits right in your purse or bag in case you need a touch up.</li>
            <li>But this trimmer works really well, has different settings and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anyone (guy or gal) who wants to stay tidy down there.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for me, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to regular use.</li>
            <li>Trims to various lengths, and I can even use while 8 months pregnant without looking~!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a decent and affordable trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I am not a serious biniki trimmer-type girl, but I found this product to do wonders!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, fits easily in the hand and is easy to store, since it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>This little guy is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little shaver.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer helps you keep your pubic hedges nice and neat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this little tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for trimming but getting along the sides for actually hair removal..not very close at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a shave and wants one fast without the pain of a wax!</li>
            <li>I must say though that I do like the 1/4 inch length and will probably keep that for my everyday look, but am really happy to have the option to go really low when i need to.  </li>
            <li>While it does a good job of trimming the hair, it is REALLY bad about yanking the hair and catching my skin.</li>
            <li>I try to work with it very carefuly and gently but still in injure my skin.</li>
            <li>This product really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer is very versatile...</li>
            <li>Works really well for trimming up.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I expected for the cost.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Product works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have found the Panasonic ES246AC Shaper &amp; Trimmer to be a very valuable tool when performing all tasks associated with shaping/trimming.</li>
            <li>I use it gently and don&#x27;t press.  </li>
            <li>Guard keeps it from getting really close.  </li>
            <li>It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain.  </li>
            <li>The size and style is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>It does not work very well and does not shave well either.</li>
            <li>It gets very close, but without any pain, irritation or bumps.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It does work if you have a lot of hair to remove, otherwise, not so much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li>For the price this is absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely dislike it.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get you completely smooth, but it will go as close as possible without any damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it five stars if it could make it completely smooth, but that probably brings back irritation issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I can&#x27;t believe I had been using a normal razor all this</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>but I think the reason it quit working is my fault, as I think it got too much moisture where it was relocated at the time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I did before it haha</li>
            <li>Shaper was just as advertised and has worked better than expected with no scrapes or skin burns.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very adjustable.</li>
            <li>It also does a wonderful job trimming in awkward positions.</li>
            <li>I stopped buying much electronic stuff on amazon, since the return policy feels like a hassle to me.</li>
            <li>#1, This trimmer isn&#x27;t really made in Japan, it maybe put together there and</li>
            <li>I am not one to review very often on Amazon, but was compelled to by this electric trimmer.</li>
            <li>This makes things so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>Trims very well.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but this one is so much faster.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Works very well (according to my girlfriend words).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the whole &amp;#34;not waterproof&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I really dont know how anyone could use this to trim that area.</li>
            <li>It was close enough for me (as in a couple mm), and it was really precise.</li>
            <li>(If the price was raised, I&#x27;d still purchase, I like it that much.)</li>
            <li>Get a wax or laser removal if you want a total smooth finish.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the length, so you have control of how much you trim and how much you keep.</li>
            <li>It can be adjusted for whatever length you want and cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never pay this much for a trimmer again.</li>
            <li>Replaced it with a $15 Conair trimmer and am much happier.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at the fact that it is battery operated but yet so powerful.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed that its heated, but it doesnt really make a difference to me.</li>
            <li>you regret paying that much.  </li>
            <li>It has just as much as power as my husband’s corded, electric razor.</li>
            <li>However, if you want a closer cut, take off the guide and gently trim the hair with the blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is battery operated, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I used to have to charge the remington ahead of time, before each time as the battery did not hold power very well.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>As much as I admire the minimalist design</li>
            <li>Luckily it is gentle on batteries.</li>
            <li>Really noisy which just adds to my apprehension.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very close shave without the guard, which is what I was hoping for, and it did not hurt me at all.  </li>
            <li>This is really every woman&#x27;s must have product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get it smooth to touch, but get the hairs very short.</li>
            <li>Makes trimming so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li>, I really wish it was.  </li>
            <li>However it is NOT a shaver, and does NOT get really close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it on the closest shave setting, and it gave me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>No pain, VERY close shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li>I use this on the shortest setting and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has worked really well.</li>
            <li>like it so much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself continuing with this one much longer.</li>
            <li>but this trimmer did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how much battery life it uses yet, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>I would like to hear some opinions about how close it really shaves.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed because this stopped working after owning it for nine months and using it once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li>Oh and I use it without the guard for a very close trim, and it has NEVER nicked me.</li>
            <li>worked very well as a trimmer</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It gets really close to a shave an</li>
            <li>Never nicked, pinched, or cut me and held up very well.</li>
            <li>I took care of all offending hair while not really being able to see.</li>
            <li>So much easier then trimming with sissors.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The width of the trimmer that Panasonic chose works very well.  </li>
            <li>Almost in that the guard doesn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really heated.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those sensitive and delicate areas like the bikini line and keeping your private area neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li>I like it that much.</li>
            <li>(Who who wants a heated device on their bikini line?</li>
            <li>cut is very close and causes no irritation, pulling on skin, itching or redness.  </li>
            <li>I really like it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer gets really close</li>
            <li>It has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>but it really does not remove anything...</li>
            <li>It also is easy enough to pop open &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>The head has adjustable height for custom length and is removable for a very close finish.</li>
            <li>I really like this thing.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Shapes very well without leaving area prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are trying to cut a very tall grass, you have to go step by step</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works really well and trims very close.  </li>
            <li>so it is always ready when you need it.  </li>
            <li>I use this for the advertised purpose and it works really well, does just what I want it to.</li>
            <li>it did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Did the job and trimmed hair very close.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just too much hair for my preference.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient grooming tool.</li>
            <li>You can trim straight edges and control length of hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have anything to add anything that others haven&#x27;t already mentioned.</li>
            <li>This is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li>I know there are some reviews that give this item a much lower rating</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t really cut the hair either.</li>
            <li>Remington has a trimmer that works very well</li>
            <li>and this gives you a really close trim without giving those types of issues.</li>
            <li>I really like how it does the work.</li>
            <li>(yes, I tried changing the batteries &amp; gently banging it against the shower wall.)</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for really applies with this item.  </li>
            <li>Without getting into too much detail...</li>
            <li>It trimmed just as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>These are real gentle and made for your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and have liked the results.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s an effective trimmer, but you will have to make several passes over the same area.  </li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s better than shaving because it grows back soft and not all bushy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be definitely going back to the little Braun, which is super quick and way more precise.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it, cuts down the hair fast and easy!</li>
            <li>so I took the guard off and ended up completely bald!!!</li>
            <li>It gets incredibly low and works consistently and quickly.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I put in brand new batteries the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This little machine is very easy to use, efficient and relatively fast.  </li>
            <li>It definitely cuts cleanly and works well, but you are going to have about 1/4 inch of hair left that you still have to shave off if you are looking for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I did a couple of times, but it didn&#x27;t even really feel like a nick, more like just the sharp point dug in a bit.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable to use as my older rechargeable Conair that was curvier and smaller.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it in the shower because it is battery operated, which I love because I always forgot to charge the other one that I had.  </li>
            <li>better then other ones i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It worked well at first l but the top metal that moves on the top broke after 7 or so times using it, and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li>I bought other trimmers after this trying to find a better one.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think she will love it.</li>
            <li>This works better and has lasted longer than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The Schick trimmer that comes with a razor on the other end works better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap, but after the first use I knew it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting is very short (without being bare) and there is no harm of any nicks on my skin with the safe guard.  </li>
            <li>It works well for keeping the private area neat and clean and does not cause a rash or nick/cut your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I especially like the fact that you can take the guard off to clean it.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective, lasts long time on 2 batteries.  </li>
            <li>Likewise, the little plastic shaver head (that determines how low the hair is cut) works surprising well for something so simple and cheap to manufacture.  </li>
            <li>I took it apart and cleaned the mechanisms only to have it power down for good.</li>
            <li>This shaves very, very close without &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; your sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for shaving pubes, chest, pits, and any other hair that you want down to a low length but not shaved to the skin.  </li>
            <li>If I could make an improvement, I&#x27;d make it a little bit more sensitive or powerful so that I could work quicker.</li>
            <li>While her hair is not thick, it grows long very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Having been pregnant for past few years it can be challenging for many reasons to get a bikini wax.  </li>
            <li>The batteries last many months worth of clippings, something I hadn&#x27;t expected and</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to trim around the really sensitive areas</li>
            <li>in addition, unlike a razor there is no painful, itchy stubble growing back around the panty line.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>As someone who gets a shaving rash by just looking at a razor, and doesn&#x27;t have the budget for regular bikini waxes (plus, OUCH!), this product was a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>not sure about the heated part,  mine did not feel heated..very easy to use and I am glad they make some specific to a womens needs.</li>
            <li>It may not be good for eyebrow trimming since it is a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li>It just died, so time to buy a new one!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda pissed that I lost the adjustment piece and had to buy a whole new one because just the replacement is no where online</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t a lengthy and descriptive review on the ways it didn&#x27;t work, the cuts it inflicted, and/pr what sort of trashcan it met its end in, but I think in this case, less is more.</li>
            <li>It was a clean toilet thank goodness</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to make the black one any more, and he was hesitant to buy the &#x27;girls version&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Way better than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>I personally like it very very short, so I just take the additional part on top off and use the trimmer by itself.</li>
            <li>The battery life is decent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the guard on this particular product because it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the trimmer I had before.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>that if I screw something up, I can just order that particular part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than some more expensive brands that I tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d make a slip and never did a decent job.</li>
            <li>Smooth, quiet action with no pulling or nicking.</li>
            <li>This is a decent trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the Braun mini shaver does.</li>
            <li>and it gives a really close and clean, almost shaved look especially on hairy areas where soft hair runs rampant.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using it in the shower a few times, and it died quickly (my own fault, because it clearly says not to do that)</li>
            <li>Plus it trims super short and without the guard I have had no cuts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to anything in this area, but only had one quick moment of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>But this trimmer didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and I have very very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but maybe I set my expectations too high.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times since I got this, but I feel like it&#x27;s mostly been my fault for not being careful enough.</li>
            <li>and I already can tell that this will cause some kind of redness and irritation due to the fact that I have to constantly go over my skin with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>it was louder than i expected, but that&#x27;s fine for the job it does.</li>
            <li>Love this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I guess depending on what you like, the little part that goes on the top lets you adjust</li>
            <li>Love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li>It snags and tugs a little more than the model I used to use, which broke.  </li>
            <li>I love this little thing.  </li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest spending a little more on something nicer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a little more picky about what&#x27;s lopping stuff off around my privates.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if it trimmed a little closer to the skin.</li>
            <li>really quite pleased with how close the trimmer gets; I actually feel smooth in some places (where hair is slightly less coarse), and everywhere else is neat and evenly trim.  </li>
            <li>My main concern was that as a woman of color, with naturally thicker and courser hair, that this wouldn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Only pain point is too many small parts to clean and doesn&#x27;t seem like you can run it under a tap.</li>
            <li>The guard is easy to move and the blades stay functional and sharp.</li>
            <li>blade is kind of dull.</li>
            <li>Shaved with one stroke, it&#x27;s strong and sharp.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve also given buzz haircuts and beard trims with no problem, taking it slowly - handy little widget!!</li>
            <li>it has the ability to cut the hair very close and completely off if you&#x27;d like to use it for that as well.</li>
            <li>The speed of the blade is much faster and trims with fewer passes as compared to my old remington.</li>
            <li>A silly vanity, but it works great</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t really like shaving or waxing (and</li>
            <li>Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>:  Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.</li>
            <li>And for those of you who even have a trail of hair going even further under...even past the general &#x27;exposed&#x27;  areas...I was so happy with the results of mine</li>
            <li>It obviously doesn&#x27;t get you perfectly smooth, but it can cut the hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>It really gives you a close shave without going completely bald.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple of years ago, then lost part of the top a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Definitely an item worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Better than using heavy clippers..</li>
            <li>although it might not cut as close or be as sharp as other bikini trimmers, it NEVER nicks my skin or causes irritation, which i think is a fair tradeoff.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not powerful enough at all.</li>
            <li>It use normal battery, but I like the design, because I can buy the rechargeable one easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It simply wasn&#x27;t useful with the guard in place-- just ran over the area and did not trim the hair.</li>
            <li>If the guards were the normal ones that snap on and off like hair clippers, this would be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more of the round file things, and plan on incorporating this into my routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a real close shave without having to feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; or too hairy and no more razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tug, and gets something done in 5 minutes that would normally take 30.</li>
            <li>Keep the blades oiled as you would a normal clipper set.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty much bare.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty basic, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I had the rechargeable clio before this one, but dropped it a few too many times so needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>This item is powerful enough and does not catch your hair.</li>
            <li>This thing might be ok for trimming a few strands of hair but not a hairy man.</li>
            <li>What would take an hour or more took a few minutes no pulled hair nothing.</li>
            <li>The removable blade cap is adjustable to several lengths, but none of which are useful to me because I like a closer shaver.</li>
            <li>Normally, I get everything waxed, but have let things get admittedly out of hand.</li>
            <li>maiden voyage was a bit longer than what I would normally expect to use this for.</li>
            <li>so much I vowed never to do it again even though my skin felt silky smooth down there; and razors always made me super-itchy and sometimes gave me razor burn that hurt.</li>
            <li>It trims down the hair nicely and (following the suggestion of another reviewer - thank you!)</li>
            <li>I used to use razors until my stomach got very big that I honestly can&#x27;t see down there without my stomach being in the way.</li>
            <li>Second; Both me and the wife like to be neat and tidy with the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to hold and use easily and accurately.</li>
            <li>All other settings seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>Other then than I the product works fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers that are more expensive that aren&#x27;t as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my hand, is basically easy to maneuver and ultimately does the job well and quickly other than the few mishaps I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Using its lowest guarg setting, it easily handled my course, dark hair.</li>
            <li>This would work great if I kept the lawn a little longer, but since I prefer bare this is not very helpful.</li>
            <li>The old one (pink) still works fine after maybe 10 years.  </li>
            <li>does a fantastic job, there are some reviews saying it either breaks after a few uses or that it doesnt give you a close enough shave, i find these comments not to be true.</li>
            <li>Though it is small enough to get to all the lady parts, unlike a regular sized trimmer, which is great.  </li>
            <li>If only I had known about this product sooner as it saves the pain from brazilian waxing although it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate hair, the result is pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I got this little puppy a day early today.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>but with a new design so they keep their charge</li>
            <li>I pkan to buy a new one and hide it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine trying anything new.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries, still nothing.  </li>
            <li>but it stopped working, I put new batteries in and it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the batteries with brand new ones and got nothing.</li>
            <li>and it still works and looks new.</li>
            <li>that you can order parts as opposed to buying an entirely new trimmer.</li>
            <li>It still works, though, but it seems the batteries are dying when they&#x27;re brand new.</li>
            <li>I tried putting new batteries in and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one -</li>
            <li>I needed a new trimmer</li>
            <li>yes, I replaced batteries with new ones and still would not work.</li>
            <li>Panasonic sent me another one brand new because I was still under the 2 year warranty and guess what?</li>
            <li>I find it amusing that it is advertised as a &#x27;bikini line&#x27; trimmer, and I suppose it works for the worst of that too, but if you are looking for grooming your privates without the pain of waxing it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>If you use it without the guard, it trims really closely so there isn&#x27;t much hair left.</li>
            <li>One thing I personally noticed was that the metal teeth at the top were rounded instead of being sharp like other trimmers which is a great thing as sharp metal potion could actually hurt you.</li>
            <li>It has never irritated my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful (need to go over same area multiple times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>A good product a little rough, works well, but it does the job!</li>
            <li>I was able to repair the piece temporarily with super glue, but when I tapped the head a little later it broke in the same place.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m replacing it with the exact same model, hoping to get another 5 years out of the new one.</li>
            <li>I went right back to using my old one.</li>
            <li>the trim is slightly large and the guard does not really capture as much of the hair as I&#x27;d like, yet without the guard it takes off too much.</li>
            <li>it is easy to carry and very quiet, no loud noise,i was very surprised that i did not get any bumps.</li>
            <li>I bought this even though there were some pretty strong negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its compactness makes it easy to maneuver in tight spots.</li>
            <li>Originally I rated this trimmer only 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed the hair close enough.</li>
            <li>And all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>I just ordered the exact same one to replace it.</li>
            <li>This completely does the trick!</li>
            <li>Many cordless trimmers I had in the past were overly bulky.  </li>
            <li>I have used it only once; so I am hopeful that it will continue to perform as it did the first time.</li>
            <li>Not a total &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Two years later and it still works as well as it did the first time.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s cordless and small.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several years now and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it is not meant for use in the shower, which is how I would use the first one, so that&#x27;s probably why it died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better quality for the same money in other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Honestly ladies, there&#x27;s no good way to do this</li>
            <li>When you are ready to shave bare, take off piece.  </li>
            <li>small cute but efficient..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d start with the longest setting first and see if that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li>The second time I tried to use it, instead of it working, it just got really hot.</li>
            <li>Wow...was i surprised!</li>
            <li>This works pretty well for trimming everything up the same length.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not waterproof (bummer), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, when I first attempted to use it, I left the guard on, but on the shortest trimmer setting.....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in removing all hair, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere because this is just a trimmer with a couple different length settings.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and powerful cut.</li>
            <li>Powerful enough, yet also gentle enough.</li>
            <li>This will not get to the skin but will allow you to trim, edge, and provide a pretty short buzz cut where applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was built for the soft contours of the female anatomy, but given a little patience any man will be rewarded with a nice soft swimsuit area.</li>
            <li>This bikini TRIMMER (read: NOT razor), can quickly and easily trim hair down to a very low level (but not so short it&#x27;s prickly).</li>
            <li>I almost always use it without the guard, which works fine, but it&#x27;s a little frustrating because I have to be much more careful than if I could use a guard with an appropriate height.</li>
            <li>Like other reviews, it does not do a clean shave</li>
            <li>Love it and always recommend to my friends, both male and female alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: nearly two years later</li>
            <li>This trimmer was actually cheaper than other ones I&#x27;ve tried and far better quality.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t break, it just got really loud, so I got a new one.</li>
            <li>Now even with new batteries the trimmer turns off so frequently it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li>It is small, light-weight and easy to maneuver with left and right handed use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super smooth close shave</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it would have lasted long because it&#x27;s made of such cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had issues with it hurting or pinching, and I have control in all the small spaces that I need to use it for- stainless steel blades important.</li>
            <li>I had to run the thing over the hair MANY times to get anything remotely resembling a trim, and there were still lots of long hairs among the shorter ones.</li>
            <li>The battery life is decent, but for some people, the extra cost for a rechargable unit is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>It has several adjustments and is nice and small.</li>
            <li>I use the 1 setting first to get the hairs to around 1/8&amp;#34; and then remove the trimmer comb to get extra close, by doing this I avoid bumps completely.</li>
            <li>I have the most coarse hair and did not have any problems trimming it down to an acceptable level (for me).</li>
            <li>it is hard to find trimmers that really work without pulling and hurting this one was easy to use and did not pull out hair.</li>
            <li>But sooooo easy to use and very maneuverable in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Top quality unit with no pulling should last a long time with proper care.</li>
            <li>The only reason I even gave 2 stars is because it seemed totally safe to have around all those sensitive parts down there--</li>
            <li>You can get a very short trim if you want, and you&#x27;ll probably have to trim a couple of times from different directions, but that&#x27;s due to hair growth patterns, not the trimmer, and even then it&#x27;s super quick.</li>
            <li>A little cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little brush to keep the guard and blades free of hair.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one pretty soon after because I could not live without this thing.</li>
            <li>It is a little loud but that sound didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>For $20 (only $5 more than a 3 pack of disposables) I bought this little wonder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little trimmer for the price but be careful or you&#x27;ll nick yourself.</li>
            <li>I love that it has various height settings, as well as a little brush for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the feeling of only having a little stubble.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a little narrower, like the ones sold in the drugstore (I think Venus has one -- but this one does not last more than a month).</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, but you do have to clean it every time and it is a little annoying to do even though it is easy.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is great, although I never use the attachment to trim \\&quot;down there\\&quot; because it would still leave it too long</li>
            <li>It is not just for the bikini area.. great for trimming hair too, that is, if you are cutting your kids hair..</li>
            <li>This product is made in Japan and it clearly shows.</li>
            <li>most of the others are more painful and end up with cuts.</li>
            <li>You can also use it without the guard to remove some hair completely</li>
            <li>It does allow you to get really close, no bumps when the hair grows back</li>
            <li>It actually trims very close</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be completely hair-free.  </li>
            <li>It works well even near sensitive areas without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>it takes batteries so that&#x27;s the only real downside.</li>
            <li>me, the trimmer blade kept nicking my skin (which is not what you want when you&#x27;re grooming the delicate areas), and using the guide takes forever to shorten longer hairs to a better length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it twice, but will have to get my old man to help.</li>
            <li>I love purchasing from Amazon.com especially products sold by Amazon LLC, but this was disappointing to hear that they could not help me out after I had purchased so many products through their website.    </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had various cordless trimmers, all of them were rechargeable, and all of them lost power within a year or two and the cost of replacing the battery was almost as much as the trimmer.    </li>
            <li>The adjustable length mechanism works very well and is removable, as are the blades which can be removed and thoroughly cleaned (and replaced if necessary).    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classy gadget.</li>
            <li>I bought it because my old Panasonic epilator/shaver feels like it&#x27;s dying</li>
            <li>so I avoid completely shaving.</li>
            <li>So far I have had no issues with it and would buy again when mine gets to old.</li>
            <li>Considering how sensitive the bikini line area is the trimmer cuts a close shave without nicking.</li>
            <li>My old remington did not come with that, and</li>
            <li>Remember, if you want to remove hair completely don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>It cuts fast and doesn&#x27;t catch/rip out my hair like my last trimmer did.</li>
            <li>So far she hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item as my old &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; was about to bite the dust.  </li>
            <li>This works perfectly so far</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give anything NEAR a close shave, probably</li>
            <li>My old 1 did not have this problem.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with its performance.</li>
            <li>I can just pop the batteries in and be ready to go, instead of forgetting to charge it until the last minute.</li>
            <li>I take the guard off completely to get it to trim the shortest.  </li>
            <li>It completely attended my needs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s action and shape.</li>
            <li>It cuts no where near as close as the Clio</li>
            <li>okay but not spectacular.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done but pulls at hair if you aren&#x27;t directly on skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t loud</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>and i have pretty long curly hair in that area.  </li>
            <li>How does it do on those really sensitive areas?</li>
            <li>I would commend this for anyone that wants personal trimmer for that area.</li>
            <li>For the price, this should last much longer than 18-20 uses.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this item twice</li>
            <li>It works so well that my husband now wants one too as I won&#x27;t share, for obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this trimmer if you&#x27;re looking for something that will trim VERY close to the skin without nicking you.</li>
            <li>ehem* sensitive parts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud or jittery</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>this shaver doesn&#x27;t catch or grab sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I find that the plastic guard doesn&#x27;t let me get the closest trim I want, so I just take it off and use the metal part directly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather feel very short stubble from this trimmer!</li>
            <li>It trims evenly with no irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>shaver worked well until it stopped completely after a year.  </li>
            <li>and I think I had this for a year so far.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it thus far.</li>
            <li>No, this shaver does not give you that completely bald look or feel, but that&#x27;s not what I was going for.  </li>
            <li>The shave is very close, especially if you remove the guard, and there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It was fast, quiet, and efficient.</li>
            <li>Works well, it&#x27;s completely plastic.</li>
            <li>has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>If your looking to take care of adult acne and are concerned about ageing also</li>
            <li>I really recommend it and it does have different sizes in case</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Once again I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The guide is adjustable for different lengths and it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li>I take the batteries out and just put them back in when I am ready to use it.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a very similarly-shaped device, but smaller, and cheaper, and I hadn&#x27;t used the guard on that either</li>
            <li>You can rinse it under water and it doesn&#x27;t get damaged (i don&#x27;t submerge it or let water near the battery compartment)</li>
            <li>Used it once thus far and the sliding head works as indicated - no manuevering problems.</li>
            <li>Thus far, no hair bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li>But, so far, no problems.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to shave.  </li>
            <li>and it literally turned on for a split seconded then completely died.</li>
            <li>Holding up thus far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely ideal for cropping hair relatively close to the skin, and the narrow blade width allows me to get all those delicate nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>It is nice and small and not loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different trimmers over the years, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Sadly, after just one use, I&#x27;ve realised it&#x27;s just as good as I had</li>
            <li>This gets the hair an does the job, but it could be built more for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Now with out the guarded it shaves down the the bare skin..</li>
            <li>The different levels are very useful and there have been absolutely no nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that it came in easy to open packaging with a small cleaning comb as well.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer - from tough beard to any other areas you want to trim.</li>
            <li>and i have finally found the right one.i would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I was really scared at first to use it, but as I saw how well it was working, I got less nervous with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on other razors that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking the guard off completely and it shaves it almost bare, which is actually a little too short but better than the Number 1.</li>
            <li>This unit is small and compact and fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li>Its small and easy to maneuver</li>
            <li>Its size makes maneuvering it in small places, like the bikini area, fairly easy.</li>
            <li>Small, lightweight, easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to go anywhere.</li>
            <li>Small and easy storage.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to take on trips in carryon luggage, because it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair long enough to be a little softer and I like that the plastic guard prevents catching skin.</li>
            <li>It comes with just three pieces, the body, the guard, and a little brush to clean out the guard (Im assuming).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to clean up and not have to worry about little cuts.</li>
            <li>As if not sharp or fast enough.</li>
            <li>I find it pretty uncomfortable honestly for several days after trimming.</li>
            <li>It seems kind of ludicrous to me that I spent years of my life removing all my hair down there to meet some societal standard.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it will let you do what this Panasonic one does, and more, and for very little extra cost.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried two other ones (one by epilady, and i forget the brand of the other one), but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works pretty well, and I use it fairly regularly.</li>
            <li>the blade guard doesn&#x27;t really come close enough though, so I wind up using it bare blade which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I have had many bikini trimmers in the past and they have always cut me and left me bleeding!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little trimmer!</li>
            <li>This trimmer will not get you shaved smooth, but will trim your hair down relatively short.  </li>
            <li>As I said earlier, I highly recommend Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended it for coarse hair that causes bumps.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer to anyone that wants to keep things neat and trim.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with other smaller trimmers, but they do not seem to be large or powerful enough to work like this one.</li>
            <li>I tried a few bikini trimmers and they never seemed strong enough to do what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>Small, light weight, takes 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>No one wants long hair</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t eat up too much battery power as long as you take out the batteries after every use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, needed, and expected.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was HOT PINK or girly looking</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t nick you if you&#x27;re pretty careful.  </li>
            <li>What normally takes me 30 minutes only took me 5 with this thing!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>with 2 little boys around I am in pretty high stock of batteries.</li>
            <li>my last one worked the same, but used up the batteries very quickly, basically one round of use would require for me to put in new batteries.</li>
            <li>and I have to turn it off several times to let it cool down a bit before I can complete the job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very powerful for it&#x27;s small size.  </li>
            <li>The guard didn&#x27;t feel secure and it was pretty useless since the closet trim was still pretty long.</li>
            <li>My new Panasonic ES2207P works about the same.  </li>
            <li>You use it dry, it is powered with batteries, and it really is idiot-proof until you try to shave without the trim guard</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for any male or female who wants to trim their pubic areas.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy one of those super expensive trimmers because I figured the more expensive it is the better the product will be, until I stumbled onto this product and read all the reviews.</li>
            <li>And weirdly it leaves a nice soft feel, none of that prickly stuff.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer to just have mine neat and in order instead of completely shaved and so far this trimmer has kept me from having to deal with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed lately, though, that it makes more noise when I use it, and I can only surmise that after 5 hard-working years, the &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; may be dying.</li>
            <li>The only con really is that it&#x27;s starting to act as if it isn&#x27;t working as well as it was.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is how long they are expected to work because it&#x27;s still not a bad price for the use I got out of it.</li>
            <li>I use it for my pubic hair because my skin is very sensitive to a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the cage thing off, this is the only thing I can use that causes no irritation/ingrowns/problems as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly how I expected it would!</li>
            <li>This can cause cuts and will tug on the hair if you&#x27;re not careful, though!</li>
            <li>Well... it is quite, but it also has no power, becomes too hot to continue using, and has sharp edges which scrape me up.</li>
            <li>The blade seems as sharp as ever, and I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and small for easy storage.</li>
            <li>I agree with previous reviews - this item is for TRIMMING not shaving (which I thought was pretty clear in the item description).  </li>
            <li>I even wore short denim shorts for the first two days after trimming and there wasn&#x27;t a single bump from chafing around the shaven area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; clean them after each use with a small softbrush provided.</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts cleanly without any tugging or excessive vibration, and I haven&#x27;t had any cuts using it without the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more scissors, no more razor burn, it shaves quickly and exactly to where I want it to shave to!!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy one of these bad boys if you want a decent personal clipper that gives a great clip, has longevity, is compact, and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>Mehh, I didn&#x27;t expect a close shave, but I expected a little better than what it does, I like to keep everything shaved, and I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve had it...</li>
            <li>Its size makes it hard to really get down to trim those more personal areas and the removeable piece is always removed which is my suggestion unless you want to look like a teddybear.</li>
            <li>It will NOT shave you smooth, however, it seems some folks are confusing this with a shaver.</li>
            <li>It trims close enough that it looks like nothing is barely there from a far.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t cut me but cut hair very short in those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>And I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner, because now I can&#x27;t imagine going back to being au natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the same model is still sold!</li>
            <li>It is a definite step up from shaving with a razor however and works well so far.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Reallly like the 4 different levels of shave with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy not having shaving bumps anymore on my sensitive</li>
            <li>and I like it almost bare.</li>
            <li>Barely used--</li>
            <li>I prefer to keep my hair low for hygienic and aesthetic reasons, but was fed up with the ordeal of getting waxed and how frequently you have to go.</li>
            <li>I treated it well and barely used it before it died.  </li>
            <li>It barely works.</li>
            <li>PS335 T-Shaped Shaver on my thighs which cuts closer without shaving bare.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it again a week or so later, and the batteries were completely drained.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this trimmer draws energy from the batteries even while it isn&#x27;t operating.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it&#x27;s a trimmer, so it only trims your hair to a shorter length, it doesn&#x27;t remove or shave your hair completely.</li>
            <li>I used this to groom my genitals, and this thing could barely cut anything.</li>
            <li>:o</li>
            <li>I bought this because I dont like to be totally bare, plus razor burn kills</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be bare.</li>
            <li>this trims so close that it&#x27;s like you are bare.</li>
            <li>Completely died after only five or six uses, and wouldn&#x27;t power up again at all.  </li>
            <li>Definitely do not attempt to use it in sensitive areas without the guard-</li>
            <li>I use it for my personal &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and also to cut my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I expected a razor for the bikini area to be close but gentle.  </li>
            <li>I used it without the cover the whole time and you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to get that bare skin feeling.</li>
            <li>final choice was this product after reading the reviews, because i completely understood what the product would do and I felt that it would soot my purpose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s also not great.  </li>
            <li>Hair can make me feel dirty; holds bacteria even if you wash the area good.</li>
            <li>It worked OK, but never great.</li>
            <li>I let it cool and finished a few minutes later.</li>
            <li>and I love it, is still working, but the blade is broken and I can&#x27;t find any place to buy a blade replacement</li>
            <li>The angled head makes it easy to maintain a fluid motion in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is slim enough that you can actually maneuver around your lady bits.. to be clear, if you are in trimming stance (legs spread a bit), you can trim up one side of your lips and then the other side (with a small amount of stretching or maneuvering the current focus area).&lt;br /&gt;I never find trimmers that slim, it&#x27;s really nice to not have to worry about nicking anything.</li>
            <li>but If your replacing an old one like me, I just used the case from my previous shaver - problem solved :) (or use a small makeup brush case)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and makes it almost impossible to create nicks and cuts.    </li>
            <li>I dried it right away</li>
            <li>You may have to do more than one pass to get an even trim, but no more than any other trimmer of this type.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with razor burn, sensitive skin, etc.</li>
            <li>It also is very affordable because you aren&#x27;t paying for an ad campaign during the Superbowl that comes with other products.</li>
            <li>This makes it hard to clean off since you can&#x27;t run it under water.  </li>
            <li>and it was hard to reach a clean trim at some places.</li>
            <li>Sharp fast moving blades in your bikini area, yikes.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to use on the other end, whereas I really can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times, but so far It works exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I think the size would preferably be a little more narrow, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Trims easily and painlessly, no snags, no bumps (note that I don&#x27;t usually get bumps), runs on two AA batteries, and has a two-year limited warranty.</li>
            <li>The old one, though still running well, sounded like a hedge clipper next to my new one, so no telling how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s lightweight, and the guide is fully adjustable for several different lengths.</li>
            <li>(blade is still sharp but it does not turn on) failure unless one is willing to open the case, clean the contacts and bend the part in to shape.</li>
            <li>As a guy, this little trimmer is amazing and takes out the worry of accidentally nicking yourself in a place you do not want to be nicked, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old female who has never shaved my private area before.</li>
            <li>Not silent actually a bit loud.</li>
            <li>Hair is left short but feels soft and downy</li>
            <li>I am able to get really close without cutting myself.</li>
            <li>I experience a lot of irritation with shaving (after 6 laser treatments no less) and still get quite a few ingrowns/razor rash in certain places.</li>
            <li>First the motor slowed down, then it turned off and never came back on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shed blood trying that with my husband&#x27;s trimmer, but this little puppy did the trick and my skin stayed intact the whole time!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut me or pull the hair as long as I take it easy and go slow.</li>
            <li>Other men might be turned off by the fact that this thing is baby blue and says \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; on it, but it works very well</li>
            <li>but the blade back in place, Also hard to clean blade.</li>
            <li>It cleans up really well and similar to other reviews</li>
            <li>Other than that it does the job very well in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it is pretty loud in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I lost my first Panasonic and went through various other alternatives, only to come back to it!!</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a really long time and does not need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li>At first I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t working that well (which it wasn&#x27;t, it was missing a lot of hair)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t shave with a normal wet razor and waxing</li>
            <li>Purchased this trimmer as an easy way to shape and trim the tough areas.  </li>
            <li>so things were very unruly down there...</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.    </li>
            <li>Does not shave down to the skin, but really close which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Batteries last a long time, and easy to replace common AAs</li>
            <li>First, there was a little tugging, but not enough to make me worry.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the head is a bit too wide to be able to do any real angling, so that can be difficult.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the title/label says &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it dry so far</li>
            <li>and I am so much happier than with my two previous purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used this trimmer once so far, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it will perform in the long run, but</li>
            <li>Just be careful with blade length while in sensitive areas, you WILL get nicked!</li>
            <li>I actually bought this trimmer a second time after the first one broke after a few months because the batteries leaked.</li>
            <li>The small size is easy to handle for hair down there.</li>
            <li>This neat little toy made things much easier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic offers a limited 2-year warranty!</li>
            <li>It its a good size not too big and not too small, so it can trim a larger area as opposed to the small little trimmer which would take twice the time.</li>

            <li> Once I cleaned out, it worked great again.</li>
            <li> tends to fly upward, so I find it cleanest to use this in the shower *with the water off,*</li>
            <li> This is a great value.</li>

            <li> love it, works great!!</li>
            <li> Reliable, great price, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Maybe people with skim and dainty pubic hair don&#x27;t need that kind of tool</li>
            <li> Used it and it felt awesome so better than a razor.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> I use the shaper and trimmer to help my wife look her best in today&#x27;s more revealing bathing suits.  </li>

            <li> Love that it has the attachment and is perfect for bikini region on lowest setting.</li>

            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> but it works good for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> this proved easier to maintain - and good cost savings too. .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bargain.  </li>
            <li> Did not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li> I could return this in good concious (after using it), I would -</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> A good deal for the product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap shaper and this one works real good</li>
            <li> This one is just as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews</li>
            <li> Battery life is good too.</li>
            <li> Good size, doesn&#x27;t snag or pinch.</li>
            <li> It was a great price, keeps everything trimmed nicely.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a really good trimmer</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Shaper &amp; Trimmer is a good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s so good that I even recommended it to my cousin and anyone</li>
            <li> Does a good job of triming the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it died.</li>
            <li> The trimmer lasts a fair amount of time before needing the batteries to be replaced.</li>
            <li> If you want to split the difference between looking like you have not gone through puberty yet, and looking like a feral guinea pig, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, sturdy build.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for what it is.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews and purchased it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped.......</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good price, but turns out I won&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i loved it..</li>
            <li> Noise level is good.</li>
            <li> Attractive color and nice weight.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it is going to be good.  </li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic trimmers before and they have always been good.</li>
            <li> Works good, though nicks sometimes.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon and got it based on its good reviews.</li>
            <li> He loved it and couldn&#x27;t find another one to replace it.</li>
            <li> and you will have a good result.</li>
            <li> This did the trick and keeps everything at a good length.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a good quality trimmer but just doesn&#x27;t cut it in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> It does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li> but this is good for the price.</li>
            <li> thought it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> The good, it trims well and doesn&#x27;t catch the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The not so good:  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be good for the shower</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> one must perhaps need to go all winter without trimming the bikini area to get good use of it.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic bikini trimmer does a good job of taming the bush.  </li>
            <li> The power level is good.</li>
            <li> This worked good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I changed batteries and seemed to work good again.</li>
            <li> I like that it takes batteries, rather than rechargeable because I don&#x27;t have good luck with rechargeable gadgets.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is compact with surprising power for two AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I wish I could show you how good I look.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> This was a good shaver when it worked.</li>
            <li> Great for pubes, works nice without pulling or not trimming.</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that the length is adjustable and I can get a fairly close shave without having to worry about razor burn!</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who like 1 to 2 mm of beard vs clean shave.</li>
            <li> Works great, trims consistently, battery life is excellent!</li>
            <li> Works great, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in your hand, its easy to use, and best of all it&#x27;s afforable and it DOESN&#x27;T hurt like maybe a wax would.</li>
            <li> After most of the hair was gone I was easily able to trim the landing strip I leave to the perfect manicured length.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for when your man is coming over and you need to get cleaned up quickly.</li>
            <li> For a pregnant person this is the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its function, size, and portability.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; trimmer, and it works great for my girlfriend, but I use it too, and we both love it.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with that and was able to see then</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very safe trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it, great product for my needs.</li>
            <li> works great, love this shaver..</li>
            <li> tidy seems like a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Safe, easy to use and works brilliantly!</li>
            <li> And this product is no way perfect (like the rather loud motor noise), but for the price this is great and I have nothing to complain.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the most well-made trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> But boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> This was outstanding!</li>
            <li> When I first got this bikini shaper it was great!</li>
            <li> Pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is sure to keep your lower pubic area neat and tidy!</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> And I know my partner is glad I stopped stealing his electric razor for the job!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmer is absolutely excellent and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> If you want to just trim some hair, be sure not to put in on closest shave!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this machine!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!  </li>
            <li> It cuts at a nice length (I use the shortest option) and is very safe from cuts.</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> The first one that we purchased, was bought over five years ago and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bikini trimmer!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It does its job for sure!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> What I like most about this shaver is it does not cut me!</li>
            <li> Glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with it anymore!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that is easy to use.</li>

            <li> Easy to use, light and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not some amazing thing that will change your life.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> used with baby powder as recommended by another review and worked amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing works amazingly.</li>
            <li> an amazing trimmer..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> But i gritted my teeth and started in -- it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This shaver has amazing reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, uses AA batteries, does a great job, and is compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s cordless, it trims, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely.</li>
            <li> Well, I can honestly say after doing MUCH research within the \\&quot;bikini hair-removing\\&quot; area, this was the best thing I could have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, until it broke now.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a case, so buy your own (I got a pencil case from Target for it).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just kind of clunky to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kind of have the OCD to cleanliness.</li>
            <li> I want to add my enthusiastic review to the chorus.</li>
            <li> nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This product is very well designed, and at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li> Being battery-operated was nice, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush it comes with is handy.  </li>
            <li> Nice for trimming the bikini area without shaving too closely to cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Nice power.</li>
            <li> Nice product that works well.  </li>
            <li> This shaper/trimmer is a nice tool to use to keep things tidy.</li>
            <li> and I can do it without thinking or honestly without even looking.</li>
            <li> but I like to keep my area nice and neat</li>
            <li> From the cheapest to the kind that&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the guard, but it is a nice option to have if you needed it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought some Gillette razor before I got him his own.  </li>
            <li> excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li> The wireless/battery situation is also nice.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer when it works.</li>
            <li> nice but</li>
            <li> Gets everything trimmed up and tidy</li>
            <li> Far superior to the Philips HP6376/10 Philips Bikini Perfect.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a nice ballsack trimming device</li>
            <li> The adjustable head is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> You basically have to pre-trim before using this vibrator thing to tidy up.  </li>
            <li> the built-in adjustable guide is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer because nothing makes you feel sexier than your husband lovingly telling you, &amp;#34;nice thigh-brows, honey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very durable and excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> i just use it to keep my lady parts tidy in-between waxes.  </li>
            <li> It &#x27;ll help to keep you nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Now it will be a pleasure instead of a chore to keep the bikini area neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice close trim without the itch.</li>

            <li> Great to use as a clean up beforehand tool.</li>
            <li> My problem was that I was not using it as directed, and also although they did specify a particular direction to cut in, I found best results going in every direction imaginable.</li>

            <li> other Panasonic shaver has been working great for over 12 years and my Panasonic cordless drills have been working great for over 20 years!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome machine, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, and does exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Works great, and I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, very quick and easy to get a neat bikini line.</li>
            <li> but I must say a very good Trimmer cuts very close)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great, economical option for me.</li>
            <li> By far the best bikini trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It worked okay when it worked, but was nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> and i love the neat and tidy results.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be honest, on some more</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I (as well as my husband) have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I had that for two years before it just wasn&#x27;t suitable to use in the shower anymore.</li>
            <li> very convenient, incredibly inexpensive for the performance, has continued to cut well for months, and it looks like replacement blades are affordable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I wanted so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a frequent trimmer and you need a perfect trim throughout</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but after shopping around, I picked the Panasonic since it was good value and seemed to have a good reputation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and painless!</li>
            <li> so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong after a year or so!</li>
            <li> Made tidy work of all excess hair on both of us and made for a fun foreplay activity exploring the nether regions!!</li>
            <li> The two occasions it worked, it was a great product-very fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, I&#x27;m happy to say that this trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Gives a good clean, sparse look on the shortest trim level.</li>
            <li> and i actually liked how it looked -- sooooo much neater -- and i was happy with it then.  </li>
            <li> But since it was very handy and convenient I ordered another one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly as the packaging says; it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great, but if you don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; of post trimming, then it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li> Great product, cuts evenly, yet gently!  </li>
            <li> Love this so much so easy !</li>
            <li> But it still works fine and never missed a beat!</li>
            <li> Ok so...most people have very fine, sparse hair..</li>
            <li> And the guard is on the head very securely so I don&#x27;t worry about any slips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap, you have to squeeze each side of the end piece to adjust it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, it works on batteries</li>
            <li> but this was very cheap.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to be made of very cheap material.</li>
            <li> It is very light to hold and contained all parts I paid for.</li>
            <li> This didnt give me any razor bumps and came out very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The size is great, love the guard, and it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it takes batteries instead of having to plug it in to charge, and the adjustable guard is handy &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use, gets the job done and leaves everything nice and neat.</li>
            <li> the guard comes off for easy cleaning, and it&#x27;s effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li> so the power is much better - it has a nice ,sleek shape and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works very smooth and felt really safe.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, does exactly what it is supposed to do: provide a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li> A huge relief when it comes to wearing swimsuits!</li>
            <li> Would not pay more than $10.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the one redeeming quality the trimmer has is that it did not give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lil device and bought extras for my daughters.</li>
            <li> so it is much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a bit more power</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a trimmer :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Nothing works better .</li>
            <li> I wish more items would be sold like this.</li>
            <li> I hope they never change this product - best personal shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Maybe a more streamlined shape and not so square an end would be better.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> You can take the guard off so it trims close, and use the guard to trim hair to the appropriate length.</li>
            <li> Powered through pretty successfully.</li>
            <li> Make sure you register the product so you can use the warranty.</li>
            <li> so it cuts more at once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 5 different types of trimmers over the years and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I remove the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch.  </li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works</li>
            <li> I love the price for it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you get batteries ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Trust me buy it and you will love it</li>
            <li> The plastic needs to be more \\&quot;anti-stat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all-around great product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes without the guard on and also shaving with cream and a razor, my overgrown bush now had become mostly smooth(with some prickly spots).</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love how you can adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this item.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I just received it and tried it out and am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I would surely recommend this product to anyone who is timid to blades around there pubic area.</li>
            <li> A LOT better on my areas</li>
            <li> I should have paid more money and bought a chargable type.</li>
            <li> I like the wahl much better, but I already bought this one.</li>
            <li> Stores seems better for some stuff.</li>
            <li> Now bump and irritation free!</li>
            <li> Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used it several times already, and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Ok guys, don&#x27;t get in a snit,  but yes I use this bikini shaver for my mustache and sideburns,  </li>
            <li> can I say, but this is one of my better buys</li>
            <li> pulls hair sometimes and does a ok trim, i don&#x27;t see how it being heated enhances it, i wish it won&#x27;t snag hair</li>
            <li> and she was satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> In love.</li>
            <li> But it sure does work.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this compared to the Braun Bikini Shaver.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic has more length settings to choose from and it&#x27;s made in Japan.  </li>
            <li> Better quality in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Also great for women who want to keep a gentle length and do not like the pro look.</li>
            <li> I somehow even managed to make myself bleed on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it ladies, we&#x27;ve all stared at our area helplessly with a pair of scissors in our hands, hoping something better would come along.</li>
            <li> If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion.</li>
            <li> You can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  </li>
            <li> plus is that it comes with a form showing you how you can order more parts if you need to.</li>
            <li> The top is adjustable and can come off for shaping up the edges</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this trimmer WHILE it worked</li>
            <li> I do, however, shave the bikini line and the area &amp;#34;that matters&amp;#34;, but up top, I use this on 1</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What more?</li>
            <li> these are the better ones out there in the market.</li>
            <li> this is definitely better.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This baby performs better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also appropriate for bikini season.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite trimmer still.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> wife has used it and likes the product says it is better than anything else she has used.</li>
            <li> I used another brand for many years without any problems.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> , I will agree that this doesn&#x27;t give you the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; look, but it sure gets close.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, to clean, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more for friends.</li>
            <li> but this could have been much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It trims better than a lot of trimmers that I have used.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Feeling safe while grooming in this area has never happened until I got this trimmer.</li>
            <li> but I make sure I don&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> There are better choices.</li>
            <li> Works great, very convenient</li>
            <li> I love being able to change batteries myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> , i used it many times with no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple years and use it more in the spring/summer as one would expect.</li>
            <li> This shaver was perfect, it doesn&#x27;t nick me, because since I can&#x27;t see, I am just moving it back and forth.</li>
            <li> I am even able to take the guards off.</li>
            <li> I just think that should have more attachments to adjust but for what I need is Ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> after buying i&#x27;m 100% sure to recommend this product to all..</li>
            <li> This is an OK trimmer.</li>
            <li> is a grand fiasco of foliculitis.  </li>
            <li> yeah, this is definitely the best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I had mine set at about 2 and trimmed off more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> But yeah, I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Two, I like to shave my bikini area more like a Brazilian type shave than just a bikini line.</li>
            <li> you for your answers! :3</li>
            <li> I definately recomend this product and have a feeling my husband might be borrowing it. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t detect any heat from it, nor am I sure why you would want a heated bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect for keeping things properly groomed without razor burn.</li>
            <li> it is that safe.</li>
            <li> After fighting shaving bumps for most of my life, I took the advice of my boyfriend and bought a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about getting this, as I was not to sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it before a trip that involved bathing suits and at 6 months I could not see below my tummy.  </li>
            <li> i felt safe using it.  </li>
            <li> I will be using it more and have already recommended it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Great purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The guards on it make sure that you won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the Clio</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love using it to trim my down-there.</li>
            <li> and it broke after I dropped it one too many times.</li>
            <li> I also love the that it is battery operated and does not use ac charger.</li>
            <li> I wont go into detail, but it does work well :)</li>
            <li> The Braun is excellent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product and I highly recommend it for both men and women!</li>
            <li> Much better than getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> We have used so many different brands, types and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, my husband loves this thing.</li>
            <li> But it got lost during my latest move, so</li>
            <li> Love that the attachment can be removed to use alone.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Battery operation MUCH more convenient than plug-in&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> I love this product , it is all I am going to use from now on.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment on my husbands electric razor works 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Really does great work on the legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li> One of the better ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> There are probably better ones out there</li>
            <li> It was working ok for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> Removed guard for most of my shaving.</li>
            <li> I like it much better then trying to cut with scissors or using a razor.  </li>
            <li> The guard also has nice smooth corners and doesn&#x27;t snag on looser skin.</li>
            <li> SURE NOT TO USE IT IN OR AROUND WATER BECAUSE IT WILL KILL THE MOTOR.</li>
            <li> Hair clings to the plastic by static electricity.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something more durable.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries in it, and even when they are fully charged this trimmer has started making more noise than it once did and seems like it&#x27;s struggling a bit more.</li>
            <li> Otherwise though, I love it.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t obtain it (safely).</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Shaving my bikini area seems more like torture...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am not 100% satisfied because it doesn&#x27;t do the job neatly.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I have had many bikini trimmers.</li>
            <li> more run-time:&lt;br /&gt;Battery</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it but it will have to be more often.</li>
            <li> It is simple to operate and serves its purpose perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I love this item..</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could tell you how wonderful this product is, especially since Dr. Oz himself recommended the thing on a show.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> and before I knew it, hair was trimmed low perfectly.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have stated, the guard is adjustable (or even removable, if need be).  </li>
            <li> Not that much better than the $10 bikini trimmers.</li>
            <li> and I used the lowest guard setting to trimmer the most of it.</li>
            <li> : )</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean, the battery life seems good, its an appropriate size/weight and seems like a quality machine.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has lasted me many years.  </li>
            <li> Love it, works great and is very powerful compared to the kind I used to use and a much wider top</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its supposed to do... TRIM!!!</li>
            <li> you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> So far so good with this trimmer for taking care of the bikini area!</li>
            <li> you get a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming and even does a decent job shaving.    </li>
            <li> fabulous product, very easy to use</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use and safe.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very light.  </li>
            <li> Used it to shave my head, very smooth shave and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products but am so happy with this product that I felt compelled to do so.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in January 2010 and loved it the from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s been working pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I was on the search for a good trimmer and this one works very well!</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday and just as good as the first one.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for a battery-operated trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I guess 2 years is a pretty good run nowadays.  </li>
            <li> I got mine a long time ago and it is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Trims perfectly and lasts a long time even with Alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li> Has lasted me a while on its first batteries with biweekly use and good maintenance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect little handy device.</li>
            <li> and it DEFINITELY isn&#x27;t worth the price!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 3 years now, and the original batteries still work!</li>
            <li> I love the attachment and this is so easy to use since it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
            <li> Easy, fool proof, and safe.</li>
            <li> Safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is really easy too use, and it doesn&#x27;t have too many features.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was able to get everything trimmed fairly easily.</li>
            <li> The top comes off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best bilkini trimmer available.  </li>
            <li> The guard is good with the different levels for length and the battery life is also good.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from the Panasonic brand, which is normally superb, and this isn&#x27;t the cheapest trimmer out there.</li>
            <li> Honestly I had low expectations when I ordered the product, but with all the great reviews this Panasonic trimmer has received I figured what the heck</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and nice range of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li> so easy to get a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> dont like being clean shaven because that region develops ingrown VERY easily for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean, as well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re patient you could cut your own hair and save the money on the very first use,&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and its nice that I can set the length for a closer or set trim.</li>
            <li> As is the description, doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave because it is a trimmer, but definitely does an excellent job as a trimmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it worked perfectly, it wasnt a totally clean close shave, but if it was you&#x27;d risk ingrown hairs and this removes the risk entirely!</li>
            <li> It does a very good, even job and has 5 different settings so that you can have the hair length you prefer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better option than shaving, but it won&#x27;t do 100% smooth shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size - slim and light, feels good in the hand, not too loud.  </li>
            <li> Great for decreasing thickness and maintaining hair without getting rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This bikini shaper has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this would be ok for touching up, but I won&#x27;t be using it when I need to get the full \\&quot;haircut\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it works great so far.  </li>
            <li> I would use it for trimming and touching up, not for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and so far she says it works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect length and not too rough.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Panasonic trimmer that worked great for years.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap bikini razor for years that worked much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I was like, how come so many people thought this was fantastic</li>
            <li> This works great for potentially sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It does sound like a vibrator, but honestly there are so many workarounds for problems like that that it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> with a hand mirror available, and without a top on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a product like this before, so I can&#x27;t really provide a good review here without something to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done without leaving any nicks or cuts, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on contours.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for something good and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, and for the price it is definitely a good buy if you don&#x27;t care too much about length, because, in my experience, adjusting the head for trimming doesn&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the largest/longest trimmer head would be good for thinning but all the heads are really shavers...</li>
            <li> But good stainless steel trimmer.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is great to use as a moisturizer afterward, 100% natural and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for keeping things tidy down there, it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> really could not be more satisfied with this purchase!  </li>
            <li> Probably the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Super easy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer, does the job wonderfully and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Having used other body hair trimmers and razors, I can say at this price point, this is the best.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really easy to use</li>
            <li> The trim settings are easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Made my life easy.</li>
            <li> The easy to clean design makes it even better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not meant to be used with the plastic head and does easily pull/cut at the skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Who knew bikini line maintenance could be this easy?</li>
            <li> Its easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and painfree.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works fantastically with the guard head on, trims easily without snagging.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as easily and</li>
            <li> Easy to store and would be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans so easily</li>
            <li> My sideburns grow very quickly and curl out so that I look like I have wings, set this at number two and with one swipe makes them look as if I just came from a barber shop.  </li>
            <li> But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Just take it easy around your bits.  </li>
            <li> The shape makes it easy to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easier to store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works really well to keep everything nice and neat :-)  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, just slide the switch.</li>
            <li> Easy to change comb length.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The upside is it&#x27;s not a noticeable bruise, so still more attractive than red bumps on porcelain skin!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> Works well, easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>

            <li> It allows for easy use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick.</li>
            <li> Works well, fits in hand well, and easy to change length of trim.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to figure out and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Goes through batteries very quick.</li>
            <li> Very quick.</li>
            <li> Not only is it worth the price, the results it delivers is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t harm my lady bits.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use..</li>
            <li> Easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have had this since 2005, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this five years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver that is very comfortable in the hand and shaves nice and close without nicking .</li>
            <li> It works ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This works great as a ladies personal trimmer, no nicks, good speed and easy to use, but it really didn&#x27;t trim as close as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend happily bought this for me, upon request, when I decided I wanted to try going bare.</li>
            <li> In general, a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall a great trimmer if you not worrying about nicks is the most important thing you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works fine, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good product due to the \\&quot;Good Housekeeping\\&quot; seal of approval.  </li>
            <li> This allows me an tidy look which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m trimming down there, I want to be using the best and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year now and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> It works fine but for some reason the shape and design just feels clunky to me.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive trimmer that does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I used it once, and the battery power was fine.  </li>
            <li> The product lives up to its description and does a fine job of that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a  extremely light weight.</li>
            <li> That being said, this thing works for my mankini area just fine, but be forewarned: it&#x27;s no industrial strength weed eater.</li>
            <li> so i could use another shaver for fine tuning.</li>
            <li> But i decided 1/2 inch was fine</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to use.</li>
            <li> For women, or men, out there who want their hair finely trimmed, leaving the guard on defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> very quick, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as a cheap plugin trimmer I have, but still works well.</li>
            <li> I am super pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was easy to assemble and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, powerful motor, SAFE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, etc.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li> However FABULOUS for keeping things clean &amp; super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Makes everything very easy and fast!  </li>
            <li> If you like a little \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming, this is definitely a great buy!  </li>
            <li> This little shaver is a wonderful (and under budget!)</li>
            <li> This little thing is perfect.</li>
            <li> This little diddy is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect little tool.  </li>
            <li> This little machine is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This particular razor was great for the first 3 uses.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer... gives a nice close finish without pulling or pain.</li>
            <li> It work great and the best part for me it shaves as close as I like without leaving bumps or cutting myself as would happen with a razor.</li>
            <li> There is one HUGE CON -</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to hold, which is important for those of us with carpal tunnel syndrome, and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hairy at all, so I didn&#x27;t think I needed something that was huge and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth pubic area, this is not for you, because it doesn&#x27;t get razor close.  </li>
            <li> Simple design, no flash and a great product.</li>
            <li> works great for men&#x27;s private areas, too!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get a smooth shave, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> It is simply a trimmer that is great for maintenance.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t cut my skin (unlike a horrid Remington one I had), it gave me a close trimming, and I could clean it easily.</li>
            <li> Was it perfectly smooth?</li>
            <li> so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be a smooth shave, but I was hoping it would leave stubble, and not just shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, but I have to clean it twice during each use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in your hand and the trimmer guide works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer from Amazon in 2002 and have happily used it until it just decided to die on me recently.</li>
            <li> This was very helpful in keeping things neat in between many MANY doctor visits and huge for money saving when Bliss charges $70 and up for a wax</li>
            <li> I bought this product after comparing similar items and reading reviews and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I put some baby powder on my skin before using this and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> it is worth of its cost.i love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Great price since I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It does not pull hair, is ouchless and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> And,,, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, though I really wish it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well on cheap batteries.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They work great also but it takes forever and they rust if you do not care for them properly.</li>
            <li> I was justified in my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It was also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like the look of this trimmer, very sleek and has nice grips to hold it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to razor shave it smooth.</li>
            <li> No, you will not be smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works great and the batteries last for ages.</li>
            <li> it shaves close, easy to clean and no hair bumps.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it won&#x27;t get you totally smooth or bald.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more fun if you have your partner help.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the best trimmer I have used, and I have used quite a few.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, very sturdy and performs nicely.</li>
            <li> It gets as close as I like and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great to just trim the downstairs especially for the summer. ^_^</li>
            <li> Will it remove all of the hair leaving you porn star smooth?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at taming the forest when it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim very well and it kind of hurts or tugs at the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is quite, trims well with no pulling or irritation, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the purchase, for the price.</li>
            <li> Works smoothly.</li>
            <li> Easy to take apart and clean out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t substitute for shaving because it doesn&#x27;t get that close, but great for overall trimming.</li>
            <li> Great personal shaver.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Reviews I read said if you took the guard off you could get really smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Does the job of trimming me and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the cheap rotary shaver I have.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make you as smooth as a bikini wax, or</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful trimmer on the market by any means.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and comes with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product that does the job well.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product.  </li>
            <li> Omits a fabulous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Using it as the primary tool will feel like having a toothy hamster go to town on your business.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even make a sound.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price- not like the cheap pencil thin $7 ones</li>
            <li> But I liked it so much that I purchased another one.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great concept but defiantly on the pricey side especially when it snags and pull hair!</li>
            <li> Do not speak smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Works really great, the adjustable guard makes it so you can trim up howver short</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a day, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice, very well trimmed and groomed areas.</li>
            <li> If you want to go completely smooth, then you will need to wax.</li>
            <li> Was easy to put together for use and clean.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But this is fantastic, none of those issues (of course this doesn&#x27;t shave, just trim)</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maneuver.</li>
            <li> so far....I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It does not give you a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I was initially scared to use this, but after reading the reviews, I was like &amp;#34;oh, I can do this too!&amp;#34; I was able to neatly trim it rather quickly...and nicely, I might add :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth knowing. :)</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m used to something buzzing between my legs, I&#x27;m quite comfortable with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its cheap and for reason.</li>
            <li> Batterie powered so you can take them in the shower (without the water running) for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of trimming to the same length.  </li>
            <li> it really is the next best thing to shaving.</li>
            <li> The guard does a good job at keeping area trimmed short and safe from nicks.</li>
            <li> Trimming action is good for the price we pay.</li>
            <li> I was then able to use another shaver for a clean look for a quick vacation at the beach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome two double A batteries and its ready to rock...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this awesome trimmer at least 20 times (too many to count)</li>
            <li> Works good so far.  </li>
            <li> good, solid product and made in Japan  :-)  </li>
            <li> So far, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> this is a very gud trimmer, very easy to use and since it is a trimmer, not a shaver,results are fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product because its the right size and doesn&#x27;t cut you or grab at you like others do.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t experienced any pulling while the different settings work well and gives a clean and precise shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> pulling at my hairs and just generally not doing a great job of trimming.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for getting a nice close shave without the razor burn I normally experience from a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Very easy and safe to use, i agree with other review every lady should own one of this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know why the product is labeled &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; since it clearly is not.&lt;br /&gt;However, I love the product and it feels safe and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It makes it quick and easy to take care of the lady business.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to the extent</li>
            <li> You will not get a quick, easy once-over trim with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is quick, easy, painless, since it doesn&#x27;t catch the skin and is something I wished I had purchased years ago.  </li>
            <li> And its super easy as its battery operated.</li>
            <li> Works as described and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy and quickly to use.</li>
            <li> Zero pulling, zero room for error, quick, easy, lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It the perfect size, not too large, but big enough that I covers good &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; while shaving.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and very affective, at keeping the nether regions well groomed.</li>
            <li> A great tool, especially while pregnant.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> Trims real close quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller, good quality, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so easy, fast, and safe to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to clean with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my original one broke after years of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great, and it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li> Great as long as you use the guard.</li>
            <li> Avoiding debilitating razor burn is worth it!</li>
            <li> I usually have the best luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> , IT IS SO EASY FAST CLEAN AND NEAT,, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so much that I had to write a review!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more consistent and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> A very safe way to trim a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure everyone shaves their vag in the shower.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty close, which I&#x27;m glad to see.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So worth buying!  </li>
            <li> It makes a sound like &amp;#34;i will rip your skin off moahha&amp;#34; but it is really not painful at all.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and was soo excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> its small, no cord, and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long time now, and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, light and shaves just the right length.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, though, those issues are very minor, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as clean and snappy of a job as I thought it would be,</li>
            <li> I wish it were waterproof though.... that would make clean up easier.</li>
            <li> I can stay and feel clean using this product alone.</li>
            <li> Gentle, efficient, and really makes the region look good.</li>
            <li> My super calloused feet are now smooth.</li>
            <li> No wonder why this is one of the most popular personal trimmers that I have researched online.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Clean Cut</li>
            <li> do go ahead and clean the blades, yes</li>
            <li> Keeps me neat and clean.</li>
            <li> Helps me feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is not a razor so do not expect to be completely clean shaven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I tried taking it apart to clean it out and broke it, so I&#x27;d not recommend that.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; trim.  </li>
            <li> However, if you just want to clean up your areas and keep it neat</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect it to clean off everything.</li>
            <li> If you dont want a complete bald shave and want to trim the pubic area as close as possible this is perfect.</li>
            <li> but it will clean up the area for waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> so how are you supposed to clean it after you use it?</li>
            <li> Just try to keep water out of the inside and if it does happen or fills with hair, just clean it out.</li>
            <li> and that would be pretty dang exciting... and more ecological and economical for me, too!</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;m loving being so neat -- and am not missing the experience or the price of getting waxed!  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product and works very well for multiple trim levels even very short not quit shaven smoot, but good.</li>
            <li> SO happy to have finally find this product, tried others but they just weren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> Great little hair trimmer, light, easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, very precise and seems quite safe.&lt;br /&gt;There are different options about hair</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use though you have to make the hair stand up right under the blade for it to cut.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, trims just right amount.</li>
            <li> but I think for the price having working fine for 5 years is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliating, lotions, special shaving cream, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to clean</li>
            <li> Up until it got wet, it did a great job as a grooming aid</li>
            <li> The adjustable attachment for the blade is a nice feature and lets you control exactly how much you want to remove.  </li>
            <li> personally was hoping it&#x27;d mimic the results of shaving, so I took off the guard head and used it that way and surprisingly</li>
            <li> It arrived early which is always nice.</li>
            <li> Good, basic, durable.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and so far it is still working after six months.</li>
            <li> Use clipper disinfecting spray like Andis Cool Care Plus after using.</li>
            <li> I just won&#x27;t be able to give you much advise as mine didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that the product actually met my expectations!  </li>
            <li> Okay I really don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but I was compelled to write this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this, not expecting much, but BOY am I glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Solid construction good color.</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you lose that top part or drop it and accidentally step on it or something, you&#x27;re gonna wanna replace just that part instead of the whole trimmer.</li>
            <li> But is does trim close enough to give you a good alternative rather than shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li> The reviews turned out to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for more than a year on one set of batteries and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> If you put this on the closest shave, you will get just about as good as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for a full shave.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have loved if they added is a storing case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a workhorse or a full shave.</li>
            <li> Returned for full refund.  </li>
            <li> Might be good if it had actually worked longer.  </li>
            <li> This works really quickly and cleanly for maintenance grooming.</li>
            <li> Also quick to clean.</li>
            <li> It cuts just close enough and all at a good price.</li>
            <li> t works very well and has battery power for or more shaves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely painful</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe what a quick and clean job it did.  </li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer does a good job overall.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the free shipping.</li>
            <li> it takes a really long time and a lot of your own added coercion for it to pick up most of your hairs to pull them into its blades.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews for this product before I bought it and most were positive and the price was decent</li>
            <li> I love this very much and it is very gentle</li>
            <li> Powerful, consistent, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up (to my knowledge), but other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li> I want it but other than that it&#x27;s great, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I CANT LIVE WITHOUT THIS TRIMMER! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The first time it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li> i can quickly trim unwanted hair all over.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get a super close shave</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t seen many similar products (most are razors, not adjustable trimmers), I decided to try and replace the one I already had.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to ANY pregnant woman.  </li>
            <li> Nice design, great user experience, but poor quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived super quickly too.</li>
            <li> As a longtime shaver and waxer, I switched to trimming when I became pregnant and could no longer see.</li>
            <li> this device works quickly , painlessly and  does just what you want it to do-cleans up the area so that you won&#x27;t be embarrassed by unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and bought this machine to avoid waxing at the time.</li>
            <li> Although that was great for the nooks and crannies, I much prefer the size of this one for regular maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a perfect trimmer though, especially for the bikini area that shaves closer without occasional nicks or cuts.   </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> it does get super close to the skin, though.  </li>
            <li> It trimmed very well and is easy to clean it too.</li>
            <li> Hygienic and QUICK.</li>
            <li> (When you&#x27;re 6 months pregnant, out of sight is out of mind).</li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipping to NZ.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I was pregnant</li>
            <li> For those looking to get super close</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a combo with a razor), but they always died out quickly</li>
            <li> sometimes I&#x27;ll need to use a comb to stand the hair up quickly followed by the trimmer.</li>
            <li> You could go completely bare by going over that with a razor, but this looks pretty good in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This got pretty good reviews, better than other shavers, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, love the different lengths to choose from, love the narrow size for good angling to get that bikini weather short trim!!</li>
            <li> Love this product: small, cute and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good little beast, definitely would recommend for lighter use than what we put it through though lol</li>
            <li> My request to man or female purchase this product .. 5 stars really its very nice</li>
            <li> The clipper (Definately not a shaver) does a great job, but the batteries wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and gets a good trim down.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little trimmer that I have found to be very useful - it doesn&#x27;t cut too close (nor does it completely clear all hair), but it does just what it is supposed to (which is trim hair).  </li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Its a smooth ride ;)</li>
            <li> Compared to other trimmers I have owned, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use on even the most private areas and to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very safe, so you can use close to the very private areas.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased</li>
            <li> Everything was nice, neat, and barely there.</li>
            <li> but I definitely liked my other trimmer better.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it won&#x27;t give you a completely smooth shave, but if you just want to trim this product is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> this is great for keeping things down there under control.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and is not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and more durable than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I love using my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great, just as expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> easy to use, very functional.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> although there are plenty of good reviwes for this item ( and that was the reason I have orderd this) but it cut my skin every single time that i used it.</li>
            <li> After having looked for years to something like this, I bought it to dity up and it is absolutely fab!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> this your first time?&amp;#34; - Ha!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> Only thing that could make it better would be if it was water resistant!</li>
            <li> After reading all other reviews and after trying it for myself, I can honestly say EVERYONE IS 100% CORRECT!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, too!!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I&#x27;d hoped it would!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to take apart for cleaning, and it&#x27;s pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> This trimmer, as a trimmer, is fantastic it has lasted for about year so far is still running strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I love that it has the different settings.</li>
            <li> I like that it has multiple lengths, and it is also very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> You get a clean, even trim, so much easier than what it used to be!</li>
            <li> I clean the head thoroughly between uses with either hot soapy water or just pouring alcohol on the trimmer head and the shaver.</li>
            <li> This does the job just fine, but you have to remove the guard to get any real work done.</li>
            <li> I want more power, so I&#x27;ll buy a second one, but if you want mild trimming, this product is good enough.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got this great little number system by the way,</li>
            <li> Love the little brush that comes with it that helps keep it tidy.</li>
            <li> This little thing is way more effective and reliable than my rechargeable trimmers were.  </li>
            <li> Great for expecting mothers or anyone whose had a mishap using scissors down there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing you could use it for other areas of the body, like trimming sideburns or neck hair, if you wanted to, making it versatile, cheap, quick and effective.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product so much quicker then shaving.</li>
            <li> Very close and precise shave or adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> If you are anti apilator and waxing, this trimmer is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used this handy contraption several times since purchase and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This one is powerful and it seems durable.</li>
            <li> Worth every</li>
            <li> In all seriousness though, having used it twice at this point, it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> good design, simple and work very well.</li>
            <li> I can use it without worrying about hairs being pulled or skin being caught even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I liked what it did the one and only time it worked, though!</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Useful for keep you fresh for the week.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies, but this product is gentle and effective for the bikini line.</li>
            <li> Its also fun to take in who&#x27;s turn is it to get pampered.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re left to figure out on your own how to get them in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ditched my old one and got this one.</li>
            <li> Over the years, in search for perfect shaving, ~$4000 spent in experimenting; only Panasonic shavers came close to DE razors for acceptable results.</li>
            <li> and I thought maybe something with a  smaller head would be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is so much better than my old trimmer, a Remington rechargable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take the bulk off the fur off, especially if I intend on shaving smooth later.</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t uber sensitive, maybe you will have better luck, but I won&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> The shaper and trimmer is a simple, yet effective design.</li>
            <li> So useful (I don&#x27;t know how I survived before this thing).</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush is a nice accessory as it helps get the tiny hairs out of the blades.</li>
            <li> Not so fun when you&#x27;re trimming your pubic area.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have any tools to put in or take off and that it is especially designed for bikini hair.</li>
            <li> One, It looks like a really nice trimmer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> so I decided to go more natural.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products like this one and the Panasonic is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Now my wife can keep her enormous bush nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li> For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong motor - decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update August 2013: bought a replacement because the razor seemed to be dulling, was taking quite a bit longer to get the same results, kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that a case/bag would be nice, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got more power than my old trimmers and because of the design</li>
            <li> I like to keep as neat and tidy as possible.  </li>
            <li> As many others have noted, this is *not* going to give you the amazingly soft, post-professional wax feel.  </li>
            <li> It requires batteries which is nice because you can take it anywhere without a plug yanking you back.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Like most or all of the other reviewers, I love this.</li>
            <li> So many other better products on the market.</li>
            <li> I though not 100% safe trimming but much better than other ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The more pregnant I got, the less I was able to...uh...see things...</li>
            <li> My first one and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Gets you nice and clean with minimal irritation and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I know its not really meant to give you a nice clean close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fast and easy and great for my sensitive skin that would always get red and bumpy after shaving with a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I got it after reading all the other reviews and I have to agree with everyone about how good a trimmmer it is.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the how close the blade gets to the skin, it would be nice to get a really close clip, but the 1/4&amp;#34; is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleasantly surprised to try this product and take advantage of how unbelievably easy and smooth this trimmer makes the entire process (as well as the end result).  </li>
            <li> This product is high-quality and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price was right and does the job.</li>
            <li> The shaver didn&#x27;t pull at my skin -- you have to hold it right</li>
            <li> This shaver is just the right size for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a bunch of money for those trimmers where you switch combs, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The adjustment setting are just right.</li>
            <li> Except I end up nicking myself every time if I don&#x27;t put it against the skin at the right angle.</li>
            <li> She is right.</li>
            <li> they were right.</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t use this right away because I had to buy Batteries (btw, you need batteries for this...)</li>
            <li> gone through a bunch to find the right one.</li>
            <li> Also, I should note that as someone who has sensitive skin, I was able to get a pretty darn close shave without any razor burn, rashes, or ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li> For lazy days, remove the top cap and it becomes nice shaver that gives the looks of one-day shave.</li>
            <li> I suffer from terrible razor burn and ingrown hair after shaving, so this has been a pleasant and welcome relief to keeping my bikini area tidy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really couldn&#x27;t find anything to clean up the area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to clean and keep from getting clogged.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> A great little trimmer that will work for anyone&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works great, have multiple razor level options (0 to 5), small and light weight, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Works great, may buy a second one for my guy so he can clean up if he wants, it has different settings on the guard that are all useful</li>
            <li> (My previous trimmer had cost 1/4 as much and lasted 15 years -- and worked great.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get through a whole shave with out having to stop and allow it to cool.</li>
            <li> There must be a pretty good little motor inside, because it does the job quickly and well, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product, trims hair down there no problem.</li>
            <li> but suffice to say this little guy keeps you nice and neat...and no annoying cords get in the way.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> and Panasonic wants to charge you more than the original cost of the entire set....</li>
            <li> I only recently had to replace it and was so happy when I found it on Amazaon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair from the trim end and the battery seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well and is completely painless so you are able to get into hard-to-reach crevices.</li>
            <li> I think the spring metal that forms the on/off switch is too soft and corrodes too easily.  </li>
            <li> I would never be outgoing enough to go get a wax, nor brave enough to do it myself.</li>
            <li> Sometimes had problems actually turning on despite fully charged batteries, but overall it worked great.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first 4 times but it completely died!</li>
            <li> Only used once, but it was fine!</li>
            <li> My main concern was safety!!  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle too.</li>
            <li> wife like it very much.</li>
            <li> Wife tried it and said it just would not cut very much so she quit.</li>
            <li> Back to order a new one because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Panasonic uses high speed and a special blade design on these so they do not pinch or bruise.</li>
            <li> It is not so loud, but I do not like color, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> --I can see why it&#x27;d be useful to trip a beard a certain length,</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to replace an older trimmer that I had that just didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power to give a good trim - this one is far superior to my other one -</li>
            <li> We have special clippers for the dogs which I would NOT want near my jewels!!</li>
            <li> Good little shaver</li>
            <li> I found this to be a good little shaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to trim to various lengths.  </li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach places</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little bulky and not the easiest to maneuver but does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> Its a small light weight trimmer which is easy to use and quite portable, making it easy to take it with you while travelling.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten specifically for the bikini area</li>
            <li> I used it at it&#x27;s lowest setting with the guard first and then cleaned up without the guard.</li>
            <li> -it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I got a pretty close shave that way.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first bikini shaver/trimmer I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> The guard is nice but does not shave as close as I would like, so I just remove the guard and shave carefully to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s ManGroomer works better for following the curves in.</li>
            <li> I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to trim as short as I want.  </li>
            <li> I think that the 11 years of use I got out of it was acceptable (and it cost $10 more back when I got it)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing and could NEVER go back to razors alone.</li>
            <li> After reading loads of reviews, I was pretty keen to buy as a replacement for my Braun FG 1100, which I&#x27;d had for ages.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only the mons that get irritated, so you might try that to get the smoothest results where it counts most :</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> ;-).</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaper and trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 5 years</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my personal Panasonic Bikini Shaper and Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> It seems as if Panasonic cares about its reputation and most likely reviewed and tested it thoroughly before sale.</li>
            <li> Minimal tugging and nice results.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li> This bikini shaper is much better than the last one I used.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was made for.</li>
            <li> I decided on this one after reading several customer reviews, and am very pleased with it thus far.  </li>
            <li> The first one of these I purchased came apart inside.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering because I thought I&#x27;d just revert back to razors, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently and love it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Panasonic items &amp; have absolutely no complaints with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Only cons I noticed are if your using the guarded the hair must be straight or you have to go over it multiple times which isn&#x27;t a problem for me because most times I don&#x27;t even use the guarded.</li>
            <li> This was the first trimmer I had ever bought.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer that I bought stopped working after I accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> the most basic trimmer that you can get.  </li>
            <li> and I had lost the brush with the first trimmer I bought</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Gets a bit hot.</li>
            <li> Wish there was something magic that wasn&#x27;t fraught with the possibility of bodily injury.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This must be a much higher quality shaver.  </li>
            <li> It does not remove all the hair, like a razor, but it get pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly how stated in the product description.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve definitely paid more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it takes regular batteries instead of being charged - anytime I need to use it</li>
            <li> Only thing that would make this better would be a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> and it still works as well as the first day.  </li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying: I&#x27;m a dude.</li>
            <li> I need to use it once every week to keep it consistent.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my first one within a year</li>
            <li> actually don&#x27;t use the purple top.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> It took many passes over the same area to do anything.</li>
            <li> It is not as nice as I expected</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb like attachment on top lets you choose between 4 different hair lengths.</li>
            <li> It does get a bit hot</li>
            <li> First thought my trimmer wasn&#x27;t working when I first put batteries in because it was already on the on switch.</li>
            <li> Works better for coarse kinky hair (4c hair).</li>
            <li> When i first started using this trimmer</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the help!</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this product out and used it the first day.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> A grown person with actual pubes, however, will be better off using duct tape.  </li>
            <li> The bikini shaper and trimmer works quiet well for trimming the bikini area and more</li>
            <li> but I love that u can choose different lengths would definately recommend</li>
            <li> If you are looking to be completely hair free; I suggest a brazilian wax or comparable procedure as this is a trimmer not a stripper.  </li>
            <li> I had the first one for about two years</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I had bought a Panasonic bikini shaper / trimmer, and it lasted many years.</li>
            <li> When I first did, after praying all saints for strength, I found myself so surprise</li>
            <li> but my first one was on a charger and the charger mysteriously stopped fitting and wouldn&#x27;t charge</li>
            <li> At first, I was uncertain how to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve had so I cannot compare to others.</li>
            <li> But it works and keeps a charge more than 2 mins which was the problem I had with the last shaper I had.</li>
            <li> It still works as well as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> Love this and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the product description says what it will do.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t scream modern woman, hear me roar!  </li>
            <li> and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what i need it to.</li>
            <li> This review is bases on my first use.</li>
            <li> I do not feel it is a trimmer that can be used to properly groom , or more like</li>
            <li> It stopped working after first use...</li>
            <li> First it forgets where it&#x27;s supposed to grow, then it starts growing where it&#x27;s not suppose to grow.  </li>
            <li> First against the hair growth, then from the inside toward the out.  </li>
            <li> this is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a skin-close cut, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use several bikini trimmers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s smaller</li>
            <li> first time I purchased a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first trimmer</li>
            <li> for the Bikini area, it was EXACTLY what you would hope to be.  </li>
            <li> I have more coarse hair</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will not look for an alternative</li>
            <li> It came exactly as the package indicated.</li>
            <li> only wished it was rechargeable or waterproof,  but that would cost more</li>
            <li> The short setting is perfectly safe with the guard of course.</li>
            <li> I was okay with trying something different for the plumbing repair</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, spend an extra $10 and buy a slightly better one.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over a year...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has several setting for different lengths, comes with a slipcase, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.      </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if your looking for that super close trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get it completely smooth but the surface feels like if you would have shaved the day before with the little prickly hair which is fine for me!</li>
            <li> I even needed a quick touch up on my legs before going out and it left me looking and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> If you want to experiment; buy this one, cheap and open all  parts and see, clean, and close - capable.</li>
            <li> I really kind of scared to use this since I had prior nightmares with razors and shavers, but wow!</li>
            <li> Now remember its for people that don&#x27;t want a really close shave that its completely shaven , but that&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimmer attachment  is essential for a nice, painless trim (you don&#x27;t want to go wacking away at lengthier hairs without trimming them down first), and allows for better shaping.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has many different length settings, which is also appreciated, and the attachment that adjusts for length very sturdy (not so with my old remington, where I broke one of the attachments fairly easily after about 2 years of use).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries, and I usually use it for about 5 minutes or so each time I trim, once a week, so, the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> So most of the hair is still laying flat and doesn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good value - seems to work well, though I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;ve even recommended it to several of my girlfriends, who have been equally as pleased.</li>
            <li> what a good little trimmer this really was.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised since the plastic is obviously VERY flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> makes hair soft and clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried it mostly dressed and sitting on the toilet - which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you&#x27;re into picking fuzz out of</li>
            <li> I love mine so much, I am buying a second for our vacation home.</li>
            <li> That makes this as good as the drug store razor/trimmers but more expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO much easier than regular shaving, and I&#x27;ve never been able to stand waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull hair, completely painless &amp; no razor bumps, the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very useful altough not as effective as I was expecting, it&#x27;s kinda hard for it to catch shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I have more than received my monies worth from the first and expect the same from this new one,  very flexible to use.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and small, so it&#x27;s easy to use and customize.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Overall, a really great, inexpensive little trimmer -- does what it says in a pretty short time, and gives many options.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is much wider than other bikini trimmers, which means I can trim more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I just love the way this little hand held shaver that helps me to feel &#x27;kept clean&#x27; in an area that isn&#x27;t in view to anyone else to see but me.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick and makes grooming pretty satisfying since it makes everything even.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect (and powerful) bikini trimmer, easy to handle for smaller hands like mine, and gets into the creases and tight spots without any trouble.</li>
            <li> That was a mistake, it barely trims and is made cheaply.</li>
            <li> Really dissapointing as this is the first bikini trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go totally bare and smooth, and was looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is the first trimmer I have ever tried and I am really content with it.</li>
            <li> I want to make sure we have it around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Slick, Sleek, and good for a man.</li>
            <li> It will trim super super short if you remove attachment, doesn&#x27;t pull &amp; isn&#x27;t painfull at all.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to have hair down in those nether regions but keep it looking trim and tidy.</li>
            <li> This product is fine if you just wanted to trim down the bikini area but not if you want it smooth for swim suit season.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it but feel I may have to get out a mirror and work hard to move exactly with the way the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, even with this fault.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re looking for a pain-free, easy way to get rid of the bikini line that won&#x27;t kill your wallet (because that&#x27;s a big deal when you&#x27;re in college like I am)</li>
            <li> simple, easy and adjustable.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased- especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Fast but got hot fast.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use, does what it says.</li>
            <li> Saves time, easy to use, no bumps and this is coming from someone who has tried numerous products.</li>
            <li> Trims sensitive areas quickly without nicking skin.</li>
            <li> i was really surprised at how quickly it was getting the hair off, zip, zip...</li>
            <li> I decided I did not want anymore bikini waxing and needed to resort to trimming myself, This was easy to use and shaved just enough.</li>
            <li> It is imperative that you use the trimmer on a completely dry area for a better shave, and use baby powder or cornstarch.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, it has 5 &amp;#34;sizes&amp;#34; of trimming and you only need 2</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I use it to get as close as possible and then i go over the area with my razor, its a very quick once over.  </li>
            <li> Also love how you can shave dry, so you can touch up whenever.  </li>
            <li> I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I just got a new one because basically this little thing does a good job.</li>
            <li> I chose this one due to the high amount of positive reviews, but I haven&#x27;t liked this one at all.</li>
            <li> I am a large, tall woman, who had difficulty shaving my genital area with a razor.</li>
            <li> Oh well... maybe I got a dud, but one thing is certain:</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all, it is too large for the area of use.</li>
            <li> If I had to recommend a trimmer to any of my friends I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I could see where this could plow through a large quantity of longer hair quite well</li>
            <li> It took MANY passes over the same areas and pulling the skin very taut, sometimes holding hairs straight up to get them to go through the guard, to get a half-way decent trim.</li>
            <li> Its nice and small so it fits right in your purse or bag in case you need a touch up.</li>
            <li> But this trimmer works really well, has different settings and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this to anyone (guy or gal) who wants to stay tidy down there.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for me, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to regular use.</li>
            <li> Trims to various lengths, and I can even use while 8 months pregnant without looking~!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a decent and affordable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I am not a serious biniki trimmer-type girl, but I found this product to do wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, fits easily in the hand and is easy to store, since it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little shaver.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer helps you keep your pubic hedges nice and neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this little tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for trimming but getting along the sides for actually hair removal..not very close at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a shave and wants one fast without the pain of a wax!</li>
            <li> I must say though that I do like the 1/4 inch length and will probably keep that for my everyday look, but am really happy to have the option to go really low when i need to.  </li>
            <li> While it does a good job of trimming the hair, it is REALLY bad about yanking the hair and catching my skin.</li>
            <li> I try to work with it very carefuly and gently but still in injure my skin.</li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is very versatile...</li>
            <li> Works really well for trimming up.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I expected for the cost.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have found the Panasonic ES246AC Shaper &amp; Trimmer to be a very valuable tool when performing all tasks associated with shaping/trimming.</li>
            <li> I use it gently and don&#x27;t press.  </li>
            <li> Guard keeps it from getting really close.  </li>
            <li> It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain.  </li>
            <li> The size and style is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> It does not work very well and does not shave well either.</li>
            <li> It gets very close, but without any pain, irritation or bumps.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does work if you have a lot of hair to remove, otherwise, not so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price this is absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely dislike it.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get you completely smooth, but it will go as close as possible without any damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it could make it completely smooth, but that probably brings back irritation issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I can&#x27;t believe I had been using a normal razor all this</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> but I think the reason it quit working is my fault, as I think it got too much moisture where it was relocated at the time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I did before it haha</li>
            <li> Shaper was just as advertised and has worked better than expected with no scrapes or skin burns.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very adjustable.</li>
            <li> It also does a wonderful job trimming in awkward positions.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying much electronic stuff on amazon, since the return policy feels like a hassle to me.</li>
            <li> #1, This trimmer isn&#x27;t really made in Japan, it maybe put together there and</li>
            <li> I am not one to review very often on Amazon, but was compelled to by this electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> This makes things so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Trims very well.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but this one is so much faster.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Works very well (according to my girlfriend words).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the whole &amp;#34;not waterproof&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I really dont know how anyone could use this to trim that area.</li>
            <li> It was close enough for me (as in a couple mm), and it was really precise.</li>
            <li> (If the price was raised, I&#x27;d still purchase, I like it that much.)</li>
            <li> Get a wax or laser removal if you want a total smooth finish.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the length, so you have control of how much you trim and how much you keep.</li>
            <li> It can be adjusted for whatever length you want and cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never pay this much for a trimmer again.</li>
            <li> Replaced it with a $15 Conair trimmer and am much happier.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the fact that it is battery operated but yet so powerful.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed that its heated, but it doesnt really make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> you regret paying that much.  </li>
            <li> It has just as much as power as my husband’s corded, electric razor.</li>
            <li> However, if you want a closer cut, take off the guide and gently trim the hair with the blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is battery operated, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I used to have to charge the remington ahead of time, before each time as the battery did not hold power very well.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> As much as I admire the minimalist design</li>
            <li> Luckily it is gentle on batteries.</li>
            <li> Really noisy which just adds to my apprehension.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very close shave without the guard, which is what I was hoping for, and it did not hurt me at all.  </li>
            <li> This is really every woman&#x27;s must have product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get it smooth to touch, but get the hairs very short.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> , I really wish it was.  </li>
            <li> However it is NOT a shaver, and does NOT get really close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it on the closest shave setting, and it gave me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> No pain, VERY close shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> I use this on the shortest setting and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked really well.</li>
            <li> like it so much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself continuing with this one much longer.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how much battery life it uses yet, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I would like to hear some opinions about how close it really shaves.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed because this stopped working after owning it for nine months and using it once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Oh and I use it without the guard for a very close trim, and it has NEVER nicked me.</li>
            <li> worked very well as a trimmer</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It gets really close to a shave an</li>
            <li> Never nicked, pinched, or cut me and held up very well.</li>
            <li> I took care of all offending hair while not really being able to see.</li>
            <li> So much easier then trimming with sissors.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The width of the trimmer that Panasonic chose works very well.  </li>
            <li> Almost in that the guard doesn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really heated.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those sensitive and delicate areas like the bikini line and keeping your private area neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I like it that much.</li>
            <li> (Who who wants a heated device on their bikini line?</li>
            <li> cut is very close and causes no irritation, pulling on skin, itching or redness.  </li>
            <li> I really like it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets really close</li>
            <li> It has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> but it really does not remove anything...</li>
            <li> It also is easy enough to pop open &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> The head has adjustable height for custom length and is removable for a very close finish.</li>
            <li> I really like this thing.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Shapes very well without leaving area prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are trying to cut a very tall grass, you have to go step by step</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works really well and trims very close.  </li>
            <li> so it is always ready when you need it.  </li>
            <li> I use this for the advertised purpose and it works really well, does just what I want it to.</li>
            <li> it did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Did the job and trimmed hair very close.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just too much hair for my preference.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient grooming tool.</li>
            <li> You can trim straight edges and control length of hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything to add anything that others haven&#x27;t already mentioned.</li>
            <li> This is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li> I know there are some reviews that give this item a much lower rating</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t really cut the hair either.</li>
            <li> Remington has a trimmer that works very well</li>
            <li> and this gives you a really close trim without giving those types of issues.</li>
            <li> I really like how it does the work.</li>
            <li> (yes, I tried changing the batteries &amp; gently banging it against the shower wall.)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for really applies with this item.  </li>
            <li> Without getting into too much detail...</li>
            <li> It trimmed just as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These are real gentle and made for your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and have liked the results.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s an effective trimmer, but you will have to make several passes over the same area.  </li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s better than shaving because it grows back soft and not all bushy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be definitely going back to the little Braun, which is super quick and way more precise.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, cuts down the hair fast and easy!</li>
            <li> so I took the guard off and ended up completely bald!!!</li>
            <li> It gets incredibly low and works consistently and quickly.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I put in brand new batteries the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This little machine is very easy to use, efficient and relatively fast.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cuts cleanly and works well, but you are going to have about 1/4 inch of hair left that you still have to shave off if you are looking for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I did a couple of times, but it didn&#x27;t even really feel like a nick, more like just the sharp point dug in a bit.</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable to use as my older rechargeable Conair that was curvier and smaller.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it in the shower because it is battery operated, which I love because I always forgot to charge the other one that I had.  </li>
            <li> better then other ones i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It worked well at first l but the top metal that moves on the top broke after 7 or so times using it, and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I bought other trimmers after this trying to find a better one.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> This works better and has lasted longer than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Schick trimmer that comes with a razor on the other end works better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap, but after the first use I knew it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting is very short (without being bare) and there is no harm of any nicks on my skin with the safe guard.  </li>
            <li> It works well for keeping the private area neat and clean and does not cause a rash or nick/cut your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I especially like the fact that you can take the guard off to clean it.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, lasts long time on 2 batteries.  </li>
            <li> Likewise, the little plastic shaver head (that determines how low the hair is cut) works surprising well for something so simple and cheap to manufacture.  </li>
            <li> I took it apart and cleaned the mechanisms only to have it power down for good.</li>
            <li> This shaves very, very close without &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; your sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for shaving pubes, chest, pits, and any other hair that you want down to a low length but not shaved to the skin.  </li>
            <li> If I could make an improvement, I&#x27;d make it a little bit more sensitive or powerful so that I could work quicker.</li>
            <li> While her hair is not thick, it grows long very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Having been pregnant for past few years it can be challenging for many reasons to get a bikini wax.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last many months worth of clippings, something I hadn&#x27;t expected and</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to trim around the really sensitive areas</li>
            <li> in addition, unlike a razor there is no painful, itchy stubble growing back around the panty line.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> As someone who gets a shaving rash by just looking at a razor, and doesn&#x27;t have the budget for regular bikini waxes (plus, OUCH!), this product was a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> not sure about the heated part,  mine did not feel heated..very easy to use and I am glad they make some specific to a womens needs.</li>
            <li> It may not be good for eyebrow trimming since it is a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It just died, so time to buy a new one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda pissed that I lost the adjustment piece and had to buy a whole new one because just the replacement is no where online</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t a lengthy and descriptive review on the ways it didn&#x27;t work, the cuts it inflicted, and/pr what sort of trashcan it met its end in, but I think in this case, less is more.</li>
            <li> It was a clean toilet thank goodness</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to make the black one any more, and he was hesitant to buy the &#x27;girls version&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I personally like it very very short, so I just take the additional part on top off and use the trimmer by itself.</li>
            <li> The battery life is decent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the guard on this particular product because it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the trimmer I had before.</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> that if I screw something up, I can just order that particular part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than some more expensive brands that I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make a slip and never did a decent job.</li>
            <li> Smooth, quiet action with no pulling or nicking.</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the Braun mini shaver does.</li>
            <li> and it gives a really close and clean, almost shaved look especially on hairy areas where soft hair runs rampant.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using it in the shower a few times, and it died quickly (my own fault, because it clearly says not to do that)</li>
            <li> Plus it trims super short and without the guard I have had no cuts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to anything in this area, but only had one quick moment of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> But this trimmer didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and I have very very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but maybe I set my expectations too high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all you ladies.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest the Braun 2370 Silk-epil EverSoft Body System.  </li>

            <li> highly recommend the Panasonic trimmer.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks like they deliberately designed this stripped-down version of their high end(200+$) shavers.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and this one had a high rating.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly suggest purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you want to shave your pubic hair.</li>
            <li> * high....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times since I got this, but I feel like it&#x27;s mostly been my fault for not being careful enough.</li>
            <li> and I already can tell that this will cause some kind of redness and irritation due to the fact that I have to constantly go over my skin with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> it was louder than i expected, but that&#x27;s fine for the job it does.</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I guess depending on what you like, the little part that goes on the top lets you adjust</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> It snags and tugs a little more than the model I used to use, which broke.  </li>
            <li> I love this little thing.  </li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest spending a little more on something nicer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little more picky about what&#x27;s lopping stuff off around my privates.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if it trimmed a little closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> really quite pleased with how close the trimmer gets; I actually feel smooth in some places (where hair is slightly less coarse), and everywhere else is neat and evenly trim.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was that as a woman of color, with naturally thicker and courser hair, that this wouldn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Only pain point is too many small parts to clean and doesn&#x27;t seem like you can run it under a tap.</li>
            <li> The guard is easy to move and the blades stay functional and sharp.</li>
            <li> blade is kind of dull.</li>
            <li> Shaved with one stroke, it&#x27;s strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also given buzz haircuts and beard trims with no problem, taking it slowly - handy little widget!!</li>
            <li> it has the ability to cut the hair very close and completely off if you&#x27;d like to use it for that as well.</li>
            <li> The speed of the blade is much faster and trims with fewer passes as compared to my old remington.</li>
            <li> A silly vanity, but it works great</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t really like shaving or waxing (and</li>
            <li> Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> :  Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.</li>
            <li> And for those of you who even have a trail of hair going even further under...even past the general &#x27;exposed&#x27;  areas...I was so happy with the results of mine</li>
            <li> It obviously doesn&#x27;t get you perfectly smooth, but it can cut the hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> It really gives you a close shave without going completely bald.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of years ago, then lost part of the top a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Definitely an item worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Better than using heavy clippers..</li>
            <li> although it might not cut as close or be as sharp as other bikini trimmers, it NEVER nicks my skin or causes irritation, which i think is a fair tradeoff.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not powerful enough at all.</li>
            <li> It use normal battery, but I like the design, because I can buy the rechargeable one easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply wasn&#x27;t useful with the guard in place-- just ran over the area and did not trim the hair.</li>
            <li> If the guards were the normal ones that snap on and off like hair clippers, this would be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have already ordered more of the round file things, and plan on incorporating this into my routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a real close shave without having to feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; or too hairy and no more razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tug, and gets something done in 5 minutes that would normally take 30.</li>
            <li> Keep the blades oiled as you would a normal clipper set.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty much bare.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty basic, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I had the rechargeable clio before this one, but dropped it a few too many times so needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> This item is powerful enough and does not catch your hair.</li>
            <li> This thing might be ok for trimming a few strands of hair but not a hairy man.</li>
            <li> What would take an hour or more took a few minutes no pulled hair nothing.</li>
            <li> The removable blade cap is adjustable to several lengths, but none of which are useful to me because I like a closer shaver.</li>
            <li> Normally, I get everything waxed, but have let things get admittedly out of hand.</li>
            <li> maiden voyage was a bit longer than what I would normally expect to use this for.</li>
            <li> so much I vowed never to do it again even though my skin felt silky smooth down there; and razors always made me super-itchy and sometimes gave me razor burn that hurt.</li>
            <li> It trims down the hair nicely and (following the suggestion of another reviewer - thank you!)</li>
            <li> I used to use razors until my stomach got very big that I honestly can&#x27;t see down there without my stomach being in the way.</li>
            <li> Second; Both me and the wife like to be neat and tidy with the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to hold and use easily and accurately.</li>
            <li> All other settings seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> Other then than I the product works fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers that are more expensive that aren&#x27;t as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my hand, is basically easy to maneuver and ultimately does the job well and quickly other than the few mishaps I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Using its lowest guarg setting, it easily handled my course, dark hair.</li>
            <li> This would work great if I kept the lawn a little longer, but since I prefer bare this is not very helpful.</li>
            <li> The old one (pink) still works fine after maybe 10 years.  </li>
            <li> does a fantastic job, there are some reviews saying it either breaks after a few uses or that it doesnt give you a close enough shave, i find these comments not to be true.</li>
            <li> Though it is small enough to get to all the lady parts, unlike a regular sized trimmer, which is great.  </li>
            <li> If only I had known about this product sooner as it saves the pain from brazilian waxing although it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate hair, the result is pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I got this little puppy a day early today.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> but with a new design so they keep their charge</li>
            <li> I pkan to buy a new one and hide it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine trying anything new.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries, still nothing.  </li>
            <li> but it stopped working, I put new batteries in and it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the batteries with brand new ones and got nothing.</li>
            <li> and it still works and looks new.</li>
            <li> that you can order parts as opposed to buying an entirely new trimmer.</li>
            <li> It still works, though, but it seems the batteries are dying when they&#x27;re brand new.</li>
            <li> I tried putting new batteries in and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one -</li>
            <li> I needed a new trimmer</li>
            <li> yes, I replaced batteries with new ones and still would not work.</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent me another one brand new because I was still under the 2 year warranty and guess what?</li>
            <li> I find it amusing that it is advertised as a &#x27;bikini line&#x27; trimmer, and I suppose it works for the worst of that too, but if you are looking for grooming your privates without the pain of waxing it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> If you use it without the guard, it trims really closely so there isn&#x27;t much hair left.</li>
            <li> One thing I personally noticed was that the metal teeth at the top were rounded instead of being sharp like other trimmers which is a great thing as sharp metal potion could actually hurt you.</li>
            <li> It has never irritated my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful (need to go over same area multiple times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> A good product a little rough, works well, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> I was able to repair the piece temporarily with super glue, but when I tapped the head a little later it broke in the same place.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m replacing it with the exact same model, hoping to get another 5 years out of the new one.</li>
            <li> I went right back to using my old one.</li>
            <li> the trim is slightly large and the guard does not really capture as much of the hair as I&#x27;d like, yet without the guard it takes off too much.</li>
            <li> it is easy to carry and very quiet, no loud noise,i was very surprised that i did not get any bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this even though there were some pretty strong negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its compactness makes it easy to maneuver in tight spots.</li>
            <li> Originally I rated this trimmer only 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed the hair close enough.</li>
            <li> And all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> I just ordered the exact same one to replace it.</li>
            <li> This completely does the trick!</li>
            <li> Many cordless trimmers I had in the past were overly bulky.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only once; so I am hopeful that it will continue to perform as it did the first time.</li>
            <li> Not a total &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Two years later and it still works as well as it did the first time.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s cordless and small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several years now and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it is not meant for use in the shower, which is how I would use the first one, so that&#x27;s probably why it died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better quality for the same money in other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Honestly ladies, there&#x27;s no good way to do this</li>
            <li> When you are ready to shave bare, take off piece.  </li>
            <li> small cute but efficient..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d start with the longest setting first and see if that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> The second time I tried to use it, instead of it working, it just got really hot.</li>
            <li> Wow...was i surprised!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for trimming everything up the same length.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not waterproof (bummer), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet for a shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, when I first attempted to use it, I left the guard on, but on the shortest trimmer setting.....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in removing all hair, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere because this is just a trimmer with a couple different length settings.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and powerful cut.</li>
            <li> Powerful enough, yet also gentle enough.</li>
            <li> This will not get to the skin but will allow you to trim, edge, and provide a pretty short buzz cut where applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was built for the soft contours of the female anatomy, but given a little patience any man will be rewarded with a nice soft swimsuit area.</li>
            <li> This bikini TRIMMER (read: NOT razor), can quickly and easily trim hair down to a very low level (but not so short it&#x27;s prickly).</li>
            <li> I almost always use it without the guard, which works fine, but it&#x27;s a little frustrating because I have to be much more careful than if I could use a guard with an appropriate height.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, it does not do a clean shave</li>
            <li> Love it and always recommend to my friends, both male and female alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: nearly two years later</li>
            <li> This trimmer was actually cheaper than other ones I&#x27;ve tried and far better quality.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t break, it just got really loud, so I got a new one.</li>
            <li> Now even with new batteries the trimmer turns off so frequently it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> It is small, light-weight and easy to maneuver with left and right handed use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super smooth close shave</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it would have lasted long because it&#x27;s made of such cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had issues with it hurting or pinching, and I have control in all the small spaces that I need to use it for- stainless steel blades important.</li>
            <li> I had to run the thing over the hair MANY times to get anything remotely resembling a trim, and there were still lots of long hairs among the shorter ones.</li>
            <li> The battery life is decent, but for some people, the extra cost for a rechargable unit is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> It has several adjustments and is nice and small.</li>
            <li> I use the 1 setting first to get the hairs to around 1/8&amp;#34; and then remove the trimmer comb to get extra close, by doing this I avoid bumps completely.</li>
            <li> I have the most coarse hair and did not have any problems trimming it down to an acceptable level (for me).</li>
            <li> it is hard to find trimmers that really work without pulling and hurting this one was easy to use and did not pull out hair.</li>
            <li> But sooooo easy to use and very maneuverable in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Top quality unit with no pulling should last a long time with proper care.</li>
            <li> The only reason I even gave 2 stars is because it seemed totally safe to have around all those sensitive parts down there--</li>
            <li> You can get a very short trim if you want, and you&#x27;ll probably have to trim a couple of times from different directions, but that&#x27;s due to hair growth patterns, not the trimmer, and even then it&#x27;s super quick.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush to keep the guard and blades free of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one pretty soon after because I could not live without this thing.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud but that sound didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> For $20 (only $5 more than a 3 pack of disposables) I bought this little wonder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little trimmer for the price but be careful or you&#x27;ll nick yourself.</li>
            <li> I love that it has various height settings, as well as a little brush for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feeling of only having a little stubble.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little narrower, like the ones sold in the drugstore (I think Venus has one -- but this one does not last more than a month).</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, but you do have to clean it every time and it is a little annoying to do even though it is easy.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great, although I never use the attachment to trim \\&quot;down there\\&quot; because it would still leave it too long</li>
            <li> It is not just for the bikini area.. great for trimming hair too, that is, if you are cutting your kids hair..</li>
            <li> This product is made in Japan and it clearly shows.</li>
            <li> most of the others are more painful and end up with cuts.</li>
            <li> You can also use it without the guard to remove some hair completely</li>
            <li> It does allow you to get really close, no bumps when the hair grows back</li>
            <li> It actually trims very close</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be completely hair-free.  </li>
            <li> It works well even near sensitive areas without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> it takes batteries so that&#x27;s the only real downside.</li>
            <li> me, the trimmer blade kept nicking my skin (which is not what you want when you&#x27;re grooming the delicate areas), and using the guide takes forever to shorten longer hairs to a better length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it twice, but will have to get my old man to help.</li>
            <li> I love purchasing from Amazon.com especially products sold by Amazon LLC, but this was disappointing to hear that they could not help me out after I had purchased so many products through their website.    </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various cordless trimmers, all of them were rechargeable, and all of them lost power within a year or two and the cost of replacing the battery was almost as much as the trimmer.    </li>
            <li> The adjustable length mechanism works very well and is removable, as are the blades which can be removed and thoroughly cleaned (and replaced if necessary).    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classy gadget.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my old Panasonic epilator/shaver feels like it&#x27;s dying</li>
            <li> so I avoid completely shaving.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no issues with it and would buy again when mine gets to old.</li>
            <li> Considering how sensitive the bikini line area is the trimmer cuts a close shave without nicking.</li>
            <li> My old remington did not come with that, and</li>
            <li> Remember, if you want to remove hair completely don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> It cuts fast and doesn&#x27;t catch/rip out my hair like my last trimmer did.</li>
            <li> So far she hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as my old &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; was about to bite the dust.  </li>
            <li> This works perfectly so far</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give anything NEAR a close shave, probably</li>
            <li> My old 1 did not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with its performance.</li>
            <li> I can just pop the batteries in and be ready to go, instead of forgetting to charge it until the last minute.</li>
            <li> I take the guard off completely to get it to trim the shortest.  </li>
            <li> It completely attended my needs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s action and shape.</li>
            <li> It cuts no where near as close as the Clio</li>
            <li> okay but not spectacular.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done but pulls at hair if you aren&#x27;t directly on skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t loud</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> and i have pretty long curly hair in that area.  </li>
            <li> How does it do on those really sensitive areas?</li>
            <li> I would commend this for anyone that wants personal trimmer for that area.</li>
            <li> For the price, this should last much longer than 18-20 uses.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this item twice</li>
            <li> It works so well that my husband now wants one too as I won&#x27;t share, for obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this trimmer if you&#x27;re looking for something that will trim VERY close to the skin without nicking you.</li>
            <li> ehem* sensitive parts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud or jittery</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> this shaver doesn&#x27;t catch or grab sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I find that the plastic guard doesn&#x27;t let me get the closest trim I want, so I just take it off and use the metal part directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather feel very short stubble from this trimmer!</li>
            <li> It trims evenly with no irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> shaver worked well until it stopped completely after a year.  </li>
            <li> and I think I had this for a year so far.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it thus far.</li>
            <li> No, this shaver does not give you that completely bald look or feel, but that&#x27;s not what I was going for.  </li>
            <li> The shave is very close, especially if you remove the guard, and there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It was fast, quiet, and efficient.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s completely plastic.</li>
            <li> has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> If your looking to take care of adult acne and are concerned about ageing also</li>
            <li> I really recommend it and it does have different sizes in case</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Once again I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The guide is adjustable for different lengths and it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li> I take the batteries out and just put them back in when I am ready to use it.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a very similarly-shaped device, but smaller, and cheaper, and I hadn&#x27;t used the guard on that either</li>
            <li> You can rinse it under water and it doesn&#x27;t get damaged (i don&#x27;t submerge it or let water near the battery compartment)</li>
            <li> Used it once thus far and the sliding head works as indicated - no manuevering problems.</li>
            <li> Thus far, no hair bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li> But, so far, no problems.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to shave.  </li>
            <li> and it literally turned on for a split seconded then completely died.</li>
            <li> Holding up thus far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely ideal for cropping hair relatively close to the skin, and the narrow blade width allows me to get all those delicate nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> It is nice and small and not loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different trimmers over the years, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after just one use, I&#x27;ve realised it&#x27;s just as good as I had</li>
            <li> This gets the hair an does the job, but it could be built more for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Now with out the guarded it shaves down the the bare skin..</li>
            <li> The different levels are very useful and there have been absolutely no nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that it came in easy to open packaging with a small cleaning comb as well.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer - from tough beard to any other areas you want to trim.</li>
            <li> and i have finally found the right one.i would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was really scared at first to use it, but as I saw how well it was working, I got less nervous with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on other razors that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking the guard off completely and it shaves it almost bare, which is actually a little too short but better than the Number 1.</li>
            <li> This unit is small and compact and fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li> Its small and easy to maneuver</li>
            <li> Its size makes maneuvering it in small places, like the bikini area, fairly easy.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to go anywhere.</li>
            <li> Small and easy storage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to take on trips in carryon luggage, because it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair long enough to be a little softer and I like that the plastic guard prevents catching skin.</li>
            <li> It comes with just three pieces, the body, the guard, and a little brush to clean out the guard (Im assuming).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to clean up and not have to worry about little cuts.</li>
            <li> As if not sharp or fast enough.</li>
            <li> I find it pretty uncomfortable honestly for several days after trimming.</li>
            <li> It seems kind of ludicrous to me that I spent years of my life removing all my hair down there to meet some societal standard.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it will let you do what this Panasonic one does, and more, and for very little extra cost.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried two other ones (one by epilady, and i forget the brand of the other one), but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works pretty well, and I use it fairly regularly.</li>
            <li> the blade guard doesn&#x27;t really come close enough though, so I wind up using it bare blade which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have had many bikini trimmers in the past and they have always cut me and left me bleeding!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little trimmer!</li>
            <li> This trimmer will not get you shaved smooth, but will trim your hair down relatively short.  </li>
            <li> As I said earlier, I highly recommend Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended it for coarse hair that causes bumps.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer to anyone that wants to keep things neat and trim.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with other smaller trimmers, but they do not seem to be large or powerful enough to work like this one.</li>
            <li> I tried a few bikini trimmers and they never seemed strong enough to do what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Small, light weight, takes 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> No one wants long hair</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t eat up too much battery power as long as you take out the batteries after every use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, needed, and expected.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was HOT PINK or girly looking</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t nick you if you&#x27;re pretty careful.  </li>
            <li> What normally takes me 30 minutes only took me 5 with this thing!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> with 2 little boys around I am in pretty high stock of batteries.</li>
            <li> my last one worked the same, but used up the batteries very quickly, basically one round of use would require for me to put in new batteries.</li>
            <li> and I have to turn it off several times to let it cool down a bit before I can complete the job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very powerful for it&#x27;s small size.  </li>
            <li> The guard didn&#x27;t feel secure and it was pretty useless since the closet trim was still pretty long.</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic ES2207P works about the same.  </li>
            <li> You use it dry, it is powered with batteries, and it really is idiot-proof until you try to shave without the trim guard</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for any male or female who wants to trim their pubic areas.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy one of those super expensive trimmers because I figured the more expensive it is the better the product will be, until I stumbled onto this product and read all the reviews.</li>
            <li> And weirdly it leaves a nice soft feel, none of that prickly stuff.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer to just have mine neat and in order instead of completely shaved and so far this trimmer has kept me from having to deal with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed lately, though, that it makes more noise when I use it, and I can only surmise that after 5 hard-working years, the &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; may be dying.</li>
            <li> The only con really is that it&#x27;s starting to act as if it isn&#x27;t working as well as it was.</li>
            <li> Maybe that is how long they are expected to work because it&#x27;s still not a bad price for the use I got out of it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my pubic hair because my skin is very sensitive to a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the cage thing off, this is the only thing I can use that causes no irritation/ingrowns/problems as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly how I expected it would!</li>
            <li> This can cause cuts and will tug on the hair if you&#x27;re not careful, though!</li>
            <li> Well... it is quite, but it also has no power, becomes too hot to continue using, and has sharp edges which scrape me up.</li>
            <li> The blade seems as sharp as ever, and I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and small for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews - this item is for TRIMMING not shaving (which I thought was pretty clear in the item description).  </li>
            <li> I even wore short denim shorts for the first two days after trimming and there wasn&#x27;t a single bump from chafing around the shaven area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; clean them after each use with a small softbrush provided.</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts cleanly without any tugging or excessive vibration, and I haven&#x27;t had any cuts using it without the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more scissors, no more razor burn, it shaves quickly and exactly to where I want it to shave to!!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy one of these bad boys if you want a decent personal clipper that gives a great clip, has longevity, is compact, and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> Mehh, I didn&#x27;t expect a close shave, but I expected a little better than what it does, I like to keep everything shaved, and I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve had it...</li>
            <li> Its size makes it hard to really get down to trim those more personal areas and the removeable piece is always removed which is my suggestion unless you want to look like a teddybear.</li>
            <li> It will NOT shave you smooth, however, it seems some folks are confusing this with a shaver.</li>
            <li> It trims close enough that it looks like nothing is barely there from a far.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t cut me but cut hair very short in those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> And I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner, because now I can&#x27;t imagine going back to being au natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the same model is still sold!</li>
            <li> It is a definite step up from shaving with a razor however and works well so far.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Reallly like the 4 different levels of shave with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy not having shaving bumps anymore on my sensitive</li>
            <li> and I like it almost bare.</li>
            <li> Barely used--</li>
            <li> I prefer to keep my hair low for hygienic and aesthetic reasons, but was fed up with the ordeal of getting waxed and how frequently you have to go.</li>
            <li> I treated it well and barely used it before it died.  </li>
            <li> It barely works.</li>
            <li> PS335 T-Shaped Shaver on my thighs which cuts closer without shaving bare.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it again a week or so later, and the batteries were completely drained.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this trimmer draws energy from the batteries even while it isn&#x27;t operating.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it&#x27;s a trimmer, so it only trims your hair to a shorter length, it doesn&#x27;t remove or shave your hair completely.</li>
            <li> I used this to groom my genitals, and this thing could barely cut anything.</li>
            <li> :o</li>
            <li> I bought this because I dont like to be totally bare, plus razor burn kills</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be bare.</li>
            <li> this trims so close that it&#x27;s like you are bare.</li>
            <li> Completely died after only five or six uses, and wouldn&#x27;t power up again at all.  </li>
            <li> Definitely do not attempt to use it in sensitive areas without the guard-</li>
            <li> I use it for my personal &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and also to cut my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I expected a razor for the bikini area to be close but gentle.  </li>
            <li> I used it without the cover the whole time and you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to get that bare skin feeling.</li>
            <li> final choice was this product after reading the reviews, because i completely understood what the product would do and I felt that it would soot my purpose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s also not great.  </li>
            <li> Hair can make me feel dirty; holds bacteria even if you wash the area good.</li>
            <li> It worked OK, but never great.</li>
            <li> I let it cool and finished a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> and I love it, is still working, but the blade is broken and I can&#x27;t find any place to buy a blade replacement</li>
            <li> The angled head makes it easy to maintain a fluid motion in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is slim enough that you can actually maneuver around your lady bits.. to be clear, if you are in trimming stance (legs spread a bit), you can trim up one side of your lips and then the other side (with a small amount of stretching or maneuvering the current focus area).&lt;br /&gt;I never find trimmers that slim, it&#x27;s really nice to not have to worry about nicking anything.</li>
            <li> but If your replacing an old one like me, I just used the case from my previous shaver - problem solved :) (or use a small makeup brush case)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and makes it almost impossible to create nicks and cuts.    </li>
            <li> I dried it right away</li>
            <li> You may have to do more than one pass to get an even trim, but no more than any other trimmer of this type.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with razor burn, sensitive skin, etc.</li>
            <li> It also is very affordable because you aren&#x27;t paying for an ad campaign during the Superbowl that comes with other products.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to clean off since you can&#x27;t run it under water.  </li>
            <li> and it was hard to reach a clean trim at some places.</li>
            <li> Sharp fast moving blades in your bikini area, yikes.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to use on the other end, whereas I really can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times, but so far It works exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I think the size would preferably be a little more narrow, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Trims easily and painlessly, no snags, no bumps (note that I don&#x27;t usually get bumps), runs on two AA batteries, and has a two-year limited warranty.</li>
            <li> The old one, though still running well, sounded like a hedge clipper next to my new one, so no telling how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s lightweight, and the guide is fully adjustable for several different lengths.</li>
            <li> (blade is still sharp but it does not turn on) failure unless one is willing to open the case, clean the contacts and bend the part in to shape.</li>
            <li> As a guy, this little trimmer is amazing and takes out the worry of accidentally nicking yourself in a place you do not want to be nicked, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old female who has never shaved my private area before.</li>
            <li> Not silent actually a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Hair is left short but feels soft and downy</li>
            <li> I am able to get really close without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I experience a lot of irritation with shaving (after 6 laser treatments no less) and still get quite a few ingrowns/razor rash in certain places.</li>
            <li> First the motor slowed down, then it turned off and never came back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shed blood trying that with my husband&#x27;s trimmer, but this little puppy did the trick and my skin stayed intact the whole time!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut me or pull the hair as long as I take it easy and go slow.</li>
            <li> Other men might be turned off by the fact that this thing is baby blue and says \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; on it, but it works very well</li>
            <li> but the blade back in place, Also hard to clean blade.</li>
            <li> It cleans up really well and similar to other reviews</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the job very well in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it is pretty loud in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I lost my first Panasonic and went through various other alternatives, only to come back to it!!</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a really long time and does not need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li> At first I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t working that well (which it wasn&#x27;t, it was missing a lot of hair)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave with a normal wet razor and waxing</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer as an easy way to shape and trim the tough areas.  </li>
            <li> so things were very unruly down there...</li>
            <li> It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.    </li>
            <li> Does not shave down to the skin, but really close which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time, and easy to replace common AAs</li>
            <li> First, there was a little tugging, but not enough to make me worry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the head is a bit too wide to be able to do any real angling, so that can be difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the title/label says &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it dry so far</li>
            <li> and I am so much happier than with my two previous purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer once so far, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it will perform in the long run, but</li>
            <li> Just be careful with blade length while in sensitive areas, you WILL get nicked!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this trimmer a second time after the first one broke after a few months because the batteries leaked.</li>
            <li> The small size is easy to handle for hair down there.</li>
            <li> This neat little toy made things much easier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic offers a limited 2-year warranty!</li>
            <li> It its a good size not too big and not too small, so it can trim a larger area as opposed to the small little trimmer which would take twice the time.</li>
            <li> As commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise, I have found it necessary to keep my personal regions clear of any potential problem areas that could effect relationships between myself (as a representative of the galactic fleet) and other life forms to include members of my command.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd one, the other one finally gave out after nearly 10 years of use or</li>
            <li> time I only used it about 4 times and now the motor slows way down and stops even with 2 sets of new batteries!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s large enough to be expedient, but small enough to be maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> The blade is compact and sharp, and offers replacement parts, but the fact that this system uses batteries is a downer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as on my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> As recommended by other reviewers, I took the protective head completely off and just used the blade to get a closer trim.</li>
            <li> 6 months later the thing just decides to stop working for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> While I am not saying this product is worthless, there are better ones for the same price to slightly higher prices.  </li>
            <li> Works great, much less painful than using a traditional electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This works very well for small patches of rather coarse body hair.  </li>
            <li> but they last a long time with occasional use.  </li>
            <li> My batteries weren&#x27;t pushed down far enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for the products I purchase, but I felt compelled to write one for this nifty little product.</li>
            <li> at least it&#x27;s a VERY reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but DO save the \\&quot;buy replacement parts\\&quot; sheet that comes with the product because i threw that away the first time i bought it, and the blade became dull after about 9 months (with me trimming about 1-2 times per week)</li>
            <li> You could find a high quality one for that price, even half that price!</li>
            <li> There is no reason to be worried even further &#x27;down there&#x27; since the blade is hidden and the only parts that are really exposed to the blade would not be hair, not skin.</li>
            <li> much easier than with messy creams in the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 5 years and am ready to buy myself another one.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long at all, pulled on hairs as well.</li>
            <li> and like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously a quality product if it&#x27;s been around so long and hasn&#x27;t changed any.</li>
            <li> The cut is close but not completely bare.</li>
            <li> No fear of getting bitten by the blades as setting 1 is long enough to prevent injury.</li>
            <li> Two AA batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> So if trimming your privates, hold the skin taut and keep this trimmer flat to your skin.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> it lets me stay groomed while keeping the hair long enough for my appointments.</li>
            <li> Just long enough for the warranty to expire.</li>
            <li> It did not last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update when I see how long the battery lasts with regular use.  </li>
            <li> Not great, not bad, just about what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my dog&#x27;s outer thigh and it bogged down, but was able to handle a small test section.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get you completely bald down there, but since I had read the reviews before purchasing this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.</li>
            <li> its ok and does a decent job, disappointed because you can&#x27;t use it in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and a virgin, but I was always self conscious about my hair down there.  </li>
            <li> or you can remove the clipper  to totally shave the hair completely off (I am a little nervous to try that)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not fond of little devices that run on AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I was previously using men&#x27;s clippers to trim, and cripes those clippers were loud.  </li>
            <li> No problems loosing the charge, even when it is being less frequently used.  </li>
            <li> I used to go with those little ones you see on infomercials, but it seemed like after using it only a few times, the blades became so dull so quickly that you just had to throw them away and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> However, if you just need to trim down, and also epilate, the Braun product does a decent job of just trimming it down---the price of it is a little over double of the trimmer, but therefore works well as a combination product for a couple different needs.</li>
            <li> However, I soon found out that a) my skin down there is far too sensitive to handle a razor, and b) this little trimmer is all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color and is small enough to use in difficult to reach places.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, if that&#x27;s a concern for you.</li>
            <li> This may sound like a feature that should be common sense, but other trimmers have been more pointy (and thus, painful).</li>
            <li> She is white and has relatively coarse dark hair.</li>
            <li> With the guard on, it does leave a few mm of hair, which is clearly mentioned in the manual.</li>
            <li> how long you want your hair, the settings go from 1-5.</li>
            <li> and it runs on the battery power for quite a long time before the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have long gotten waxed - and almost always the technician says &amp;#34;is</li>
            <li> and to wax when you have a long beach getaway.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the height level so you can decide how long you want your hair...</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as this thing lasts me a couple years I&#x27;d buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a long battery life and is getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t return since I had it too long before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give it 5 stars yet, because I would like to see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> It does make a noise but it&#x27;s not unusually loud for a electric product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using a microtrimmer but that took so long to trim bikini area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how long it runs on a set of batteries.</li>
            <li> in Japan (not China!)&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer works well on long to medium hairs</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d had a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it all that long, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time for this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to use, but you can nick yourself if you&#x27;re not being attentive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was totally what I expected</li>
            <li> Good to get the base layer wacked away.</li>
            <li> The same thing with this, use the trimmer&#x27;s position down to 1 and then disconnect the plastic guide and you can go lower, always using the same angle of attack as designed , and then after that you could shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My wife accidentally dropped it in the toilet while doing some trimming!!  </li>
            <li> It took me down to real stubble, probably less than 1/8 of an inch!  </li>
            <li> Nice that you can remove too and do closer trimming in the less dangerous spots.</li>
            <li> A normal razor gets the job done with less discomfort, it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and had used this brand in the past.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the little blades heat up very fast</li>
            <li> The water in our area is pretty tough  - I had to replace the toilet tank parts after a year too.  </li>
            <li> I like that there&#x27;s only one attachment that adjusts to any length so you don&#x27;t need to mess with a bunch of different pieces.</li>
            <li> and I can shave my face with this if my beard is long enough, so this little thing has enough</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is highly recommended for anyone who has ever tried to use scissors down there.  </li>
            <li> seriously, who using a bikini trimmer wants hair that long????)  </li>
            <li> So may be I will order similar thing from other company...</li>
            <li> I have done the shaving and waxing thing only to deal with the ingrown hairs and bumps due to the re-growth.</li>
            <li> that it lasts me a long time!</li>
            <li> The other pro is that the trimmer comes with a guide for the different parts in case you need to re-order a part.</li>
            <li> This is pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has long eyebrows, and I set this trimmer on (3) and zap!</li>
            <li> little beast is being laid to rest, I used it to touch up my girlfriend&#x27;s side cut occasionally the last year, and I think that&#x27;s what is making the motor start to die.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to trim with the trimmer on a shaver and having a terrible experience, I bought this wonderful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to write a review over a trimmer without getting a little TMI, but I feel like in order to maybe get better use of this trimmer</li>
            <li> Idk why I waited so long to get this!</li>
            <li> Rather difficult to clean though .</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re concerned because you have to use it dry, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works but has to be used dry.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT get you totally smooth and hair free, but it&#x27;s awfully darn close!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the shortest setting is .125 inches, which is still a considerable amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> The charge would frequently last no longer than a few minutes, even when I actually remembered to charge it.</li>
            <li> Completely stopped working less than 3 months after purchasing and after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because it cause irritation but with this I can have a nice close shave without the red bumps.</li>
            <li> Used new batteries after only one use on hair that is not &#x27;barb-wiry&#x27; or thick; not very economical to use.</li>
            <li> preps the area for my single blade electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Without the guard it works, but you&#x27;re taking a chance on a memorable and unpleasant injury.</li>
            <li> Works well and so far has not gone out usually</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying that it does work for me as long as I&#x27;m being careful.</li>
            <li> Something&#x27;s loose in there.  </li>
            <li> Battery casing is a bit loose, so batteries are sort of misaligned when you put them in.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust desired length, works dry or in the shower just as well, no nicking or cutting skin.</li>
            <li> It truly took less than half the time of my old one.  </li>
            <li> It gets down very low</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change, if I could, is having another shorter setting as the smallest setting is still a little long.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a proper lady clipper that&#x27;s small, quiet and doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in.</li>
            <li> , reletively &amp;quot;tidy.&amp;quot; As much as I love staying shorn and bare, I absolutely hate shaving &amp;quot;down there&amp;quot; with a razor -- and as for a Brazillian wax?</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should know that your hair, while short, is still slightly visible.</li>
            <li> Setting 1 (lowest setting) leaves hair longer compared to the same setting on my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it took less time than actually shaving would have.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was rechargeable, but I actually prefer batteries.</li>
            <li> Small and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag, this shaver can reach narrow places and get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> He had the male version (black w/ no heat) and it wore out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn&#x27;t trim the hairs short enough</li>
            <li> I end up hurt, pissed, and only half shaven.</li>
            <li> Pull skin taught so that you&#x27;ll be less likely to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> but it simply didn&#x27;t work for someone with less hair that was about 1/2\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; to begin with.</li>
            <li> I typically use settings 1 or 2 to get my lady hair as short as I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> It works like a trimmer should, no more no less.</li>
            <li> One barely works with very little power, and the other two died completely after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too stoked about is that it makes quite a mess.</li>
            <li> This is much smaller than I thought so not true to size as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; for my wedding and honeymoon but was very disappointed that this product (one that my research said was great) did not operate correctly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has black hair and it definitely takes off the amount I want to take off without taking him to a barbershop since he&#x27;s not ready for it yet.</li>
            <li> This little beauty lasted me through 6 years and several boyfriends.  </li>
            <li> It only lasted a little over two years.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is a little noisy when in use.</li>
            <li> It is about 2 years later, and this little guy still works like a champ.</li>
            <li> I am done with both, this little trimmer is the only one in my life now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a little concerned that, because of the way the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch was designed, it&#x27;d be possible for it to be turned on unintentionally, but that hasn&#x27;t ever happened to me.  </li>
            <li> so be careful going into very sensitive areas of the skin if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> And its hard to use w/o the guard in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t have any problems with itchiness due to how short the hair is.</li>
            <li> I inserted the two AA batteries, but the only thing that happened is that the razor moved back and forth very slowly for only about 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> so I could avoid getting more ugly bumps.  </li>
            <li> Never liked being completely bald.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It pulls hair and is not very efficient.</li>
            <li> I impatiently ripped open the box, grabbed some batteries, and tackled some winter fur without needing to examine the directions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful using it without the attachment because I don&#x27;t want to nick myself -</li>
            <li> The length is adjusted by squeezing the sides and sliding the comb part; there are only a few length options.</li>
            <li> do not get this wet or it will rust so beware of using this in the shower.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected</li>
            <li> head is too wide to get around areas with folds, so I use it in combination with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very close at all..definitely leaves something to be desired..</li>
            <li> Never got it wet and cleaned if after each use.  </li>
            <li> I have to slide it back and forth a few times for it to shut off.  </li>
            <li> My husband was away with the military</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get wet, and you need to have batteries on hand because it&#x27;s not rechargable.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected</li>
            <li> Also, it will rust if you get it wet.</li>
            <li> Careful there is some pulling.</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> Harder to get around the edges.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be smaller to make it easier to maneuver in such a delicate area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer a few times</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s battery powered and cannot get wet.</li>
            <li> It performs as expected.</li>
            <li> However, a few months after starting use, the trimmer just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It broke after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I replaced the batteries and not much change.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse then being ready to shave and not having power.  </li>
            <li> The guard keeps the hair so long that it&#x27;s not really worth using.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t take the blade out  for cleaning or get it wet.  </li>
            <li> but I think they expected the trimmer to get rid of everything</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the battery, and only a few issues with ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got it wet, leading to its demise.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too wide.</li>
            <li> The one drawback is that the blades got dull pretty quick, and it sometimes snags a hair, and cuts the skin which can be quite painful.</li>
            <li> I used the guard to get the long hair down to manageable length and thickness, and then took off the guard.</li>
            <li> Its plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I was SO sick of razor bumps that I decided to give this a try and am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> So any of the reviewers that gave it negative reviews was clearly expecting something something other than the description.</li>
            <li> This is that something, I just found it long after half the rest of the world did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only downside is we need to replace the battery once fully discharged but it consumes very less power.</li>
            <li> Small enough to get all the little nooks, crannies, and personal areas.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn&#x27;t get those awful red bumps afterwards.</li>
            <li> It did not really meet my expectations based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus when it did work it was not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I personally go with the shortest - a number 1 - and it&#x27;s probably an eighth of an inch or a little less even.</li>
            <li> plastic guard on it is very odd, it slides up and down for different lengths and</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading reviews of other brands.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that other people posted before I bought this</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it sounds like that, because other reviews said that&#x27;s what it sounds like.</li>
            <li> Small enough for \\&quot;tough\\&quot; spaces.</li>
            <li> then my other electric shaver from Norelco.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does all that the other reviewers say.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this.  </li>
            <li> It does not get extremely close to the roots which I like because then I don&#x27;t have to deal with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products, but none have lasted past a battery change.</li>
            <li> It does get pretty close, so as an alternative to shaving or to trim up what you don&#x27;t want \\&quot;bald\\&quot;, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Usually electronic products have a given one year warranty, but theses are simply 30 days.</li>
            <li> No more red bumps or irritation like you get from razors or hair removers.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it the other day and it would not turn on.  </li>
            <li> but since I read other reviews before I bought this product I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the area like with other shavers.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviews state, remove the guard.</li>
            <li> THE BIKINI SHAPER AND TRIMMER IS SOMETHING EVERY WOMAN SHOULD HAVE, I WAS USING OTHER THINGS BEFORE I FOUND THIS TRIMMER</li>
            <li> I took off the small attachment to get as close as possible</li>
            <li> Broke on the second use :/</li>
            <li> Head protector too sharp.</li>
            <li> I use it as an adjunct to my other Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Yes, as other customers have observed, its not going to shave but do a trim.</li>
            <li> It made very weird sound when in use and now it just doesnt work</li>
            <li> Must be cleaned with the small brush and the hair gets in tiny grooves.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to other.</li>
            <li> a razor is better &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trimmer to get close where I need it and to just trim in other areas.</li>
            <li> I know other reviews say it will hurt the skin and warn you not to do it,</li>
            <li> I have tried other bikini shapers /trimmers.</li>
            <li> Of course, the the angled head comes off to trim close in other areas.</li>
            <li> Not willing to buy another one to try.</li>
            <li> This is small enough to maneuver around your lady parts, fits in your hand, and doesn&#x27;t cut you or rip out pubes!</li>
            <li> can be snag city with this trimmer- careful folks!</li>
            <li> I have used other methods of removing bikini hair and none can compare to this trimmer.</li>
            <li> No need to excessively worry about all your female bits getting in there either</li>
            <li> It works extremely well</li>
            <li> Diffinately recommend for other women to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers however nothing compares to this one.  </li>
            <li> I used to cut my junk trying to get a close buzz with other clippers.</li>
            <li> discovered that by taking off the plastic guard, and being VERY careful, I got a trim almost as close as a shave.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clean cutting blades with the protective cover</li>
            <li> The length gauge seems a little loose.</li>
            <li> Super disappointing.</li>
            <li> This cross trainer could easily double as a poor person&#x27;s vibrator given</li>
            <li> Flying blind, so to speak, is a bit worrisome in such a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I used to use a fine-tooth comb and traditional razor to achieve this, which was all-around inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The packaging was reminiscent of something that is government-issue, but open it up, ignore the outdated colors and illustrations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so beyond the days of shaving things all the way down, no more red bumpies and itchies for me.</li>
            <li> Also, I recall other reviewers saying they couldn&#x27;t use it everywhere down there, but I had no problem maneuvering at all (without the guard) on all parts of the anatomy.  </li>
            <li> Will cut you when you shave around the curve at the top of your leg, no matter how tight you stretch your skin. :(</li>
            <li> I have used it a little wet and it still works.  </li>
            <li> Its small, not very loud.</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful but it does the job without a mess.</li>
            <li> Wish it had different head attachments for those hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> That one is so not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I would say is that it took almost 2 months to come in.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is not worth the price, save yourself the headache.</li>
            <li> its not worth one star, as it did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, and have used it around once/week on average for a close crop (without the shield).  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charger, it takes 2 AA batteries which I am not sure how long it will take them to run out of juice.  </li>
            <li> It worked as expected for the 1 year I have had it, but now it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor a few months ago because I wanted the bare look, but my skin is very sensitive and shaving just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a bikini trimmer attachment that can trim the hair down south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the attachment on, you can get down to 1/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to shave down there for a while now, and decided to get this.</li>
            <li> I use it without the guard and get the hair down to just a stubble (I&#x27;ve never cut myself).</li>
            <li> My wife and I were looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  </li>
            <li> &quot; you just either click it up or click it down depending.</li>
            <li> However, I also don&#x27;t like to have a lot going on down there.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has 5 cut lengths and you adjust the cut length by moving the guard up and down on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> try it down there.</li>
            <li> The shortest setting on this trimmer is 1/8\\&quot; but it does not get hair down that length.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for down there.</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well!</li>
            <li> - Keeps everything neat and trims extremely close!</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to use for the bikini areas (big and clumsy)&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the guard seems a little flimsy (it&#x27;s plastic), and that it may break down the road.  </li>
            <li> I tried other electric shavers and they were too harsh.</li>
            <li> Not a super close trim.</li>
            <li> I just had to change my routine a bit to use this before I turn the shower on (my previous trimmer was waterproof).</li>
            <li> The razor I previously owned (another brand) lasted 9 yrs</li>
            <li> It causes muuuuch less anxiety than taking scissors to the area.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous trimmer that died.</li>
            <li> just in time for summer and unlike some reviews previously stated, there is no discomfort/ pulling with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Cuts the time in half.  </li>
            <li> A lot less irritation than razors</li>
            <li> I did it in less than 5 min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black lady</li>
            <li> Maybe I was spoiled by my previous razor, which I can no longer find for purchase...</li>
            <li> But I bought this to make shaving less of a hassle when I let it get out of hand...and it works for that</li>
            <li> That is until is stopped working less than 6 months after I got it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted slightly less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less then a year</li>
            <li> This I got less then a year.</li>
            <li> Still broke after less than a year.</li>
            <li> and it has done as the description says and held up to previous reviews.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a trimmer that can cut down to the skin or make designs, this is not the trimmer for you; without the guard, it leaves a little less than 1/8 inch.  </li>
            <li> Drop a towel on the floor, prop a foot up, and sprinkle a little baby powder down below to defuzz</li>
            <li> I am a little too hairy down there, as you all know what I&#x27;m saying...</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t sweep up the mess afterwards!</li>
            <li> It works well and as long as you use common sense, you wont cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmed somehow sticks to the device leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less stressful for me</li>
            <li> but I wish it lasted a little longer than a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Its compact and works well in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> It does not nick and works well in tight spaces on the body.</li>
            <li> This product is not waterproof, so do not clean it with water.</li>
            <li> Then i was somewhat disappointed that it didnt really trim very low, not to stubble length</li>
            <li> still hoping somebody invent a machine that will give you a close shave but not clean shaven</li>
            <li> I use this to help me with my upkeep as I am pregnant and at 36 weeks it is impossible to see but this helps me stay tame.</li>
            <li> It started acting strange about a month in randomly turning off.</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying at all!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s where this little trimmer comes in.</li>
            <li> Comes with a little brush for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I just got this little trimmer</li>
            <li> but I took off that little plastic piece</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get everything even, but works well.</li>
            <li> pulls hairs a little.</li>
            <li> Also no problem with getting a little closer with the guard off.</li>
            <li> During the delivery of my little girl by C-section, the doctor/nurses kept talking about how &amp;quot;neat&amp;quot; my pubic area was.  </li>
            <li> I wish the shortest setting were a little shorter though--it still leaves hair a tad longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> but it felt a little bit bulky sometimes</li>
            <li> Works well, pulls a little.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than just using your man&#x27;s face trimmer</li>
            <li> Not worth the $20!  </li>
            <li> I wish it would trim a little closer.  </li>
            <li> was a little scared of this when I bought it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already sent a link out to my girlfriends...sharing this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a little overpriced....</li>
            <li> There is a little brush included for cleaning but it would be a lot easier to just rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Wish it would gave come with a little carrier bag or something</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> No, this trimmer will *not* get you completely smooth or as close as a razor -- but you will also NEVER get an ingrown hair or nasty red razorburn from this little hummer.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> It gets much closer to sensitive areas without cutting or feeling weird.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t afraid to nick myself because of the guard and it provided a really close trim.</li>
            <li> I finally took the end piece off and shaved directly against my skin because I was so frustrated with it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You can remove the guard and trim without it, but you have to be careful and go slowly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> waste of 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> some areas you may need to run it a few times...</li>
            <li> If you have trouble, use a mirror to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one when this one dies, even if its after a few months.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the battery hasn&#x27;t faltered yet</li>
            <li> Not smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few types of trimmers and &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I left behind on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it as efficient as my old trimmer (which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t seem to be in production anymore.)</li>
            <li> I have SENSITIVE skin and nearly every form of hair removal results in horrible red bumps.</li>
            <li> It cuts me a few times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of money, wish i never purchased it, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone....</li>
            <li> I have a few questions about this trimmer that I was hoping someone could answer for me?</li>
            <li> There was a few spots I had to go over a few times</li>
            <li> Has worked well for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It did work well for trimming prior to shaving, but if you don&#x27;t let it get to that point, it&#x27;s unnecessary anyway.</li>
            <li> I tried changing the batteries a few times, but it still didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but I think that is what killed it.</li>
            <li> A few people said this pulled, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I changed the batteries and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thought it stopped working after a few uses but had gotten water inside.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes , depending how big the game field is.</li>
            <li> It looks quite simple and outdated but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers I have had usually slice the delicate skin down there</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased one of those small portable bikini trimmers at CVS (it looks like a pen or something) and</li>
            <li> The guides are not calibrated correctly and the trimmer took turns being razor sharp to incredibly dull.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these on base when I was in the military from &#x27;99 to &#x27;05.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer WILL trim hair but not easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid nothing last too long these days, but what did I expect for $20?</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not exactly the type of thing you can return.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a remington one that would actually cut and rip up my skin, not good!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it died in less than a year, with only once-every-two-weeks usage.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I press down hard the on off switch, it buzzes-</li>
            <li> this allows you to get with the security &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; tool on leaves hairs approximately 0,5 cm long.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try something new but wanted to.  </li>
            <li> I get REALLY bad razor burn on my bikini area and upper thighs when I use a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> The nick didn&#x27;t hurt too bad more like an uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment I have is I expected a carrying case for the trimmer, like on the picture, but it did not have one included.</li>
            <li> Also, it shaves thick or thin hair at the same speed.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it which makes tight spots hard to manage.</li>
            <li> With minor modifications (alternative trimmer head); black color; extraneous packaging this becomes expensive men&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> small size mkes it a winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s called heated, although that&#x27;s not why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps and irritation..</li>
            <li> I like the small size</li>
            <li> like the small size.</li>
            <li> This is a $20 trimmer and no more than that.</li>
            <li> It gets close and doesn&#x27;t bite like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with it is that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t shut off when I slide the switch.  </li>
            <li> Small and portable.</li>
            <li> but usually you dont have to.</li>
            <li> No more searching for shaver/trimmers that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Its small and portable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because sometimes I get lazy and let it all grow out</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a surprisingly small and compact device, and I&#x27;ll probably even take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area about 25 times to get mediocre results.  </li>
            <li> not sure what qualifies it as a bikini shaper or trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Feels bulky even though small.</li>
            <li> Small, battery operated and eBay to handle.  </li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure why it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; bikini trimmer either.  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Not sure why the description says heated, it is not.</li>
            <li> But I am still not sure if I want to keep using this trimmer or not.</li>
            <li> I usually take the comb head off to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It might cut hair better without the guard on, but that defeats the purpose, so... lame. :-(</li>
            <li> But it does trim well, and if you&#x27;re not living in a bathing suit this summer, it covers your (or at least my) bases for everyday</li>
            <li> Replaceable batteries mean no waiting if it goes dead while in use.</li>
            <li> It was still very uneven though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very heavy women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very good shaper &amp; trimmer.</li>
            <li> The battery life is not very good at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And finally, no more ingrown hairs, no more razor burn, and no more pain!</li>
            <li> But then that might be dangerous :o</li>
            <li> I actually got this to trim down my crazy dark arm hair without that weird</li>
            <li> Personally though, I&#x27;ve stopped using it in the bikini region as I find it difficult to maneuver in such an awkward space, if you know what I mean, even though that&#x27;s what it says it is for.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick yourself with this trimmer - an added plus in that sensitive zone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scissors are such a pain with a bad angle, just hope the razor stays sharp!  </li>
            <li> I use to use scissors for tidying up my nether regions, which resulted in nasty cuts, or the job was super uneven as I am not an acrobat.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting all of the hair even because it does not &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; the hair to trim it.  </li>
            <li> Did not quit and it was hard to</li>
            <li> Yep, works like a charm - gets all those hard to shave areas without nicking.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hardly cut hair</li>
            <li> to handle and maneuver in hard to reach areas&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly bothered by it, but if you&#x27;re shy</li>
            <li> (duh).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year</li>
            <li> I started with the guard on but it wasn&#x27;t cutting the hair close enough</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she complained of using a razor.  </li>
            <li> This was disappointing since I was hoping it would last me at least a decade.</li>
            <li> It can handle delicate areas</li>
            <li> The blade is longer and the batteries haven&#x27;t run out yet, I have used it at least 5 times now.</li>
            <li> The batteries work forever, well over a year at least with once a week use.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally delicate skin - just looking at a razor</li>
            <li> I was just late getting the mail....</li>
            <li> I have had this at least a year</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, however the product is worthless.</li>
            <li> It eats batteries, power is noticeably decreased after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I wanted it and the instructions were extremely unclear and vague.</li>
            <li> I mean, you are basically sanding your feet.</li>
            <li> I tried to fix it but the small plastic parts inside were destroyed!</li>
            <li> : if it says &amp;#34;Bikini trimmer&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t mean that guys cannot use it too.</li>
            <li> Or when you haven&#x27;t had time to get a wax and need to tend to would like the area to look groomed in the mean time.</li>
            <li> Pastels are not sexy!  </li>
            <li> I get horrible razor burn with a blade, even the special bikini razons and creams, etc.</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulls quite a bit if you&#x27;re not careful but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim close enough and very difficult to get the hair within the plastic guide .  </li>
            <li> I think some of the past reviewers were confused when they purchased this item and didn&#x27;t notice that it says &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot; in the name.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using an electric trimmer on my armpits and Southern region because I didn&#x27;t want to get razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs, irritation, etc.  </li>
            <li> I can keep the &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34; at bay without having to spend serious bank on going to the salon every week for a wax.</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on its lowest setting it catches hairs and can be quite painful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s about the size of a typical beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than others as well.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, buy one.</li>
            <li> less expensive than the ones i&#x27;ve seen in stores</li>
            <li> Just give it a quick rinse afterwards you filthy animal!</li>
            <li> I think it is so much smarter to default to maintenance with this (no ingrown hairs or painful grow out periods!)</li>
            <li> Not a good investment.</li>
            <li> It pulls and trim at the same time (painful).  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that it was awkward to use, but I decided to try it, anyway.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving my bikini line because it always gets all red and bumpy and is very uncomfortable, but this trims everything really short and neat.  </li>
            <li> It went dull from from months  of manscaping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, and waxing results in horrible hive-like rashes a few days after (nevermind the pain during the waxing process!)</li>
            <li> but I found it weak.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife overseas and unfortunately she was not able to use it before the return policy expired.</li>
            <li> Just gotta remove the batteries when you&#x27;re not using it or it&#x27;ll work weakly...</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This thing finally nicked me! :(</li>
            <li> But what is not mentioned is that it is very hard to maneuver in those hard-to-reach places for a close trim.</li>
            <li> No irritation like with shaving but doesn&#x27;t get the tough to reach spot s</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulls hair unless you use it VERY slowly.</li>
            <li> I actually used to use the Shick Intuition Razer and, even with shaving cream, I always itched afterwards and got shave bumps and, it was quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Get one if you want to shave or thin your, &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET CONFUSED</li>
            <li> The plastic head was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Easily broken.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lot of longer hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> but I was still confused.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Its broken.  </li>
            <li> and I bought this trimmer in hopes of getting some relief from the razor burn; but alas seems like for me this trimmer might not do that trick for what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Read some reviews that mention battery area rust etc, have not experienced it in the 2 months</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone who is sick of using a razor or tired of paying for expensive waxes.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER cut myself, pinched my skin, hurt myself, or had any other bad reaction/effect happen to me when I used this trimmer without the plastic guard.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> and I was a little disappointed in this one because it has a tendency to tug on the pubic hair as I&#x27;m cutting it which hurts a little.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted for a few years before it started going bad.</li>
            <li> After trying others, when the old one gave out, they were terrible.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad one or what.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dead.. :(</li>
            <li> the blades become weak and end up breaking hair rather than cutting</li>
            <li> I always have a bloody mess whenever I tried to use this.</li>
            <li> so it gets 3 for being lame like that</li>
            <li> It does its job without fail.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my arms, which reduces the appearance of the hair without giving that weird hairless shaven arm look.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> DO NOT pay these outrageous third party prices!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> (even worked on butt crack fuzz, sorry, tmi).</li>
            <li> I have to say i was skeptical about all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is uncomfortable, waxing is pricey.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something like this for a while, and saw it at a salon I go to, but I found it expensive there.  </li>
            <li> Seems expensive for four times of use.</li>
            <li> This was useless for me unless I took the guard off of it.</li>
            <li> I used several trimmers and this is the worst.  </li>
            <li> Basically useless.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> If you feel pain, you&#x27;re doing it wrong</li>
            <li> And do not rate it wrong because you didn&#x27;t understand the title of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the guard and find that this trimmer pulls uncomfortably on longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> the slide up gauge to cut hair longer is useless.</li>
            <li> Lastly, why does every manufacturer figure that women want to shave their girly bits with awful pastel colored contraptions.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong .</li>
            <li> If I do I get those nasty red bumps that hurt and itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use a razor, which would give me horrible red bumps that made me look like a had some STD or something.  </li>
            <li> Like I mean, I have it BAD.</li>
            <li> I have had some painful pulling of hair, in awkward, hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this trimmer was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I spent all summer in my chacos, walking around 7-10 miles a day, and my feet were disgusting.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a razor, a bikini wax is too painful, and using those chemical-filled hair removal creams is irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> also I think it&#x27;s stupid and ridiculous to pretend like women have no pubic hair).</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Forget scissors - they are dangerous compared to this gadget.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about watching carefully or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> My neck and bottom jaw have burn scars and this shaved over them without pulling or cutting the scars.</li>
            <li> but then I would be afraid of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally cutting yourself (ouch).  </li>
            <li> Has had no problems at all cutting any of it.  </li>
            <li> There are five settings and the settings on this one are a bit &#x27;longer&#x27; which is disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> and I have had no problems with cutting, pinching, etc.</li>
            <li> People who gave this 1 star are crazy.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because I held it at a awkward angle while trimming.</li>
            <li> but the settings are all *crazy</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong for the price!  </li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t buy expensive bikini trimmers anymore!</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like it, but it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I used to get bikini waxes every month, but it started to get expensive (and painful!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is bad or not or if I am suppose to do this</li>
            <li> The description when I ordered said it was supposed to come with a storage bad</li>
            <li> so I figured maybe I just had a bad one, so I ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When I tried to trim with the guard off, it pulled so bad.</li>
            <li> I get bad razor burn when I shave the bikini area with razors, not with this.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> replacing batteries is always a bad sign.</li>
            <li> I prefer trimmers like this one compared to the foil shavers which are painful and pluck out the hairs.</li>
            <li> She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.      </li>
            <li> This is a piece of garbage and you&#x27;ll just be frustrated if you buy it.</li>
            <li> $70 extremely painful waxing</li>
            <li> I was too frustrated to even bother contacting the company for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Then I began researching, bought this product, and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed that after all these years they didn&#x27;t make a rechargeable version of it, but I can&#x27;t hold that against this model.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed with this</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> If you are undecided on purchasing this product I would tell you that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Usually I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed by this product, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Stop cutting yourself with scissors and use this baby!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m just giving it 4 stars... :(</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t shave like that :(</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed with this Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> (I hate bikini bumps)</li>
            <li> I hate itching when hair grows in</li>
            <li> but it works by 2 base battary</li>
            <li> becaue I HATE the feeling of hair down-there.</li>
            <li> It is a trimmer, so it won&#x27;t shave everything and it&#x27;s impossible to get ingrown hair!</li>
            <li> Mostly I hated it because I hate the razor bumps and the day after itching.  </li>
            <li> It is not as bad a nick as with a razor, but still a nick!</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was looking for in trimmers, but I hated shaving and waxing was way too painful/expensive to upkeep.</li>
            <li> I tried it without the blade guard to get a close shave, and it was very painful.  </li>
            <li> Very painful.  </li>
            <li> Before I would shave and get razor bumps, then I started doing waxing, very painful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I read the user manual that says blade, not inexpensive, needs to be replaced every year!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> it was terrible...</li>
            <li> I am a sufferer of Nasty Feet.</li>
            <li> Like too embarrassed to go get a pedicure to try and fix it disgusting.</li>
            <li> This plus some foot cream turned my Nasty Feet into Not Competely Disgusting Feet......</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>
            <li> This one is HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> it was my solution, used it twice and its not made for curves around your bikini area, worst of all it catches!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving!!!</li>
            <li> This thing does a terrible job of trimming.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long at all, pulled on hairs as well.</li>
            <li> This works great for the quick trimming in between waxes. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer I use it for my yorkie.</li>
            <li> As a 0.7mm aprox. trimmer they are very good. It is not shave close.&lt;br /&gt;The small size mkes it a winner.&lt;br /&gt;You have to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; clean them after each use with a small softbrush provided.</li>
            <li> This product is high-quality and just the right size.  I have tried the cheaper versions and they don&#x27;t compare.  I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The trim heights seem to be an issue, but I make it work and you become accustom to it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth pubic area, this is not for you, because it doesn&#x27;t get razor close.  I like it because it cuts hair to a very short length without causing ingrown hairs like a razor does.  For panty line strays, you will still need a razor. It&#x27;s very easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li> No red bumps! It&#x27;s not a super smooth close shave but it definitely cleans up the area well. My boyfriend likes the results and I like that there is no need for a torturous grooming regime. It&#x27;s easy to use and painless!</li>
            <li> Have had two.  Both broke.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I wanted it and the instructions were extremely unclear and vague. It claims there are five settings but there are actually only two; On, and Off. Would not pay more than $10. HOWEVER, the one redeeming quality the trimmer has is that it did not give me razor bumps. I can keep the &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34; at bay without having to spend serious bank on going to the salon every week for a wax.</li>
            <li> Good quality razer for the money</li>
            <li> LOVE this lil device and bought extras for my daughters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic and to the point, you adjust it to 5 lengths and it cuts evenly.  I&#x27;m kinda pissed that I lost the adjustment piece and had to buy a whole new one because just the replacement is no where online and Panasonic wants to charge you more than the original cost of the entire set.... so it gets 3 for being lame like that</li>
            <li> although there are plenty of good reviwes for this item ( and that was the reason I have orderd this) but it cut my skin every single time that i used it. I try to work with it very carefuly and gently but still in injure my skin. After using that i didnt have any alergy or ingrown hair at all so it is much better than shaving. So may be I will order similar thing from other company...</li>
            <li> Possibly the best bilkini trimmer available.  Only downside is it&#x27;s not waterproof</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this for a couple of months. Very sharp clean cutting blades with the protective cover it wouldn&#x27;t cut me but cut hair very short in those sensitive areas.  Was the best........and then one day it just stopped working - it won&#x27;t turn on. I haven&#x27;t tried contacting the seller or Panasonic yet but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The size is great, love the guard, and it gets pretty close.  You can get a closer shave without the guard.  I wish it had a bit more power but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few years now. Works great, very easy to use. Ordered for my daughter. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming tool. Provides a close shave without any discomfort &amp; very easy to use. Perfect for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s cordless, it trims, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  The guard is good with the different levels for length and the battery life is also good.  You can also use it without the guard to remove some hair completely but that isn&#x27;t what this is for.  It&#x27;s a bikini shaper and TRIMMER, so don&#x27;t buy this if you want all the hair removed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of years ago, then lost part of the top a few months ago. I bought a new one pretty soon after because I could not live without this thing. It makes it quick and easy to take care of the lady business.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this trimmer. I really wanted to like it, however the product is worthless. I bought this because my original one broke after years of use. My origninal trimmer was made for men and I thought to try a product made for women. That was a mistake, it barely trims and is made cheaply. I regret this purchase....</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, and I love how easy it is to adjust the trimming length!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great, and it&#x27;s lasted this long. Both me and my husband use it. It&#x27;s a much better option than shaving, but it won&#x27;t do 100% smooth shave that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a trimmer :)</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying at all!  It pulls hair and is not very efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading a lot of the reviews. This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten specifically for the bikini area and I&#x27;m quite impressed. I was hesitant at first to trim around the really sensitive areas but it&#x27;s really easy to use and I never nicked or cut myself once. I highly recommend it. I used it at it&#x27;s lowest setting with the guard first and then cleaned up without the guard. It gave me just the trim I was looking for. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too stoked about is that it makes quite a mess. It doesn&#x27;t allow the cut hair to collect anywhere and it just gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great price. Powerful. Gets those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is wonderful!  Great for those hard to reach places-it is exactly what I wanted.  I HATE shaving my bikini line because it always gets all red and bumpy and is very uncomfortable, but this trims everything really short and neat.  It DOES NOT REMOVE ALL THE HAIR-but then again it is just a TRIMMER. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and went back to the beard and mustache trimmer I was using.</li>
            <li> I was previously using men&#x27;s clippers to trim, and cripes those clippers were loud.  I rushed trying to save my hearing.  Now I have a proper lady clipper that&#x27;s small, quiet and doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.  It will trim super super short if you remove attachment, doesn&#x27;t pull &amp; isn&#x27;t painfull at all.  I tried others &amp; this is the best at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a product like this before, so I can&#x27;t really provide a good review here without something to compare it to.  I have used this product once and it wasn&#x27;t as clean and snappy of a job as I thought it would be, but maybe I set my expectations too high.  It did what it is supposed to do and the product seems to be quality, so no complaints.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer.  Perfect for bikinis</li>
            <li> I lost my first Panasonic and went through various other alternatives, only to come back to it!! Nothing works better .</li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done. I would recommend it to people who just want to shape up and look well groomed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again ! Doesn&#x27;t trim close enough and very difficult to get the hair within the plastic guide .  Just another tool for my drawer .</li>
            <li> Simple design, no flash and a great product. It does its job without fail. It isn&#x27;t fancy with lotion dispensers, scents or anything called HD. It also is very affordable because you aren&#x27;t paying for an ad campaign during the Superbowl that comes with other products. I wish more items would be sold like this.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these on base when I was in the military from &#x27;99 to &#x27;05.  It lasted until 2009!  No kidding!  I only recently had to replace it and was so happy when I found it on Amazaon.  This is the most well-made trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I bought this even though there were some pretty strong negative reviews.  I must say that I am very pleased with the shaver.  It does allow you to get really close, no bumps when the hair grows back and I haven&#x27;t had to shave as often.  You can&#x27;t use it in the shower because it is battery operated, which I love because I always forgot to charge the other one that I had.  This way I can just pop in batteries when I need it - with 2 little boys around I am in pretty high stock of batteries. Overall very pleased with this product.  It was also a fraction of the cost as at Ulta - even with the shipping.</li>
            <li> Originally I rated this trimmer only 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed the hair close enough. But then I discovered if you remove the grooming comb you get a nice clean trim. I highly recommend this now.</li>
            <li> This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely. If you are anti apilator and waxing, this trimmer is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Its compact and works well in tight spaces. I wish it were waterproof though.... that would make clean up easier.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is very versatile...it also works great on your sideburns. The fact that it runs on 2 AA batteries, frees you from working close to an electric outlet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who likes to stay, how shall I say it?, reletively &amp;quot;tidy.&amp;quot; As much as I love staying shorn and bare, I absolutely hate shaving &amp;quot;down there&amp;quot; with a razor -- and as for a Brazillian wax? NO WAY.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where this little trimmer comes in. It&#x27;s absolutely ideal for cropping hair relatively close to the skin, and the narrow blade width allows me to get all those delicate nooks and crannies. No, this trimmer will *not* get you completely smooth or as close as a razor -- but you will also NEVER get an ingrown hair or nasty red razorburn from this little hummer.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: works great for men&#x27;s private areas, too!</li>
            <li> I wont&#x27; go into the nitty gritty details here...but suffice to say this little guy keeps you nice and neat...and no annoying cords get in the way.&lt;BR&gt;I adore this trimmer and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> what cud i do without it!!!!</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works well.  My only issue with it is that, if you also epilate, you might as well save the money and buy the Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator: [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a bikini trimmer attachment that can trim the hair down south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice.  However, if you just need to trim down, and also epilate, the Braun product does a decent job of just trimming it down---the price of it is a little over double of the trimmer, but therefore works well as a combination product for a couple different needs.</li>
            <li> Does not remove hair as it claims.  Waste of money. Will not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has several setting for different lengths, comes with a slipcase, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. This is a wonderful trimmer for your bikini area. If you are looking to get a smooth shave, this isn&#x27;t for you.  It is simply a trimmer that is great for maintenance.</li>
            <li> THank YOu! I had been wanting something like this forever, I thought it only existed in my dreams!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well for trimming up.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I expected for the cost.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch tender skin, even without a guard.  Works with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I hope they never change this product - best personal shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li> PROS: This is a pretty good trimmer. It&#x27;s easy to clean and makes it almost impossible to create nicks and cuts.    CONS:It can be a bit unwieldy and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> This was a great trimmer- it didn&#x27;t cut my skin (unlike a horrid Remington one I had), it gave me a close trimming, and I could clean it easily. It did eat through batteries, though. Unfortunately, it died in less than a year, with only once-every-two-weeks usage. I expected more from the Panasonic brand, which is normally superb, and this isn&#x27;t the cheapest trimmer out there. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well, I can honestly say after doing MUCH research within the \\&quot;bikini hair-removing\\&quot; area, this was the best thing I could have ever bought. I looked up bikini trimmers, the shavers, the wax, and this product definitely beats them all. I actually used to use the Shick Intuition Razer and, even with shaving cream, I always itched afterwards and got shave bumps and, it was quite annoying. Then I began researching, bought this product, and I have not been disappointed. I guess depending on what you like, the little part that goes on the top lets you adjust how long you want your hair, the settings go from 1-5. I personally like it very very short, so I just take the additional part on top off and use the trimmer by itself. I found this works well. I have had this for 2 months I think and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries, and I usually use it for about 5 minutes or so each time I trim, once a week, so, the battery life is pretty good. It fits nicely in your hand, its easy to use, and best of all it&#x27;s afforable and it DOESN&#x27;T hurt like maybe a wax would. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a pain-free, easy way to get rid of the bikini line that won&#x27;t kill your wallet (because that&#x27;s a big deal when you&#x27;re in college like I am) I would suggest this to anyone in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> It works fine but for some reason the shape and design just feels clunky to me.  Maybe a more streamlined shape and not so square an end would be better.  It does seem solid though and like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the attachment and this is so easy to use since it&#x27;s battery operated. The trim settings are easy to adjust. Perfect Bikini trimmer. Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer. Does the job quickly and neatly. Love the little brush that comes with it that helps keep it tidy. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer is great. I&#x27;d never used a product like this before, so I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into. But this trimmer works really well, has different settings and easy to care for. Love it!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before buying this product. I highly recommend this product to all you ladies. I was very happy with it&#x27;s ease of use. It did a good job. I give it 5 Stars!!!</li>
            <li> After having looked for years to something like this, I bought it to dity up and it is absolutely fab!! Does a great job!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Like most or all of the other reviewers, I love this. I was using cuticle scissors, this works beautifully is a great product, compact and easy-to-use. Button line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> My boyfriend happily bought this for me, upon request, when I decided I wanted to try going bare. I figured that I&#x27;d use it to trim my bikini area as a prep for shaving. However, I soon found out that a) my skin down there is far too sensitive to handle a razor, and b) this little trimmer is all I actually need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that by taking off the plastic guard, and being VERY careful, I got a trim almost as close as a shave. It&#x27;s a perfect (and powerful) bikini trimmer, easy to handle for smaller hands like mine, and gets into the creases and tight spots without any trouble. I absolutely love it! And I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner, because now I can&#x27;t imagine going back to being au natural. Definitely an item worth purchasing. DEFINITELY.</li>
            <li> pull your hair a bit...</li>
            <li> Trims it low like how I like it. Works good. Wish it had different head attachments for those hard to reach spots but I love it. You would too</li>
            <li> I liked the product, until it broke now. I think this is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for the products I purchase, but I felt compelled to write one for this nifty little product. Honestly I had low expectations when I ordered the product, but with all the great reviews this Panasonic trimmer has received I figured what the heck I&#x27;ll give a shot. And all I can say is WOW! WHY did I not have this trimmer before now? The Panasonic ES246 AC allows you to adjust the the length of the cut to five different settings which allows you to get as close (or not) as you&#x27;d like. You can remove the guard and trim without it, but you have to be careful and go slowly or you&#x27;ll nick yourself. I trimmed without the guard on and I got a pretty close shave that way. Was it perfectly smooth? No, but it was a cinch to use a quality razor to finish off that part. Also, I should note that as someone who has sensitive skin, I was able to get a pretty darn close shave without any razor burn, rashes, or ingrown hairs.    This unit is small and compact and fits easily in your hand. It even trimmed well on those delicate/harder to reach places. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me. Would recommend buying a Norelco or something nicer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just what I wanted. I get horrible razor burn with a blade, even the special bikini razons and creams, etc. I have always used this type of trimmer to avoid bumps and burn. You can take the guard off so it trims close, and use the guard to trim hair to the appropriate length. It is easy to use and I don&#x27;t get the irritation of a blade. Works great for me!</li>
            <li> Product works very well and I have not had any problems. Great for the value! I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and it still works perfect.</li>
            <li> No cut and nips from using this. Very easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It runs with battery so cordless. It is not very powerful but it does the job without a mess. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again. Cuts short but not too close on the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting. It leaves hair long enough to be a little softer and I like that the plastic guard prevents catching skin. I impatiently ripped open the box, grabbed some batteries, and tackled some winter fur without needing to examine the directions so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easy to use. Powered through pretty successfully. Drop a towel on the floor, prop a foot up, and sprinkle a little baby powder down below to defuzz much easier than with messy creams in the shower! ;)</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer!! It actually trims very close but as others have said it isn&#x27;t a shaver so you won&#x27;t be completely hair-free.  But it is excellent for what it is intended to do, which is trim.</li>
            <li> Not quite as close a shave as I hoped but performs well to the described specifications.</li>
            <li> Great for men too! ;)</li>
            <li> Easy, fool proof, and safe. Quality product. Have used this handy contraption several times since purchase and no complaints. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great! Made my life easy. i can quickly trim unwanted hair all over. preps the area for my single blade electric shaver. Its a smooth ride ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who formerly used razors which might cause problems as you could guess. She&#x27;s very happy with the effectiveness of the product and the reduced razor use.  Get one if you want to shave or thin your, &amp;#34;well you know&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Best bikini trimmer. Does the job!</li>
            <li> This is the first bikini shaver/trimmer I have purchased.  The guard is nice but does not shave as close as I would like, so I just remove the guard and shave carefully to get a closer shave.  Love it!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t follow curves, still need to trim with scissors. My husband&#x27;s ManGroomer works better for following the curves in.</li>
            <li> Mehh, I didn&#x27;t expect a close shave, but I expected a little better than what it does, I like to keep everything shaved, and I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve had it...I went right back to using my old one.</li>
            <li> As commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise, I have found it necessary to keep my personal regions clear of any potential problem areas that could effect relationships between myself (as a representative of the galactic fleet) and other life forms to include members of my command. I have found the Panasonic ES246AC Shaper &amp; Trimmer to be a very valuable tool when performing all tasks associated with shaping/trimming. I would recommend this item to anyone in the galaxy.</li>
            <li> Great little hair trimmer, light, easy to hold and control.  If you like a little \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming, this is definitely a great buy!  As a guy, this little trimmer is amazing and takes out the worry of accidentally nicking yourself in a place you do not want to be nicked, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and works well.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading reviews of other brands. I am very pleased with its function, size, and portability. The different levels are very useful and there have been absolutely no nicks and cuts. It works well even near sensitive areas without causing any irritation. The easy to clean design makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 5 years and works great!! It finally died on me but I think for the price having working fine for 5 years is definitely worth the money.  I just ordered the exact same one to replace it.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Does the job. But be prepared to purchase one every 6 months. I&#x27;ve purchased 2. both times, they suddenly stopped working. Make sure you register the product so you can use the warranty.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s called heated, although that&#x27;s not why I bought it.  It snags and tugs a little more than the model I used to use, which broke.  I&#x27;m not really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> No longer looking at a jungle</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! Very easy to use and more durable than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works for both males and females and does a wonderful job! best off all, it doesn&#x27;t leave the trimmed area feeling spikey! :)</li>
            <li> Works great.  I bought a second one for my teen daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s also not great.  If you are trying to keep some length on your bikini area, this is the one for you.  It definitely cuts cleanly and works well, but you are going to have about 1/4 inch of hair left that you still have to shave off if you are looking for a smooth shave.  I read the reviews that other people posted before I bought this so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be a smooth shave, but I was hoping it would leave stubble, and not just shorter hair.  It&#x27;s not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> This does a great job trimming the bikini area.  It&#x27;s a nice size - slim and light, feels good in the hand, not too loud.  I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to trim as short as I want.  With the attachment on, you can get down to 1/8\\&quot; (their measurement).  But if you want to go shorter, just take the attachment off.  I&#x27;m careful using it without the attachment because I don&#x27;t want to nick myself - I use it gently and don&#x27;t press.  But I haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer i&#x27;ve bought. I used to go with those little ones you see on infomercials, but it seemed like after using it only a few times, the blades became so dull so quickly that you just had to throw them away and buy a new one. This one is powerful and it seems durable. The only downside is that the head is a bit too wide to be able to do any real angling, so that can be difficult.</li>
            <li> simple, easy and adjustable. perfect!</li>
            <li> Comes with a little brush for cleaning. Does NOT come with batteries. The length is adjusted by squeezing the sides and sliding the comb part; there are only a few length options. Is not any louder or quieter than a man&#x27;s beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because of the size but this trimmer hurts and it pulls the hair. Only used it once. I am going back to using my male trimmer</li>
            <li> bought it for the wife but when I tried it I fell in love! Better than using heavy clippers..</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust desired length, works dry or in the shower just as well, no nicking or cutting skin. Must confess I wax the edges and only use this to shorten hair, not shave it all off, so have not tried a skin close shave. For the purpose I use it for, works excellent!</li>
            <li> Ok. Guard keeps it from getting really close.  And its hard to use w/o the guard in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and have not had to change the batteries yet (I do take them out between uses). The trimmer is easy to use though you have to make the hair stand up right under the blade for it to cut. It does not nick and works well in tight spaces on the body. Cleaning is easy, but I have to clean it twice during each use. It does not come with a case, so buy your own (I got a pencil case from Target for it).</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and is very powerful compared to the kind I used to use and a much wider top so it cuts more at once.  It is just a trimmer so it doesn&#x27;t get a super close shave but it works good for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Great for decreasing thickness and maintaining hair without getting rid of it completely. I do often use it without the blue plastic head piece to get a close cut before using my Cleancut Personal Shaver. But be warned...it&#x27;s not meant to be used with the plastic head and does easily pull/cut at the skin.</li>
            <li> The blade is compact and sharp, and offers replacement parts, but the fact that this system uses batteries is a downer. I&#x27;ve switched to the Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 5 different types of trimmers over the years and this one works the best. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in your hand and the trimmer guide works well. It&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair from the trim end and the battery seems to last forever. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works beautifully.  It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain.  I also use it on my arms, which reduces the appearance of the hair without giving that weird hairless shaven arm look.  My only complaint is that the shortest setting is .125 inches, which is still a considerable amount of hair.  Sometimes I remove the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch.  I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer from Amazon in 2002 and have happily used it until it just decided to die on me recently. Since I haven&#x27;t seen many similar products (most are razors, not adjustable trimmers), I decided to try and replace the one I already had. I was surprised to see the same model is still sold! It&#x27;s obviously a quality product if it&#x27;s been around so long and hasn&#x27;t changed any. I think that the 11 years of use I got out of it was acceptable (and it cost $10 more back when I got it) so I don&#x27;t mind having to buy it again now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer adjusts to various lengths and I&#x27;ve only ever had it \\&quot;snag\\&quot; if I wasn&#x27;t using the guard and was trying to get a close shave. Even then it didn&#x27;t happen often, and I have very coarse hair. I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed that after all these years they didn&#x27;t make a rechargeable version of it, but I can&#x27;t hold that against this model. The battery life is decent. The angled head makes it easy to maintain a fluid motion in hard to reach areas. I have no idea why this says \\&quot;heated\\&quot; in the title though.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer as an easy way to shape and trim the tough areas.  The trimmer is a little bulky and not the easiest to maneuver but does a pretty good job.  If you are looking for a trimmer that can cut down to the skin or make designs, this is not the trimmer for you; without the guard, it leaves a little less than 1/8 inch.  It is also not a trimmer you can bring in the shower with you, not a waterproof shaver. It is a definite step up from shaving with a razor however and works well so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product because its the right size and doesn&#x27;t cut you or grab at you like others do. Plus the price was right and does the job. It arrived very quickly and I would recommend this product. Now remember its for people that don&#x27;t want a really close shave that its completely shaven , but that&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li> Not a super close trim. but otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li> This bikini TRIMMER (read: NOT razor), can quickly and easily trim hair down to a very low level (but not so short it&#x27;s prickly). You use it dry, it is powered with batteries, and it really is idiot-proof until you try to shave without the trim guard (duh). I love mine so much, I am buying a second for our vacation home. Who knew bikini line maintenance could be this easy?</li>
            <li> IT DOES IT&#x27;S JOB!! I CANT LIVE WITHOUT THIS TRIMMER! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD</li>
            <li> Does what it says, which is trimming and is excellent in it. Highly satisfied with the purchase. No skin irritation or pulling of hair while trimming is done.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works and I can choose whatever length I want it. It is very gentle too. It is a little loud but that sound didn&#x27;t bother me. It sounds like an electric razor. I&#x27;ve never used a vibrator so I can&#x27;t say it sounds like that, because other reviews said that&#x27;s what it sounds like. I love this very much and it is very gentle like I said and I love the price for it. I&#x27;ve had this product for a year and it&#x27;s been awesome I will definetly keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Having been pregnant for past few years it can be challenging for many reasons to get a bikini wax.  This was very helpful in keeping things neat in between many MANY doctor visits and huge for money saving when Bliss charges $70 and up for a wax this proved easier to maintain - and good cost savings too. .  Would recommend to ANY pregnant woman.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This broke after two uses. I tried replacing the batteries but it was an issue with the item itself. The two occasions it worked, it was a great product-very fast and effective.</li>
            <li> this works well keeping my bikini area neat. do not get this wet or it will rust so beware of using this in the shower. it takes batteries so that&#x27;s the only real downside. it has the ability to cut the hair very close and completely off if you&#x27;d like to use it for that as well.</li>
            <li> Even though this is for women, I use it myself.    Gets you nice and clean with minimal irritation and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Works FANTASTIC!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The size and style is very convenient.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do a close shave.  It&#x27;s fine for trimming but getting along the sides for actually hair removal..not very close at all.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  Small enough for \\&quot;tough\\&quot; spaces. Its easy to hold and maneuver. Just make sure you get batteries ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product so I didn&#x27;t have to use a razor on my bikini area.  Well I still do.  I have used it once and it didn&#x27;t get any closer then my other electric shaver from Norelco. This product is fine if you just wanted to trim down the bikini area but not if you want it smooth for swim suit season.</li>
            <li> I think some of the past reviewers were confused when they purchased this item and didn&#x27;t notice that it says &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot; in the name.  This trimmer will not get you shaved smooth, but will trim your hair down relatively short.  It allows you to chose what length you want your bikini area hair to be.  It works great!  I would recommend this product for any male or female who wants to trim their pubic areas.  It is easy to use and painfree.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product that will remove all of the hair I highly suggest the Braun 2370 Silk-epil EverSoft Body System.  It has two different interchangeable heads and works as a shaver and as a epil system.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm , it is perfect !!! Trust me buy it and you will love it</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best. Works perfectly. No complaints. No regrets. Great Buy!! I have had it for almost a year and use it for bikini trims. Never had a problem. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion, I must comment on the 3/5 reviewer.  Either the directions were not read or it is not being used properly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does all that the other reviewers say.  It&#x27;s a good bargain.  The only drawback I see with it is that the cut hair sticks to this thing like glue.  This makes it hard to clean off since you can&#x27;t run it under water.  The plastic needs to be more \\&quot;anti-stat\\&quot;.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great trimmer!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer and would recommend it to anyone! It&#x27;s an all-around great product. No complaints. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, needed, and expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few years now. It&#x27;s not a very good shaper &amp; trimmer. It does not work very well and does not shave well either. I purchased this to replace my remington which died after many years of working perfectly. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another Remington to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after comparing similar items and reading reviews and this is a great product. My main concern was that as a woman of color, with naturally thicker and courser hair, that this wouldn&#x27;t work very well. Two weeks later, I&#x27;m happy to say that this trimmer works great. It gets very close, but without any pain, irritation or bumps.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and was looking for.  Trims to various lengths, and I can even use while 8 months pregnant without looking~!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product! It is easy to use and easy to clean. It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works great, have multiple razor level options (0 to 5), small and light weight, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this bikini trimmer. i&#x27;ve tried two other ones (one by epilady, and i forget the brand of the other one), but this is my favorite. although it might not cut as close or be as sharp as other bikini trimmers, it NEVER nicks my skin or causes irritation, which i think is a fair tradeoff. it&#x27;s also easy to hold and maneuver. but DO save the \\&quot;buy replacement parts\\&quot; sheet that comes with the product because i threw that away the first time i bought it, and the blade became dull after about 9 months (with me trimming about 1-2 times per week)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. This is not a razor and I knew that when ordering it, I was not expecting to get a close shave from it. It trims down the hair nicely and (following the suggestion of another reviewer - thank you!) I put some baby powder on my skin before using this and it goes on smoothly. No more razor bumps and irritation.. that deserves a big YAY!&lt;br /&gt;A five star product for me.</li>
            <li> I love this thing and could NEVER go back to razors alone. The adjustable trimmer attachment  is essential for a nice, painless trim (you don&#x27;t want to go wacking away at lengthier hairs without trimming them down first), and allows for better shaping. I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year and she&#x27;s never given me any problems. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s promised to do.  I want more power, so I&#x27;ll buy a second one, but if you want mild trimming, this product is good enough.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times since I got this, but I feel like it&#x27;s mostly been my fault for not being careful enough. It fits nicely in my hand, is basically easy to maneuver and ultimately does the job well and quickly other than the few mishaps I&#x27;ve had. I appreciated that it came in easy to open packaging with a small cleaning comb as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old female who has never shaved my private area before. As you can imagine, it was a jungle. I had been wanting to shave down there for a while now, and decided to get this. After about 30 minutes without the guard on and also shaving with cream and a razor, my overgrown bush now had become mostly smooth(with some prickly spots). This worked wonders for me, and no cuts or burn was left afterward. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a shave and wants one fast without the pain of a wax!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a trimmer that had stopped working.  This one is reasonably-price and does and works ok.  I don&#x27;t like the guard on this particular product because it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the trimmer I had before.</li>
            <li> Did not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li> After reading loads of reviews, I was pretty keen to buy as a replacement for my Braun FG 1100, which I&#x27;d had for ages. Sadly, after just one use, I&#x27;ve realised it&#x27;s just as good as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the trimmer blade kept nicking my skin (which is not what you want when you&#x27;re grooming the delicate areas), and using the guide takes forever to shorten longer hairs to a better length.&lt;br /&gt;If I could return this in good concious (after using it), I would - but I&#x27;ll be definitely going back to the little Braun, which is super quick and way more precise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 6 years and it&#x27;s been great!  Uses batteries but they last a long time with occasional use.  Perfect for trimming any kond of body hair.  We love it!</li>
            <li> A great tool, especially while pregnant. Personal grooming becomes much more difficult with a bowling ball strapped to your belly. In all seriousness though, having used it twice at this point, it was worth the purchase and I wish I would&#x27;ve found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. I had it for 10 years before i bought it again, better then other ones i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Weak....overall it does the job but I found it weak.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I wish it was smaller/slimmer.</li>
            <li> This is much smaller than I thought so not true to size as pictured.  It does work if you have a lot of hair to remove, otherwise, not so much. Kinda disappointed with this but it did work.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first l but the top metal that moves on the top broke after 7 or so times using it, and now it&#x27;s useless. That makes this as good as the drug store razor/trimmers but more expensive. So disappointing!</li>
            <li> This pulls and causes ingrown hairs.  Absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a very gud trimmer, very easy to use and since it is a trimmer, not a shaver,results are fine. it is worth of its cost.i love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> After trying to trim for years with scissors... never again. This little guy is amazing. Absolutely amazing. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stop reading these reviews and buy it already! Its the best trimmer out there for women. My GF loves it!</li>
            <li> Other men might be turned off by the fact that this thing is baby blue and says \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; on it, but it works very well and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to do some trimming.</li>
            <li> This should be packaged as a unisex product. Once again, Japanese precision and elegance shine through. This product is made in Japan and it clearly shows. It works great for men.</li>
            <li> fabulous product, very easy to use</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these, one for myself and two for my daughters for Christmas gifts.  I thought it would be a good product due to the \\&quot;Good Housekeeping\\&quot; seal of approval.  I am sending back two of the three, only because I tried mine out and can&#x27;t return it.  It states in the description that you can adjust the blade guard to trim as closely as you want. Do not order this expecting a close shave at all.  I tried it without the blade guard to get a close shave, and it was very painful.  Even with the blade guard, it pulls and pinches.  I regret ordering this product and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected</li>
            <li> Broke after using it 4 times. First the motor slowed down, then it turned off and never came back on. I&#x27;m thinking about trying to open it up and see if anything is fixable. I mean it&#x27;s not exactly the type of thing you can return. Really dissapointing as this is the first bikini trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I definitely would have bought the same trimmer in the future if it was dependable. For the price this is absolutely unacceptable. I will never buy panasonic again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely dislike it. It&#x27;s inconvenient. I gave it to my mum and bought another one trimmer. It&#x27;s a Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Worked once, then tried the following week to use again and nothing. I replaced the batteries, nothing works it&#x27;s dead.. :( waste of 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this.  But boy am I glad I did!  It&#x27;s inexpensive.  It&#x27;s cut my shaving time by two thirds!  It&#x27;s so easy.  No bumps, and it&#x27;s all even.  Fabulous.  Every girl needs this product!</li>
            <li> I just got this little trimmer and it&#x27;s awesome!  It won&#x27;t get you completely smooth, but it will go as close as possible without any damage to your skin.  Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great. I got it after reading all the other reviews and I have to agree with everyone about how good a trimmmer it is.  The only disappointment I have is I expected a carrying case for the trimmer, like on the picture, but it did not have one included.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a few months ago because I wanted the bare look, but my skin is very sensitive and shaving just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Waxing was too expensive/painful/embarrassing/messy of an option for me and epilators seemed intimidating as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great, economical option for me. I use it without the guard and get the hair down to just a stubble (I&#x27;ve never cut myself). That avoids any skin irritation (itching or bumps) but still keeps things neat. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it could make it completely smooth, but that probably brings back irritation issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is too wide to get around areas with folds, so I use it in combination with the [[ASIN:B000FRVA8O Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover with Pivoting Head]] to get to areas around my lips and between my butt cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have no problem using a razor and cream to shave around my lips - it&#x27;s only the mons that get irritated, so you might try that to get the smoothest results where it counts most :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it, with the guard, to trim the longer hairs around my boyfriend&#x27;s nipples. I&#x27;m guessing you could use it for other areas of the body, like trimming sideburns or neck hair, if you wanted to, making it versatile, cheap, quick and effective. A good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times, but so far It works exactly as I had hoped. You get a clean, even trim, so much easier than what it used to be! You can get a very short trim if you want, and you&#x27;ll probably have to trim a couple of times from different directions, but that&#x27;s due to hair growth patterns, not the trimmer, and even then it&#x27;s super quick. Got mine just in time for the beach.... Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for!!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I can&#x27;t believe I had been using a normal razor all this time.&lt;br /&gt;It works fantastically with the guard head on, trims easily without snagging. I love how you can adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;I personally was hoping it&#x27;d mimic the results of shaving, so I took off the guard head and used it that way and surprisingly - I had no cuts or snagging, and it cut everything so short that it isn&#x27;t noticeable, but the follicles are still minutely above skin so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the pain and razor burns when it starts to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly so happy to have a relief of trimming my bikini line come summer.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item January 20, 2014.  I used it for the 1st time December 2014.  I was afraid to try something new but wanted to.  I love, love, love this item.  Quick and easy clean up.  If you are looking for a trim or a cutter just to lower the hair in the lower region.  Then this is for you!!! I am ordering another one as a gift.  Quick and easy to the extent that I personally need.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my investment.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s compact and cordless, but the guide&#x27;s edge is too rounded off so it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as easily and the shortest length (imo) isn&#x27;t short enough.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and stick to trimmers from Wahl.</li>
            <li> So light,gantle and girly.Love it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does. Safe and easy to use. It arrived early which is always nice. Great price since I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this locally.</li>
            <li> This does the trick along the bikini area. The only thing i wish was different so that it was adjustable. Decent price.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products but am so happy with this product that I felt compelled to do so. I have done the shaving and waxing thing only to deal with the ingrown hairs and bumps due to the re-growth. I wanted something that I could use to \\&quot;manicure the lawn\\&quot; so to speak and have been researching trimmers for the last month. I was going to buy one of those super expensive trimmers because I figured the more expensive it is the better the product will be, until I stumbled onto this product and read all the reviews. I just received it and tried it out and am so pleased with the results. There are 3 lengths with 1 being the shortest or you can remove the clipper  to totally shave the hair completely off (I am a little nervous to try that) but the 1 was the perfect length for me without the worry of ingrown hairs and itchiness of regrowth. If you are undecided on purchasing this product I would tell you that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really kind of scared to use this since I had prior nightmares with razors and shavers, but wow! This was outstanding! No cuts, bumps or anything of that sort! Plus it gets the bush trimmed well. I would surely recommend this product to anyone who is timid to blades around there pubic area.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I decided to end my personal war on pubic hair. I wanted to have hair down in those nether regions but keep it looking trim and tidy. This completely does the trick! This trimmer allows for five different lengths. I personally go with the shortest - a number 1 - and it&#x27;s probably an eighth of an inch or a little less even. Then I let it go for a couple of weeks before trimming it up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick yourself with this trimmer - an added plus in that sensitive zone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that your hair, while short, is still slightly visible. So I do shave my bikini line if I plan on being in a bathingsuit amongst strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, no more ingrown hairs, no more razor burn, and no more pain! It seems kind of ludicrous to me that I spent years of my life removing all my hair down there to meet some societal standard. Anyone who thinks the baby-like, razorburned look is hotter than what this provides is crazytown. Get this product!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations after reading the reviews. I like the small size but it isn&#x27;t powerful enough. Not that I&#x27;m shaving through a jungle of bush or anything! It&#x27;s just cheaply made. Gets the job done but it&#x27;s just kind of clunky to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the small size. Easy to store and would be easy to travel with. It&#x27;s just average. When I&#x27;m trimming down there, I want to be using the best and this isn&#x27;t it. I bought other trimmers after this trying to find a better one. This will just sit in my bathroom and collect dust. I will only use this if I am travelling to slip into my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not powerful enough at all. You will not get a quick, easy once-over trim with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the third party prices for this of $80, at the moment, are JACKED UP! I paid $20 or 25 for this when I bought it from Amazon. DO NOT pay these outrageous third party prices! Seriously! You could find a high quality one for that price, even half that price! Keep looking! This is a $20 trimmer and no more than that.</li>
            <li> nice doesnot give that smoothness ,but better than razor after bumps and hair removing lotion cream smell,i liked it and use it every week</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She hasn&#x27;t experienced any pulling while the different settings work well and gives a clean and precise shave.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.  Good product.</li>
            <li> By far the best bikini trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go totally bare and smooth, and was looking for a trimmer. This one is very good for the price. It does not pull hair, is ouchless and easy to clean. I&#x27;ve used it dry so far and it&#x27;s excellent. You can choose the desired length - I like the shortest (3 mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some areas you may need to run it a few times... And this product is no way perfect (like the rather loud motor noise), but for the price this is great and I have nothing to complain. I&#x27;ve also read that the blade is not replacable... I&#x27;ll just buy another one.</li>
            <li> When I first got this bikini shaper it was great! Then about 2 months later it stopped working - boo! I took it apart and cleaned the mechanisms only to have it power down for good. Nice design, great user experience, but poor quality.</li>
            <li> Good, basic, durable. Gets the job done, but does not inspire worries about nicking anything--the guard does its job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived super quickly too. Just wish it was HOT PINK or girly looking so my bf wouldn&#x27;t take...LOL!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well and is easy to handle. Reallly like the 4 different levels of shave with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy not having shaving bumps anymore on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS THING!!! I&#x27;ve had it for I want to say almost 2 years and it is still up and running! I don&#x27;t know if this is bad or not or if I am suppose to do this but I took off that little plastic piece and it works A LOT better on my areas ;-). Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> only use this if you have nothing else.  you have to pass over areas repeatedly to get an even trim.  even on the lowest guard height.  removing the guard results in hair being entirely too low, almost gone.  i do not like.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive trimmer that does the job just fine.  Not great, not bad, just about what you&#x27;d expect. A good deal for the product.</li>
            <li> Works well and so far has not gone out usually it is hard to find trimmers that really work without pulling and hurting this one was easy to use and did not pull out hair. I liked the product and so far it is still working after six months.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaper and trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for. It&#x27;s well made and works great. I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> good design, simple and work very well. It use normal battery, but I like the design, because I can buy the rechargeable one easily.&lt;br /&gt;My wife like it very much. And,,, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product. the trimmings go everywhere and all over the trimmer itself..it&#x27;s not very close at all..definitely leaves something to be desired..</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer. The first one lasted over 5 years but I think the reason it quit working is my fault, as I think it got too much moisture where it was relocated at the time. Buying another one as it does a great job and it lasted over 5+ years.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting all of the hair even because it does not &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; the hair to trim it.  I find myself sort of pinching my skin up to give the trimmer access to the hair so it takes longer than I thought it would to trim up.  It&#x27;s the only trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and it definitely beats shaving that area!  I can use it without worrying about hairs being pulled or skin being caught even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> So convenient! Don&#x27;t know what I did before it haha</li>
            <li> Shaper was just as advertised and has worked better than expected with no scrapes or skin burns. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver that is very comfortable in the hand and shaves nice and close without nicking . I would have given it 5 stars if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great, although I never use the attachment to trim \\&quot;down there\\&quot; because it would still leave it too long and I like it almost bare. It its a good size not too big and not too small, so it can trim a larger area as opposed to the small little trimmer which would take twice the time. I&#x27;ve had it for 7 months and would get it again if it ever breaks, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t *fingers crossed*.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my personal Panasonic Bikini Shaper and Trimmer.  Its the perfect size and it gets all the areas I need to trim.  The only way it could be improved is if it were waterproof, but its really not a big deal.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product just one time, and the next time I tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Super disappointing. Not sure if I just got a bad one or what. I liked what it did the one and only time it worked, though!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in July.  It&#x27;s August and it stopped working.  That is totally unacceptable and it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> Affordable, does the job, and works well. If only it was rechargeable! Either way, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase even if it does run off batteries.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Worth the money. It does exactly what I need it to do. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulls quite a bit if you&#x27;re not careful but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> This is a shaver, not remover! It does not get extremely close to the roots which I like because then I don&#x27;t have to deal with ingrown hairs. It works VERY well and is completely painless so you are able to get into hard-to-reach crevices. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A good product a little rough, works well, but it does the job! I would Just be careful around sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Great as long as you use the guard. If you try to get closer, all it does is pull the hair. Ouch!</li>
            <li> If I could review this clipper for longevity, it would be a 10! I have had this since 2005, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it about 2x per month, and take care to oil and clean it after each use, but it has been great. The only thing I would change is the how close the blade gets to the skin, it would be nice to get a really close clip, but the 1/4&amp;#34; is not bad at all. No pulling or pinching, and for the $11.99 I paid 10 years ago, it has done quite nicely! Do yourself a favor and buy one of these bad boys if you want a decent personal clipper that gives a great clip, has longevity, is compact, and relatively quiet. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice, but will have to get my old man to help.</li>
            <li> Slick, Sleek, and good for a man.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get everything even, but works well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, though I really wish it was waterproof. Easy to use, easy to clean. I just had to change my routine a bit to use this before I turn the shower on (my previous trimmer was waterproof). Very adjustable.</li>
            <li> Quiet, close trim with no nicks or snags. Great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> The clipper (Definately not a shaver) does a great job, but the batteries wear down quickly.  I should have paid more money and bought a chargable type.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Very strong and it runs on the battery power for quite a long time before the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Pretty impressed. The color scheme + over all design of the product made me think it was dated. This was not the case. It did exactly what I needed it to do. It was very simple to use. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Died after one use. Battery won&#x27;t charge again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap shaper and this one works real good and it&#x27;s not too expensive. It is really easy too use, and it doesn&#x27;t have too many features.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s that it uses AA batteries (I don&#x27;t like to throw them away). But that&#x27;s really personal, and I can always get rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> What a great gadget! I kind of have the OCD to cleanliness. Hair can make me feel dirty; holds bacteria even if you wash the area good. Gross! It trims close enough that it looks like nothing is barely there from a far. It also does a wonderful job trimming in awkward positions. If you have trouble, use a mirror to see what you are doing. Its also a great product to use for preparating before waxing. Now that fall is coming, I no longer need waxing. I can stay and feel clean using this product alone. If you were going to the beach and looking for that no hair nude-look, this product would not deliver that. This is a TRIMMER. Useful for keep you fresh for the week. Men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on cheap batteries. This product is not waterproof, so do not clean it with water. Use clipper disinfecting spray like Andis Cool Care Plus after using. It will help disinfect and lubricate the hair clipper.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has worked well in that it has not pinched or cut me.  I was disappointed when I read the user manual that says blade, not inexpensive, needs to be replaced every year!</li>
            <li> Compared to other trimmers I have owned, this one is by far the best.  Don&#x27;t know why it says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; though. If there&#x27;s some type of heating function I don&#x27;t know that it works. But it trims the hair and that&#x27;s what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies, but this product is gentle and effective for the bikini line. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> pulls hairs a little. I like the wahl much better, but I already bought this one. I stopped buying much electronic stuff on amazon, since the return policy feels like a hassle to me. Stores seems better for some stuff.</li>
            <li> This bikini shaper has been great so far.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems and hope that it lasts me a long time!</li>
            <li> Had the shaver 12 months, and it just stopped working.  Never got it wet and cleaned if after each use.  Barely used--So upset.</li>
            <li> Loved it! As is the description, doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave because it is a trimmer, but definitely does an excellent job as a trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;Works very smooth and felt really safe.</li>
            <li> I want to add my enthusiastic review to the chorus. I&#x27;m usually not fond of little devices that run on AA batteries. However, when I took it out of the package, I noticed its weight. There must be a pretty good little motor inside, because it does the job quickly and well, just as advertised. It&#x27;s compact, fits easily in the hand and is easy to store, since it takes up very little space. It seems as if Panasonic cares about its reputation and most likely reviewed and tested it thoroughly before sale.</li>
            <li> As a longtime shaver and waxer, I switched to trimming when I became pregnant and could no longer see. This trimmer is fantastic. I have no irritation, in-grown hairs, or cuts.  This is a really low maintenance tool and simple to use.  The lowest setting leaves the appearance of shaving without the actual side effects of shaving (nicks, irritation, etc.).  I definitely recommend this to anyone who is sick of using a razor or tired of paying for expensive waxes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products, but none have lasted past a battery change. This one seems like a keeper. Minimal tugging and nice results.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer. It does get pretty close, so as an alternative to shaving or to trim up what you don&#x27;t want \\&quot;bald\\&quot;, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I like that there&#x27;s only one attachment that adjusts to any length so you don&#x27;t need to mess with a bunch of different pieces. I was SO sick of razor bumps that I decided to give this a try and am really glad I did.  Now bump and irritation free! Plus, it&#x27;s large enough to be expedient, but small enough to be maneuverable.  Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife overseas and unfortunately she was not able to use it before the return policy expired. The product was used once and then stopped working all together. I called Amazon upon my return to the U.S. but they simply informed me that the return date has expired and to contact Panasonic.     I love purchasing from Amazon.com especially products sold by Amazon LLC, but this was disappointing to hear that they could not help me out after I had purchased so many products through their website.    Usually electronic products have a given one year warranty, but theses are simply 30 days. For every 100 of these trimmers probably 1-5 are faulty. Just my luck of the draw I guess.    I purchased this because the reviews were great for it, and it probably is a great trimmer. I just won&#x27;t be able to give you much advise as mine didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I found this to be one of the best trimmers I have purchased.  It gets close and doesn&#x27;t bite like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Its also fun to take in who&#x27;s turn is it to get pampered.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve had. The old one (pink) still works fine after maybe 10 years.  Batteries last a long time, and easy to replace common AAs</li>
            <li> nice while it lasted. I purchased the item in December, it will not work after only 6 months of infrequent use. it was never submerged in water so I can&#x27;t figure it out. The razor I previously owned (another brand) lasted 9 yrs</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well! I have used it several times already, and it works wonderfully. I even use it for my armpits, and it works just as well!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this trimmer was a disappointment. It simply wasn&#x27;t useful with the guard in place-- just ran over the area and did not trim the hair. Without the guard it works, but you&#x27;re taking a chance on a memorable and unpleasant injury.</li>
            <li> You know you need it...this does what your looking for.  Forget scissors - they are dangerous compared to this gadget.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer!  You cannot go wrong for the price!  My last one was $189 and I had it for years.  This one is just as good.</li>
            <li> #1, This trimmer isn&#x27;t really made in Japan, it maybe put together there and some parts maybe even made there, BUT the electric motor is made in china, it&#x27;s a very strong motor, but it&#x27;s still made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# 2,  I&#x27;m a MAN and I can shave my face with this if my beard is long enough, so this little thing has enough power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and it takes 2 AA batteries and the trimmer blade and the blue square plastic piece its connected to pops off to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and just for the heck of it (replacement parts paperwork for this) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) comb attachment price $2.27 part no. WES246A7398&lt;br /&gt;2) BLADE!!! $10.50 part no. WES246A1058...&lt;br /&gt;3) Battery cover $1.70 WES246A3128&lt;br /&gt;4) cleaning brush $.95 WES76806761</li>
            <li> this trimmer WILL trim hair but not easily. it takes a really long time and a lot of your own added coercion for it to pick up most of your hairs to pull them into its blades. essentially it won&#x27;t pick them up at all and you&#x27;re left to figure out on your own how to get them in there. final result: 4/5 stars. required effort: 1/5 stars.</li>
            <li> this device works quickly , painlessly and  does just what you want it to do-cleans up the area so that you won&#x27;t be embarrassed by unwanted hair. in addition, unlike a razor there is no painful, itchy stubble growing back around the panty line.</li>
            <li> I am not one to review very often on Amazon, but was compelled to by this electric trimmer. Wow. I am a woman of color with coarse, unruly hair. I have long gotten waxed - and almost always the technician says &amp;#34;is this your first time?&amp;#34; - Ha! I prefer to keep my hair low for hygienic and aesthetic reasons, but was fed up with the ordeal of getting waxed and how frequently you have to go. Enter my bikini trimmer search. This Panasonic baby is so good! Gentle, efficient, and really makes the region look good. I think it is so much smarter to default to maintenance with this (no ingrown hairs or painful grow out periods!) and to wax when you have a long beach getaway. It gets the hair unobtrusively low and I love it. Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Very useful altough not as effective as I was expecting, it&#x27;s kinda hard for it to catch shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This makes things so much easier and faster. I was hesitant at first becasue I&#x27;m cheap, but after the first use I knew it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest things I&#x27;ve learned about from a magazine article.  It needs to be mentioned more often as this product is so very effective in tidying up the bikini area!  If only I had known about this product sooner as it saves the pain from brazilian waxing although it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate hair, the result is pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great!  No more red bumps or irritation like you get from razors or hair removers.  Like others said, it didn&#x27;t come with a carrying pouch, but I didn&#x27;t mind.  I recommended it to a friend and she bought one too, and loves it!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. This is the worst shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various cordless trimmers, all of them were rechargeable, and all of them lost power within a year or two and the cost of replacing the battery was almost as much as the trimmer.    This trimmer takes 2 standard AA batteries.  I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargables which are excellent.    This trimmer is very powerful for it&#x27;s small size.  It fits the hand well.  Many cordless trimmers I had in the past were overly bulky.  It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; trimmer, and it works great for my girlfriend, but I use it too, and we both love it.    I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard, my hair, and all parts and it&#x27;s great.  The adjustable length mechanism works very well and is removable, as are the blades which can be removed and thoroughly cleaned (and replaced if necessary).    This product is very well designed, and at an excellent price.  I highly recommend it.    P.S. - The item doesn&#x27;t come with batteries.  As I said earlier, I highly recommend Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  They&#x27;re NiMH batteries but with a new design so they keep their charge (\\&quot;normal\\&quot; NiMH rechargeable batteries rapidly lose their charge entirely after only a month even when they&#x27;re not being used at all).  Sanyo claims an unused Eneloop battery will still have up to 85% of it&#x27;s charge after 1 year, and my experience with them seems to confirm that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews and I was rather disappointed. It did get the job done, sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The size is good and is easy to maneuver. Being battery-operated was nice, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guard on it is very odd, it slides up and down for different lengths and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pick up\\&quot; the hairs to be trimmed. So most of the hair is still laying flat and doesn&#x27;t get cut. It took MANY passes over the same areas and pulling the skin very taut, sometimes holding hairs straight up to get them to go through the guard, to get a half-way decent trim. It was still very uneven though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this would be ok for touching up, but I won&#x27;t be using it when I need to get the full \\&quot;haircut\\&quot;. If the guards were the normal ones that snap on and off like hair clippers, this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, do NOT use this without the guard, it will pull hairs and nick skin. Which, in my personal opinion, takes away from being a bikini trimmer. It should trim and shave.)</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable.  Trims very well.  The cleaning brush it comes with is handy.  The only thing wrong with it is that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t shut off when I slide the switch.  I have to slide it back and forth a few times for it to shut off.  Something&#x27;s loose in there.  But, it works and trims well enough.</li>
            <li> does a fantastic job, there are some reviews saying it either breaks after a few uses or that it doesnt give you a close enough shave, i find these comments not to be true.</li>
            <li> I just love the way this little hand held shaver that helps me to feel &#x27;kept clean&#x27; in an area that isn&#x27;t in view to anyone else to see but me.  Infact this is my 2nd one, the other one finally gave out after nearly 10 years of use or so it seems, ha!.</li>
            <li> I get REALLY bad razor burn on my bikini area and upper thighs when I use a traditional razor. I have tried everything! Exfoliating, lotions, special shaving cream, nothing worked. I decided I wouldn&#x27;t bother anymore...To my husbands dismay..haha. I started using the noxema disposable trimmers. They work great also but it takes forever and they rust if you do not care for them properly. For $20 (only $5 more than a 3 pack of disposables) I bought this little wonder. My husband was away with the military so things were very unruly down there... Well 5 minutes later it was spic and span! You can adjust the height level so you can decide how long you want your hair... I used the lowest setting and it worked great. You can also take off the guard and use it like a regular razor. I will buy another one when this one dies, even if its after a few months. Avoiding debilitating razor burn is worth it!</li>
            <li> This bikini shaper is much better than the last one I used. It gets much closer to sensitive areas without cutting or feeling weird. and it cleans so easily, I just rinse it in water. I&#x27;m glad I ditched my old one and got this one. Battery life is good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my &amp;#34;hedges&amp;#34;...my husband now dominates it. It went dull from from months  of manscaping! I pkan to buy a new one and hide it.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that the product actually met my expectations!  Usually I am disappointed.  That is the reason I chose to review this product.  Do not hesitate to purchase this product.  I have used it only once; so I am hopeful that it will continue to perform as it did the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trimmer. It trims. I don&#x27;t see anything superior or particularly impressive about it. It works like a trimmer should, no more no less. The end.</li>
            <li> This little thing is way more effective and reliable than my rechargeable trimmers were.  I will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> ... My wife loves this, and so do I.  ;)  I&#x27;ve used it to trim my beard without telling her.  Shhhhhh</li>
            <li> Great product, love the different lengths to choose from, love the narrow size for good angling to get that bikini weather short trim!!</li>
            <li> Ok guys, don&#x27;t get in a snit,  but yes I use this bikini shaver for my mustache and sideburns,  have had one for about ten years and when I saw this I could not help but buy it as a backup. My sideburns grow very quickly and curl out so that I look like I have wings, set this at number two and with one swipe makes them look as if I just came from a barber shop.  Same for my mustache.  I have a Wahl mustache trimmer but this one is so much faster.&lt;br /&gt;When I fired it up I was justified in my purchase.  The old one, though still running well, sounded like a hedge clipper next to my new one, so no telling how long it will last.  I have more than received my monies worth from the first and expect the same from this new one,  very flexible to use.  If you&#x27;re patient you could cut your own hair and save the money on the very first use,&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, but this is one of my better buys</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace a Remington trimmer I bought years ago.  The trimmer is much wider than other bikini trimmers, which means I can trim more quickly.  This is exactly what I wanted and it&#x27;s still going strong after a year or so!</li>
            <li> pulls hair sometimes and does a ok trim, i don&#x27;t see how it being heated enhances it, i wish it won&#x27;t snag hair and i would be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased one of those small portable bikini trimmers at CVS (it looks like a pen or something) and it was terrible...pulling at my hairs and just generally not doing a great job of trimming. That cost me about $10. This trimmer works great! The guard lets you choose your length and I experienced no pulling or discomfort while trimming. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well (according to my girlfriend words).</li>
            <li> This trimmer is safe to use and does a very good job. I got one for myself and also as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> This worked great. I started with the guard on but it wasn&#x27;t cutting the hair close enough so I removed it. The shaver didn&#x27;t pull at my skin -- you have to hold it right and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. It was also easy to clean. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love it, works great!!</li>
            <li> I am a large, tall woman, who had difficulty shaving my genital area with a razor. The trimmer is quick, easy, painless, since it doesn&#x27;t catch the skin and is something I wished I had purchased years ago.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best trimmer I have ever bought.. It is not just for the bikini area.. great for trimming hair too, that is, if you are cutting your kids hair.. its OUCHLESS.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use and safe.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This little beauty lasted me through 6 years and several boyfriends.  It just died, so time to buy a new one!  Reliable, great price, and does a good job.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying anything new.</li>
            <li> My wife used this just once and she was satisfied with this product. One thing I personally noticed was that the metal teeth at the top were rounded instead of being sharp like other trimmers which is a great thing as sharp metal potion could actually hurt you.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was made for. Battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s slim size makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Nice for trimming the bikini area without shaving too closely to cause irritation. I prefer trimmers like this one compared to the foil shavers which are painful and pluck out the hairs. Great Product</li>
            <li> I like the look of this trimmer, very sleek and has nice grips to hold it. The one i had before this worked in the shower and i don&#x27;t think this one can which is kind of inconvenient but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I can not get get over how happy I am with this product. I am a little too hairy down there, as you all know what I&#x27;m saying... and I&#x27;ve been embarrassed FOREVER. I&#x27;m going to go into a lot of detail here in case anyone like me is out there, but I used to get TONS of ingrown hairs and razor burn outside of my bikini line and was often too embarrassed to go swimming. THIS IS FINALLY OVER. I just gotta moisturize after using. At first I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t working that well (which it wasn&#x27;t, it was missing a lot of hair) but finally I just took the razor protector off entirely (which you probably shouldn&#x27;t do but oh well) and it worked PERFECTLY. (even worked on butt crack fuzz, sorry, tmi). I am just so happy. After most of the hair was gone I was easily able to trim the landing strip I leave to the perfect manicured length. In love.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well and does not provide a close shave</li>
            <li> Okay I really don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but I was compelled to write this one. I am a sufferer of Nasty Feet. I spent all summer in my chacos, walking around 7-10 miles a day, and my feet were disgusting. Like too embarrassed to go get a pedicure to try and fix it disgusting. So I searched Amazon for some possible fixes. I bought this, not expecting much, but BOY am I glad I purchased this. My super calloused feet are now smooth. I mean, you are basically sanding your feet. No getting around that. But it sure does work. This plus some foot cream turned my Nasty Feet into Not Competely Disgusting Feet...... And for that I am grateful. I have already ordered more of the round file things, and plan on incorporating this into my routine.</li>
            <li> No wonder why this is one of the most popular personal trimmers that I have researched online. Good size, doesn&#x27;t snag or pinch. Trims real close quickly and effectively. I will never go back to shaving and dealing with razor burn and bikini bumps and irritation. This trims so close it really is the next best thing to shaving.</li>
            <li> I like to shave everything but I don&#x27;t like to razor shave it smooth. (I hate bikini bumps) So finding the perfect shaver was a must, and this is it! My husband even loves it! LOL!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of hair pulling with this...ouch!</li>
            <li> Powerful, consistent, easy to clean. No, you will not be smooth. Also no problem with getting a little closer with the guard off.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, and waxing results in horrible hive-like rashes a few days after (nevermind the pain during the waxing process!), I was on the hunt for something to &amp;#34;trim the hedges&amp;#34;.  I decided on this one after reading several customer reviews, and am very pleased with it thus far.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and have liked the results.  Even though I have not had the guts to use without the plastic guard, it leaves the hair short enough.  I have never snagged any hair nor had any accidents.  This little machine is very easy to use, efficient and relatively fast.  Would recommend to anyone wishing to &amp;#34;neaten&amp;#34;  their area.</li>
            <li> It was a great price, keeps everything trimmed nicely. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> eweww. its my bros shaver. worked great.</li>
            <li> To begin with: For irrational reason like the name \\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot; I did not like the company.  Over the years, in search for perfect shaving, ~$4000 spent in experimenting; only Panasonic shavers came close to DE razors for acceptable results. Once you open that shaver, you&#x27;ll find why!!! Well thought design. This gadget shares the same Panasonic design philosophy.  If you want to experiment; buy this one, cheap and open all  parts and see, clean, and close - capable. Looks like they deliberately designed this stripped-down version of their high end(200+$) shavers. I guess, marketing strategy. With minor modifications (alternative trimmer head); black color; extraneous packaging this becomes expensive men&#x27;s shaver. So, all in all, for the stated purpose they give out a lot with this one. Comfort: Good / best amongst available. Cleanability: Very nice. Color: I like purple. It&#x27;s a classy gadget. Solid construction good color. Good hold/feel. Nice power. For lazy days, remove the top cap and it becomes nice shaver that gives the looks of one-day shave. Perfect for people who like 1 to 2 mm of beard vs clean shave. Use with a good cream like Geo F Trumper and this becomes a very nice shaver too. Hint: if you have some tools, get another replacement head and file it to the thinnest feasible section and you&#x27;ll get the 200+$ shaver for the cost of ~5 $ &amp; 15 min.  Any second thoughts before buying? NONE.  Just buy it. You&#x27;ll love it.  &#x60;D</li>
            <li> This product works great and the batteries last for ages. The description when I ordered said it was supposed to come with a storage bad and I didn&#x27;t receive one.</li>
            <li> I love this compared to the Braun Bikini Shaver.  That one is so not worth the money.  This Panasonic has more length settings to choose from and it&#x27;s made in Japan.  Better quality in my opinion.  I&#x27;m able to get a real close shave without having to feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; or too hairy and no more razor bumps.  Also helps me save on time and money that I would spend on shaving creams too.</li>
            <li> I usually have the best luck with Panasonic products. The first one of these I purchased came apart inside. I tried to fix it but the small plastic parts inside were destroyed! When it worked I did like it so I figured maybe I just had a bad one, so I ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;This time I only used it about 4 times and now the motor slows way down and stops even with 2 sets of new batteries!&lt;br /&gt;I would never purchase another one of these!&lt;br /&gt;My other Panasonic shaver has been working great for over 12 years and my Panasonic cordless drills have been working great for over 20 years!</li>
            <li> Made in Japan. Silent.Sharp blades.Low price. Adjustable height. The best beard trimmer or whatever trimmer I have had. Panasonic uses high speed and a special blade design on these so they do not pinch or bruise. Because of the speed they are great for sculpting whatever you may want to trim. Small and portable. Definitely a 5 star item. Also great for women who want to keep a gentle length and do not like the pro look.</li>
            <li> This is great for what it is: a battery operated trimmer. It works well, but it&#x27;s not some amazing thing that will change your life. It can&#x27;t get wet, and you need to have batteries on hand because it&#x27;s not rechargable. The battery life is decent, but for some people, the extra cost for a rechargable unit is worth the extra cost. I bought this unit because the connector for the charger on my last electric trimmer eventually became so corroded that it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the whole &amp;#34;not waterproof&amp;#34; thing, but it&#x27;s a functional, inexpensive solution.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer only a handful of times.  I tried to use it the other day and it would not turn on.  I tried new batteries, still nothing.  I treated it well and barely used it before it died.  It worked okay when it worked, but was nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have to say i was skeptical about all the reviews.  this product is wonderful. it shaves close, easy to clean and no hair bumps.  excellent</li>
            <li> This was just too big for what I wanted. I wanted something that would trim my bikini area and I really dont know how anyone could use this to trim that area. Just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Did not work well. I somehow even managed to make myself bleed on more than one occasion. Not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> Works as it should. It is not to be used in water, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue. The trim length can be adjusted or removed for closer shave. Great for face, arms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk, &amp;#34;adjustable&amp;#34; guard broke after 2 uses. do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I was worried about ordering because I thought I&#x27;d just revert back to razors, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the trimmer. It&#x27;s smaller, good quality, and easy to use. If I could make an improvement, I&#x27;d make it a little bit more sensitive or powerful so that I could work quicker. But then that might be dangerous :o</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations based on reviews I&#x27;ve seen. Would prefer to buy a Philips device instead... Unless my unit has any problem...</li>
            <li> Does the job well. Easy to use and easy to clean out afterwards. Would recommend. Battery life is good too.</li>
            <li> it worked perfectly, it wasnt a totally clean close shave, but if it was you&#x27;d risk ingrown hairs and this removes the risk entirely! It was close enough for me (as in a couple mm), and it was really precise. You may have to go over the same place twice but usually you dont have to. And weirdly it leaves a nice soft feel, none of that prickly stuff. Overall very pleased- especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected</li>
            <li> Not a total &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave but pretty darn close. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it ladies, we&#x27;ve all stared at our area helplessly with a pair of scissors in our hands, hoping something better would come along. This is that something, I just found it long after half the rest of the world did.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is slim enough that you can actually maneuver around your lady bits.. to be clear, if you are in trimming stance (legs spread a bit), you can trim up one side of your lips and then the other side (with a small amount of stretching or maneuvering the current focus area).&lt;br /&gt;I never find trimmers that slim, it&#x27;s really nice to not have to worry about nicking anything. And the guard is on the head very securely so I don&#x27;t worry about any slips. Works great, may buy a second one for my guy so he can clean up if he wants, it has different settings on the guard that are all useful and I think a male would appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the battery hasn&#x27;t faltered yet so it appears to be holding its charge well, if that matters to whoever is reading this.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, try it out.. at least it&#x27;s a VERY reasonable price. (If the price was raised, I&#x27;d still purchase, I like it that much.)</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t nick you when you get in the nooks and crannies. It&#x27;s a nice color and is small enough to use in difficult to reach places.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  While her hair is not thick, it grows long very quickly.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.      The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won&#x27;t get you totally smooth or bald.  Get a wax or laser removal if you want a total smooth finish. But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.      Just take it easy around your bits.  It&#x27;s helpful to use a mirror, assuming you&#x27;re using it alone.  It&#x27;s more fun if you have your partner help.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.    You can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner.  Speaking of which, it works for men too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she complained of using a razor.  6 months later the thing just decides to stop working for no apparent reason.  I&#x27;m not going to even bother complaining, just buy a Norelco or something.</li>
            <li> During the delivery of my little girl by C-section, the doctor/nurses kept talking about how &amp;quot;neat&amp;quot; my pubic area was.  They complimented the prep-nurse, who finally told them that she didn&#x27;t do the prep, that I came in that way.  Needless to say, I love this product and have been using it for years, both before and after the birth.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is highly recommended for anyone who has ever tried to use scissors down there.  It&#x27;s great for trimming and even does a decent job shaving.    Two years later and it still works as well as it did the first time.  I don&#x27;t even remember changing the batteries (maybe once?).</li>
            <li> This trimmer is sure to keep your lower pubic area neat and tidy! You can adjust the length, so you have control of how much you trim and how much you keep. It doesn&#x27;t get you completely bald down there, but since I had read the reviews before purchasing this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. -For that I would suggest some Skintimate shaving cream and a Mach 3 razor. Oh, and some Bikini Zone as well. I personally prefer to just have mine neat and in order instead of completely shaved and so far this trimmer has kept me from having to deal with razor bumps. &lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it comes with a form showing you how you can order more parts if you need to. The top is adjustable and can come off for shaping up the edges and then it resembles regular hair clippers. (I didn&#x27;t know about that until I had received it.) Anyway, if you lose that top part or drop it and accidentally step on it or something, you&#x27;re gonna wanna replace just that part instead of the whole trimmer. It&#x27;s a little less stressful for me if I know -before I use the product- that if I screw something up, I can just order that particular part.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this product!&lt;br /&gt;*****Special Note About The Product&#x27;s Color: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT JUST FOR WOMEN. MEN CAN BENEFIT FROM USING THIS TRIMMER, TOO. IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD.*****</li>
            <li> not sure about the heated part,  mine did not feel heated..very easy to use and I am glad they make some specific to a womens needs.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this trimmer WHILE it worked but it stopped working, I put new batteries in and it won&#x27;t work.  Of course it can&#x27;t be returned now.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best grooming solution! Shaving is uncomfortable, waxing is pricey. This is the perfect do-it-yourself option that will look great too.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product so much quicker then shaving. I know it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor but since I read other reviews before I bought this product I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and bought this machine to avoid waxing at the time. This is an awesome machine, easy to clean and easy to use. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Works great!  I use it without the guard in areas as well and it doesn&#x27;t nick you if you&#x27;re pretty careful.  Makes everything very easy and fast!  Also it doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn.  Yay!  And I have yet to have to change the battery and I&#x27;ve had it for months!  I love how it&#x27;s cordless and small.  The only thing I would change, if I could, is having another shorter setting as the smallest setting is still a little long.  But whatevs.</li>
            <li> Good for it purpose and time when shaving or trimming. Did not quit and it was hard to but the blade back in place, Also hard to clean blade. Fast but got hot fast.</li>
            <li> Update: It drew blood. It&#x27;s going into the trash. This would work great if I kept the lawn a little longer, but since I prefer bare this is not very helpful. I bought it because my old Panasonic epilator/shaver feels like it&#x27;s dying and I thought maybe something with a  smaller head would be more comfortable. It&#x27;s not, and I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> easy to use, very functional.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.  I hate itching when hair grows in so I avoid completely shaving. I do, however, shave the bikini line and the area &amp;#34;that matters&amp;#34;, but up top, I use this on 1 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love it.</li>
            <li> The more pregnant I got, the less I was able to...uh...see things... This worked our perfectly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about watching carefully or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer! It can be adjusted for whatever length you want and cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Oct of 2012 to replace a Conair trimmer because they didn&#x27;t make that model anymore and this one had a high rating. This Panasonic trimmer died suddenly in Feb of 2015. It only lasted a little over two years. This was disappointing since I was hoping it would last me at least a decade. It worked OK, but never great. I had to keep going over spots repeatedly. (My previous trimmer had cost 1/4 as much and lasted 15 years -- and worked great.) Oh well... maybe I got a dud, but one thing is certain: I&#x27;ll never pay this much for a trimmer again.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the best trimmer I have used, and I have used quite a few.  The shape makes it easy to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> It will get the longer hairs trimmed but for a close shave you have to use a foil shaver or a razor.</li>
            <li> If all you want to do is trim, then this will suffice, but even in that capacity, you have to go over and over the same spot multiple times. Because I wanted a closer trim/shave, I just ordered this instead, on the recommendation of a friend and the reviews: Philips Consumer Lifestyle BG2028/42 Ultimate Body Groomer, Cordless. From what I can tell, it will let you do what this Panasonic one does, and more, and for very little extra cost.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. No more scissors, no more razor burn, it shaves quickly and exactly to where I want it to shave to!! I seriously couldn&#x27;t be any happier. Best money I&#x27;ve ever spend on a razor I never thought I&#x27;d buy! But its seriously an essential. It the perfect size, not too large, but big enough that I covers good &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; while shaving. And its super easy as its battery operated. It comes with just three pieces, the body, the guard, and a little brush to clean out the guard (Im assuming). As long as this thing lasts me a couple years I&#x27;d buy it over and over again. Im super happy with the job it does too. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Buy it, you&#x27;ll wish you did it sooner!</li>
            <li> It barely works. Doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  Not a good investment. Replaced it with a $15 Conair trimmer and am much happier.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with this product, just a close perfect shave. No more searching for shaver/trimmers that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, does exactly what it is supposed to do: provide a nice, clean trim. Easy to clean and easy to use. What more?</li>
            <li> This trimmer is extremely easy to use. I&#x27;ve had it for several years now and it has never failed me. The fact that it&#x27;s battery operated and portable makes it perfect for taking on vacations.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Can use it without the length guards.</li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t buy expensive bikini trimmers anymore! Buy the Norelco nose trimmer! It&#x27;s AMAZING and shaped perfectly for our areas!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does and i don&#x27;t think i need to get specific or else i will get flagged for posting inappropriate comments. Recommended buy.</li>
            <li> these are the better ones out there in the market. most of the others are more painful and end up with cuts. this is definitely better. still think waxing is the best option.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and plenty of adjustment levels to suit you. I suffer from terrible razor burn and ingrown hair after shaving, so this has been a pleasant and welcome relief to keeping my bikini area tidy. I use it in conjunction with the Clean Cut PS335 T-Shaped Shaver on my thighs which cuts closer without shaving bare. The two shavers make a perfect team.</li>
            <li> Works well and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just the right size for the bikini area. The cut is close but not completely bare. I was quite surprised at the fact that it is battery operated but yet so powerful.</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently and love it. Does the job. I have only had it for a month so we will see if I have any troubles with it later on. I will update.</li>
            <li> Just as others reviewed and does job well.</li>
            <li> It is great. I am able to get really close without cutting myself. Its small and portable. I love this thing. It trims short and only takes two batteries. Im glad I bought it</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome. Arrived quickly, very sturdy and performs nicely.</li>
            <li> I had one maybe 1/2 the size of this.  Although that was great for the nooks and crannies, I much prefer the size of this one for regular maintenance.  No problems loosing the charge, even when it is being less frequently used.  And I know my partner is glad I stopped stealing his electric razor for the job!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well and is easy to use.  Life changer!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something like this for a while, and saw it at a salon I go to, but I found it expensive there.  I decided to check it out at Amazon.com, found the price agreeable &amp; purchased it.  It&#x27;s a really good trimmer and I&#x27;d highly suggest purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I use this all over. Works great. No fear of getting bitten by the blades as setting 1 is long enough to prevent injury.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, very quick and easy to get a neat bikini line.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly as the packaging says; it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice product that works well.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaper/trimmer is a nice tool to use to keep things tidy. I like that it has multiple lengths, and it is also very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. I wasn&#x27;t afraid to nick myself because of the guard and it provided a really close trim.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish the edge of it wasn&#x27;t as pointy.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Shaper &amp; Trimmer is a good product.  Not junk, made well. Has an adjustable plastic slide on trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of garbage and you&#x27;ll just be frustrated if you buy it.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve only used it once but it&#x27;s everything I expected!</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all. A normal razor gets the job done with less discomfort, it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The packaging was reminiscent of something that is government-issue, but open it up, ignore the outdated colors and illustrations. This thing is amazing. It performs well on man and woman, beard and bikini. Don&#x27;t spend money on any features and attachments you won&#x27;t use if all you&#x27;re doing is making a basic triangle and just taming the landscape, if you will.</li>
            <li> used with baby powder as recommended by another review and worked amazing.  I was worried about the battery powered having enough juice but it was perfect.</li>
            <li> My girl loves this! She has praised it since day one and she actually encouraged me to write a review. I will add that the quality of the finished product is perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer! It work great and the best part for me it shaves as close as I like without leaving bumps or cutting myself as would happen with a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in January 2010 and loved it the from the first time I used it. I like the adjustable head and the fact that I can remove the head and just use the clippers for a closer shave. I&#x27;ve used it and gotten all up in my nook and cranny and not once have I been nicked or hurt myself in any way. I clean the head thoroughly between uses with either hot soapy water or just pouring alcohol on the trimmer head and the shaver. It gets down very low and I can do it without thinking or honestly without even looking. Its pretty foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so good that I even recommended it to my cousin and anyone I know</li>
            <li> Trimmer. Not smooth shave. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for herself and I needed to shave my beard quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It was the best shave I have ever had with an electric shaver. My neck and bottom jaw have burn scars and this shaved over them without pulling or cutting the scars.</li>
            <li> So far I love it. Its small and easy to maneuver and i love the neat and tidy results.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of triming the unwanted hair. I don&#x27;t have to worry about clipping myself. I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years now and it still works.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first 4 times but it completely died! It just doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore. And yes I tried changing the batteries. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to contact the manufacturer to see if they can send a replacement (maybe I just have a lemon?). Seems expensive for four times of use. No one else had this happen?</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome.  Makes trimming fast and easy.  So far I have had no issues with it and would buy again when mine gets to old.</li>
            <li> I bought it for shaving my chin. It shaves well. It is not so loud, but I do not like color, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this sooner.  It&#x27;s worked quite well on the same set of batteries for a while.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers that are more expensive that aren&#x27;t as good as this one.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the area like with other shavers.  No razor burn, no scratching, no irritation - and that&#x27;s without the guide.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easier to store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s been working pretty good.  I don&#x27;t wax but I like to keep my area nice and neat and it works great so far.  I started with the lowest and worked my way up to the length I wanted.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed that its heated, but it doesnt really make a difference to me. It gets the job done with no tangled cord to get in the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Panasonic items &amp; have absolutely no complaints with this purchase. I&#x27;ve used it &amp; like the way it works.</li>
            <li> Trims easily and painlessly, no snags, no bumps (note that I don&#x27;t usually get bumps), runs on two AA batteries, and has a two-year limited warranty. I don&#x27;t thinkbthis will malfunction anytime soon, but I can&#x27;t say at this point. Subtracting one star because I wish it came with something to catch the hair to make the overall process/cleanup easier. I haven&#x27;t tried another product to compare, but I don&#x27;t need a different product, so. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer. It gets as close as I like and is easy to clean. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few types of trimmers and &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34;.  From the cheapest to the kind that&lt;br /&gt;make you regret paying that much.  This baby performs better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I do go ahead and clean the blades, yes I know, only supposed to brush or wipe&lt;br /&gt;clean but that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I use it on my arms like a razor.  Just take&lt;br /&gt;the comb guide off and that&#x27;s how it acts.  No cuts so far.&lt;br /&gt;  Also appropriate for bikini season.  I would suggest going in every direction&lt;br /&gt;for perfectly even results.  It&#x27;s a close trim with the comb guide on.  It&#x27;s just&lt;br /&gt;long enough to shave if wanted, but not caused me any ingrowns.</li>
            <li> It works well for trimming hair and bikini area. My only problem is that it is a little noisy when in use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as described for nick-free trimming. I wish the shortest setting were a little shorter though--it still leaves hair a tad longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working after using it in the shower. The company quickly sent me a replacement and it works great. I don&#x27;t use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 5 years and am ready to buy myself another one.  It&#x27;s been a great product, trimming the hair just as it is designed to do.  I&#x27;ve never removed the protective guard, since I would use my razor for shaving.  And with the guard, I&#x27;ve NEVER cut myself.  How could I, with the guard in place?  Doesn&#x27;t seem possible. I appreciate the 5 different settings, and you can tell the difference when you change them. Works just as it is supposed to. I&#x27;ve noticed lately, though, that it makes more noise when I use it, and I can only surmise that after 5 hard-working years, the &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; may be dying. So I&#x27;m replacing it with the exact same model, hoping to get another 5 years out of the new one.</li>
            <li> For the low price this this beauty is a steal! It works exactly how I expected it would! Only cons I noticed are if your using the guarded the hair must be straight or you have to go over it multiple times which isn&#x27;t a problem for me because most times I don&#x27;t even use the guarded. Now with out the guarded it shaves down the the bare skin..it doesn&#x27;t get it completely smooth but the surface feels like if you would have shaved the day before with the little prickly hair which is fine for me! It&#x27;s a perfect little handy device.</li>
            <li> Love this product: small, cute and very easy to use. DO NOT GET CONFUSED: if it says &amp;#34;Bikini trimmer&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t mean that guys cannot use it too. Everyone has unwanted hair. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;P.S the only one thing - I wish it would be water resistant.</li>
            <li> Yep, works like a charm - gets all those hard to shave areas without nicking.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Keeps me neat and clean. I&#x27;m not sure why the title/label says &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; right now. When I bought it, I don&#x27;t think that was there, and mine is definitely not heated (why would you want a heated bikini trimmer?). I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it still works great. I like that you can adjust the level for a closer trim. It is a little loud, if that&#x27;s a concern for you. It didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a good trimmer and this one works very well! It is AMAZING. It gets incredibly low and works consistently and quickly. What normally takes me 30 minutes only took me 5 with this thing!</li>
            <li> This was the first trimmer I had ever bought. I loved it until it died. Then I bought a different brand it it was horrible. Was so happy when I found this one again. Used it yesterday and just as good as the first one. Only thing is that it is not meant for use in the shower, which is how I would use the first one, so that&#x27;s probably why it died.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is just for trimming. It is painless and very easy to use. Great to just trim the downstairs especially for the summer. ^_^</li>
            <li> Works really well to keep everything nice and neat :-)  I don&#x27;t use the guard, but it is a nice option to have if you needed it.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for a battery-operated trimmer. It has just as much as power as my husband’s corded, electric razor. Though it is small enough to get to all the lady parts, unlike a regular sized trimmer, which is great.  The trimmer lasts a fair amount of time before needing the batteries to be replaced. I was able to get everything trimmed fairly easily. Its size makes maneuvering it in small places, like the bikini area, fairly easy. It also has an optional cap that goes over the blades, preventing it from causing cuts and nicks. I tend not to use this cap however, because it doesn’t allow for as close of a shave.  The one drawback is that the blades got dull pretty quick, and it sometimes snags a hair, and cuts the skin which can be quite painful. Obviously, placing the cap over it would help with this, but like I said earlier, then you don’t get as close of a shave.  Overall, it works pretty well, and I use it fairly regularly. I have yet to find a perfect trimmer though, especially for the bikini area that shaves closer without occasional nicks or cuts.   [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic Bikini Trimmer and Shaver, Ladies, ES246AC]]</li>
            <li> Works well.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. My new Panasonic ES2207P works about the same.  Use this product at times.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> If you want to split the difference between looking like you have not gone through puberty yet, and looking like a feral guinea pig, this is a good choice.  It is a robust design that emphasizes function over style.  There are five settings for length. It was easy to assemble and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer that I bought stopped working after I accidentally dropped it. But since it was very handy and convenient I ordered another one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Wife tried it and said it just would not cut very much so she quit. As the other reviews state, remove the guard. Once she tried it without the guard, the one star product became a four star product. They should just sell it without the guard, as it defeats the overall usefulness of this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer! Finally found something to trim the bikini area without shaving or waxing which respectively cause bumps/redness/extreme itching and ingrown hairs. Easy to use, just slide the switch. Lots of length choices with the guide. Won&#x27;t cut you if you keep the guide on. However, if you want a closer cut, take off the guide and gently trim the hair with the blade. This can cause cuts and will tug on the hair if you&#x27;re not careful, though! Good quality, sturdy build. A huge relief when it comes to wearing swimsuits!</li>
            <li> This is the second electric razor from panasonic that has died on me. This particular razor was great for the first 3 uses. After that it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I replaced the batteries with brand new ones and got nothing. I&#x27;m done panasonic. You&#x27;ve lost a customer. I can forgive you for one electric razor dying on me, but not two.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer.  Considering how sensitive the bikini line area is the trimmer cuts a close shave without nicking. Uses batteries, compact size, well made, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> My friends and I call this the &amp;#34;muffin mower.&amp;#34;  I gave away several of them as gifts because it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is easily adjustable, the size is perfect, and I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with recharging.</li>
            <li> A simple and reliable way to trim unwanted hair.  I find it amusing that it is advertised as a &#x27;bikini line&#x27; trimmer, and I suppose it works for the worst of that too, but if you are looking for grooming your privates without the pain of waxing it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer... gives a nice close finish without pulling or pain. only con is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case but If your replacing an old one like me, I just used the case from my previous shaver - problem solved :) (or use a small makeup brush case)</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is so much better than my old trimmer, a Remington rechargable. The speed of the blade is much faster and trims with fewer passes as compared to my old remington. This trimmer has many different length settings, which is also appreciated, and the attachment that adjusts for length very sturdy (not so with my old remington, where I broke one of the attachments fairly easily after about 2 years of use). The other pro is that the trimmer comes with a guide for the different parts in case you need to re-order a part. My old remington did not come with that, and so after I broke one of the attachments I had to use an attachment with longer lengths only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is battery operated, which I really like. I used to have to charge the remington ahead of time, before each time as the battery did not hold power very well. Because of earlier reviews that the panasonic drains the battery, I just take the batteries out between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this trimmer!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I used this many time very good but it works by 2 base battary AAA&lt;br /&gt;no carge no wire with electric !!!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is a wonderful (and under budget!) solution to a grooming challenge.  It causes muuuuch less anxiety than taking scissors to the area.  Faster too.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between waxing and not-and like to stay somewhat groomed in between.  I wanted a trimmer but didn&#x27;t know what to get.  I read all the reviews and decided to go with the Panasonic.  My main concern was safety!!  I didn&#x27;t want to worry about nicks and cuts!  This trimmer is great.  The &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting is very short (without being bare) and there is no harm of any nicks on my skin with the safe guard.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Small, light weight, takes 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I dropped this trimmer in my shower (I was not using it with water) and a plastic piece inside broke instantly. I was able to repair the piece temporarily with super glue, but when I tapped the head a little later it broke in the same place. It worked fine for me, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to regular use.</li>
            <li> I use this for my bikini area and its great, just what I was looking for. Easy to use, easy to clean, and its nice that I can set the length for a closer or set trim.</li>
            <li> Will it remove all of the hair leaving you porn star smooth? No. But it&#x27;s a buzzer not a $70 extremely painful waxing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because sometimes I get lazy and let it all grow out and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take the bulk off the fur off, especially if I intend on shaving smooth later. It&#x27;s great at taming the forest when it becomes necessary. Maybe people with skim and dainty pubic hair don&#x27;t need that kind of tool but I think it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a surprisingly small and compact device, and I&#x27;ll probably even take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> This product works super well and is a great value. Remember, if you want to remove hair completely don&#x27;t buy this. But if you want to trim buy this (and if you want you can remove some hair using a regular disposable razor and trim the rest with this). This is so easy, fast, and safe to use. Also, FYI the blade is supposed to last a year with twice a week trims (according to the product manual.)</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It doesn&#x27;t trim very well and it kind of hurts or tugs at the hairs.  I will probably throw it out and get a different type of trimmer.  Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> This is a trimmer, not a shaver.  But is does trim close enough to give you a good alternative rather than shaving or waxing.  It is quite, trims well with no pulling or irritation, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, works quickly, easily adjusted, good handheld shape.  My only complaint is that the guard seems a little flimsy (it&#x27;s plastic), and that it may break down the road.  I&#x27;ve only had the trimmer for a month, though, so I&#x27;ll update if anything untoward occurs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer, as a trimmer, is fantastic it has lasted for about year so far is still running strong. It cuts fast and doesn&#x27;t catch/rip out my hair like my last trimmer did. I would buy this again.  Check In:   It is about 2 years later, and this little guy still works like a champ. This is my favorite trimmer still.</li>
            <li> My wife says this works well.  So far she hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.  The length gauge seems a little loose.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just gotta remove the batteries when you&#x27;re not using it or it&#x27;ll work weakly...</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star trimmer in 1 star body.  If you open one you&#x27;ll discover it&#x27;s minimalist design.  One of the reasons why it&#x27;s not made in China it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s so simple no human intervention is required.  But I digress.  As much as I admire the minimalist design I think the spring metal that forms the on/off switch is too soft and corrodes too easily.  This leads to premature (blade is still sharp but it does not turn on) failure unless one is willing to open the case, clean the contacts and bend the part in to shape.</li>
            <li> It did the job but it felt a little bit bulky sometimes and it was hard to reach a clean trim at some places. The guard didn&#x27;t feel secure and it was pretty useless since the closet trim was still pretty long. I ended  up not using the guard.  I took the trimmer apart for a deep cleaning but once I put it back together it didn&#x27;t  work anymore. Shame I only used it for a couple months and it broke on me.</li>
            <li> This is pretty weak.  Feels cheap.  Doesn&#x27;t trim close enough.  Takes forever to keep going over the same area to get it trimmed. Not worth the money.  I&#x27;ve had better quality for the same money in other trimmers.</li>
            <li> THE BIKINI SHAPER AND TRIMMER IS SOMETHING EVERY WOMAN SHOULD HAVE, I WAS USING OTHER THINGS BEFORE I FOUND THIS TRIMMER, IT IS SO EASY FAST CLEAN AND NEAT,, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done. It is nice and small and not loud. Very easy to use. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love using my new shaver.  Like other reviews, it does not do a clean shave but it trims the hair to a short length.  Easy to use and clean.  :)</li>
            <li> Just as it was promised and advertised.  wife has used it and likes the product says it is better than anything else she has used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of all the positive reviews. I got the trimmer in the mail and opened it up to use it. I attempted to use the trimmer with the guard on. First, there was a little tugging, but not enough to make me worry. Second, I didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all. When I tried to trim with the guard off, it pulled so bad. No matter what I did it wouldn&#x27;t stop tugging and hurting.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. If your skin isn&#x27;t uber sensitive, maybe you will have better luck, but I won&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Works as described and super easy to use. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I used another brand for many years without any problems.  I bought this one because it had great reviews.  How?  This one is HORRIBLE!  I had to go over the same area about 25 times to get mediocre results.  I finally took the end piece off and shaved directly against my skin because I was so frustrated with it.  It&#x27;s very cheap, you have to squeeze each side of the end piece to adjust it.  My last one had a dial.  Had it shaved well, I don&#x27;t think it would have lasted long because it&#x27;s made of such cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> This shaves very, very close without &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; your sensitive skin. This is hard to find. Also, it shaves thick or thin hair at the same speed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver. Easy to handle, light and shaves just the right length.  Helps me feel clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little trimmer for the price but be careful or you&#x27;ll nick yourself. Also, it will rust if you get it wet.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on its lowest setting it catches hairs and can be quite painful. All other settings seem to work fine. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> This could be used for both men and women no problem. I was hesitant at first, but after shopping around, I picked the Panasonic since it was good value and seemed to have a good reputation.I would definitely recommend this to any woman that was looking for a sturdy bikini trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t tug, and gets something done in 5 minutes that would normally take 30.</li>
            <li> the most basic trimmer that you can get.  not sure what qualifies it as a bikini shaper or trimmer.  cheaply made. would never buy this again</li>
            <li> This baby still works as if I bought it yesterday. It&#x27;s pretty great, but if you don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; of post trimming, then it&#x27;s not for you. I find it pretty uncomfortable honestly for several days after trimming.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, easy to use trimmer. The closest shave this allows you to get with the security &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; tool on leaves hairs approximately 0,5 cm long.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works well and is easy to clean. However, I do wish it had rechargeable batteries. Luckily it is gentle on batteries.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is perfect for those that want maintenance.  The attachment is convenient as it snaps to different lengths so you don&#x27;t need a different \\&quot;head;\\&quot; you just either click it up or click it down depending.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It cleans up really well and similar to other reviews, I will agree that this doesn&#x27;t give you the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; look, but it sure gets close. I took off the small attachment to get as close as possible (this may not be what I am supposed to do)...but it didn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all, didn&#x27;t snag any hairs and I am very happy with the results. This is perfect for when your man is coming over and you need to get cleaned up quickly. Or when you haven&#x27;t had time to get a wax and need to tend to would like the area to look groomed in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It works well at trimming the bikini area. I could prefer a closer shave but then I would be afraid of cutting myself. The guard does a good job at keeping area trimmed short and safe from nicks. Pretty easy to clean but the cleaning brush is almost like a joke and I had lost the brush with the first trimmer I bought but the trimmer can still be cleaned without it.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to replace an older trimmer that I had that just didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power to give a good trim - this one is far superior to my other one - it takes larger batteries (AA instead of AAA) so the power is much better - it has a nice ,sleek shape and is easy to hold.  Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The plastic head was broken when I received it. I wasn&#x27;t surprised since the plastic is obviously VERY flimsy and cheap. I&#x27;ll be ordering a different trimmer after my refund.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Overall happy with the purchase, for the price.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Gets a bit hot. Feels bulky even though small. Really noisy which just adds to my apprehension. Honestly ladies, there&#x27;s no good way to do this is there? Sharp fast moving blades in your bikini area, yikes. It&#x27;s a $20 trimmer. Good for what it is. Not as comfortable to use as my older rechargeable Conair that was curvier and smaller. Wish there was something magic that wasn&#x27;t fraught with the possibility of bodily injury.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and what i was looking for</li>
            <li> The shaper and trimmer is a simple, yet effective design. It&#x27;s easy to use, and gets a good trim down. Much better than some more expensive brands that I tried.</li>
            <li> Broke on the second use :/</li>
            <li> i purchased this item probably in 2004 and up until now it still works the same way!!</li>
            <li> Works smoothly. Easy to change comb length. good price!</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job. I purchased this item as my old &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; was about to bite the dust.  This works perfectly so far and you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally cutting yourself (ouch).  It&#x27;s quiet and small for easy storage. I&#x27;d recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, to clean, and does a good job.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like I was concerned about. Easy to take apart and clean out. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so much that I had to write a review!  I just received it today and tried it out right away.  It gives you a very close shave without the guard, which is what I was hoping for, and it did not hurt me at all.  I recently bought another shaver that kept nicking me without the guard on it.  This must be a much higher quality shaver.  Also, I recall other reviewers saying they couldn&#x27;t use it everywhere down there, but I had no problem maneuvering at all (without the guard) on all parts of the anatomy.  I HIGHLY recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t substitute for shaving because it doesn&#x27;t get that close, but great for overall trimming.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> This works very well for small patches of rather coarse body hair.  Has had no problems at all cutting any of it.  Likewise, the little plastic shaver head (that determines how low the hair is cut) works surprising well for something so simple and cheap to manufacture.  I will buy more for friends.</li>
            <li> works great! my last one worked the same, but used up the batteries very quickly, basically one round of use would require for me to put in new batteries. This one will last and last.......</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with this product. Didn&#x27;t give anything NEAR a close shave, probably could of trimmed closer with scissors. I know its not really meant to give you a nice clean close shave but this could have been much better. Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Love it. We have two because my husband uses it to trim his beard! We lost one on a vacation and bought another. My husband bought some Gillette razor before I got him his own.  I get bad razor burn when I shave the bikini area with razors, not with this.</li>
            <li> Works as advertized. Love it. Does not shave down to the skin, but really close which is what I was looking for. It&#x27;s also great that it is battery operated so there are no cords to get in the way. Good product.</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews and purchased it. The reviews turned out to be true. This is really every woman&#x27;s must have product.</li>
            <li> Does what it say it does. This is not a razor so do not expect to be completely clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Works great, much less painful than using a traditional electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is as advertised. However did not work at all for my wife as a bikini trimmer. She is white and has relatively coarse dark hair. Returned the product for a competitor.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It trims better than a lot of trimmers that I have used. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again! I love it. I use it to shave my pits and bikini line and it&#x27;s wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t get it smooth to touch, but get the hairs very short. I would use it for trimming and touching up, not for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I had mine for almost 3 years before I dropped it in a sink of water while moving it to look for something else. Took the batteries out and stuck it in a bowl of rice overnight but no luck. Back to order a new one because I loved it so much. Simple, easy to use, does what it says. I used mine approx every two weeks for almost 3 years and hadn&#x27;t had to change the blades yet (the manual does give you instructions for ordering them if you need them!). Only thing that could make it better would be if it was water resistant!</li>
            <li> Compact, gets around curves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it over a year and it still works and looks new.</li>
            <li> Feeling safe while grooming in this area has never happened until I got this trimmer. Comb and scissors or husband&#x27;s electric shaver all left me shuddering I&#x27;d make a slip and never did a decent job. This is everything it says. Does a great job quickly with no fear - at all.</li>
            <li> Great personal shaver.  It does not remove all the hair, like a razor, but it get pretty close.  No nicks.  Easy to clean.  I use it in the shower but I make sure I don&#x27;t get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****January 2013****&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaver died.  Good little shaver and I guess 2 years is a pretty good run nowadays.  I&#x27;m afraid nothing last too long these days, but what did I expect for $20?</li>
            <li> Head protector too sharp. Easily broken. There are better choices.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace 1 I left behind on vacation.  I don&#x27;t find it as efficient as my old trimmer (which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t seem to be in production anymore.) So, it&#x27;s an effective trimmer, but you will have to make several passes over the same area.  Perhaps the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as on my old trimmer.  There is one HUGE CON - this trimmer drains rechargeable nimh batteries, even when it is not being used. As proof, I put a pair of fully charged batteries in the trimmer when it arrived.  I used it once, and the battery power was fine.  I tried to use it again a week or so later, and the batteries were completely drained.  Apparently this trimmer draws energy from the batteries even while it isn&#x27;t operating.  My old 1 did not have this problem.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmer is absolutely excellent and exactly what I was looking for. It does exactly what its supposed to do... TRIM!!! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the same. Saves time, easy to use, no bumps and this is coming from someone who has tried numerous products. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This product works great. Works exactly how stated in the product description. I was pleasantly surprised with its performance. Would&#x27;ve definitely paid more. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> 5-Stars all the way! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like it alot! Its small, not very loud.</li>
            <li> Works great, very convenient</li>
            <li> excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped.......but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I love being able to change batteries myself.  Great product, cuts evenly, yet gently!  I use it as an adjunct to my other Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> It snags and pulls.  Very painful.  I can&#x27;t return it but I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous trimmer that died. There are five settings and the settings on this one are a bit &#x27;longer&#x27; which is disappointing to me. Setting 1 (lowest setting) leaves hair longer compared to the same setting on my previous trimmer. Obviously the setting difference isn&#x27;t Panasonic&#x27;s fault, but just wanted to share that I think the lowest setting on this unit isn&#x27;t low enough.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife... And she loves it. No bumps! I would highly recommended it for coarse hair that causes bumps.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and easy to use and clean. It doesn&#x27;t heat up (to my knowledge), but other than that it is great.  It seems to have a long battery life and is getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I actually got this to trim down my crazy dark arm hair without that weird she-shaves-her-arms look. A silly vanity, but it works great and I&#x27;m happy with the results. I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a bunch of money for those trimmers where you switch combs, and the price was right. The wireless/battery situation is also nice. My boyfriend said it would never survive his beard, but it works for cleaning up the back of your neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is very quiet, but does not work as the reviews state. Trimmer pulls, does not cut evenly or fluidly.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer...just in time for summer and unlike some reviews previously stated, there is no discomfort/ pulling with this razor.  Very very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but I was hoping for a razor with a cleaner shave.  I had to go over bikini area several times to get the necessary trim.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean. Works great as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer when it works. I have had three now. One barely works with very little power, and the other two died completely after just a few uses. I&#x27;m looking for a completely different brand now.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. Makes trimming so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> nice but blade is kind of dull.</li>
            <li> This works great for the bikini area.  I got it just before a trip to the coast and it works great.  Very easy to use and clean.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well, pulls a little. Reviews I read said if you took the guard off you could get really smooth. Not the truth it just makes a prickly stubble for you to deal with afterwards. Great to use as a clean up beforehand tool.</li>
            <li> This thing works amazingly. I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a trimmer. It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s lightweight, and the guide is fully adjustable for several different lengths. I LOVE that it takes regular batteries instead of being charged - anytime I need to use it I can just pop the batteries in and be ready to go, instead of forgetting to charge it until the last minute.</li>
            <li> Does the basic job-nothing fancy. Rather difficult to clean though . Would purchase again for the basic functionality.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s perfect for shaving pubes, chest, pits, and any other hair that you want down to a low length but not shaved to the skin.  Yes, this even works great on balls.  Only thing that would make this better would be a rechargeable battery. Love it and always recommend to my friends, both male and female alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: nearly two years later and it still works as well as the first day.  Keep the blades oiled as you would a normal clipper set.  The batteries last many months worth of clippings, something I hadn&#x27;t expected and greatly appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried taking it apart to clean it out and broke it, so I&#x27;d not recommend that. Still the best downstairs trimmer I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Worked well initially, with time (several months) the blades become weak and end up breaking hair rather than cutting</li>
            <li> Yes, as other customers have observed, its not going to shave but do a trim. The product lives up to its description and does a fine job of that. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Shaving angers my skin, so I got this instead, and it works beautifully. I&#x27;ve owned it for a year and only replaced the batteries one time with regular use. Easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Before this I was using my husband&#x27;s Wahl trimmer for my bikini area.  This works well.  I take the guard off completely to get it to trim the shortest.  Batteries seem to last well and I have had no problems with cutting, pinching, etc.</li>
            <li> Not silent actually a bit loud. Other than that it does the job very well in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> People who gave this 1 star are crazy.  It shaves pretty much bare.  I use it for my pubic hair because my skin is very sensitive to a regular razor.  If you got a lot of hair put the plastic piece on.  When you are ready to shave bare, take off piece.  My gf loves it too!</li>
            <li> So useful (I don&#x27;t know how I survived before this thing). Super easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries (I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years and I&#x27;ve changed the batteries once).</li>
            <li> This was useless for me unless I took the guard off of it. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all with the guard on so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> So I know it doesn&#x27;t claim to be water proof, I really wish it was.  I kept it by the shower because well, it&#x27;s a perfect time to straighten things up!  After about 6 months it stopped working because the contacts got corroded from moisture.  :(  It works AWESOME though!  I ordered another, won&#x27;t keep it next to the tub!</li>
            <li> Used it and it felt awesome so better than a razor.</li>
            <li> True I haven&#x27;t experienced razor burn after using 3 times. I have SENSITIVE skin and nearly every form of hair removal results in horrible red bumps. Not cute!!&lt;br /&gt;But I have had some painful pulling of hair, in awkward, hard to reach areas. That has caused me bruising, but not bumps or burns. The upside is it&#x27;s not a noticeable bruise, so still more attractive than red bumps on porcelain skin! But it hurts, and makes my panties feel like a torture device...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it but feel I may have to get out a mirror and work hard to move exactly with the way the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, even with this fault.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I have tried a few.  It works well for keeping the private area neat and clean and does not cause a rash or nick/cut your skin.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It broke within 2 months of use. It made very weird sound when in use and now it just doesnt work</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. Since it was all plastic, I made the mistake of thinking it was waterproof, but it is not. So I am buying a second one. Up until it got wet, it did a great job as a grooming aid, i used it many times with no problems. It will NOT shave you smooth, however, it seems some folks are confusing this with a shaver. Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, and does exactly what I was looking for! However it is NOT a shaver, and does NOT get really close to the skin. However FABULOUS for keeping things clean &amp; super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t cut me or pull the hair as long as I take it easy and go slow. Small enough to get all the little nooks, crannies, and personal areas. Gets everything trimmed up and tidy so I can go over it with a razor for a closer shave. Saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Does the job of trimming me and is easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t notice the motor struggle. I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple years and use it more in the spring/summer as one would expect. I would recommend this product for the price and functionality.</li>
            <li> Great bikini shaver. Well designed.</li>
            <li> I am a very heavy women. I used to use razors until my stomach got very big that I honestly can&#x27;t see down there without my stomach being in the way. So I stopped shaving. This shaver was perfect, it doesn&#x27;t nick me, because since I can&#x27;t see, I am just moving it back and forth. I am even able to take the guards off. Lifesaver!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing pulled my hair.  It pulls and trim at the same time (painful).  I used several trimmers and this is the worst.  I even cleaned and oil the trimmer and gave it to someone else.  The trimmer cut and pulled her hair too.  Didn&#x27;t return since I had it too long before using.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year now and it works as good as new. This trimmer is easy to use on even the most private areas and to keep clean. It is cordless and lightweight. Two AA batteries last a long time. It has never irritated my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only had a chance to use this once.  So far, I really like it.  I tried it on the closest shave setting, and it gave me a really close shave.  Didn&#x27;t pull on the skin or anything.  I&#x27;m not going to give it 5 stars yet, because I would like to see how long it lasts.  My last trimmer only lasted about 6 months, so hopefully this one survives a bit longer.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. Easy to use and a  extremely light weight. Close shave if I want it.</li>
            <li> This razor is GREAT! No pain, VERY close shave and no irritation. I may never wax again.</li>
            <li> This mini trimmer works just as well as a larger model that one would use for trimming hair on the head. The small size is easy to handle for hair down there. The cleaning brush is a nice accessory as it helps get the tiny hairs out of the blades. The only thing I dislike about the trimmer is how the blades pull on hairs when the plastic guard is off--sometimes known as a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; in barber shops. On larger models I&#x27;ve never had the issue with pulling on hairs. Not so fun when you&#x27;re trimming your pubic area.</li>
            <li> Just like the description! works great.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer. It took a bit to get used to but it works well. It is easy to clean, but you do have to clean it every time and it is a little annoying to do even though it is easy. Simple to use and it works.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is WONDERFUL. Far superior to the Philips HP6376/10 Philips Bikini Perfect. I would definitely purchase again, and would recommend to friends. Easy to use, powerful motor, SAFE. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man. I use this to shave my face. I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the plastic guard it leaves about a millimeter of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to replace the batteries yet.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts cleanly without any tugging or excessive vibration, and I haven&#x27;t had any cuts using it without the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I prefer this over the cheap rotary shaver I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer and I like it. Only pain point is too many small parts to clean and doesn&#x27;t seem like you can run it under a tap. Must be cleaned with the small brush and the hair gets in tiny grooves.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but sturdy, inexpensive, performs great for the price.  Nice compact size, easy to use, and a brand you can trust to make a quality product!  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I would say is that it took almost 2 months to come in. Other then than I the product works fine</li>
            <li> It completely attended my needs. It&#x27;s simple to use. I just think that should have more attachments to adjust but for what I need is Ok. Easy and quickly to use. It&#x27;s small, easy to go anywhere.</li>
            <li> It was awesome and then it crapped out. I&#x27;m going to try another brand. Just stopping working has been my issue with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to find a replacement then it got stolen during our move along with the entire container of toiletries. So I replaced it with the same trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull!</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying: I&#x27;m a dude. That being said, this thing works for my mankini area just fine, but be forewarned: it&#x27;s no industrial strength weed eater. It was built for the soft contours of the female anatomy, but given a little patience any man will be rewarded with a nice soft swimsuit area. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you&#x27;re in a hurry or if you have a densely matted pubic region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a nice ballsack trimming device and it comes in lavender, so you can express yourself. This cross trainer could easily double as a poor person&#x27;s vibrator given it&#x27;s action and shape. Just give it a quick rinse afterwards you filthy animal!</li>
            <li> This got pretty good reviews, better than other shavers, so I bought it. It&#x27;s okay. It does tend to pull at times, which is literally a pain. For some reason, this shaver just seems temperamental--sometimes it works great, sometimes it nicks. Maybe it&#x27;s me. All in all, I prefer the simple men&#x27;s trimmer I bought. It&#x27;s more consistent and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> This is pretty basic, but I really like it. I have really sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t really like shaving or waxing (and also I think it&#x27;s stupid and ridiculous to pretend like women have no pubic hair). However, I also don&#x27;t like to have a lot going on down there. I use this on the shortest setting and it works really well for me. I need to use it once every week to keep it consistent. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use an epilator for my legs and once I start using that on my armpits, I can kick razors for good!.. and that would be pretty dang exciting... and more ecological and economical for me, too!</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and had used this brand in the past. Does a very good job and love that it is so portable. Arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> This shaver works as described. Using its lowest guarg setting, it easily handled my course, dark hair. I even used it, without the guard, to shave my inner thigh area. Worked like a charm!! This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I had the rechargeable clio before this one, but dropped it a few too many times so needed a replacement. I did not like this replacement panasonic. It cuts no where near as close as the Clio so I needed to shave my bikini area during this time. It cuts me a few times. Overall....hated it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not irritate skin. I had to replace my first one within a year but inexpensive enough not to worry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was heated. I thought it was just burning me! &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t use the purple top. This trimmer has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times for bikini lines.  It&#x27;s basic and does the job okay but not spectacular.  Careful there is some pulling.</li>
            <li> This gets the hair an does the job, but it could be built more for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer about three years ago and I still love it. It works great and gets the job done. Keep in mind that it&#x27;s a trimmer, so it only trims your hair to a shorter length, it doesn&#x27;t remove or shave your hair completely. You can adjust the guard to pick different lengths. It&#x27;ll give you an even cut. I have no real complaints. It isn&#x27;t quiet though. It does make a noise but it&#x27;s not unusually loud for a electric product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes two AA batteries. They last for a while too. I just replaced mine, although I don&#x27;t actually use the trimmer that often.</li>
            <li> it is my second time purchasing this product it last about a year it works with batteries&lt;br /&gt;i like it so much</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but pulls at hair if you aren&#x27;t directly on skin. It isn&#x27;t loud so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Just awesome for the bikini area and trimming the privates, plus it great for sideburns and eyebrows on men too.</li>
            <li> I do not like this thing.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I prefer a closer shave, and this thing isn&#x27;t adjustable at all.  Basically useless.  I thought it was a good price, but turns out I won&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> This gets caught and tugs and nicks my skin. I no longer use it because of it</li>
            <li> Well, there you have it. I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for more than a year on one set of batteries and it works very well. The guard is easy to move and the blades stay functional and sharp. It can handle delicate areas but I&#x27;ve also given buzz haircuts and beard trims with no problem, taking it slowly - handy little widget!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done way faster than my Shick Quattro for Women Trimstyles. The blade is longer and the batteries haven&#x27;t run out yet, I have used it at least 5 times now. The Schick ran out after one use... The only downside is that this trimmer is not waterproof. Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer to anyone that wants to keep things neat and trim.</li>
            <li> I was like 50--50 when i read the reviews for this product whether buy or not..&lt;br /&gt;but after buying i&#x27;m 100% sure to recommend this product to all..&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing trimmer..&lt;br /&gt;i loved it..small cute but efficient..</li>
            <li> Love this so much so easy !</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient. Shave in seconds. It&#x27;s definitely every women&#x27;s must have! !!</li>
            <li> Ive used mine like 3 times now. I have nothing bad to say about it. No complaints with the battery either, but I always take it out after using it. The adjustable head is quite nice. Noise level is good.</li>
            <li> I will start this off by saying that I am a guy who chose to buy this product.  I was very skeptical about using an electric trimmer on my armpits and Southern region because I didn&#x27;t want to get razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs, irritation, etc.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to try this product and take advantage of how unbelievably easy and smooth this trimmer makes the entire process (as well as the end result).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make you as smooth as a bikini wax, or a shave,&lt;BR&gt;but you won&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown hairs or&lt;BR&gt;razor bumps.  A very safe way to trim a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I tried a few bikini trimmers and they never seemed strong enough to do what I needed it to do. This item is powerful enough and does not catch your hair. Recommend it over anything else I&#x27;ve every tried</li>
            <li> Great trimmer... Def.does the job &amp; without hurting too</li>
            <li> Works well, easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well. Hardly cut hair</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful trimmer on the market by any means. It takes a little longer than just using your man&#x27;s face trimmer but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great, just as expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I used this to groom my genitals, and this thing could barely cut anything. It took many passes over the same area to do anything. This thing might be ok for trimming a few strands of hair but not a hairy man.</li>
            <li> This is an OK trimmer. It is not as nice as I expected and it is definately on the \\&quot;bigger\\&quot; side. Its size makes it hard to really get down to trim those more personal areas and the removeable piece is always removed which is my suggestion unless you want to look like a teddybear. At the end of the day I always have to resort to a disposable razor. I can&#x27;t see myself continuing with this one much longer. You may not want to look like you had a bikini wax but if you want a close shave and you want to touch up all over this may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Love the fact that the length is adjustable and I can get a fairly close shave without having to worry about razor burn!</li>
            <li> Used new batteries after only one use on hair that is not &#x27;barb-wiry&#x27; or thick; not very economical to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and so far she says it works great. Her last trimmer would pull and snag hairs but this one is simple and works well. Replaceable batteries mean no waiting if it goes dead while in use. My wife would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed by this product, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Got to use it about 3x and it stopped working! Thought it just ran out of bat so i changed it but nothing happened. Not worth the $20!  Buy yourself a Quattro bikini trimmer instead, only $10 and lasted me 2 years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ineffective, it cuts you, and it went in the trash. I know this isn&#x27;t a lengthy and descriptive review on the ways it didn&#x27;t work, the cuts it inflicted, and/pr what sort of trashcan it met its end in, but I think in this case, less is more. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this trimmer again!  I had this back in 97-2001, maybe longer... I ended up getting a remington one that would actually cut and rip up my skin, not good!  This trimmer is perfect!  I use it with the cage thing off, this is the only thing I can use that causes no irritation/ingrowns/problems as I have very sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t shave with a normal wet razor and waxing is a grand fiasco of foliculitis.  So yeah, this is definitely the best trimmer I have ever used.  It is a purple/grey color.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far. Gives a good clean, sparse look on the shortest trim level. Harder to get around the edges. Easy to clean. Takes 2 AA batteries that are NOT included.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of all the awesome reviews and the Good Housekeeping award...but this trimmer did absolutely nothing for me. With the guard on the lowest setting not one hair trimmed off.  With the guard off it pulled my skin and it hurt a lot.  I tried really hard to like it, but it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item literally 2 days ago. It arrived so quickly which I was happy about. I had no idea what I was looking for in trimmers, but I hated shaving and waxing was way too painful/expensive to upkeep. I bought this based solely upon customer reviews. This thing is great! Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! As recommended by other reviewers, I took the protective head completely off and just used the blade to get a closer trim. I had no irritation and it was painless. Probably the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for removing body and chest hair. Nice. Has an adjustment for blade distance so you don&#x27;t harm skin.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all, it is too large for the area of use. When I have surgery the hospital has a much smaller shaver and easier shaver they use, wish I knew who makes it.</li>
            <li> Its a small light weight trimmer which is easy to use and quite portable, making it easy to take it with you while travelling. The cap is adjustable for those who want a closer trim vs for those who do not. The battery lasts a really long time and does not need to be replaced frequently. That being said, it works well for males too and does not cause any irritation and/or \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; which is often the case with shaving.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works. Easy to use. I wish it came in a pouch. I put mine in  a pouch so I could keep the cleaner brush and directions with it. If you put this on the closest shave, you will get just about as good as a regular razor. It saves me from the razor bumps I always got before. If you want to just trim some hair, be sure not to put in on closest shave! I&#x27;d start with the longest setting first and see if that&#x27;s enough. I had mine set at about 2 and trimmed off more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The second time I tried to use it, instead of it working, it just got really hot.</li>
            <li> Trims sensitive areas quickly without nicking skin. 5 different lenths to choose from. Attractive color and nice weight. Easy to clean and comes with a cleaning brush. Not too noisy. A carrying case would&#x27;ve been a plus.</li>
            <li> After 3 years of use this trimmer is still going strong and I am very happy with it. Its compactness makes it easy to maneuver in tight spots. The adjustable comb like attachment on top lets you choose between 4 different hair lengths. You may have to do more than one pass to get an even trim, but no more than any other trimmer of this type. The top comes off for easy cleaning. Overall a great product that does the job well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The fact that it trims evenly makes you look a lot neater. It&#x27;s very very safe, so you can use close to the very private areas.</li>
            <li> I love this machine! It works perfect and does not knick or pull the skin. It does get a bit hot so be careful going into very sensitive areas of the skin if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product.  Works perfectly.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> This trimmer can be used by both men and women. Only downside is we need to replace the battery once fully discharged but it consumes very less power. Trimming action is good for the price we pay.</li>
            <li> So far I like it. The adjustment setting are just right. I can&#x27;t speak to how much battery life it uses yet, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I love it! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> First thought my trimmer wasn&#x27;t working when I first put batteries in because it was already on the on switch. There are no words saying on or off &amp; the symbols used to indicate so are not universal in meaning so I had no idea it was already on the \\&quot;on\\&quot; setting. My batteries weren&#x27;t pushed down far enough. *Battery casing is a bit loose, so batteries are sort of misaligned when you put them in. *I thought the blades would&#x27;ve been a bit sharper. For closer shave take blade protector off. Works better for coarse kinky hair (4c hair).</li>
            <li> This has the perfect amount of trimming ability and amount of adjustment for my \\&quot;purposes&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this for about two years now and havent experienced any problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like being clean shaven because that region develops ingrown VERY easily for me. This allows me an tidy look which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at a great price!  It&#x27;s not like using a regular razor, but that&#x27;s not what this is intended for...it does get super close to the skin, though.  Would recommend to other.</li>
            <li> It works well. I have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Omits a fabulous trimmer. I think people need to keep in mind what a trimmer is. But yeah, I love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you. As described item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I expected it to be smaller to make it easier to maneuver in such a delicate area.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s about the size of a typical beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This works so well. Easy to use. Great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Love that you can order parts as opposed to buying an entirely new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have any tools to put in or take off and that it is especially designed for bikini hair. It didn&#x27;t pull any hair and I didn&#x27;t have any bikini bumps after using it. It trimmed very well and is easy to clean it too.</li>
            <li> a razor is better &#x3D;( .... waste of money, wish i never purchased it, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.... this trimmer is not worth the price, save yourself the headache.</li>
            <li> When i first started using this trimmer i was really surprised at how quickly it was getting the hair off, zip, zip...and i have pretty long curly hair in that area.  Then i was somewhat disappointed that it didnt really trim very low, not to stubble length so i could use another shaver for fine tuning. It left the hair about 1/2 inch in length and i was a bit ho hum about it because i thought it would get it lower.  But i decided 1/2 inch was fine and i actually liked how it looked -- sooooo much neater -- and i was happy with it then.  I was using it at level 1.  After looking at myself forever it suddenly occurred to me that maybe i should remove the comb thing and just use it with the blade.  Wow...was i surprised! It took me down to real stubble, probably less than 1/8 of an inch!  I was really happy with that and was able to see then what a good little trimmer this really was. I was then able to use another shaver for a clean look for a quick vacation at the beach.  I must say though that I do like the 1/4 inch length and will probably keep that for my everyday look, but am really happy to have the option to go really low when i need to.  Overall, a really great, inexpensive little trimmer -- does what it says in a pretty short time, and gives many options.  Oh, and no itching. You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Bought this for two reasons.  I&#x27;m a guy who has long eyebrows, and I set this trimmer on (3) and zap! Perfect eybrow length.  It&#x27;s so fast and easy.  Second; Both me and the wife like to be neat and tidy with the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  This trimmer is a breeze! Perfect length and not too rough.  OH and seems to be durable.  My wife accidentally dropped it in the toilet while doing some trimming!!  It was a clean toilet thank goodness or I&#x27;d be ordering another one.  But it still works fine and never missed a beat!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and very affective, at keeping the nether regions well groomed. Cannot go wrong with this product. Not designed to be used for a razor type close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it&#x27;s very easy to clean and to use. It&#x27;s very light, it works on batteries and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a gift so I don&#x27;t know if it is going to be good.  From the reviews I think my daughter will like this.  I have used Panasonic trimmers before and they have always been good.</li>
            <li> I have a few questions about this trimmer that I was hoping someone could answer for me? One, It looks like a really nice trimmer, especially for the money. Some people are saying that it does not shave close at all some say it shaves close... I would like to hear some opinions about how close it really shaves. For me, I don&#x27;t mind If it leaves like 2mm or so, I am not looking to shave close as I get ingrown hairs very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, I like to shave my bikini area more like a Brazilian type shave than just a bikini line. How does it do on those really sensitive areas? Other trimmers I have had usually slice the delicate skin down there and I have to use one of those tiny trimmers on that area which takes an eternity and pulls hairs out. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three, it says the battery life is only 45 mins? :o With non chargeable batteries that would cost a fortune to replace so often. What has been your experience with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your answers! :3 I really appreciate the help!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I dont like to be totally bare, plus razor burn kills me.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this product out and used it the first day. Although I did take the purple gaurd off and just used no gaurd it worked great. There was a few spots I had to go over a few times but otherwise it took less time than actually shaving would have. I definately recomend this product and have a feeling my husband might be borrowing it. :)</li>
            <li> I decided I did not want anymore bikini waxing and needed to resort to trimming myself, This was easy to use and shaved just enough. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little shaver.  Small, battery operated and eBay to handle.  Less expensive than others as well.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have purchased this. I was using a microtrimmer but that took so long to trim bikini area. I don&#x27;t like shaving my bikini area but I like being trimmed. This is a great product that is easy to use. I would commend this for anyone that wants personal trimmer for that area. thanks!</li>
            <li> Works good, though nicks sometimes.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;m really bummed because this stopped working after owning it for nine months and using it once every two weeks or so. For the price, this should last much longer than 18-20 uses.  Initial review: I&#x27;ve used a few different trimmers over the years, and this is my favorite. I&#x27;ve been using this for three months now. Please note this is a *trimmer*, not a shaver. Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for a full shave. My previous trimmer was rechargeable, but I actually prefer batteries. The charge would frequently last no longer than a few minutes, even when I actually remembered to charge it. My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded. This may sound like a feature that should be common sense, but other trimmers have been more pointy (and thus, painful). This works great, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a trimmer, so it won&#x27;t shave everything and it&#x27;s impossible to get ingrown hair! It&#x27;s very easy to clean, as well.</li>
            <li> This is a toy for kids who want to practice trimming their pubes.  A grown person with actual pubes, however, will be better off using duct tape.  You basically have to pre-trim before using this vibrator thing to tidy up.  Using it as the primary tool will feel like having a toothy hamster go to town on your business. OUCH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price</li>
            <li> Mine lasted for a few years before it started going bad. It still works, though, but it seems the batteries are dying when they&#x27;re brand new. I use it to trim my eyebrows on setting #1, and it works well for that. I haven&#x27;t used any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.  I got mine a long time ago and it is still working perfectly.  It has several adjustments and is nice and small.</li>
            <li> It should say somewhere on the packaging it is not water resistant/proof. I am pretty sure everyone shaves their vag in the shower.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for a few years now. Not as strong as a cheap plugin trimmer I have, but still works well. Does pull hair occasionally if used against direction of hair growth. The batteries work forever, well over a year at least with once a week use.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, durable and well made. Although, it does not shave as close to the skin as I would like it for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this item twice and it seems to work well. It gets pretty close, which I&#x27;m glad to see. I was looking for a trimmer to get close where I need it and to just trim in other areas. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Terrible! I bought it and used it twice. The first time it worked fine. When I went to try to use it again, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I went and replaced the batteries. Mind you, I put in brand new batteries the first time I used it. It worked for the second time. I went to use it again for the third time, it won&#x27;t turn on. I tried putting new batteries in and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer. Doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at all, and while it can be intimidating, gets the job done. Any cuts are painless. Trims very short.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES246AC is a great product.  It is super easy to use and is not irritating at all.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use. Small and easy storage. Easy to clean. Works well. I would recommend to anyone .</li>
            <li> I wish it would trim a little closer.  It works.  And it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  It just doesn&#x27;t do as thorough or as uniform a job as I hoped.  It leaves a lot of longer hairs behind.  I am not exactly sure why it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; bikini trimmer either.  I don&#x27;t detect any heat from it, nor am I sure why you would want a heated bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> The bikini shaper and trimmer works quiet well for trimming the bikini area and more, definitely makes grooming way easier.</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well! If I had to recommend a trimmer to any of my friends I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!  I bought it to replace one I had been using for years and I wish I had bought it sooner.  It works so well that my husband now wants one too as I won&#x27;t share, for obvious reasons.  I definitely recommend this trimmer if you&#x27;re looking for something that will trim VERY close to the skin without nicking you.</li>
            <li> I used to get bikini waxes every month, but it started to get expensive (and painful!) so I decided to go more natural. This trimmer is perfect for keeping things properly groomed without razor burn.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Takes AA batteries which is a plus.  Was trying to find Remington BKT-1000 but ended up using this one for trimming my beard/goatee.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome two double A batteries and its ready to rock... What would take an hour or more took a few minutes no pulled hair nothing. A+</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for trimming everything up the same length. I do wish it had a rechargeable battery but for the price I paid I think this is great.</li>
            <li> I read on consumer reports that this was one of the best Bikini Shaper and Trimmers. It is.....so easy to use! I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a Trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was a bit skeptical but I love that u can choose different lengths would definately recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer a few times but I am pleased with it so far.  Easy to use and very light.  Nice!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done without leaving any nicks or cuts, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on contours.</li>
            <li> This item is very good for trimming bikini area. easy to use without having any irritation. It can also be used for trimming baby&#x27;s hair. it is that safe.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is simple but does the job well. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin getting snagged or hair getting pulled. It trims hair quite short, but if you prefer, the guide allows you to trim at a variety of lengths.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fairly basic. It has the attachment but it&#x27;s battery powered and cannot get wet. Overall it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT bikini trimmer. I read all the reviews here and it&#x27;s excellent. And no it&#x27;s not a razor so you won&#x27;t be bare. But let&#x27;s be honest, on some more *ehem* sensitive parts this trims so close that it&#x27;s like you are bare. It&#x27;s amazing. Clean. Hygienic and QUICK. Stop cutting yourself with scissors and use this baby! Also NO razor bumps or irritation. It trims so close but doesn&#x27;t hurt. Oh and I use it without the guard for a very close trim, and it has NEVER nicked me. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This thing finally nicked me! :( I think it&#x27;s because I held it at a awkward angle while trimming. So if trimming your privates, hold the skin taut and keep this trimmer flat to your skin. The nick didn&#x27;t hurt too bad more like an uncomfortable feeling. It didn&#x27;t even bleed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer looked great out of the box, but upon use we found that the trimmer pulls and tugs in areas that you do not want that feeling.</li>
            <li> This trimmer and very easy to use. It is the first trimmer I have ever tried and I am really content with it. It cuts at a nice length (I use the shortest option) and is very safe from cuts.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this trimmer and are sold on it.  It is simple to use and as efficient as we would expect from a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was rechargable instead of battery powered but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product, trims hair down there no problem.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this years ago.  Even my husband uses it to shape up.</li>
            <li> I have always been a shaver. I would never be outgoing enough to go get a wax, nor brave enough to do it myself. After fighting shaving bumps for most of my life, I took the advice of my boyfriend and bought a trimmer. I found this on Amazon and got it based on its good reviews. Im so glad I did!! The removable blade cap is adjustable to several lengths, but none of which are useful to me because I like a closer shaver. I use this trimmer without that guard cap and it does a wonderful job. Best part- NO BUMPS!!! I even wore short denim shorts for the first two days after trimming and there wasn&#x27;t a single bump from chafing around the shaven area. My skin is pretty sensitive so I&#x27;m extremely impressed. It also cuts very short if you don&#x27;t use the blade guard. Give this a try. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was shipped qucikly. Been using it for over 3 -4 weeks now and it works beautifully. I am impressed</li>
            <li> i only used this maybe 3 times. The forth time I tried it, it didn&#x27;t turn on. Didn&#x27;t even make a sound. Before that it worked excellent Nd I would give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about getting this, as I was not to sure how well it would work. It was perfect for me! Easy to use, easy to clean, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little trimmer that I have found to be very useful - it doesn&#x27;t cut too close (nor does it completely clear all hair), but it does just what it is supposed to (which is trim hair).  I love that it has various height settings, as well as a little brush for cleaning.  It&#x27;s not too loud or jittery (it doesn&#x27;t shake a lot).  A great little trimmer that will work for anyone&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li> great product at a great price- not like the cheap pencil thin $7 ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products like this one and the Panasonic is by far the best. It is well-made, quiet, and the built-in adjustable guide is a nice feature. Great value at a great price.</li>
            <li> worked very well as a trimmer</li>
            <li> This trimmer works and works well.  It takes just a few minutes to get the job done.  The adjustable attachment for the blade is a nice feature and lets you control exactly how much you want to remove.  If you are looking to be completely hair free; I suggest a brazilian wax or comparable procedure as this is a trimmer not a stripper.  It is imperative that you use the trimmer on a completely dry area for a better shave, and use baby powder or cornstarch.  Aloe Vera is great to use as a moisturizer afterward, 100% natural and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> This has been working perfectly for me for years.</li>
            <li> I had this on my wishlist for over a year before I bought it, and I wish I&#x27;d bought it so much earlier! It&#x27;s SO much easier than regular shaving, and I&#x27;ve never been able to stand waxing. It&#x27;s really easy to use, and it does a great job. I took one star off because I wish the Number 1 setting trimmed it shorter. I ended up taking the guard off completely and it shaves it almost bare, which is actually a little too short but better than the Number 1. So I wish there was a setting in between, and then it would definitely be five stars.</li>
            <li> Works.  I had to buy and use it in person in order to figure out the mechanism.  For a pregnant person this is the best thing ever. I was able to use it before a trip that involved bathing suits and at 6 months I could not see below my tummy.  i felt safe using it.  I will be using it more and have already recommended it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and east to change length of trimmer. It is small enough to hold and use easily and accurately.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it was my solution, used it twice and its not made for curves around your bikini area, worst of all it catches!!!! Haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> I wish I could plug in the wall. But for the price it is convenient. I hate shaving because it cause irritation but with this I can have a nice close shave without the red bumps. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This product very very nice .. smooth ship .. My request to man or female purchase this product .. 5 stars really its very nice</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and she loves it. She used it tonight. Shipping was on time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it was rechargeable. Other than that I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Safe, easy to use and works brilliantly! How did I ever do with it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Great purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This works better and has lasted longer than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s the perfect size for curvy areas. The batteries last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> This little thing is perfect. No, it will not give you a perfect close shave. It&#x27;s not a razor. It&#x27;s a trimmer,  and it does that job wonderfully. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This little diddy is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made. Haven&#x27;t had to change the battery since I bought it. The guards on it make sure that you won&#x27;t cut yourself. Seriously, buy one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulls hair unless you use it VERY slowly. I will be replacing it with the model my husband uses to trim his facial hair.</li>
            <li> love it. so far. so easy</li>
            <li> Perfect for bikini maintenance, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> After reading all other reviews and after trying it for myself, I can honestly say EVERYONE IS 100% CORRECT! This product is awesome in everyway. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with any irritation whatsoever. I even needed a quick touch up on my legs before going out and it left me looking and feeling smooth. Best investment ever and a wonderful time saver for any given moment :)</li>
            <li> No ingrown hairs using this vs shaving. My doctor said not to shave but to use scissors but this beats scissors. Top quality unit with no pulling should last a long time with proper care.</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer. It&#x27;s pain-free and I have never been nicked from using it. It only lasted for about a year but that was my fault. I was using it in the shower and it is NOT waterproof. It rusted up and stopped working. But I liked it so much that I purchased another one. This is so much better than the Clio I got from CVS.</li>
            <li> advertised on Dr. Oz show and I bought 4 to include my sisters;&lt;br /&gt;these things don&#x27;t trim hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;junk</li>
            <li> Completely died after only five or six uses, and wouldn&#x27;t power up again at all.  I&#x27;m not at all impressed.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 times.  Never touched a drop of water. Now it doesn&#x27;t work. What a waste!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I&#x27;m amazed how long it runs on a set of batteries.</li>
            <li> So worth buying!  I love it I use it all the time just for pubs. It gets really close to a shave an you don&#x27;t get red pumps or itchiness!  Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> Small and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag, this shaver can reach narrow places and get very close to the skin. A really great trimmer for ladies!</li>
            <li> its ok and does a decent job, disappointed because you can&#x27;t use it in the shower</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Works just as simply as it appears to from its images. Just be careful with blade length while in sensitive areas, you WILL get nicked!</li>
            <li> this shaver doesn&#x27;t catch or grab sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love using it to trim my down-there. I find that the plastic guard doesn&#x27;t let me get the closest trim I want, so I just take it off and use the metal part directly. I know other reviews say it will hurt the skin and warn you not to do it, but I personally have NOT had any problems with the guard off. I get the closest, evenest trim ever! I absolutely love the feeling of only having a little stubble. &amp;lt;3 And it doesn&#x27;t hurt me to apply the metal part to my skin, so even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying you should just do it and use it without the guard. I&#x27;m just saying that it does work for me as long as I&#x27;m being careful. I have NEVER cut myself, pinched my skin, hurt myself, or had any other bad reaction/effect happen to me when I used this trimmer without the plastic guard. I&#x27;ve used this awesome trimmer at least 20 times (too many to count) becaue I HATE the feeling of hair down-there. I&#x27;ve done waxing it hurt so much I vowed never to do it again even though my skin felt silky smooth down there; and razors always made me super-itchy and sometimes gave me razor burn that hurt. I&#x27;d much rather feel very short stubble from this trimmer! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this trimmer. I had the first one for about two years and it broke after I dropped it one too many times. For the price, it is a great product. Never nicked, pinched, or cut me and held up very well.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Now my wife can keep her enormous bush nice and trimmed. Wish I knew about this product sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby as a beard trimmer. He had the male version (black w/ no heat) and it wore out. He loved it and couldn&#x27;t find another one to replace it. They don&#x27;t seem to make the black one any more, and he was hesitant to buy the &#x27;girls version&#x27;. He was pleased to open it on Christmas morning and has happily used it since.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife who&#x27;s struggled with sizzors over the years.  Works as advertised!  Leaves a clean &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; trim.  Smooth, quiet action with no pulling or nicking. Easy to clean. I use it on my beard - smoother and sharper than my beard trimmer.  We love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other bikini shapers /trimmers. None of them are up to par. This Panasonic is not &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; (as it is titled), but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a &#x27;heated&#x27; one, anyway. Several years ago, I had bought a Panasonic bikini shaper / trimmer, and it lasted many years. After trying others, when the old one gave out, they were terrible. The Panasonic(s) are wonderful, and very comfortable, no matter how close / intimate the trim.&lt;br /&gt;Debra-Sue</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for getting a nice close shave without the razor burn I normally experience from a regular razor. Easy to clean and nice range of lengths to choose from. Simple to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer because nothing makes you feel sexier than your husband lovingly telling you, &amp;#34;nice thigh-brows, honey&amp;#34;. Normally, I get everything waxed, but have let things get admittedly out of hand. (When you&#x27;re 6 months pregnant, out of sight is out of mind). I took care of all offending hair while not really being able to see. Flying blind, so to speak, is a bit worrisome in such a sensitive area. I&#x27;ve shed blood trying that with my husband&#x27;s trimmer, but this little puppy did the trick and my skin stayed intact the whole time! It is small, light-weight and easy to maneuver with left and right handed use. I would recommend this to anyone looking to clean up and not have to worry about little cuts. However, I would suggest only using it for short periods of time. I had my work cut out for me, so I suppose it&#x27;s maiden voyage was a bit longer than what I would normally expect to use this for. The head got very warm. I let it cool and finished a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer helps you keep your pubic hedges nice and neat. It has several different lengths for trimming - I use the shortest setting and haven&#x27;t gotten razor burn or experienced any discomfort while using it. It&#x27;s very easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to take apart for cleaning, and it&#x27;s pretty quiet. I absolutely recommend this to anyone (guy or gal) who wants to stay tidy down there.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who doesn&#x27;t like it totally gone this is the perfect little tool.  Great price and works perfect.  So much easier then trimming with sissors.  Cuts the time in half.  The only thing I would have loved if they added is a storing case.</li>
            <li> just what you expect from panasonic - quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase.  Very safe trimmer. Trims perfectly and lasts a long time even with Alkaline batteries. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It works well and as long as you use common sense, you wont cut yourself. Has lasted me a while on its first batteries with biweekly use and good maintenance.</li>
            <li> Great concept but defiantly on the pricey side especially when it snags and pull hair!</li>
            <li> I had one that lasted about 5 years.  And it didn&#x27;t break, it just got really loud, so I got a new one.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, it has 5 &amp;#34;sizes&amp;#34; of trimming and you only need 2 AA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared of this when I bought it but I was just going to risk it. I was really looking for something good and this is panasonic so it caught my attention. When I first did, after praying all saints for strength, I found myself so surprise it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I am still amazed at this. It makes a sound like &amp;#34;i will rip your skin off moahha&amp;#34; but it is really not painful at all. If you feel pain, you&#x27;re doing it wrong that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on the opposite way of a comb and you will have a good result. It is a TRIMMER. Do not speak smooth skin afterwards. And do not rate it wrong because you didn&#x27;t understand the title of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Works good so far.  I like a close shave so I have just removed the gauge and use just the trimmer blades.  Quiet too.</li>
            <li> SO happy to have finally find this product, tried others but they just weren&#x27;t right.  - Keeps everything neat and trims extremely close!</li>
            <li> While it does a good job of trimming the hair, it is REALLY bad about yanking the hair and catching my skin. I always have a bloody mess whenever I tried to use this. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is my third go at an electric razor for my bikini area and I am so much happier than with my two previous purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This runs on two AA batteries. Some people might not like that but my first one was on a charger and the charger mysteriously stopped fitting and wouldn&#x27;t charge so I&#x27;m fine with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for all over, not just the outline. I&#x27;ve used it with and without the guard. Both worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I def recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and works very well for multiple trim levels even very short not quit shaven smoot, but good.</li>
            <li> At first, I was uncertain how to use this product. I read the instruction but I was still confused. But I could figure out how to use it shortly after I found an instruction on google. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Great trimmer - from tough beard to any other areas you want to trim. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve had so I cannot compare to others. It performs as expected. Trims close and neat. Don&#x27;t expect a workhorse or a full shave. Great for occasional use.</li>
            <li> I received this to learn it is battery operated. I used it once and it did not work, at all with the guard , even on 1, so I took the guard off and ended up completely bald!!! These clippers suck.</li>
            <li> Works great,  I like that you can adjust the shield or take it off if you want.  I also love the that it is battery operated and does not use ac charger.</li>
            <li> The wait is over for a bikini trimmer that actually does what it says it does. Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li> I use the shaper and trimmer to help my wife look her best in today&#x27;s more revealing bathing suits.  The width of the trimmer that Panasonic chose works very well.  It allows for easy use.  Also, the trimmer has plenty of power to get the job done.  Setting the length of hair remaining is very easy.  Do remember, it is a trimmer, not a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wont go into detail, but it does work well :)</li>
            <li> Tend to use this without the attachment...trims well but different from a razor. If u get too close it does hurt and bleeding occurs. No irritation like with shaving but doesn&#x27;t get the tough to reach spot s</li>
            <li> Perfect for trimming pubic areas.A lot less irritation than razors</li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipping to NZ.</li>
            <li> Its plain and simple. But gets the job done. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for trimming body hair for men and women.  NOT a close shave, but a pain-free trim.</li>
            <li> This works perfect!  Very easy to trim to desired length with 5-position angled trimmer head. It trims evenly with no irritation to my sensitive skin. Of course, the the angled head comes off to trim close in other areas. It&#x27;s very quick. I did it in less than 5 min. I am thrilled to get a Panasonic trimmer for $19.99!</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with razor burn, sensitive skin, etc. I cannot use a razor, a bikini wax is too painful, and using those chemical-filled hair removal creams is irritating to my skin. This works well to eliminate all of those problems while keeping things neat. With the guard on, it does leave a few mm of hair, which is clearly mentioned in the manual. But what is not mentioned is that it is very hard to maneuver in those hard-to-reach places for a close trim. Definitely do not attempt to use it in sensitive areas without the guard- it can nick skin! It is not as bad a nick as with a razor, but still a nick!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really couldn&#x27;t find anything to clean up the area. This did the trick and keeps everything at a good length. Didn&#x27;t cut me at all. I tried other electric shavers and they were too harsh.</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t get as close as the Braun mini shaver does. The Braun is excellent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a good quality trimmer but just doesn&#x27;t cut it in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmed somehow sticks to the device leaving a mess. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works really great, the adjustable guard makes it so you can trim up howver short you want and I can take the guard off to trim up my bikini line if I don&#x27;t have time to shave or wax</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a smooth shave this is not the product for you. However, if you just want to clean up your areas and keep it neat then it&#x27;s almost perfect! Almost in that the guard doesn&#x27;t really work too well so I don&#x27;t use it which makes tight spots hard to manage. But it works and keeps a charge more than 2 mins which was the problem I had with the last shaper I had. My husband even uses it for his areas. Great product and I highly recommend it for both men and women!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to hold, which is important for those of us with carpal tunnel syndrome, and comfortable to use.  It does a very good, even job and has 5 different settings so that you can have the hair length you prefer.  Those who prefer longer lengths can have it while still getting the benefits of an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, the trimmer does not come with the bag shown in the picture, which means that you get to figure out a way to keep the trimmer and the brush together.  For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Really, though, those issues are very minor, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the trimmer.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good trimmer. Breathe a sigh of relief people ... your two day Amazon search is over. Buy this one, it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have it. It&#x27;s 2017. It still works as well as when I first bought it. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> All the reviews here sum it up. This little trimmer is great.  Gets you all trimmed up with no nicks!!  Reasonable price, too!!  A+++++  I&#x27;ve already sent a link out to my girlfriends...sharing this little trimmer.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I am happy this item was at amazon, I did need to order batteries from you for it. I do not know if you sell clock, watch, AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;it you do I know they will be at a lower price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull hair, completely painless &amp; no razor bumps, the main reason I bought it. I think I&#x27;ma have to adjust the angle I&#x27;m holding it at as to get the hair at the length I want it but other than that it&#x27;s great, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot but this was very cheap.  It does pull without the guard on.  I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really heated.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find where the heat comes from!  Works well, fits in hand well, and easy to change length of trim.  Much better than getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does a good job. I use it to stay trimmed. Also, I use it prior to shaving to minimize razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I (as well as my husband) have ever used. We have used so many different brands, types and this one is still the best. I purchased this one as a backup, just in case like everything else (once you begin liking something they stop selling it) it suddendly isn&#x27;t being sold anymore. I want to make sure we have it around for a long time. The first one that we purchased, was bought over five years ago and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!!! This backup will be tucked away just in case! I love this thing, my husband loves this thing. The trimmer worth purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I have to remove the protective head in order to actually trim, and that makes me nervous. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, and for the price it is definitely a good buy if you don&#x27;t care too much about length, because, in my experience, adjusting the head for trimming doesn&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr For the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those sensitive and delicate areas like the bikini line and keeping your private area neatly trimmed. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after just one use.  Returned for full refund.  Might be good if it had actually worked longer.  Not willing to buy another one to try.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer for &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; areas as well as my legs and it gives a really close and clean, almost shaved look especially on hairy areas where soft hair runs rampant. Love this and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent for its intended use.  This is a trimmer, not a shaver.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the product description says what it will do.  So any of the reviewers that gave it negative reviews was clearly expecting something something other than the description.</li>
            <li> I had my trimmer for, I don&#x27;t know, 7 years? But it got lost during my latest move, so I&#x27;m buying a new one - I like it that much. It&#x27;s not glamorously designed and it&#x27;s a boring, gray color, but it does the job perfectly and reliably. But what&#x27;s up with this \\&quot;heated\\&quot; business?  Mine didn&#x27;t heat up - in fact, I&#x27;d be alarmed if it did! (Who who wants a heated device on their bikini line? Yikes...)</li>
            <li> Great product to have. Love that the attachment can be removed to use alone. This replaced one that I already had. Love it</li>
            <li> easy to use. works on batteries. cut is very close and causes no irritation, pulling on skin, itching or redness.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Strong motor - decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> I thought the largest/longest trimmer head would be good for thinning but all the heads are really shavers...good, solid product and made in Japan  :-)  So if you are looking for shave and shape, this is for you but NOT for thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic offers a limited 2-year warranty!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the guard and find that this trimmer pulls uncomfortably on longer hairs.  I bought this to replace an old Panasonic trimmer that worked great for years.  I&#x27;m going to look for a different one that doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> I needed a new trimmer and I kinda ordered this one blindly because I wasn&#x27;t sure what I wanted. It seems like it is the correct size/weight for my hand to hold without being too weildy and I especially like the fact that you can take the guard off to clean it. This trimmer has 5 cut lengths and you adjust the cut length by moving the guard up and down on the trimmer. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charger, it takes 2 AA batteries which I am not sure how long it will take them to run out of juice.  I like this trimmer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not great. A little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a good little shaper. Does exactly what you need. I bought this a couple months ago &amp; still use it once to twice a week just to keep everything in line, lol. Its nice and small so it fits right in your purse or bag in case you need a touch up. Easy to clean. Was shipped to me faster than I thought it would come. I really like it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver worked well until it stopped completely after a year.  It would not charge so I could not use the product.  I&#x27;ve just spoken to the warranty service reps and will send it in.  That will cost me shipping and the hassle, of course.  Good thing there&#x27;s a 2 year warranty.  Will update after I hear back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent price on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;-Made in Japan (not China!)&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer works well on long to medium hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Shaper provides a close almost-shave&lt;br /&gt;-Designed to reach all contours of the body&lt;br /&gt;-Battery operation MUCH more convenient than plug-in&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer doesn&#x27;t get short hairs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cap, without it I get the perfect trim. Except I end up nicking myself every time if I don&#x27;t put it against the skin at the right angle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black lady and i have been looking for a trimmer that works. I have used this one twice, and I can say no razor burn!! Yay! Will keep using it..</li>
            <li> Pulls my hair out and does NOT trim properly ... Wish I could return but will def be tossing it</li>
            <li> Works well; Trimmer heads not terribly short.</li>
            <li> Before I would shave and get razor bumps, then I started doing waxing, very painful. I am done with both, this little trimmer is the only one in my life now. Compact great for travel, wireless. I love this product , it is all I am going to use from now on. Very close and precise shave or adjustable length attachment. Thank you Panasonic.</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t like this at all and it DEFINITELY isn&#x27;t worth the price!!  It&#x27;s too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places, at least for me.  It did work well for trimming prior to shaving, but if you don&#x27;t let it get to that point, it&#x27;s unnecessary anyway. I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn&#x27;t trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!!  Plus, for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry.  Save your money.  The trimmer attachment on my husbands electric razor works 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. Very durable and excellent battery life. Really does great work on the legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was spoiled by my previous razor, which I can no longer find for purchase... I had a cheap bikini razor for years that worked much better than this one. I chose this one due to the high amount of positive reviews, but I haven&#x27;t liked this one at all. I&#x27;ve been searching for another one. It does not give a good shave. It&#x27;s design doesn&#x27;t even make sense.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to use. Not sure why the description says heated, it is not. Still a great razor. One of the better ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know why the product is labeled &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; since it clearly is not.&lt;br /&gt;However, I love the product and it feels safe and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> but this is great for the price for what it does. i just use it to keep my lady parts tidy in-between waxes.  it lets me stay groomed while keeping the hair long enough for my appointments.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will. I just got it today and was soo excited to try it out. It looks exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it works. I wished it trimmed to a shorter length, but oh well. I guess I could take the guard off and it would be shorter. Very easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t snag, pull, or hurt at all. My biggest complaint is that it is pretty loud in my opinion! My roommate probably thought I got a vibrator in the mail today lol! But I bought this to make shaving less of a hassle when I let it get out of hand...and it works for that so I can&#x27;t complain. There are probably better ones out there but this is good for the price. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, lasts long time on 2 batteries.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Gets heated up for couple of minutes of trimming. Didn&#x27;t like the noise too.</li>
            <li> This does the job just fine, but you have to remove the guard to get any real work done. In general, a great product.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works great. Batteries last forever in this thing. I changed the batteries once just recently and I think I had this for a year so far.  I use it once a week for trimming arm hairs since I found out that&#x27;s how an aesthetician did hers. She said it&#x27;s better than shaving because it grows back soft and not all bushy. She is right. This trimmer gets really close so I&#x27;m happy with the results I get with it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.  I would and have recommended it to friends.  This one gets an excellent recommendation from me.</li>
            <li> Very easy and safe to use, i agree with other review every lady should own one of this. It &#x27;ll help to keep you nice and neat. i think it would work great for guys too.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and had problems with it getting close enough to really trim well.  However, a few months after starting use, the trimmer just stopped working.  I tried changing the batteries a few times, but it still didn&#x27;t work.  The Schick trimmer that comes with a razor on the other end works better and I had that for two years before it just wasn&#x27;t suitable to use in the shower anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 months ago and it works great! I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and small, so it&#x27;s easy to use and customize. It is advertised as having a &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; function, which I don&#x27;t notice at all, but it&#x27;s not something I cared about when purchasing it. The trimmer itself is a very good quality for the price and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it thus far. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bikini trimmer! It has made my life so much easier. I no longer dread shaving, and it only takes a couple minutes versus 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 5 months.  It was working ok for my purposes.  Its a little hard to use for the bikini areas (big and clumsy)&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN I DROPPED IT, BY ACCIDENT, IN WATER.  Its broken.  I dried it right away but it does not even turn on anymore.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  I bought it when I was pregnant and I&#x27;ve continued to use it even though I&#x27;ve had my baby.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, very precise and seems quite safe.&lt;br /&gt;There are different options about hair length.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Finally! I have tried and tried to find a trimmer that works and here it is. This is small enough to maneuver around your lady parts, fits in your hand, and doesn&#x27;t cut you or rip out pubes! Seriously, you can get a super close shave without fear. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> It broke after only a few uses. Seemed to be made of very cheap material. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ok so...most people have very fine, sparse hair..I have VERY thick, coarse hair. Like I mean, I have it BAD. When I bought this, I knew it was a trimmer so I didn&#x27;t expect it to clean off everything. So I put it to the test. Initially, it did nothing, NOTHING! I was like, how come so many people thought this was fantastic, what&#x27;s the problem here? Fast forward a day, and I am loving it. My problem was that I was not using it as directed, and also although they did specify a particular direction to cut in, I found best results going in every direction imaginable. And for those of you who even have a trail of hair going even further under...even past the general &#x27;exposed&#x27;  areas...I was so happy with the results of mine I decided to put it to the test and GULP...try it down there. Super easy! There is no reason to be worried even further &#x27;down there&#x27; since the blade is hidden and the only parts that are really exposed to the blade would not be hair, not skin. No cuts, bruises, nicks..nothing. It&#x27;s just nice, very well trimmed and groomed areas.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews - this item is for TRIMMING not shaving (which I thought was pretty clear in the item description).  This is perfect for keeping things tidy down there, it&#x27;s super easy to use.  I also like that it gets the hair short but doesn&#x27;t clip it so close that you&#x27;ll get ingrown hairs and whatnot.  Great for expecting mothers or anyone whose had a mishap using scissors down there!</li>
            <li> This is...I don&#x27;t know what to say this is...but it really does not remove anything...you have to remove the plastic head to get a close shave....still hoping somebody invent a machine that will give you a close shave but not clean shaven</li>
            <li> Works perfect as a trimmer. For those looking to get super close this is not your tool, but for a close maintenance length this is a great inexpensive tool.</li>
            <li> The good, it trims well and doesn&#x27;t catch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:  the slide up gauge to cut hair longer is useless. It only trims at the shortest setting.  It eats batteries, power is noticeably decreased after a few uses.  I would prefer a corded unit.  Lastly, why does every manufacturer figure that women want to shave their girly bits with awful pastel colored contraptions.  Pastels are not sexy!  They don&#x27;t scream modern woman, hear me roar!  It screams &amp;#34;we have product designers who decorated the set of The Brady Bunch!&amp;#34;  They could at least have some fun with the design of it</li>
            <li> It does what it says its supposed to do.  Maybe it&#x27;s a little overpriced....but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  I use it for my personal &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and also to cut my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  He has black hair and it definitely takes off the amount I want to take off without taking him to a barbershop since he&#x27;s not ready for it yet.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> works quickly and effectively. makes hair soft and clean shaven look. i researched it and was told this was the best. they were right.</li>
            <li> its not worth one star, as it did not work.</li>
            <li> Removed guard for most of my shaving. Leaves a wee bit of stubble. But sooooo easy to use and very maneuverable in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to shave my pubic hair and it worked perfectly! Highly recommend it if you want to shave your pubic hair.</li>
            <li> Used it to shave my head, very smooth shave and easy to use. Shaved with one stroke, it&#x27;s strong and sharp. Was able to use as a good beard trimmer, very impressed. Great quality, cuts great.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten this years ago!  Scissors are such a pain with a bad angle, just hope the razor stays sharp!  I tried using my leg shaver for this and ruined it :P&lt;br /&gt;..............&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2013: bought a replacement because the razor seemed to be dulling, was taking quite a bit longer to get the same results, kind of a pain.  I replaced the batteries and not much change.  I didn&#x27;t even look for replacement razors, they never sell them for leg electric razors :P</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good value - seems to work well, though I&#x27;ve only had it a short time. I like the fact that it takes batteries instead of having to plug it in to charge, and the adjustable guard is handy &amp; easy to work with. It also is easy enough to pop open &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a decent and affordable trimmer.  That is until is stopped working less than 6 months after I got it.  I tried changing the batteries and cleaning it, but it won&#x27;t turn on.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does just what I need it to do. The head has adjustable height for custom length and is removable for a very close finish.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use, gets the job done and leaves everything nice and neat. If you want to go completely smooth, then you will need to wax.</li>
            <li> I like it much better then trying to cut with scissors or using a razor.  I brought one for my sister for Christmas and she likes it too.</li>
            <li> No, this shaver does not give you that completely bald look or feel, but that&#x27;s not what I was going for.  The shave is very close, especially if you remove the guard, and there is no irritation.  I really like this thing.</li>
            <li> Trimmer met my expectations. It feels solid and has worked reliably with no pulling of hair or irritation. The length guide worked well too.</li>
            <li> less expensive than the ones i&#x27;ve seen in stores and it works pretty well. the guard comes off for easy cleaning, and it&#x27;s effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> This works great for potentially sensitive areas.  I like that the guard wraps around the blades and keeps them away from the skin.  The guard also has nice smooth corners and doesn&#x27;t snag on looser skin.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what i need it to. Haven&#x27;t tried without the guard though, but I really like it. Easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Edit (3 yrs later)&lt;br /&gt;This little beast is being laid to rest, I used it to touch up my girlfriend&#x27;s side cut occasionally the last year, and I think that&#x27;s what is making the motor start to die. It&#x27;s just louder and doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as well. Good little beast, definitely would recommend for lighter use than what we put it through though lol</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little trimmer! It does exactly what I wanted it to do! I doesn&#x27;t need to be charged which is great, all it needs are two batteries.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me like 5 years ago and I love it, is still working, but the blade is broken and I can&#x27;t find any place to buy a blade replacement, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m just giving it 4 stars... :(</li>
            <li> This works really quickly and cleanly for maintenance grooming. Was easy to put together for use and clean. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at any of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE NOT TO USE IT IN OR AROUND WATER BECAUSE IT WILL KILL THE MOTOR. I made the mistake of using it in the shower a few times, and it died quickly (my own fault, because it clearly says not to do that) so I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, trims just right amount. Wish I&#x27;d had a long time ago. Shapes very well without leaving area prickly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected for the 1 year I have had it, but now it is completely dead.  I can&#x27;t get it to work at all.  I know it was only $20 but I hoped it would&#x27;ve lasted longer.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to cut a very tall grass, you have to go step by step so you don&#x27;t bug out the lawn mower ,until is very low. The same thing with this, use the trimmer&#x27;s position down to 1 and then disconnect the plastic guide and you can go lower, always using the same angle of attack as designed , and then after that you could shave with an electric shaver. It takes just a few minutes , depending how big the game field is. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this little tool. Guaranteed to be every girl&#x27;s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for those who want to be neat and trim without the hassle or  embarrassment of going to waxing salons.</li>
            <li> Completely stopped working less than 3 months after purchasing and after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to trim with the trimmer on a shaver and having a terrible experience, I bought this wonderful little trimmer. It trimmed the bikini area in about one-third of the time the shaver took, without all the pulling and tugging. It was fast, quiet, and efficient. What a difference. Now it will be a pleasure instead of a chore to keep the bikini area neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> can be snag city with this trimmer- careful folks!</li>
            <li> Such a waste. It only worked once before it died. Was supposed to be good for the shower but I think that is what killed it.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s completely plastic. Take some getting used to have never used anything like this before. has worked well so far. It&#x27;s not quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean. Overall very pleased</li>
            <li> I expected a razor for the bikini area to be close but gentle.  This razor pinches!  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted  a trimmer and i have finally found the right one.i would definitely recommend this one. You cannot go wrong . it is easy to carry and very quiet, no loud noise,i was very surprised that i did not get any bumps. That is a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I wanted</li>
            <li> If your looking to take care of adult acne and are concerned about ageing also this product  is the best choice on the market . its the best of both worlds . acne and ageing combined. Good luck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that even though I read the reviews, and knew I wanted something to help with this zone, I was terrified to use it. But i gritted my teeth and started in -- it&#x27;s amazing. Zero pulling, zero room for error, quick, easy, lifesaver. I have exceptionally delicate skin - just looking at a razor can give me razor burn and ingrown hairs. But this is fantastic, none of those issues (of course this doesn&#x27;t shave, just trim) but if you&#x27;re concerned because you have to use it dry, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s easy. Also quick to clean.Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted slightly less than 3 months. Just long enough for the warranty to expire. Great trimmer, but you&#x27;ll be buying another soon.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works but has to be used dry. Hair clings to the plastic by static electricity. There is a little brush included for cleaning but it would be a lot easier to just rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Would buy again</li>
            <li> Its work great. If you dont want a complete bald shave and want to trim the pubic area as close as possible this is perfect. I used to use hand scissors but sometimes had cuts. .so I looked for a shaver and im so glad I did. I really recommend it and it does have different sizes in case you don&#x27;t want the hair to bevery short.</li>
            <li> This review is bases on my first use. It did not really meet my expectations based on other reviews. I have sensitive skin and I already can tell that this will cause some kind of redness and irritation due to the fact that I have to constantly go over my skin with the trimmer. I had to take off the attachment so I can trim properly. It is difficult to write a review over a trimmer without getting a little TMI, but I feel like in order to maybe get better use of this trimmer one must perhaps need to go all winter without trimming the bikini area to get good use of it. I do not feel it is a trimmer that can be used to properly groom , or more like keep the area trimmed without having to wait weeks between each trim. But I am still not sure if I want to keep using this trimmer or not. Once again I have really sensitive skin and I bought this trimmer in hopes of getting some relief from the razor burn; but alas seems like for me this trimmer might not do that trick for what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It stopped working after first use... an yes, I replaced batteries with new ones and still would not work. Plus when it did work it was not very powerful. Contacted Panasonic to get a replacement and it would cost 15.00 to send it back... almost what the thing cost. In retrospect I should have purchased a re-chargeable one... replacing batteries is always a bad sign.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It runs off regular batteries and since purchasing it in December, I havent had to replace them. All in all, not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would do the job and this sure did the trick!!  Works great, and I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic bikini trimmer does a good job of taming the bush.  The guide is adjustable for different lengths and it&#x27;s gentle.  It runs on two AAs (not included), it&#x27;s not waterproof (bummer), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet for a shaver.  So far, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> First it forgets where it&#x27;s supposed to grow, then it starts growing where it&#x27;s not suppose to grow.  I bought this trimmer to use on the other end, whereas I really can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing.  Works great.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. It is very light to hold and contained all parts I paid for. HOWEVER, it would not work. I inserted the two AA batteries, but the only thing that happened is that the razor moved back and forth very slowly for only about 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I had done lots of research on razors to buy, and decided on this one. I wanted to &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; for my wedding and honeymoon but was very disappointed that this product (one that my research said was great) did not operate correctly.&lt;br /&gt;It created a hectic day for me.&lt;br /&gt;Please buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have any recommendations for a razor//trimmer that works??</li>
            <li> This product works vey well. I found it easy to figure out and easy to use. The power level is good.</li>
            <li> It does everything the manufacturer said it would do. It&#x27;s a quality product I would recommend for any woman who has unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> A few people said this pulled, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I&#x27;ve tried it with and without the guard and it works perfectly. If you use it without the guard, it trims really closely so there isn&#x27;t much hair left. I used it to trim my entire area, not just my bikini line and I didn&#x27;t have any problems. It&#x27;s super easy to clean with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that it was awkward to use, but I decided to try it, anyway. They were right. It works well, but it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done for me.</li>
            <li> Works really well and trims very close.  The unit is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this in adition to the ladies panasonic close curves trimmer as that one does not have gaurds they make a great team and i believe will last me a longgggg time.</li>
            <li> This thing is great because it is battery operated so it is always ready when you need it.  I take the batteries out and just put them back in when I am ready to use it.  There is nothing worse then being ready to shave and not having power.  Plus it trims super short and without the guard I have had no cuts.  I love it and highly recommend it.  I have been using it for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the disposable trimmer that Shick makes (it&#x27;s a combo with a razor), but they always died out quickly and I wanted something more durable.  I&#x27;ve been happy with this one -- I think the size would preferably be a little more narrow, but it does the job.  The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is the razor guard.  It says that there are 5 settings, and there are....but the settings are all *crazy* high....I can barely use the lowest setting -- it still produces fairly long hair (the highest setting is literally almost an inch....seriously, who using a bikini trimmer wants hair that long????)  I almost always use it without the guard, which works fine, but it&#x27;s a little frustrating because I have to be much more careful than if I could use a guard with an appropriate height.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge after 1 month.  Doesn&#x27;t work well plugged in.  Already been replaced.</li>
            <li> I use this to help me with my upkeep as I am pregnant and at 36 weeks it is impossible to see but this helps me stay tame.</li>
            <li> Keep that sh#t trimmed with this. No one wants long hair that&#x27;s why we shave people!!! Your spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend/people at the beach/anyone born after the 70&#x27;s will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> Hands down!, this is the BEST trimmer I&#x27;ve bought. I get NO razor bumps, NO nicks,  and NO cuts. I have used other methods of removing bikini hair and none can compare to this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Say no to bikini waxing and YES to this shaver.  Easy to use, never nicks the bits.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I needed to graduate from scissors.  Easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for a couple years. Sometimes had problems actually turning on despite fully charged batteries, but overall it worked great. Eventually gave out, so I just got a new one because basically this little thing does a good job. Adjustable trim lengths are great. Does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This worked good while it lasted. It started acting strange about a month in randomly turning off. I changed batteries and seemed to work good again. Now even with new batteries the trimmer turns off so frequently it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I use this as a replacement for a regular razor on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It obviously doesn&#x27;t get you perfectly smooth, but it can cut the hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Personally though, I&#x27;ve stopped using it in the bikini region as I find it difficult to maneuver in such an awkward space, if you know what I mean, even though that&#x27;s what it says it is for. The only con really is that it&#x27;s starting to act as if it isn&#x27;t working as well as it was. I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries in it, and even when they are fully charged this trimmer has started making more noise than it once did and seems like it&#x27;s struggling a bit more. I&#x27;ve only had it for about six months. Otherwise though, I love it. It&#x27;s super fast and easy and great for my sensitive skin that would always get red and bumpy after shaving with a normal razor.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this trimmer for taking care of the bikini area! You won&#x27;t get bald with this TRIMMER (get it, TRIMMER!) but it will clean up the area for waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> When I tried to shave without the guide on, I got cut! It may be that I didn&#x27;t read the directions and somewhere it says to not shave without the guide, but I couldn&#x27;t get close enough with it on. I like short hair and I couldn&#x27;t obtain it (safely).</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and does the job. Very happy with the product. I like the compact size as well.</li>
            <li> Wish I had got this sooner!  So easy to use, and effective.  Neat and tidy results!</li>
            <li> Does the job that I need. I usually take the comb head off to get a close shave. Works great; great investment.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep you trimmed &amp; shaped.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I got this little puppy a day early today.  I hesitated to spend the money and also because I read one review or two that stated it tugged and pulled at the hair.  I am very sensitive to that.  I had no reason to worry, this thing is awesome!  I was really scared at first to use it, but as I saw how well it was working, I got less nervous with it.  No need to excessively worry about all your female bits getting in there either, just take care to move them out of the way.  I went in all directions with it, in order to get an even trim.  First against the hair growth, then from the inside toward the out.  Another concern for me was the length it would leave the hair, so let me tell you.  It&#x27;s got this great little number system by the way, on the front of the guide, it&#x27;s 1 - 5.  I cut mine at 2, I may go to a three next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,  #1 is 1/8&amp;#34; length&lt;br /&gt;  #2 is 1/4&amp;#34; length&lt;br /&gt;  #3 is 3/8&amp;#34; length&lt;br /&gt;  #4 is 1/2&amp;#34; length&lt;br /&gt;and #5 is 5/8&amp;#34; length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago. It does what it is intended for. Not a lot of bells and whistles here. I like that it takes batteries, rather than rechargeable because I don&#x27;t have good luck with rechargeable gadgets. I have no complaints. I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever but for under $20, you can&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in January 2011 and it worked until the summer of 2012 with 1 - 2x a month usage. I am considering buying it again because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything else like it. I may opt for the Always Bikini Perfect since it can be used in the shower (even though it doesn&#x27;t have as favorable reviews). I used it without the cover the whole time and you have to be careful. I wish it were a little narrower, like the ones sold in the drugstore (I think Venus has one -- but this one does not last more than a month). So overall I would recommend this trimmer but I wish it lasted a little longer than a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It does the job with ease. I experienced no pulls, nicks, or ingrown hairs. It cuts just close enough and all at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the best alternative to shaving and waxing! It works extremely well and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but does the job. For the price point, I recommend.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i needed. it trims but doesn&#x27;t shave (which means no razor burn!)&lt;br /&gt;someone recommended removing the comb for almost no hair left and i would second that. it won&#x27;t pull or cut your skin that way. it was louder than i expected, but that&#x27;s fine for the job it does.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked a handful of times until it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore. Changed batteries, nothing. Panasonic sent me another one brand new because I was still under the 2 year warranty and guess what? Went to use it this morning and that one doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore and used it ONCE. Also, it is not water-friendly so how are you supposed to clean it after you use it? So many other better products on the market. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Works great, trims consistently, battery life is excellent! Easy to clean and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small easy to use and easy to clean. It&#x27;s cordless I love it. Diffinately recommend for other women to buy.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to trim my body hair. It looks quite simple and outdated but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Works great to trim your sideburns and edges on your head as well. Just a solid product.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my pubic hair. Works great. Gives you a nice close trim without the itch.</li>
            <li> I use this for the advertised purpose and it works really well, does just what I want it to. Easy to use, I love that it has the different settings. I haven&#x27;t had it all that long, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Used once. Left in shower. Never worked again.</li>
            <li> Well... it is quite, but it also has no power, becomes too hot to continue using, and has sharp edges which scrape me up. I can&#x27;t even get through a whole shave with out having to stop and allow it to cool. The guard keeps the hair so long that it&#x27;s not really worth using. I use with out the guard, but then get scraped up and burned. Shaving my bikini area seems more like torture...I end up hurt, pissed, and only half shaven.</li>
            <li> very convenient, incredibly inexpensive for the performance, has continued to cut well for months, and it looks like replacement blades are affordable.</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer once so far, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it will perform in the long run, but so far....I really enjoy it. However, when I first attempted to use it, I left the guard on, but on the shortest trimmer setting.....it did absolutely NOTHING. For women, or men, out there who want their hair finely trimmed, leaving the guard on defeats the purpose. I had to remove the  guard to get the results that I wanted, but after that....it works perfectly. Everything was nice, neat, and barely there. I love it. It is the perfect alternative to shaving, which doesn&#x27;t work for me at all, because it causes ingrown hairs, and bumps. But this trimmer didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and I have very very sensitive skin! I love it!</li>
            <li> This shaver has amazing reviews and I was expecting it to be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t! It pinches and it actually hurts when it cuts the hairs. I&#x27;m upset that I bought it.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get the job done with this product. I am not 100% satisfied because it doesn&#x27;t do the job neatly. As if not sharp or fast enough.</li>
            <li> I love it. its small, no cord, and works great!</li>
            <li> This little machine is wonderful!! It does its job for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great, even after 3 years. doesn&#x27;t eat up too much battery power as long as you take out the batteries after every use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works.  They seemed to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to shave my baby&#x27;s head.  Worked well for that purpose.  It is relatively quiet and does not scare the baby.</li>
            <li> Only used once, but it was fine! Did the job and trimmed hair very close. I used the guard to get the long hair down to manageable length and thickness, and then took off the guard. I had been using a very similarly-shaped device, but smaller, and cheaper, and I hadn&#x27;t used the guard on that either--I can see why it&#x27;d be useful to trip a beard a certain length, etc., but for bikini-line trimming, using the guard just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Pull skin taught so that you&#x27;ll be less likely to nick yourself. I did a couple of times, but it didn&#x27;t even really feel like a nick, more like just the sharp point dug in a bit. I agree with others that a case/bag would be nice, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Good buy. It isn&#x27;t a skin-close cut, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. This was perfect for my needs, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on other razors that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. This one is perfect for my... um... needs. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. My first one and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ve had it for 10 years and I&#x27;m only now buying a replacement.</li>
            <li> t works very well and has battery power for or more shaves.  Just don&#x27;t take the blade out  for cleaning or get it wet.  It may never work again</li>
            <li> Does the job! And well. I&#x27;m so beyond the days of shaving things all the way down, no more red bumpies and itchies for me. But, I guess that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. I tend to only use the smallest setting, but again, personal preference.</li>
            <li> It does serve the purpose of trimming pubic hair as well, however I have had another trimmer before this and I was a little disappointed in this one because it has a tendency to tug on the pubic hair as I&#x27;m cutting it which hurts a little. It&#x27;s not extremely painful but I definitely liked my other trimmer better.</li>
            <li> I do realize that this is a trimmer and not a razor. I did not expect to get that bare skin feeling. With that being said, I feel like this trimmer is only for those with, dare I say it, a bush. I experience a lot of irritation with shaving (after 6 laser treatments no less) and still get quite a few ingrowns/razor rash in certain places. I purchased this to keep those areas short but not shaved so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about irritation and bumps. The shortest setting on this trimmer is 1/8\\&quot; but it does not get hair down that length. I could see where this could plow through a large quantity of longer hair quite well but it simply didn&#x27;t work for someone with less hair that was about 1/2\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; to begin with. That&#x27;s just too much hair for my preference.</li>
            <li> Never liked being completely bald.  I&#x27;ve used other trimmers however nothing compares to this one.  Would highly recommend if your looking for that super close trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews. However, it just died after only 3 months of infrequent use. I changed the batteries and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s dead. What a waste of money. It also didn&#x27;t trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn&#x27;t get those awful red bumps afterwards. But the attachment doesn&#x27;t even work, I had to take it off whenever I used it as otherwise it didn&#x27;t get any hairs, and then it would just scratch my skin while it shaved. Avoid!</li>
            <li> very quick, easy to use, easy to clean. After 3 uses the it has gotten slower. Goes through batteries very quick. But good stainless steel trimmer.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time for this. I have had many bikini trimmers. This trimmer is very easy to use. I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I wanted so far. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had issues with it hurting or pinching, and I have control in all the small spaces that I need to use it for- stainless steel blades important. Read some reviews that mention battery area rust etc, have not experienced it in the 2 months I&#x27;ve used it. We&#x27;ll see.  After around 12 uses, won&#x27;t work. Sometimes when I press down hard the on off switch, it buzzes- but only sometimes And I can&#x27;t shave like that :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use several bikini trimmers and this is my favorite. I use the 1 setting first to get the hairs to around 1/8&amp;#34; and then remove the trimmer comb to get extra close, by doing this I avoid bumps completely. It&#x27;s got more power than my old trimmers and because of the design it&#x27;s much easier to clean and keep from getting clogged. This trimmer was actually cheaper than other ones I&#x27;ve tried and far better quality.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Great for between waxing appointments. The trimmer is compact with surprising power for two AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I wish I could show you how good I look. Works great for landscaping. Good price.</li>
            <li> Got this trimmer on the advice of Dr. Oz. Used it six times and blade stopped working. Opened it up and a rod runs from motor to the blade head through a plastic bushing that causes the blade to move back and forth. The bushing was totally destroyed. This happened after only six uses. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews for this product before I bought it and most were positive and the price was decent so I decided to buy. I heart this thing. I use to use scissors for tidying up my nether regions, which resulted in nasty cuts, or the job was super uneven as I am not an acrobat. I would recommend this to anyone that needs an efficient and an effective way to maintain their bikini area but is not looking for a hairless result.</li>
            <li> Overall a great trimmer if you not worrying about nicks is the most important thing you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good for grooming male or female private areas&lt;br /&gt;Can close your eyes and trim without worrying about nicks&lt;br /&gt;No need to worry about batteries running out or not retaining charge&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle and maneuver in hard to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;Low maintenance, no oiling of blade&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful (need to go over same area multiple times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need more run-time:&lt;br /&gt;Battery door build seems a bit flimsy (time will tell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a trimmer only, does not provide a shave</li>
            <li> This works great as a ladies personal trimmer, no nicks, good speed and easy to use, but it really didn&#x27;t trim as close as I was hoping. I will continue to use it but it will have to be more often.</li>
            <li> i had never used a trimmer and gave this one a try. i love that it&#x27;s smaller and it does the trick. remember it&#x27;s a trimmer NOT a hair removal so if you&#x27;re looking for that you&#x27;ll have to go with waxing, shaving or electrical methods. for what its supposed to do it&#x27;s great. easy to use and keep clean. love it!</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer for some manscaping following surgery. I&#x27;m not hairy at all, so I didn&#x27;t think I needed something that was huge and rechargeable. This trimmer was perfect for me. It&#x27;s cheap, uses AA batteries, does a great job, and is compact.</li>
            <li> Review from my wife: first time I purchased a bikini trimmer. It works ok but nothing special. Would try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for over a year and it&#x27;s going strong. Fast and efficient grooming tool.</li>
            <li> This makes lawn maintenance a breeze</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is simple to operate and serves its purpose perfectly.  You can rinse it under water and it doesn&#x27;t get damaged (i don&#x27;t submerge it or let water near the battery compartment) I have used it a little wet and it still works.  I&#x27;ve had this for a long time now, and it still works great.  You can trim straight edges and control length of hair.  For a simple and durable shaver, this is the one you want.</li>
            <li> I love this item..This shaver has came handy to do touchups on my husband&#x27;s haircut when in a pinch for time..I would buy this shaver again..</li>
            <li> Battery powered, no charging needed. Works great, cleans easily</li>
            <li> This is a great compromise for those who like the look of waxing, but don&#x27;t like the price or the pain. It DOES NOT get you totally smooth and hair free, but it&#x27;s awfully darn close! My only complaint is that the little blades heat up very fast and I have to turn it off several times to let it cool down a bit before I can complete the job. Definitely an improvement over the men&#x27;s hair trimmer I was using for that area before!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this trimmer.  I use it on the bikini area and I can&#x27;t believe what a quick and clean job it did.  It truly took less than half the time of my old one.  Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous shaver. Under a min I was done, no pulling no pain. Very quick. Just what I need for down there. Wish it would gave come with a little carrier bag or something</li>
            <li> Love it, great product for my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and easy to handle. Haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick and makes grooming pretty satisfying since it makes everything even. It&#x27;s my first trimmer and I love it!</li>
            <li> I wish I could tell you how wonderful this product is, especially since Dr. Oz himself recommended the thing on a show. Problem is that the thing fell apart as I was trying to get it out of the packaging. I was too frustrated to even bother contacting the company for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer is a great buy.  Not only is it worth the price, the results it delivers is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Great price for this compact unit. Made tidy work of all excess hair on both of us and made for a fun foreplay activity exploring the nether regions!! Don&#x27;t expect a razor cut. We used it without the adjustable cover as your hair would have to be like a jungle to use some of those setting. I even tried it on my dog&#x27;s outer thigh and it bogged down, but was able to handle a small test section. Nothing kinky, just testing the machine. We have special clippers for the dogs which I would NOT want near my jewels!!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving!!! Mostly I hated it because I hate the razor bumps and the day after itching.  This neat little toy made things much easier.  I use it to get as close as possible and then i go over the area with my razor, its a very quick once over.  This didnt give me any razor bumps and came out very smooth.  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. Its great. I arrived ahead of time and is perfect. Used it once thus far and the sliding head works as indicated - no manuevering problems. I just worked patiently and before I knew it, hair was trimmed low perfectly. Thus far, no hair bumps or irritation. I have the most coarse hair and did not have any problems trimming it down to an acceptable level (for me). I also bought Bikini Zone (a Lidocaine cream) so I can avoid hair bumps, if they decide to show up -- which they always do!! But, so far, no problems. Thanks to the seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to shave.  I can&#x27;t wax.  If I do I get those nasty red bumps that hurt and itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I figured I&#x27;d try this.  I like to keep as neat and tidy as possible.  And this does the job!  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t harm my lady bits.  And for the price it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 3 years now, and the original batteries still work! It&#x27;s a great trimmer, does the job wonderfully and is long lasting. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I don&#x27;t use the attached plastic cap to change the length of trimming because I like my hair to be trimmed very short. I have experimented with other smaller trimmers, but they do not seem to be large or powerful enough to work like this one. You can use this anywhere you like, all over the body. It may not be good for eyebrow trimming since it is a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything to add anything that others haven&#x27;t already mentioned. It does not give you a completely smooth shave. It&#x27;s like a buzz cut. It has two or three settings with a plastic guard. Just like clippers have that is used by barbers.  Works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. You have to remove the safety piece to get a close shave though, sort of defeats the purpose. I&#x27;ve never been worried that I&#x27;d nick myself though. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was initially scared to use this, but after reading the reviews, I was like &amp;#34;oh, I can do this too!&amp;#34; I was able to neatly trim it rather quickly...and nicely, I might add :)</li>
            <li> I am super pleased with this shaver. I don&#x27;t like to remove all the hair around the bikini area, but rather just get a close trim. I used to use a fine-tooth comb and traditional razor to achieve this, which was all-around inconvenient. This is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO THE PRICE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final choice was this product after reading the reviews, because i completely understood what the product would do and I felt that it would soot my purpose and it did, pulled it out of the mail box yesterday but it had come on time like they stated 5/14/13. I was just late getting the mail....lol  (Product worked just like it stated (Trimmer) but I must say a very good Trimmer cuts very close) all in all this is a great product for the price......Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> How did I leave without it before? It is great!</li>
            <li> I bought this five years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  As many reviewers have stated, the guard is adjustable (or even removable, if need be).  It hasn&#x27;t conked out on me once, batteries last in it forever, and it&#x27;s easy to take on trips in carryon luggage, because it&#x27;s so small.  I&#x27;ve been a little concerned that, because of the way the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch was designed, it&#x27;d be possible for it to be turned on unintentionally, but that hasn&#x27;t ever happened to me.  It does sound like a vibrator, but honestly there are so many workarounds for problems like that that it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning.  I&#x27;m not particularly bothered by it, but if you&#x27;re shy it&#x27;s worth knowing. :)</li>
            <li> Good to get the base layer wacked away.</li>
            <li> Best thing that I brought on internet! I am recommending this trimmer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less then a year and it&#x27;s already stopped working. Highly disappointed with this Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> Not that much better than the $10 bikini trimmers. Will cut you when you shave around the curve at the top of your leg, no matter how tight you stretch your skin. :(</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My electric razor for my legs needed to be recharged but I was in a hurry.  I used this puppy and it worked for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Bikini area, it was EXACTLY what you would hope to be.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a trimmer so I did a lot of homework before I bought this. I wanted a product that would not cause razor bumps which was my biggest issue with shaving with razors. I have more coarse hair but that was not a problem for this bikini trimmer. I used the trimmer with the guard off to lineup everything and I used the lowest guard setting to trimmer the most of it. The trimmer works really well. I know there are some reviews that give this item a much lower rating but I think they expected the trimmer to get rid of everything, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I&#x27;ll end this by saying I wish I had found out about this bikini trimmer along time ago.</li>
            <li> Trims nicely and evenly.  Serves the purpose for what I need.</li>
            <li> Thought it stopped working after a few uses but had gotten water inside. Once I cleaned out, it worked great again. Just try to keep water out of the inside and if it does happen or fills with hair, just clean it out. LOVE how it trims - best I&#x27;ve used! Followed an online user tip to use a blow dryer on the area before trimming and that has prevented pulling of hair. Love that it has the attachment and is perfect for bikini region on lowest setting. Attachment helps assure there are no nicks. Nice that you can remove too and do closer trimming in the less dangerous spots. : ) Hubby uses it and loves it too. In case it does stop working though, there is a 2 year warranty and you can get a replacement from Panasonic. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> As someone who gets a shaving rash by just looking at a razor, and doesn&#x27;t have the budget for regular bikini waxes (plus, OUCH!), this product was a dream come true.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 4 months.  The blade seems as sharp as ever, and I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries.  If you want to get a close shave, you can take off the guard.  Never use this while in a rush.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to use, but you can nick yourself if you&#x27;re not being attentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really could not be more satisfied with this purchase!  It works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;ve even recommended it to several of my girlfriends, who have been equally as pleased.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer does a good job overall. Its easy to clean, the battery life seems good, its an appropriate size/weight and seems like a quality machine. Butt the blade guard doesn&#x27;t really come close enough though, so I wind up using it bare blade which I don&#x27;t like. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will not look for an alternative but there is room for improvement!</li>
            <li> This was a good shaver when it worked. It did not last long. The one I had before lasted 4 years. This I got less then a year.</li>
            <li> This thing does a terrible job of trimming. At best it could be called a &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34;. I had to run the thing over the hair MANY times to get anything remotely resembling a trim, and there were still lots of long hairs among the shorter ones. The only reason I even gave 2 stars is because it seemed totally safe to have around all those sensitive parts down there-- it won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t really cut the hair either. It might cut hair better without the guard on, but that defeats the purpose, so... lame. :-(</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, cuts down the hair fast and easy! Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t sweep up the mess afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, and have used it around once/week on average for a close crop (without the shield).  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the battery, and only a few issues with ingrown hair.  I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to anything in this area, but only had one quick moment of discomfort.  Now that I&#x27;m used to something buzzing between my legs, I&#x27;m quite comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really quite pleased with how close the trimmer gets; I actually feel smooth in some places (where hair is slightly less coarse), and everywhere else is neat and evenly trim.  As many others have noted, this is *not* going to give you the amazingly soft, post-professional wax feel.  But it does trim well, and if you&#x27;re not living in a bathing suit this summer, it covers your (or at least my) bases for everyday grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair tends to fly upward, so I find it cleanest to use this in the shower *with the water off,* with a hand mirror available, and without a top on.  (I&#x27;ve tried it mostly dressed and sitting on the toilet - which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you&#x27;re into picking fuzz out of cotton.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update when I see how long the battery lasts with regular use.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m loving being so neat -- and am not missing the experience or the price of getting waxed!  This is a great value.</li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t use this right away because I had to buy Batteries (btw, you need batteries for this...) Finally got batteries and time to try it out and it literally turned on for a split seconded then completely died. I tried switching out the batteries and changing positions... NOTHING. Its cheap and for reason. I would suggest spending a little more on something nicer. This isn&#x27;t worth the free shipping.</li>
            <li> works great, love this shaver.. Easy to use..</li>
            <li> It came exactly as the package indicated.</li>
            <li> This product just does not do the job. The guides are not calibrated correctly and the trimmer took turns being razor sharp to incredibly dull. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I&#x27;d hoped it would!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and adjust. I typically use settings 1 or 2 to get my lady hair as short as I&#x27;d like it. I typically don&#x27;t have any problems with itchiness due to how short the hair is.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ll probably just donate it to Goodwill, if they take personal products. Remington has a trimmer that works very well but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> Great for pubes, works nice without pulling or not trimming. I like it,  only wished it was rechargeable or waterproof,  but that would cost more</li>
            <li> Worked great for 3 months and then one day it didn&#x27;t work anymore</li>
            <li> I truly dislike razor burn and bumps and this gives you a really close trim without giving those types of issues. It requires batteries which is nice because you can take it anywhere without a plug yanking you back. Trim length is adjustable. The short setting is perfectly safe with the guard of course. It comes with a little brush to keep the guard and blades free of hair. If you&#x27;re a frequent trimmer and you need a perfect trim throughout sometimes I&#x27;ll need to use a comb to stand the hair up quickly followed by the trimmer. Hair is left short but feels soft and downy it does not leave you with prickly hair sensation or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I really like how it does the work. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer about a year ago and just purchased another because it stopped working (yes, I tried changing the batteries &amp; gently banging it against the shower wall.) $20 per year to keep my lady parts tidy seems like a good deal.  The water in our area is pretty tough  - I had to replace the toilet tank parts after a year too.  I was okay with trying something different for the plumbing repair but I&#x27;m a little more picky about what&#x27;s lopping stuff off around my privates.  I trust this one.</li>
            <li> Works fine, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Idk why I waited so long to get this! So easy to use. Saves me money and time</li>
            <li> Very easy to use battery powered trimmer.</li>
            <li> great clippers for guys to clean up their pubic hair.  Batterie powered so you can take them in the shower (without the water running) for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for really applies with this item.  While I am not saying this product is worthless, there are better ones for the same price to slightly higher prices.  Do yourself a favor, spend an extra $10 and buy a slightly better one.  The battery life is not very good at all.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. Exactly what I was looking for. I can change the length between 0 to 5.</li>
            <li> Without getting into too much detail...ahem...this is great for keeping things down there under control. If you&#x27;re interested in removing all hair, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere because this is just a trimmer with a couple different length settings. You can remove the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; part for a closer cut.</li>
            <li> I like it. I though not 100% safe trimming but much better than other ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Keeps wifey neatly trimmed, as it should be!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it. i m happy shes happy.&lt;br /&gt;shes gone through a bunch to find the right one.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was totally what I expected and I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Easy to use. Easy to clean. It does a great job of trimming to the same length.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked. It trimmed just as much as I wanted. I actually bought this trimmer a second time after the first one broke after a few months because the batteries leaked. With the second one I took out the batteries between each use. Still broke after less than a year. Maybe that is how long they are expected to work because it&#x27;s still not a bad price for the use I got out of it. Still, I&#x27;m hoping to find a different product that will last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this twice. The first one lasted over a year... And I&#x27;m pretty sure I got it wet, leading to its demise. I bought it again because the price is fab, and it does everything I need it to do, allowing me to shave at different lengths.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. I have had this at least a year and it has done as the description says and held up to previous reviews. I have only had to change the batteries once or twice.</li>
            <li> Quality product-works well!</li>
            <li> This is great, the adjustable trimmer head stays in place and is well suited. P.S I also bought AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack) Pre-charged.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this shaver is it does not cut me! I have had many bikini trimmers in the past and they have always cut me and left me bleeding! Not to mention I have had this one for several years and it still works flawless! I highly recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li> The battery operation is the best part. Lasts a long time and powerful cut. The re-charge razors never held-up after repeated charges.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has lasted me many years.  It&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to trim to various lengths.  Keep in mind that it won&#x27;t give you a completely smooth shave, but if you just want to trim this product is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does just what it says it will. Powerful enough, yet also gentle enough. The size and shape are convenient.</li>
            <li> This is not the best bikini trimmer I have ever had...  the trim is slightly large and the guard does not really capture as much of the hair as I&#x27;d like, yet without the guard it takes off too much. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. It is a bit too wide. I prefer the models that are the size of a pen, used often for bikini line and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am not a serious biniki trimmer-type girl, but I found this product to do wonders! It&#x27;s small and easy to handle. It really gives you a close shave without going completely bald. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Holding up thus far but it it has had only four uses.</li>
            <li> Having used other body hair trimmers and razors, I can say at this price point, this is the best. I used to cut my junk trying to get a close buzz with other clippers. These are real gentle and made for your sensitive areas. No cuts, and a very pleasant shave. This will not get to the skin but will allow you to trim, edge, and provide a pretty short buzz cut where applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a MAN, and use this clipper on my chest, stomach, and junk. It&#x27;s a $20 solution for body hair.</li>
            <li> It does the job but I wish it could shave closer. So, I want to try maybe a men&#x27;s electric razor so maybe I could skip the shaving part when I use this.</li>
            <li> Would be better if it trimmed a little closer to the skin. I like that it uses alkaline batteries. My prior trimmer was rechargeable so when it died it could not be resurrected.</li>
            <li> so easy to get a nice, clean trim. love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I used to use a razor, which would give me horrible red bumps that made me look like a had some STD or something.  Even if I trimmed the hair with scissors before shaving..  Well I was letting my hair grow for a while so I could avoid getting more ugly bumps.  Then I came across this.  Just one shave and it gets everything!  No bumps or bleeding!  Not to mention, I&#x27;m not itchy or prickly like razors make me.  Everything looks even and neat with about 1mm left of hair.  You could go completely bare by going over that with a razor, but this looks pretty good in my opinion.  Also love how you can shave dry, so you can touch up whenever.  I&#x27;m 21 and a virgin, but I was always self conscious about my hair down there.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with it anymore!</li>
