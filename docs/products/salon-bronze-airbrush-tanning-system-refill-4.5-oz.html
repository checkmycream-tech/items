            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My favorite tanner!  </li>
            <li>This Salon airbrush was so easy to use!</li>
            <li>I like to be able to spread the product with the applicator to prevent any streaks.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times and find it to be the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>so be sure to buy refills.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to Tan more.</li>
            <li>Shower is usually best since you can just rinse the walls off later.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product multiple times and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Was very excited to see this</li>
            <li>Finally a real healthy alternative that looks like real tan.</li>
            <li>And such a good price!</li>
            <li>dries very quick  Cons-  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, you just shake and spray.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t too strong of a smell  </li>
            <li>This product is messy, does not apply evenly and the end result is not the best color.</li>
            <li>am really light skinned and this is not too orange.&lt;br /&gt;xoxox</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners throughout the years and this one works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind cleaning the mess up, this product is great and cheap.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it, it&#x27;s my quick fix for tanning.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this is quick, easy, and works great with the spray gun attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>after trying many different products i finally found one that does not make me look orange, it makes me look nice and tanned in a bronze color</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system and this is the 2nd refill I love it!  </li>
            <li>Its not difficult to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more upset over the response I got from this company, who is selling an item that was obviously defective when it was sent out (shelf life should be more than 1 month long).</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and gives a very natural color.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have much to show for it</li>
            <li>If you really follow directions then you&#x27;ll like this airbrush tanning</li>
            <li>This stuff is legit, looks real, not orange, and lasts.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a tan that looks pretty natural, I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>If you need a new tanner try the airbrush system!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the different climate changes during shipping have anything to do with it, but the product came out super runny and just an over all disaster.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my face in the summer when I already have a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, very natural color stays on well and for the amount of money</li>
            <li>I would recommend rubbing the product in with a makeup applicator instead of spraying directly on and hoping it lays evenly.</li>
            <li>Product was old.</li>
            <li>I tried again, sure enough the spray continued to come out green.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that creates a natural tan on my face.  </li>

            <li> Like your toilet.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the item was minimal and I really don&#x27;t care about the money or having to scrub green spray off of my leg.</li>
            <li> Unless you don&#x27;t mind cleaning up a mess, outside application is in order.</li>
            <li> so this bronzer gives it a little extra glow without risking sun damage.</li>
            <li> there is very little in the can  simply not enough color after using it, put in all the time to use it</li>
            <li> Price is much less than other product and works as well.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can turn objects around where you spray green.  </li>
            <li> came with the gon spray the other one made me look green</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it, I noticed a dark olive green tint spray to my leg.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you do it in the shower because it does make a mess.</li>
            <li> and I saved a little money by avoiding the salon price....</li>
            <li> you should still rub it in a little to avoid streaks</li>
            <li> Had turned green and spray gun malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li> It was dried out and didnt work.</li>
            <li> I was approximately two days over their 30 day money back time period.</li>
            <li> I can find it for the same price at Sally Beauty and would expect it to be a little less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is very little in the can</li>
            <li> It was also twice the price that I usually pay for it.</li>
            <li> Two days later, I received an email explaining how sorry they were, but how they could not refund my costs because I was over 30 days from date of purchase.  </li>
            <li> It seems hard to find.  </li>
            <li> it was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> It wipes off though, just be wary of the green overspray or you&#x27;re going to have some funky fake tan feet (lay a towel down and mind your footing placement)</li>
            <li> so I had to wait to use it, approximately 32 days from the date I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was not happy!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment</li>
            <li> I use to use this about 5 years ago and was disappointed that they discontinued selling it.</li>

            <li> I use to use this about 5 years ago and was disappointed that they discontinued selling it. Was very excited to see this</li>
            <li> so i have used many fake tanning products over the years but this product just doesn&#x27;t work.   Pros-  isn&#x27;t too strong of a smell  dries very quick  Cons-  there is very little in the can  simply not enough color after using it, put in all the time to use it and you don&#x27;t have much to show for it</li>
            <li> You can get this product for $8 at your local Sally Beauty Supply. I would expect it to be cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you really follow directions then you&#x27;ll like this airbrush tanning system- but if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can turn objects around where you spray green.  Like your toilet.  It wipes off though, just be wary of the green overspray or you&#x27;re going to have some funky fake tan feet (lay a towel down and mind your footing placement)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am very pale and this is quick, easy, and works great with the spray gun attachment. The only reason that I am giving this three stars is because of the price. I can find it for the same price at Sally Beauty and would expect it to be a little less expensive on Amazon. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a tan that looks pretty natural, I would recommend giving this a try. I would recommend rubbing the product in with a makeup applicator instead of spraying directly on and hoping it lays evenly. I like to be able to spread the product with the applicator to prevent any streaks. Will buy again, but at the store in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and find it to be the best I have tried. It gives you some instant color and deepens overnight.  It dries quickly and gives a very natural color. There is very little in the can so be sure to buy refills. 1 tan per can!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it once a week, very natural color stays on well and for the amount of money your spending it is a great product. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I really have no complaints. I will continue using it, it&#x27;s my quick fix for tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve canceled my membership to my local salon. This stuff is legit, looks real, not orange, and lasts. It doesn&#x27;t stink, and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes permanently. Finally a real healthy alternative that looks like real tan.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face in the summer when I already have a little bit of a tan. I use sunscreen daily on my face so this bronzer gives it a little extra glow without risking sun damage.</li>
            <li> after trying many different products i finally found one that does not make me look orange, it makes me look nice and tanned in a bronze color</li>
            <li> Do it yourself spray tan with no streaking. Its not difficult to do and I saved a little money by avoiding the salon price.... I just wish one bottle lasted a bit longer .</li>
            <li> Excellent results with this item easy use perfect color though i had problem with the one came with the gon spray the other one made me look green</li>
            <li> Product was old. Had turned green and spray gun malfunctioned.  I have used this product for years. What a disappointment</li>
            <li> It was dried out and didnt work. It was also twice the price that I usually pay for it. it was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making this product.  It seems hard to find.  It is the only product that creates a natural tan on my face.  The others turn my face yellow or orange.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Salon Bronze Airbrush Canister for my upcoming trip to Las Vegas. It was just 32 days from the date received when I applied it to my skin for my vacation. The product only maintains a tan look for up to 7 days so I had to wait to use it, approximately 32 days from the date I received it in the mail. I followed the directions on the can and used my airbrush gun to apply the contents. As soon as I applied it, I noticed a dark olive green tint spray to my leg. I tried again, sure enough the spray continued to come out green. My lower leg looked great if I was going to a Halloween Party as \\&quot;Miss Poison Ivy\\&quot;. I was not happy! I contacted the seller immediately through Amazon&#x27;s email correspondence, explained my trip situation and the results the product they sold me, produced. Two days later, I received an email explaining how sorry they were, but how they could not refund my costs because I was over 30 days from date of purchase.  I explained that the product only lasts for up to 7 days after application and I was using it for my trip. I&#x27;m more upset over the response I got from this company, who is selling an item that was obviously defective when it was sent out (shelf life should be more than 1 month long). I was approximately two days over their 30 day money back time period. The cost of the item was minimal and I really don&#x27;t care about the money or having to scrub green spray off of my leg. I just think that people should know this company sold a defective item and did not gaurantee it. Buyers Beware!</li>
            <li> My favorite tanner!  And such a good price! If you need a new tanner try the airbrush system!  It is great!</li>
            <li> This Salon airbrush was so easy to use! We already bought a refill! Cant wait to Tan more. Totally awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is messy, does not apply evenly and the end result is not the best color. Unless you don&#x27;t mind cleaning up a mess, outside application is in order.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole system and this is the 2nd refill I love it!  Like any self tanner you should still rub it in a little to avoid streaks but I think in the last 6 months of using, I left 1 streak that I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that you should do it somewhere, that you won&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want stained.  Shower is usually best since you can just rinse the walls off later.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product multiple times and I am very happy with it.  I have used many self tanners throughout the years and this one works really well.  It is easy to use, you just shake and spray.  I would recommend that you do it in the shower because it does make a mess. If you don&#x27;t mind cleaning the mess up, this product is great and cheap.</li>
            <li> My skin is so &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t get out in the sun to get tanned as I did before because of being burned.  The project works well.  Price is much less than other product and works as well.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item in the store and it worked great. The order I placed on here was not the same quality at all. Don&#x27;t know if the different climate changes during shipping have anything to do with it, but the product came out super runny and just an over all disaster. I will be getting it from the store from now on.</li>
            <li> This is great, if you know how to apply it.  Don&#x27;t spray it to close or you&#x27;ll have a brown blob.  This works great for me!</li>
            <li> great product good color not runny and stays on almost three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I am really light skinned and this is not too orange.&lt;br /&gt;xoxox</li>
