            <li> This 6 pack was a great value!</li>
            <li> my favorite lip treatment cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years young and I have used lip protectants for a very long time and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve NEVER used a better lip balm then this formula.  Heaven in a tube.  I live in Sedona AZ and the dryness can almost be a killer for my lips...till now.  I use it every night before bed and my lips have never felt better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this formula as long as Nivea NEVER stops making or changes the formula.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this chapstick. It makes my lips look good and lasts me a very long time. Some days it works better than others depending on how chapped I am. I guess only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long on the lips.</li>

            <li> helps keep my lips moistured</li>
            <li> my favorite lip balm. its smooth and not clumpy. I don&#x27;t like the flavored ones that are coming out. I hope they keep making this product forever!</li>
            <li> wow! This thing really suck! I mean i do not have chjapped or dry lips but now they are dry and flaky. I usually use Chapstick lipbalm and this is more than twice the proce. WOW  just wow! My poor lips!!!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> Some people think all Chapstick is the same.  It&#x27;s not this leaves your lips kissably smooth.  My fiance got two for her stocking and I bought two of my own to keep you lips just as soft as hers.</li>
            <li> i am a huge lip balm snob.  this is by far the best one i&#x27;ve ever used.  i have a stick in my purse, in my make-up bag, next to my bed, on my desk, in my car...  everywhere!</li>
            <li> These are the only lip balms I use. Better than the other brands, in my opinion. It goes on smooth, even when my lips are dry and chapped. Keeps them moist and smooth. I can&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I finally just bought a bunch of it and will have it for years. The top attaches nicely. I keep it in my pocket. It doesn&#x27;t get as soft as regular chap stick does in my pocket.</li>
            <li> My second time purchasing because it&#x27;s a great product, saved my flaky lips and it&#x27;s also spf 15!</li>
            <li> This makes my lips so smooth and hydrated! I have tried so many lip products (EOS, Smooth Lips, etc.) but none work as well for me as the Nivea lip products. It has a light scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> If I were stranded on a desert island and could take only one thing... it would be this!  Totally addicted.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lip balm! It has a nice, light smell and keeps my lips super hydrated during the day. This also contains SPF 15, which helps protect my lips from the sun which is an awesome bonus. Super lightweight on the lips and glides on smoothly without applying any force.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I love it! Makes your lips look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> No color and no scent and no taste which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My one and only lip care stick.  I have been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything else.  Always buy six at a time and put them everywhere.  It works well under lipstick as well.</li>
            <li> the best moisurizing lip care available.  I use it numerous times per day.</li>
            <li> Great product for daily use.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm around.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING, WE RECOMENT ALLWAYS, FIVE STARS +++++A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt my favorite lip product.  I buy in bulk and keep one in every room of the house, in my purse and in my office desk drawer.  I hate the taste of other chap sticks and lip balms, so this is pretty much my one and only go-to product.  It leaves my lips feeling silky smooth and has the extra added benefit of containing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the only chapstick I will use.  I live in Boston and this winter was rough!  Throughout the winter I used this chapstick and my lips stayed smooth and did not crack once.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
