            <li>GOOD  PRICE  </li>
            <li>AND  GOOD  QUALITY</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good strap I just wish it would have came with the nasal piece.</li>
            <li>works great, very comfortable</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it too!  </li>
            <li>So now I just get up and enjoy the morning and my rest of the day is great.  </li>
            <li>Well, some of us fall asleep during our nightly routine and it&#x27;s nice to know we are covered.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for the original equipment.</li>
            <li>This is far the best mask I used for CPAP.</li>
            <li>No matter how many adjustments I made to the head and chin strap, I could not get a good fit.  </li>
            <li>It is ok they reduced the size of the inlet pipe from what I had before</li>
            <li>but it is ok.</li>
            <li>This mask is definitely the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Needed to read better - was expecting the nose pillows to come with it.  </li>
            <li>I am able to read in bed with this on.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a mouth breather, the chin strap isn&#x27;t really enough but for me it&#x27;s the best mask</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as described and was glad to find this the one I got from Apria through my insurance company got a tear in the tube.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Love Amazon.\\</li>
            <li>I do NOT put it in the dryer but lay the strapping on top of the dryer when it&#x27;s drying the load of clothes</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this mask and it worked well for 3 nights.  </li>
            <li>Better design than the one I was using, but could be better.  </li>
            <li>Love this setup.  </li>
            <li>i feel much better since i use this thing, very light and easy to install and to get use to it.</li>
            <li>Great product at 1/4 of the normal price.</li>
            <li>The best AHI i was able to achieve with other masks was 4.6 with a nasal mask.</li>
            <li>It works well and can be adjusted to fit most people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more comfortable for my nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li>Better geometry than the original.</li>
            <li>More comfortable materials and a better chin grip, even with a full beard.</li>
            <li>5 out of 5 easily.  </li>
            <li>used this type and brand for sometime most comfortable fit for me</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, had hoped for using as a replacement for chin strap, but not quite as effective for chin support</li>
            <li>This one was cheaper, and is made fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect little kit.good price, thank god some compagnie take care of us....</li>
            <li>This is a great, low cost option for a cpap mask.</li>
            <li>This head gear is light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is quiete, comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li>This headgear doesn&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a lightweight, comfortable combination in CPAP equipment.</li>
            <li>the This one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You have to buy the nasal pillows separately, but those are cheap.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, loved the chin strap,  but my nose was irritated from the silicon, so I went back to the full face mask.</li>
            <li>so we are already aware how comfortable this item is !</li>
            <li>Just like the original mask from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>this is a comfortable support band , quick shipper .</li>
            <li>better than the first full mask i stated with  but decided to go with optillfe cushions  which dont put alot of pressure on your forhead or temples</li>
            <li>I unless you have a huge nose with very large nostrils order either the small or medium pads, once you know which is best order extras.</li>
            <li>I normally use Swift LT nasal pillows which sometimes leak because the light weigh construction, but the Swift LT is very comfortable compared to the OptiLife.  </li>
            <li>This product may be fine for the right person.  </li>
            <li>I had a nearly full face mask:</li>
            <li>Was using a full face mask before which worked, but was problematic with my beard.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over I would just buy a full mask.</li>
            <li>thanks i will be ordering more cpap accessories through this si te</li>
            <li>I am currently most comfortable so far with the separate chin strap and pillow head gear.</li>
            <li>quick delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>Tried it last night for the first time and after only a couple of adjustments it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>By far, the best mask I have used due to its comfortability and built in chin strap.  </li>
            <li>Everyone at work the next day will be able to tell you got sleep the night before!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty much silent and much more comfortable than it looks, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a scuba mask to bed.  </li>
            <li>Not because they wear out, and you just don&#x27;t need the hassles of finding the right ones again.</li>
            <li>Switch to the full mask mask recently and so many leaks and was having 16 AHI.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many varieties of full masks, nasal masks, nasal cushions and pillows, but this mask with the medium Optilife cradle cushion is the combination I keep going back to</li>
            <li>I am not a satisfied, happy customer.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great option for those of us on a budget that need a new mask.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t require much to seal, so go light.</li>
            <li>Currently held together with good old duct tape.</li>
            <li>I wash the pillow pretty much every day with mild soap and water, takes about a minute maybe.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again, exactly what I wanted and very fast shipping...</li>
            <li>I love the open face feature.</li>
            <li>I am in my first months of using a cpap machine.</li>
            <li>so comfort over rules non flexible even though the OptiLife is better for CPAP pressure above 15.  </li>
            <li>But with the leaks I found it better to reduce my pressure back to 15 and use the Swift LT.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>thanx exact replacement accessories</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cpap masks I could open my on store.</li>
            <li>It is so much more comfortable and much less intrusive.  </li>
            <li>I like this headgear, especially because it is easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a fairly large guy,</li>
            <li>It is really to large for my head and has to be tightened beyond the manufactures intentions.</li>
            <li>This works great, and uses less pressure to get the same result.</li>
            <li>But in short this mask keeps my Chin in place and easily allows me to breathe very well.  </li>
            <li>Everything is great except I can not get the chin strap tight enough.</li>
            <li>Thanks, it is so needed.</li>
            <li>Thought it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I needed to do something fast</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I like and appreciate this mask.  </li>
            <li>This Ã­tem Goes very well with my cpap machine</li>
            <li>Delivered as promised and the correct item, thanks.</li>
            <li>I tried the full face when I was first diagnosed with sleep apnea after my initial sleep test.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new mask for my c-pap machine and they had the exact one that I needed.</li>
            <li>Went back to my previous headgear as more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have not found a better, lighter, less intrusive mask with a chin strap in two years.  </li>
            <li>this works so much better for me than the face mask I had previously,</li>
            <li>With a little adjusting of the straps, it fits very comfortably, and I sleep without noticing it.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts as long as the original.</li>
            <li>The price of this is much to high</li>
            <li>Chin strap is for fit not for keeping your mouth closed.</li>
            <li>I not found one that is comfortable but will keep my mouth closed.  </li>
            <li>As noted by many others, the chin strap isn&#x27;t back far enough to stay on.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what I wanted and sooo much cheaper than going to a medical supply store in my area even with insurance!</li>
            <li>People that say its cheap or poor quality must want a huge bulky think.</li>
            <li>The system has a very loud whistle when the CPAP is on.  </li>
            <li>Only fits one way, which exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>new mask is a big improvement  thanks.</li>
            <li>Very quick to adjust to various head sizes, I found I had it adjusted and ready to go in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Very Bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and used it for the last 10 days:&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>The nasal pillows rested firmly on my upper lip which was also very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My old one</li>
            <li>I use the medium pillows (not included but can be found on Amazon) and was surprised by how they work.</li>
            <li>Then I found this one, wow what a difference it has made.</li>
            <li>I would be twisting all different ways until I finally got it right.  </li>
            <li>I wear a full face mask and wanted something less bulky.  </li>
            <li>Works about as expected, not a bad price overall.</li>
            <li>I have tried 2 diffemt full face masks and one hybrid with little lick.</li>
            <li>highly recommend - especially for side sleepers.</li>
            <li>the new one was the same as the old one.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Performance is nearly the same</li>
            <li>I tried to sleep with the noise but gave up after a couple hours and went back to my old system of a separate chin strap and head gear.</li>
            <li>first couple of days I had it too tight and woke up with a sore nose.</li>
            <li>Truly forgot it was on my head the first few nights.</li>
            <li>Nasal pillows are the only thing missing, but are not expensive.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I like and appreciate this mask.  </li>
            <li> This Ã­tem Goes very well with my cpap machine</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and the correct item, thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried the full face when I was first diagnosed with sleep apnea after my initial sleep test.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new mask for my c-pap machine and they had the exact one that I needed.</li>
            <li> Went back to my previous headgear as more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better, lighter, less intrusive mask with a chin strap in two years.  </li>
            <li> this works so much better for me than the face mask I had previously,</li>
            <li> With a little adjusting of the straps, it fits very comfortably, and I sleep without noticing it.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the original.</li>
            <li> The price of this is much to high</li>
            <li> Chin strap is for fit not for keeping your mouth closed.</li>
            <li> I not found one that is comfortable but will keep my mouth closed.  </li>
            <li> As noted by many others, the chin strap isn&#x27;t back far enough to stay on.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted and sooo much cheaper than going to a medical supply store in my area even with insurance!</li>
            <li> People that say its cheap or poor quality must want a huge bulky think.</li>
            <li> The system has a very loud whistle when the CPAP is on.  </li>
            <li> Only fits one way, which exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> new mask is a big improvement  thanks.</li>
            <li> Very quick to adjust to various head sizes, I found I had it adjusted and ready to go in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Very Bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and used it for the last 10 days:&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> The nasal pillows rested firmly on my upper lip which was also very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> My old one</li>
            <li> I use the medium pillows (not included but can be found on Amazon) and was surprised by how they work.</li>
            <li> Then I found this one, wow what a difference it has made.</li>
            <li> I would be twisting all different ways until I finally got it right.  </li>
            <li> I wear a full face mask and wanted something less bulky.  </li>
            <li> Works about as expected, not a bad price overall.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 diffemt full face masks and one hybrid with little lick.</li>
            <li> highly recommend - especially for side sleepers.</li>
            <li> the new one was the same as the old one.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Performance is nearly the same</li>
            <li> I tried to sleep with the noise but gave up after a couple hours and went back to my old system of a separate chin strap and head gear.</li>
            <li> first couple of days I had it too tight and woke up with a sore nose.</li>
            <li> Truly forgot it was on my head the first few nights.</li>
            <li> Nasal pillows are the only thing missing, but are not expensive.</li>
            <li> Does not wake me up in the middle of the night by slipping out of place.</li>
            <li> Have trouble with chin dropping down during sleep causing extremely high leaks.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually dry at the end of the cycle.  </li>
            <li> The chin strap on this gear is not substantial enough to keep chin from dropping down.</li>
            <li> and I got it for much less than the medical supply company was charging.</li>
            <li> It is a break from the mask that covers your whole nasal area including your cheeks and very close to the eyes, which gets very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Thought the headgear chinstrap would help keep mouth closed, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Whenever they let an accountant get involved the customer suffer as they cheapen the product to make a few extra cents.</li>
            <li> closed too, and now my AHI is 1.1 now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model since 2010 as it&#x27;s so minimally intrusive.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this mask works for lots of people, but it is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the chin strap is useless and doesn&#x27;t actually do much for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is less intrusive than other head sets I have tried.</li>
            <li> It stopped the snoring and noise from air escaping the mouth, but is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This headgear is not very comfortable because there is not much flex or give but it does hold the nasal adapters very tightly.  </li>
            <li> I have a half dozen pieces of equipment trying to get that one that will do the job, that I can use thru the night.</li>
            <li> My wife says I look less like a space man now.  </li>
            <li> I did not use the hose that came with the sub-assembly: I prefer my previous, fatter hose.  </li>
            <li> The other design flaw is the venting comes straight out blowing cold air in the wife&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> Bet of all nothing feels like it has to be so tight to stay on an not leak air.</li>
            <li> Side tracked a little there.  </li>
            <li> I had to dismantle and figure out how to bypass the narrow hose with tape.</li>
            <li> A waste of money IMHO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely reccommend this to anyone tired of wearing the octopus on your face at night.</li>
            <li> concept one size does not fit all!</li>
            <li> It is small and well made.</li>
            <li> The chin strap itself doesn&#x27;t stay in place for me, and was continually slipping over my chin and adding to the already frustrating issue of breaking the seal.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this mask for about 2 weeks, constantly making adjustments to see where I was going wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a small face and even though I can and do use this item.  </li>
            <li> Not a good item</li>
            <li> The mask is awkward and not very comfortable at times.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend not to buy this as it is poorly constructed and will not do the job to support the chin if you are a mouth breather.</li>
            <li> Much less &#x27;claustrophobic&#x27; in a sense, not to mention it was about the cheapest set up for a mask that I found across all three types.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they have narrowed the tube that is attached which leads to noise as you breathe in.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again unfortunately.</li>
            <li> But since it is not forgiving it will leak badly because the non flexible nose piece moves when you roll you head over against the pillow.  </li>
            <li> I was shopping for a replacement mask for my Cpap machine and was sick of air escaping from the sides of the mask.  </li>
            <li> I was so hopping this would put it all in one, but was severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless piece of equipment and the worst disappointment of any strap I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought the insulated hose cover to get rid of that annoying noise when I roll over.  </li>
            <li> My full-face mask was horrible, gave me claustrophobia and kept my wife awake with the Darth Vader noise.  </li>

            <li> This product may be fine for the right person.  I can only comment on my personal satisfaction.  It did not meet my expectations.  No matter how many adjustments I made to the head and chin strap, I could not get a good fit.  The chin strap would not stay in place, so I was constantly trying to adjust it every time I woke up.  It&#x27;s just not as robust as I thought it would be when I saw it online.</li>
            <li> Works great. You must be a side-sleeper (or on your back) to wear this style. It leaves super-sweet grooves on the side of your face in the morning. Everyone at work the next day will be able to tell you got sleep the night before!</li>
            <li> I use this head gear every night. It was time to replace it. the new one was the same as the old one.</li>
            <li> ONLY ONE I USE, THE REST ARE UNCONFORTABLE</li>
            <li> RETURNED PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR MY MACHINE.</li>
            <li> Good deal. Will use them again.</li>
            <li> I have had this mask before. Unfortunately, they have narrowed the tube that is attached which leads to noise as you breathe in.  I had to dismantle and figure out how to bypass the narrow hose with tape.</li>
            <li> Fits well I love the open face feature. It&#x27;s non- restrictive. I also like how the nasal attachment are secured to the tube.</li>
            <li> Thought the headgear chinstrap would help keep mouth closed, but it didn&#x27;t. Went back to my previous headgear as more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is ok they reduced the size of the inlet pipe from what I had before but it is ok. Whenever they let an accountant get involved the customer suffer as they cheapen the product to make a few extra cents.</li>
            <li> This is a great, low cost option for a cpap mask. It works well and can be adjusted to fit most people. My main complaint is the chin strap is useless and doesn&#x27;t actually do much for you. Other than that it is a great option for those of us on a budget that need a new mask.</li>
            <li> This head gear is light and comfortable. When this one wears out I will buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;It is less intrusive than other head sets I have tried.</li>
            <li> Will buy again, exactly what I wanted and very fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I had a nearly full face mask: It covered my Nose and Mouth:&lt;br /&gt;First Night I had to get up 3-4 times but over time I got used to it but still woke up 2-3 times a night: Very Bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and used it for the last 10 days:&lt;br /&gt;First night I slept the entire 8 hours, second and following nights were all non-stop sleeping!&lt;br /&gt;When I schedule my alarm for say 5am, my body must sense it and I wake up at 4:55am like clock work.  I mention this because when I&#x27;m wearing the this OptiLife I wake up at 4:55 and feel Awesome. The problem is that if I go back to sleep for another hour (weekends) I wake up groggy and sleepy. So now I just get up and enjoy the morning and my rest of the day is great.  Side tracked a little there.  But in short this mask keeps my Chin in place and easily allows me to breathe very well.  I bought the insulated hose cover to get rid of that annoying noise when I roll over.  5 out of 5 easily.  For the price give this product a try, people warned me that since it enters the nose only, that my mouth would open: It does not-the chin strap prevents that.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FEEL AS RESTRICTIVE ON MY FACE AS THE WASP HEADGEAR.. I SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING UP TO ADJUST THE MASK..</li>
            <li> I am in my first months of using a cpap machine. I have a half dozen pieces of equipment trying to get that one that will do the job, that I can use thru the night. I am currently most comfortable so far with the separate chin strap and pillow head gear. I was so hopping this would put it all in one, but was severely disappointed. The chin strap did not do the job at all. The nasal pillows rested firmly on my upper lip which was also very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Good concept one size does not fit all!</li>
            <li> I have tried six or seven different mask since I got my C pap machine last summer.  This mask is definitely the best yet.  It is so much more comfortable and much less intrusive.  My wife says I look less like a space man now.  So that can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Needed to read better - was expecting the nose pillows to come with it.  Have to order separately.</li>
            <li> Everything is great except I can not get the chin strap tight enough. I am able to read in bed with this on. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 diffemt full face masks and one hybrid with little lick. This is Great! It is small and well made. People that say its cheap or poor quality must want a huge bulky think. This is quiete, comfortable and convenient. I have a beard and mustache and this doesn&#x27;t leak at all. I sleep on my side and still it doesn&#x27;t leak. This is the besti have found yet. Everything it advertised. Nasal pillow is seperate.</li>
            <li> Chin strap is a joke. Would have returned if I could have did not work for me. Not a good item</li>
            <li> this is a comfortable support band , quick shipper . It&#x27;s a replacement so we are already aware how comfortable this item is !</li>
            <li> This headgear doesn&#x27;t fit my face. As noted by many others, the chin strap isn&#x27;t back far enough to stay on. A waste of money IMHO.</li>
            <li> Was using a full face mask before which worked, but was problematic with my beard. This works great, and uses less pressure to get the same result. If you&#x27;re a mouth breather, the chin strap isn&#x27;t really enough but for me it&#x27;s the best mask I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of days I had it too tight and woke up with a sore nose. It really doesn&#x27;t require much to seal, so go light.</li>
            <li> Bought in March 2015, tube tore and became unusable in August 2015. Currently held together with good old duct tape. Poor quality. A must have item for the Respironic unit though. I am not a satisfied, happy customer. Will buy again unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This headgear is not very comfortable because there is not much flex or give but it does hold the nasal adapters very tightly.  But since it is not forgiving it will leak badly because the non flexible nose piece moves when you roll you head over against the pillow.  I normally use Swift LT nasal pillows which sometimes leak because the light weigh construction, but the Swift LT is very comfortable compared to the OptiLife.  Performance is nearly the same so comfort over rules non flexible even though the OptiLife is better for CPAP pressure above 15.  But with the leaks I found it better to reduce my pressure back to 15 and use the Swift LT.</li>
            <li> used this type and brand for sometime most comfortable fit for me</li>
            <li> Just like the original mask from the manufacturer. Easiest mask to wear. Try it, you will love it too!  ð</li>
            <li> Better geometry than the original. More comfortable materials and a better chin grip, even with a full beard. Truly forgot it was on my head the first few nights.</li>
            <li> switched from the old-school &amp;#34;oxygen mask&amp;#34; type to this &amp;#34;nose pillows&amp;#34; version.  It&#x27;s much more comfortable for my nose and forehead.  With a little adjusting of the straps, it fits very comfortably, and I sleep without noticing it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, had hoped for using as a replacement for chin strap, but not quite as effective for chin support</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement for another type of nasal cushion mask. This one was cheaper, and is made fine. No issues with quality or anything. My problem is with the fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fairly large guy, and I like the idea of this mask having a chin strap to help hold things in place (others I have tried lack this feature). This, however, proved to be its downfall for me. The chin strap itself doesn&#x27;t stay in place for me, and was continually slipping over my chin and adding to the already frustrating issue of breaking the seal. I tried to use this mask for about 2 weeks, constantly making adjustments to see where I was going wrong. In the end, I just gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this mask works for lots of people, but it is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks, it is so needed. Different than what I was used to having. Thank you for good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;November</li>
            <li> works great, very comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as described and was glad to find this the one I got from Apria through my insurance company got a tear in the tube.  Thought it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I do like this item.  It is well constructed.  It was a GREAT price and it works perfectly!  I have a small face and even though I can and do use this item.  It is really to large for my head and has to be tightened beyond the manufactures intentions.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and I got it for much less than the medical supply company was charging.</li>
            <li> Great Deal.  Perfect Fit</li>
            <li> This is far the best mask I used for CPAP. The best AHI i was able to achieve with other masks was 4.6 with a nasal mask. The nasal mask wasn&#x27;t getting my AHI below 4. Switch to the full mask mask recently and so many leaks and was having 16 AHI. I needed to do something fast so I brought this CPAP mask because i needed something to keep my mouth closed too, and now my AHI is 1.1 now.</li>
            <li> GOOD  PRICE  AND  GOOD  QUALITY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model since 2010 as it&#x27;s so minimally intrusive.  I tried the full face when I was first diagnosed with sleep apnea after my initial sleep test.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I like and appreciate this mask.  You can watch TV, read a book, (but still watch out when you sneeze as, well, you know).  Some people might argue and say,\\&quot;why would you want to wear it when you read a book at night, or watch TV?\\&quot; Well, some of us fall asleep during our nightly routine and it&#x27;s nice to know we are covered.  I use the medium pillows, (which this does NOT come with any) and have used the same pillow for over a year now.  I wash the pillow pretty much every day with mild soap and water, takes about a minute maybe.  I see we can now purchase the pillows here on Amazon as well.  \\&quot;Love Amazon.\\&quot; This is an EXCEPTIONALLY LOW price for this mask even without the pillows.  The chin strap keeps your mouth from opening up, (which the wife or GF might appreciate). I&#x27;ve noticed it does stretch out, both the chin strap and the lightweight strapping for the mask, but all you do is release the velcro, and tighten it back up.  I also wash the entire mask and strapping in the clothes washer 2 or 3 times a month.  I do NOT put it in the dryer but lay the strapping on top of the dryer when it&#x27;s drying the load of clothes and it&#x27;s usually dry at the end of the cycle.  I have not found a better, lighter, less intrusive mask with a chin strap in two years.  I&#x27;d definitely reccommend this to anyone tired of wearing the octopus on your face at night.</li>
            <li> Works about as expected, not a bad price overall. Very quick to adjust to various head sizes, I found I had it adjusted and ready to go in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it; I expect to continue using it for years.  I already knew what I was buying: it was a replacement for my current nasal mask.  It did exactly what I expected.  I did not use the hose that came with the sub-assembly: I prefer my previous, fatter hose.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I wear a full face mask and wanted something less bulky.  I love the idea of this mask and it worked well for 3 nights.  Very light weight, loved the chin strap,  but my nose was irritated from the silicon, so I went back to the full face mask. Had the irritation not happened, I&#x27;d still be using it every night.  Great product at 1/4 of the normal price.</li>
            <li> Perfect little kit.good price, thank god some compagnie take care of us....i feel much better since i use this thing, very light and easy to install and to get use to it.</li>
            <li> this works so much better for me than the face mask I had previously, that I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  highly recommend - especially for side sleepers.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted and sooo much cheaper than going to a medical supply store in my area even with insurance!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a lightweight, comfortable combination in CPAP equipment. I have not found any negatives about this product after a month of nightly use.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless piece of equipment and the worst disappointment of any strap I have used. It provides no support for the chin and as a physician I recommend not to buy this as it is poorly constructed and will not do the job to support the chin if you are a mouth breather. The price of this is much to high and I was fooled by the reports others had given.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for the original equipment. I hope it lasts as long as the original. Great deal and great shippping</li>
            <li> I like this headgear, especially because it is easy to maneuver.  Only fits one way, which exactly what I need.  My old one I would be twisting all different ways until I finally got it right.  I purchase the nasal pillows to go with it and they fit perfectly.  It is a break from the mask that covers your whole nasal area including your cheeks and very close to the eyes, which gets very uncomfortable.  This one does NOT push in towards your eyes and only address the nose itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.Jackson</li>
            <li> It stopped the snoring and noise from air escaping the mouth, but is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Was searching for a headgear with chinstrap.  Have trouble with chin dropping down during sleep causing extremely high leaks.  The chin strap on this gear is not substantial enough to keep chin from dropping down.</li>
            <li> The mask is awkward and not very comfortable at times. If I had it to do over I would just buy a full mask.</li>
            <li> better than the first full mask i stated with  but decided to go with optillfe cushions  which dont put alot of pressure on your forhead or temples</li>
            <li> Tried it last night for the first time and after only a couple of adjustments it was a perfect fit. Chin strap is for fit not for keeping your mouth closed. I use the medium pillows (not included but can be found on Amazon) and was surprised by how they work. I&#x27;ve used Respironics products for years and I keep coming back to them.</li>
            <li> This Ã­tem Goes very well with my cpap machine thanx exact replacement accessories thanks i will be ordering more cpap accessories through this si te</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the price related to potential quality.  By far, the best mask I have used due to its comfortability and built in chin strap.  The chin strap does keep my mouth from opening when positioned correctly.  Seller met my expectations for delivery.  Nasal pillows are the only thing missing, but are not expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many varieties of full masks, nasal masks, nasal cushions and pillows, but this mask with the medium Optilife cradle cushion is the combination I keep going back to and I recommend it to anyone that is struggling to find a mask they can tolerate. I had just about given up on my machine until I decided to give this mask a try. Now I leave my mask on all night and my AHI is between 0 and .2 every night (monitored with Sleepy Head software) so it is working great for me.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> This is a big difference to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new mask is a big improvement  thanks.</li>
            <li> Good strap I just wish it would have came with the nasal piece.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and the correct item, thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cpap masks I could open my on store. Then I found this one, wow what a difference it has made. I don&#x27;t feel restricted like all the others do. I don&#x27;t wake up with indents all over my face. Bet of all nothing feels like it has to be so tight to stay on an not leak air. the This one is fantastic. Don&#x27;t forget to order the nose pads as they don&#x27;t come with this one. I unless you have a huge nose with very large nostrils order either the small or medium pads, once you know which is best order extras. Not because they wear out, and you just don&#x27;t need the hassles of finding the right ones again. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Better design than the one I was using, but could be better.  I not found one that is comfortable but will keep my mouth closed.  This comes the closest of any I have tried.  Does not wake me up in the middle of the night by slipping out of place.</li>
            <li> I needed a new mask for my c-pap machine and they had the exact one that I needed.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a replacement mask for my Cpap machine and was sick of air escaping from the sides of the mask.  So I looked at alternatives. This was sold for a very low price and the air doesn&#x27;t leak all the time. I&#x27;m happy with it. You have to buy the nasal pillows separately, but those are cheap.</li>
            <li> My full-face mask was horrible, gave me claustrophobia and kept my wife awake with the Darth Vader noise.  This thing is pretty much silent and much more comfortable than it looks, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a scuba mask to bed.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this setup.  Let&#x27;s you use the CPAP without feeling like you are drowning in the mask.  Much less &#x27;claustrophobic&#x27; in a sense, not to mention it was about the cheapest set up for a mask that I found across all three types.</li>
            <li> The system has a very loud whistle when the CPAP is on.  I tried to sleep with the noise but gave up after a couple hours and went back to my old system of a separate chin strap and head gear. The other design flaw is the venting comes straight out blowing cold air in the wife&#x27;s face.  If you donât mind the whistle and don&#x27;t have any one sleeping next to you, go for it.  Buyer beware once you buy it it&#x27;s yours, the company will not take it back. I am just going to throw mine away.</li>
