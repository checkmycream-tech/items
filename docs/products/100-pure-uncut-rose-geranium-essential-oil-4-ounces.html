            <li>so glad I needed to blend it to &amp;#34;sweeten and deepen&amp;#34; this scent because of the breathtaking price change!  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying to those of you reading this that if you are looking for Rose Oil or Geranium oil, this is not it!</li>
            <li>I find it pleasant &amp; relaxing.</li>
            <li>and my skin has honestly cleared up beautifully.</li>
            <li>Good price for good product.  </li>
            <li>Works good but needs to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li>I am keeping the product because it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive</li>
            <li>the good stuff.</li>
            <li>good price and works to keep the ticks off the dogs</li>
            <li>service is good.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.....works great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>Im exremely happy and will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>I did notice a momentary stinging sensation on my face after I added this rose geranium oil to my water mix, but it felt like it was doing something good</li>
            <li>There is some rose smell, but comes with some others that doesnâ€™t make a good combination.  </li>
            <li>Everything was perfect all the way around and also received my order very fast...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this EO, I diffuse it in a daytime blend I make to sorta wake up, but do so in a bower of roses!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s better than ticks!</li>
            <li>and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>It adds a beautiful rosy scent to my facial oil treatment, and it really is a great purchase for the price!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best rose geranium I have found!</li>
            <li>I was very glad for because out of the bottle I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but it really smelled great once it had been heated and infused with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>geranium oil was not \\&quot;rose geranium\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Nice, but I avoid synthetic fragrances at all costs.</li>
            <li>I did scrutinize this rose geranium</li>
            <li>the oil smells nice, I used it in my lavender geranium soap, turned out well...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still to he fair it&#x27;s lovely</li>
            <li>I purchase Rose Geranium oil from Enchnted Wilderness/Catey13 to ward off ticks.</li>
            <li>I would advise you to purchase your own pipettes in quantity(I purchase them for fish tanks, and they don&#x27;t hold up well, buy a lot) , or a glass dropper.</li>
            <li>Ipurchased rose geranium oil as a tick deterrent.  </li>
            <li>Predominantly rose aroma.</li>
            <li>This one has almost no Geranium smell, diluted with rose or&lt;br /&gt;whatever, hence the lower price.</li>
            <li>This geranium oil does, in fact, smell just as roselike as any rose you ever sniffed.</li>
            <li>This rose</li>
            <li>In any case, it smells quite nice, so I have to give it two stars.  </li>
            <li>I also mix with witch hazel and it makes a nice toner for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Just perfect and really smells like roses too</li>
            <li>I mix it with Rose oil that extend the life of it.</li>
            <li>The picture that was posted was a little misleading because 2 bottles are shown, but the price is very fair and the oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a special product that diffuses very nicely in the bath.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, and with a lot of nice rose scent.</li>
            <li>It makes our home smell great AND more importantly</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and very natural.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a whirl and add it to my lovely rose mint salve that I was perfecting.</li>
            <li>The sting dissipated after about 15-30 seconds, but the lovely smell lingered nicely.</li>
            <li>(makes me wonder if it is &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; like they say) and the scent smells more like roses than rose geraniumm .  </li>
            <li>I love rose geranium.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I love this rose geranium oil :)</li>
            <li>Rose geranium is a perfect oil for women reaching menopause or in post-menopause as it supports female function in aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>Good value--smells great, and does not irritate my daughters&#x27; skin (3 year old twins).  </li>
            <li>I received this quickly and loved it.  </li>
            <li>i love this oil, i use it in my soaps and skin care products.</li>
            <li>However it has a more rosy scent</li>
            <li>which is lovely-</li>
            <li>I have used it in the bath and it is quite lovely.  </li>
            <li>It has many homeopathic uses.</li>
            <li>Use on dogs too and they dont bring so many in the house.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from this seller many times and will continue to use them but wont</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it more because the product is not what it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So I feel this company needs to be more forthcoming with their advertisement.  </li>
            <li>I use it to make homemade bath bombs, deodorants, and anything and everything else I need to smell like roses  :)</li>
            <li>I recommend this manufacturer and I plan to use them again :)</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this oil</li>
            <li>It smelled so soft and lovely and the sent was strong in a very good way.</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing and definitely worthy of being used as a perfume, as well.  :)</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful aroma and lasts a long time without having to be used in overpowering amounts.</li>
            <li>It has a nice rosy kind of smell and the quality is pure.</li>
            <li>wish there were more info on where it comes from, and certification that it is unadulterated with anything like so many EO&#x27;s now (toxins, chemicals, fillers, etc)</li>
            <li>It does smell similar to my rose fragrance oil I use, but this one smells realer lol if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using it because my research indicated it is useful for deterring ticks from dogs, which appears to be true, and the added bonus is that my dog smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>it still smells just clean and flowery!</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for many uses, such as a non toxic floor cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and work with them alot, I tried this once and was happy with it, and have purchased it again since then ----</li>
            <li>This oil is 100% pure and potent!</li>
            <li>I have to have pure Rose Geranium oil in My house.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I received a free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; which was a sample of some synthetic perfume oil.</li>
            <li>Smells good with natural scent.</li>
            <li>a decent purchase, better than I had feared for sure</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using the rose geranium essential oil because it meets all my needs.  </li>
            <li>This smells better than the Moroccan Rose essential oil I ordered a while ago!!</li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for pure geranium, than its&lt;br /&gt;heavily diluted version.</li>
            <li>The orange oil compliments this one in that it gives just a tad hint of sweet citrus to a medium-heavy floral scent.</li>
            <li>I do believe it is the real deal, just not too sure.</li>
            <li>geranium oil is real and potent.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for a rose-like essential oil this would be best (if you can&#x27;t fork out $70 per 1/8oz for real rose essential oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller included a little pamphlet of recipes and uses.</li>
            <li>I received my first bottle of rose geranium essential oil and have enjoyed incorporating the oil into my products.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the potent smell, not too rosy, but definitely with rose floral notes.</li>
            <li>This Rose Geranium Oil is better than we expected.  </li>
            <li>Now foods actually has excellent essential oils for bargain prices!</li>
            <li>You must add it to a carrier oil/liquid because of the super concentration.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Rose Geranium Essential oil for my (HP) HOT PROCESS soap !!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll discover a new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Pretty feminine smell!</li>
            <li>A few drops on wool dryer balls adds a great scent to my clothes.</li>
            <li>Aromatic and has anti-fungal/ anti-mold properties useful to growers.</li>
            <li>Rose Geranium is a completely different plant.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my salves, and a rose facial cream I have a recipe for!</li>
            <li>Mixed with rose water and sprayed went in the woods</li>
            <li>While it does smell nice, it is nothing like the pure rose geranium that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>So I spread some on my hands and right ankle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this item is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item in the hopes to help my condition and even on the first day, I started to notice a difference immediately.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I added too much of the oil to my mix, but whatever I did, it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>I buy essential oils from many sources for my products.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL DEAL!  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that say the rose note is stronger than the geranium but is still pleasant, it has a very classic aroma to it (it almost smells as if you&#x27;ve got your face buried in a bouquet of REAL backyard-grown roses, though not quite as sweet-smelling which might be due to the gardenia note).</li>
            <li>this essential oil smells heavenly -- i love its unique, natural scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it is better than lyme disease, which my wife got last year.</li>
            <li>Made a 1# heart shaped soy candle and had to use 2 oz which is a lot more than normal for scents, essential or</li>
            <li>Though I do not know if it is pure.</li>
            <li>I just hope this is the REAL deal, not a fragrance oil, as it is not from a known brand.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smell is very rose-like.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal...</li>
            <li>It really works well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops of it into a mixture of rose water and witch hazel to help my skin.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t beat the price and fast shipping, also, it seems the shipper is very courteous, lending little notes in the box so that you know if you need personal attention, they are there for you, so yes, I would order again..</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I&#x27;m new to purchasing essential oils and have nothing to compare the quality to, but I will say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Then I sneak in any oils I may need physically, like peppermint, Cyprus and eucalyptus etc for my allergies and copd and chronic fatigue, but as long as half of the blend, roughly, is orange and this rose geranium, also good for me!</li>
            <li>but yet when it arrived, I realized very quickly that this is far from a pure grade essential oil.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly and the smell is very pleasing......</li>
            <li>It is a nice change from my usual sage, rosemary or lavender smells...</li>
            <li>I also bought a bottle of sweet orange oil the same time I ordered this one</li>
            <li>It was hard to believe that I could get this much rose geranium for this price but it does appear to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>I had use about half and was well pleased.</li>
            <li>but this particular scent again</li>
            <li>So, I would highly recommend this product for soaps and lotions or just to dab on yourself or pet to ward off the ticks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My first time trying this oil, I usually get lavender oil exclusively but I am glad I tried something new.  </li>
            <li>When mixed with the sweet almond oil makes a natural flea and tick repellant for animals and humans alike  </li>
            <li>So, all-in-all I definitely recommend this product, I doubt you could beat the price and the quality anywhere else; I&#x27;ve read enough customer reviews and price-shopped on dozens of websites and at plenty of local stores to be pretty darn sure.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li>This is not Rose Geranium EO, but oil from another plant that has a close resemblance to rose oil scent.</li>
            <li>Also geranium is a nice oil for my face, I dilute it only slightly if at all.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using my mix for 4 days and haven&#x27;t had a new break out</li>
            <li>usually don&#x27;t like rosey scents, but this is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>only problem is I noticed it wasn&#x27;t nearly potent enough to only do once a day, so I had to apply twice a day to keep the ticks away.</li>
            <li>We had read about how Geranium oil works in hot tubs, and only 20 drops clears the water and we don&#x27;t need to use chlorine or bromine in it at all!</li>
            <li>Rose EO is outrageous in price, even rose hydrosol is really expensive and I&#x27;m not familiar with how to use it or it&#x27;s properties, but this gorgeous stuff mixed with orange primarily smells like a cross between  two of my favorite scents, orange blossoms and roses!  </li>
            <li>This does smell nice at least!</li>
            <li>Live near Lyme act but haven&#x27;t had any tick problems so far this summer.</li>
            <li>Definitely has a geranium scent, a little rosy, which I love to dab on my wrists instead of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>far its workig</li>
            <li>Delivered pretty soon and was given a small bottle of  lavender essential oil for free.</li>
            <li>I have been surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it so far in my homemade deodorant and some lotion with no problems.  </li>
            <li>My daughter with sensitive skin uses the deodorant and she&#x27;s had no reactions to it at all.  </li>
            <li>However to advertise this as Rose Geranium oil is false advertisement.  </li>
            <li>bottle should last quite a while considering it only takes a few drops to do the trick. :)</li>
            <li>Pure oils don&#x27;t come in this size for such a low price.</li>
            <li>First off it is &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>And I have to admit that I think when I was reading &#x27;geranium&#x27;, I was mixing it up with what I remembered gardenias to smell like, so I was a little surprised when I first smelled this oil.</li>
            <li>It completely ruined the batch leaving an odor that I can only put my finger on as &#x27;plastic&#x27;..</li>
            <li>you just have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>I compared it with the pure Geranium oil I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;from other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that we got so much for so little.  </li>
            <li>The shipper is very fast, thorough, packs well and includes little notes for instructions on uses...</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because the label on the bottle does not list it as either an &#x27;essential&#x27; oil or whether it is an &#x27;infused&#x27; oil, but since the product description on the Amazon page lists the oil as \\&quot;100% Pure Uncut Rose Geranium Essential</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Let me start by saying to those of you reading this that if you are looking for Rose Oil or Geranium oil, this is not it!</li>
            <li> I find it pleasant &amp; relaxing.</li>
            <li> and my skin has honestly cleared up beautifully.</li>
            <li> Good price for good product.  </li>
            <li> Works good but needs to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li> I am keeping the product because it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive</li>
            <li> the good stuff.</li>
            <li> good price and works to keep the ticks off the dogs</li>
            <li> service is good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....works great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Im exremely happy and will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> I did notice a momentary stinging sensation on my face after I added this rose geranium oil to my water mix, but it felt like it was doing something good</li>
            <li> There is some rose smell, but comes with some others that doesnâ€™t make a good combination.  </li>
            <li> Everything was perfect all the way around and also received my order very fast...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this EO, I diffuse it in a daytime blend I make to sorta wake up, but do so in a bower of roses!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s better than ticks!</li>
            <li> and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> It adds a beautiful rosy scent to my facial oil treatment, and it really is a great purchase for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best rose geranium I have found!</li>
            <li> I was very glad for because out of the bottle I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but it really smelled great once it had been heated and infused with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> geranium oil was not \\&quot;rose geranium\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Nice, but I avoid synthetic fragrances at all costs.</li>
            <li> I did scrutinize this rose geranium</li>
            <li> the oil smells nice, I used it in my lavender geranium soap, turned out well...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still to he fair it&#x27;s lovely</li>
            <li> I purchase Rose Geranium oil from Enchnted Wilderness/Catey13 to ward off ticks.</li>
            <li> I would advise you to purchase your own pipettes in quantity(I purchase them for fish tanks, and they don&#x27;t hold up well, buy a lot) , or a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> Ipurchased rose geranium oil as a tick deterrent.  </li>
            <li> Predominantly rose aroma.</li>
            <li> This one has almost no Geranium smell, diluted with rose or&lt;br /&gt;whatever, hence the lower price.</li>
            <li> This geranium oil does, in fact, smell just as roselike as any rose you ever sniffed.</li>
            <li> This rose</li>
            <li> In any case, it smells quite nice, so I have to give it two stars.  </li>
            <li> I also mix with witch hazel and it makes a nice toner for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Just perfect and really smells like roses too</li>
            <li> I mix it with Rose oil that extend the life of it.</li>
            <li> The picture that was posted was a little misleading because 2 bottles are shown, but the price is very fair and the oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a special product that diffuses very nicely in the bath.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and with a lot of nice rose scent.</li>
            <li> It makes our home smell great AND more importantly</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and very natural.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a whirl and add it to my lovely rose mint salve that I was perfecting.</li>
            <li> The sting dissipated after about 15-30 seconds, but the lovely smell lingered nicely.</li>
            <li> (makes me wonder if it is &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; like they say) and the scent smells more like roses than rose geraniumm .  </li>
            <li> I love rose geranium.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I love this rose geranium oil :)</li>
            <li> Rose geranium is a perfect oil for women reaching menopause or in post-menopause as it supports female function in aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li> Good value--smells great, and does not irritate my daughters&#x27; skin (3 year old twins).  </li>
            <li> I received this quickly and loved it.  </li>
            <li> i love this oil, i use it in my soaps and skin care products.</li>
            <li> However it has a more rosy scent</li>
            <li> which is lovely-</li>
            <li> I have used it in the bath and it is quite lovely.  </li>
            <li> It has many homeopathic uses.</li>
            <li> Use on dogs too and they dont bring so many in the house.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this seller many times and will continue to use them but wont</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it more because the product is not what it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So I feel this company needs to be more forthcoming with their advertisement.  </li>
            <li> I use it to make homemade bath bombs, deodorants, and anything and everything else I need to smell like roses  :)</li>
            <li> I recommend this manufacturer and I plan to use them again :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this oil</li>
            <li> It smelled so soft and lovely and the sent was strong in a very good way.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing and definitely worthy of being used as a perfume, as well.  :)</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful aroma and lasts a long time without having to be used in overpowering amounts.</li>
            <li> It has a nice rosy kind of smell and the quality is pure.</li>
            <li> wish there were more info on where it comes from, and certification that it is unadulterated with anything like so many EO&#x27;s now (toxins, chemicals, fillers, etc)</li>
            <li> It does smell similar to my rose fragrance oil I use, but this one smells realer lol if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using it because my research indicated it is useful for deterring ticks from dogs, which appears to be true, and the added bonus is that my dog smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> it still smells just clean and flowery!</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for many uses, such as a non toxic floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and work with them alot, I tried this once and was happy with it, and have purchased it again since then ----</li>
            <li> This oil is 100% pure and potent!</li>
            <li> I have to have pure Rose Geranium oil in My house.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I received a free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; which was a sample of some synthetic perfume oil.</li>
            <li> Smells good with natural scent.</li>
            <li> a decent purchase, better than I had feared for sure</li>
            <li> Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the rose geranium essential oil because it meets all my needs.  </li>
            <li> This smells better than the Moroccan Rose essential oil I ordered a while ago!!</li>
            <li> I would rather pay more for pure geranium, than its&lt;br /&gt;heavily diluted version.</li>
            <li> The orange oil compliments this one in that it gives just a tad hint of sweet citrus to a medium-heavy floral scent.</li>
            <li> I do believe it is the real deal, just not too sure.</li>
            <li> geranium oil is real and potent.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for a rose-like essential oil this would be best (if you can&#x27;t fork out $70 per 1/8oz for real rose essential oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller included a little pamphlet of recipes and uses.</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle of rose geranium essential oil and have enjoyed incorporating the oil into my products.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the potent smell, not too rosy, but definitely with rose floral notes.</li>
            <li> This Rose Geranium Oil is better than we expected.  </li>
            <li> Now foods actually has excellent essential oils for bargain prices!</li>
            <li> You must add it to a carrier oil/liquid because of the super concentration.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rose Geranium Essential oil for my (HP) HOT PROCESS soap !!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll discover a new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Pretty feminine smell!</li>
            <li> A few drops on wool dryer balls adds a great scent to my clothes.</li>
            <li> Aromatic and has anti-fungal/ anti-mold properties useful to growers.</li>
            <li> Rose Geranium is a completely different plant.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my salves, and a rose facial cream I have a recipe for!</li>
            <li> Mixed with rose water and sprayed went in the woods</li>
            <li> While it does smell nice, it is nothing like the pure rose geranium that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> So I spread some on my hands and right ankle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this item is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in the hopes to help my condition and even on the first day, I started to notice a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I added too much of the oil to my mix, but whatever I did, it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I buy essential oils from many sources for my products.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL DEAL!  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that say the rose note is stronger than the geranium but is still pleasant, it has a very classic aroma to it (it almost smells as if you&#x27;ve got your face buried in a bouquet of REAL backyard-grown roses, though not quite as sweet-smelling which might be due to the gardenia note).</li>
            <li> this essential oil smells heavenly -- i love its unique, natural scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it is better than lyme disease, which my wife got last year.</li>
            <li> Made a 1# heart shaped soy candle and had to use 2 oz which is a lot more than normal for scents, essential or</li>
            <li> Though I do not know if it is pure.</li>
            <li> I just hope this is the REAL deal, not a fragrance oil, as it is not from a known brand.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This smell is very rose-like.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal...</li>
            <li> It really works well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of it into a mixture of rose water and witch hazel to help my skin.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat the price and fast shipping, also, it seems the shipper is very courteous, lending little notes in the box so that you know if you need personal attention, they are there for you, so yes, I would order again..</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I&#x27;m new to purchasing essential oils and have nothing to compare the quality to, but I will say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Then I sneak in any oils I may need physically, like peppermint, Cyprus and eucalyptus etc for my allergies and copd and chronic fatigue, but as long as half of the blend, roughly, is orange and this rose geranium, also good for me!</li>
            <li> but yet when it arrived, I realized very quickly that this is far from a pure grade essential oil.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly and the smell is very pleasing......</li>
            <li> It is a nice change from my usual sage, rosemary or lavender smells...</li>
            <li> I also bought a bottle of sweet orange oil the same time I ordered this one</li>
            <li> It was hard to believe that I could get this much rose geranium for this price but it does appear to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> I had use about half and was well pleased.</li>
            <li> but this particular scent again</li>
            <li> So, I would highly recommend this product for soaps and lotions or just to dab on yourself or pet to ward off the ticks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this oil, I usually get lavender oil exclusively but I am glad I tried something new.  </li>
            <li> When mixed with the sweet almond oil makes a natural flea and tick repellant for animals and humans alike  </li>
            <li> So, all-in-all I definitely recommend this product, I doubt you could beat the price and the quality anywhere else; I&#x27;ve read enough customer reviews and price-shopped on dozens of websites and at plenty of local stores to be pretty darn sure.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li> This is not Rose Geranium EO, but oil from another plant that has a close resemblance to rose oil scent.</li>
            <li> Also geranium is a nice oil for my face, I dilute it only slightly if at all.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using my mix for 4 days and haven&#x27;t had a new break out</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t like rosey scents, but this is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> only problem is I noticed it wasn&#x27;t nearly potent enough to only do once a day, so I had to apply twice a day to keep the ticks away.</li>
            <li> We had read about how Geranium oil works in hot tubs, and only 20 drops clears the water and we don&#x27;t need to use chlorine or bromine in it at all!</li>
            <li> Rose EO is outrageous in price, even rose hydrosol is really expensive and I&#x27;m not familiar with how to use it or it&#x27;s properties, but this gorgeous stuff mixed with orange primarily smells like a cross between  two of my favorite scents, orange blossoms and roses!  </li>
            <li> This does smell nice at least!</li>
            <li> Live near Lyme act but haven&#x27;t had any tick problems so far this summer.</li>
            <li> Definitely has a geranium scent, a little rosy, which I love to dab on my wrists instead of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> far its workig</li>
            <li> Delivered pretty soon and was given a small bottle of  lavender essential oil for free.</li>
            <li> I have been surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it so far in my homemade deodorant and some lotion with no problems.  </li>
            <li> My daughter with sensitive skin uses the deodorant and she&#x27;s had no reactions to it at all.  </li>
            <li> However to advertise this as Rose Geranium oil is false advertisement.  </li>
            <li> bottle should last quite a while considering it only takes a few drops to do the trick. :)</li>
            <li> Pure oils don&#x27;t come in this size for such a low price.</li>
            <li> First off it is &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> And I have to admit that I think when I was reading &#x27;geranium&#x27;, I was mixing it up with what I remembered gardenias to smell like, so I was a little surprised when I first smelled this oil.</li>
            <li> It completely ruined the batch leaving an odor that I can only put my finger on as &#x27;plastic&#x27;..</li>
            <li> you just have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> I compared it with the pure Geranium oil I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;from other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that we got so much for so little.  </li>
            <li> The shipper is very fast, thorough, packs well and includes little notes for instructions on uses...</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because the label on the bottle does not list it as either an &#x27;essential&#x27; oil or whether it is an &#x27;infused&#x27; oil, but since the product description on the Amazon page lists the oil as \\&quot;100% Pure Uncut Rose Geranium Essential</li>
            <li> and I think they would pair very well as a perfume; which I plan to test out as soon as I can find a small oil bottle and some pipettes or droppers and a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Other essential oils are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about its quality, but boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> I love to use geranium oil as a big repellent, which is really does work for.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have had at least 3 or 4 .</li>
            <li> If you look at other online retailers .5 of an oz will run you about $12 - $14, which is what we paid for 4 ozs. of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have placed a few a few drops in a carrier oil and used it to simmer with the same results.</li>
            <li> I ended up with half a dozen bites.  </li>
            <li> Like I said before its rosy but not overpowering, and it seems to have a slight green background note.</li>
            <li> I use it for cleaning my skin and disinfecting the house, plus a little squirt every once in awhile on my sheets, carpet, and blankets.  </li>
            <li> indispensible oil for skin care, bug repellent, smells a heck of a lot better than citronella</li>
            <li> I dab it on our dogs chests, neck, tail and abdomen every few days.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops on a pillow meant for aromatic therapy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!  </li>
            <li> No more ticks on our Tigger!</li>
            <li> We purchased this being a little skeptical about the quality of the product in relation to the price.  </li>
            <li> It like doubled at least!  </li>
            <li> I have never had a skin reaction this way or as a bug repellent and neither have any of my family and friends who I have recommended it to, though I think usually it is recommended to dilute all essential oils except maybe lavender?</li>
            <li> Very delicate fragrance that I have been using in my humidifier.  </li>
            <li> Also, I understand that geranium oil works something like a natural mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> I hope it will help with broken capillaries and tightening skin.</li>
            <li> For the past month or so, I had been breaking out with painful acne all over my face.</li>
            <li> It does not smell fake or perfumy and has the consistency I would expect.</li>
            <li> Sadly I dropped it and broke the bottle.</li>
            <li> It leaves a plastic fake synthetic aroma.</li>
            <li> We used this product in our cold process soap and the smell of the EO is NON EXISTENT...  </li>
            <li> So please pay attention to what you purchase and how you rate it because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of misinformed people purchase this product and rate it badly because they don&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> Had a bad scent with the floral scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus - rosey and ticks hate it&lt;</li>
            <li> Trying for use for tick repellent for dogs .so</li>
            <li> Using this to help with tick repellent.</li>
            <li> It is awful, don&#x27;t buy it, and watch their products as I bought 2 others that were also quite lame!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> amazing product, use this as a tick control for my dogs!</li>
            <li> Trying for use for tick repellent for dogs .so far its workig</li>
            <li> i love this oil, i use it in my soaps and skin care products. looking forward to future business with you guys.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and loved it.  However it has a more rosy scent then I was used to in my geranium oil- which is lovely- but just a surprise.  I guess that&#x27;s because my stand-by NOW geranium oil was not \\&quot;rose geranium\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; I just hope this is the REAL deal, not a fragrance oil, as it is not from a known brand.  I received a free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; which was a sample of some synthetic perfume oil. Nice, but I avoid synthetic fragrances at all costs. I did scrutinize this rose geranium and I DO feel it is real essential oil as labeled. It does not smell fake or perfumy and has the consistency I would expect. Definitely has a geranium scent, a little rosy, which I love to dab on my wrists instead of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I will trust in the integrity of the seller, so this is a GREAT value. I love to use geranium oil as a big repellent, which is really does work for. I have used it in the bath and it is quite lovely.  Also geranium is a nice oil for my face, I dilute it only slightly if at all.  I have never had a skin reaction this way or as a bug repellent and neither have any of my family and friends who I have recommended it to, though I think usually it is recommended to dilute all essential oils except maybe lavender? Anyhow, I love this rose geranium oil :)</li>
            <li> A great smelling oil that I use for aroma therapy that I use when I&#x27;m stressed out, additive to my soap and baths and salts. It has many homeopathic uses.</li>
            <li> Good price for good product.  would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The shipper is very fast, thorough, packs well and includes little notes for instructions on uses...the oil smells nice, I used it in my lavender geranium soap, turned out well...you can&#x27;t beat the price and fast shipping, also, it seems the shipper is very courteous, lending little notes in the box so that you know if you need personal attention, they are there for you, so yes, I would order again..</li>
            <li> This Rose Geranium Oil is better than we expected.  I&#x27;m surprised that we got so much for so little.  It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> awesome price.  indispensible oil for skin care, bug repellent, smells a heck of a lot better than citronella</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely rose-scented oil! I was a little nervous because the label on the bottle does not list it as either an &#x27;essential&#x27; oil or whether it is an &#x27;infused&#x27; oil, but since the product description on the Amazon page lists the oil as \\&quot;100% Pure Uncut Rose Geranium Essential Oil\\&quot;, I decided I&#x27;ll take their word for it. The label on the bottle lists its Latin name as \\&quot;Pelargonium Capitatum x Radens.\\&quot;  It adds a beautiful rosy scent to my facial oil treatment, and it really is a great purchase for the price!!</li>
            <li> A few drops on wool dryer balls adds a great scent to my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this EO, I diffuse it in a daytime blend I make to sorta wake up, but do so in a bower of roses!  Rose EO is outrageous in price, even rose hydrosol is really expensive and I&#x27;m not familiar with how to use it or it&#x27;s properties, but this gorgeous stuff mixed with orange primarily smells like a cross between  two of my favorite scents, orange blossoms and roses!  Then I sneak in any oils I may need physically, like peppermint, Cyprus and eucalyptus etc for my allergies and copd and chronic fatigue, but as long as half of the blend, roughly, is orange and this rose geranium, also good for me! :-D it still smells just clean and flowery! Lemon works too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I needed to blend it to &amp;#34;sweeten and deepen&amp;#34; this scent because of the breathtaking price change!  It like doubled at least!  I&#x27;ve had prices change on items in my cart but never THIS drastically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still to he fair it&#x27;s lovely and if it doesn&#x27;t go up ANYMORE is still a 5 star product...</li>
            <li> This is a huge bang for your buck. I purchase Rose Geranium oil from Enchnted Wilderness/Catey13 to ward off ticks. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like rosey scents, but this is quite lovely. I especially like it mixed with cedarwood oil. I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for a rose-like essential oil this would be best (if you can&#x27;t fork out $70 per 1/8oz for real rose essential oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller included a little pamphlet of recipes and uses. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus - rosey and ticks hate it&lt;br /&gt;minus - bottle does not have a dropper, seller included plastic pipette which split. I&#x27;m happy the seller included something, and the fact that it split has no weight on my decisions to purchase from them again. I would advise you to purchase your own pipettes in quantity(I purchase them for fish tanks, and they don&#x27;t hold up well, buy a lot) , or a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> No more ticks on our Tigger! Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> smells delightful. excellent price. wish there were more info on where it comes from, and certification that it is unadulterated with anything like so many EO&#x27;s now (toxins, chemicals, fillers, etc)</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle of rose geranium essential oil and have enjoyed incorporating the oil into my products.  The smell is wonderful and very natural.  Thanks!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Sadly I dropped it and broke the bottle. I had use about half and was well pleased. Pretty feminine smell!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the rose geranium essential oil because it meets all my needs.  I recommend it highly and the smell is very pleasing......</li>
            <li> Aromatic and has anti-fungal/ anti-mold properties useful to growers.</li>
            <li> This smell is very rose-like.  I use it in both a room spray, mixed with lime, and in low doses in cleaners that end up making things smell like roses - which I like.  It is a nice change from my usual sage, rosemary or lavender smells...</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying to those of you reading this that if you are looking for Rose Oil or Geranium oil, this is not it! Rose Geranium is a completely different plant. So please pay attention to what you purchase and how you rate it because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of misinformed people purchase this product and rate it badly because they don&#x27;t know the difference. Anyway, this item is exactly what it is. It&#x27;s worked perfectly for use on warding ticks here in the Maine woods. It has a nice rosy kind of smell and the quality is pure. So, I would highly recommend this product for soaps and lotions or just to dab on yourself or pet to ward off the ticks.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this oil but yet when it arrived, I realized very quickly that this is far from a pure grade essential oil. It is diluted and it is synthetic. I thought the smell was &#x27;alright&#x27; nothing to write home about so I decided to give it a whirl and add it to my lovely rose mint salve that I was perfecting. It completely ruined the batch leaving an odor that I can only put my finger on as &#x27;plastic&#x27;.. It leaves a plastic fake synthetic aroma. It is awful, don&#x27;t buy it, and watch their products as I bought 2 others that were also quite lame!!! Now foods actually has excellent essential oils for bargain prices!</li>
            <li> Using this to help with tick repellent. Works good but needs to be reapplied often. But that&#x27;s better than ticks! Use on dogs too and they dont bring so many in the house.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this oil, I usually get lavender oil exclusively but I am glad I tried something new.  Very delicate fragrance that I have been using in my humidifier.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Believe it orbit Ipurchased rose geranium oil as a tick deterrent.  It really seems to work.  I dab it on our dogs chests, neck, tail and abdomen every few days.  Live near Lyme act but haven&#x27;t had any tick problems so far this summer.</li>
            <li> Made a 1# heart shaped soy candle and had to use 2 oz which is a lot more than normal for scents, essential or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent out of the bottle was quite different than how it smelled in the candle, though - which I was very glad for because out of the bottle I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but it really smelled great once it had been heated and infused with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent purchase, better than I had feared for sure but I may order again sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li> When mixed with the sweet almond oil makes a natural flea and tick repellant for animals and humans alike  this product was the perfect size and delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Predominantly rose aroma. I compared it with the pure Geranium oil I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;from other brands. This one has almost no Geranium smell, diluted with rose or&lt;br /&gt;whatever, hence the lower price. I would rather pay more for pure geranium, than its&lt;br /&gt;heavily diluted version.</li>
            <li> I have been in my yard a dozen times since I started using this and have not had one tick on me. Normally I would have had at least 3 or 4 . I don&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it is better than lyme disease, which my wife got last year.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells good with natural scent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my purpose.  I&#x27;d heard it repels ticks.  So I spread some on my hands and right ankle.  I used deet on the left ankle/shoe.  I picked dozens of ticks off of myself that day.  I ended up with half a dozen bites.  I detected no difference between the two different treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I will try this again with different coverage and concentration, though.  This does smell nice at least!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I&#x27;m new to purchasing essential oils and have nothing to compare the quality to, but I will say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. I agree with other reviews that say the rose note is stronger than the geranium but is still pleasant, it has a very classic aroma to it (it almost smells as if you&#x27;ve got your face buried in a bouquet of REAL backyard-grown roses, though not quite as sweet-smelling which might be due to the gardenia note). And I have to admit that I think when I was reading &#x27;geranium&#x27;, I was mixing it up with what I remembered gardenias to smell like, so I was a little surprised when I first smelled this oil. But that&#x27;s my mistake, not the sellers. I also bought a bottle of sweet orange oil the same time I ordered this one and I think they would pair very well as a perfume; which I plan to test out as soon as I can find a small oil bottle and some pipettes or droppers and a carrier oil. The orange oil compliments this one in that it gives just a tad hint of sweet citrus to a medium-heavy floral scent. So, all-in-all I definitely recommend this product, I doubt you could beat the price and the quality anywhere else; I&#x27;ve read enough customer reviews and price-shopped on dozens of websites and at plenty of local stores to be pretty darn sure.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and with a lot of nice rose scent. My last batch of soap made 13 bars of soap using 2 ounces of the oil. Rose geranium is a perfect oil for women reaching menopause or in post-menopause as it supports female function in aromatherapy.  It promotes feelings of euphoria.</li>
            <li> This geranium oil does, in fact, smell just as roselike as any rose you ever sniffed. It has a wonderful aroma and lasts a long time without having to be used in overpowering amounts. Also, I understand that geranium oil works something like a natural mosquito repellent. I don&#x27;t know if that actually works, but I haven&#x27;t ever gotten a mosquito bite while wearing it!</li>
            <li> I like the combination of the two items blended together.</li>
            <li> This smells better than the Moroccan Rose essential oil I ordered a while ago!! Though I do not know if it is pure. It smells beautiful! rosy but not overpowering. It does smell similar to my rose fragrance oil I use, but this one smells realer lol if that makes sense. Like I said before its rosy but not overpowering, and it seems to have a slight green background note. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my salves, and a rose facial cream I have a recipe for! Thank you! will by again, and I also recommend this oil! I do believe it is the real deal, just not too sure. Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> As soon as I received my item, I used it immediately. The first thing I noticed was the potent smell, not too rosy, but definitely with rose floral notes. I put a few drops of it into a mixture of rose water and witch hazel to help my skin. For the past month or so, I had been breaking out with painful acne all over my face. I ordered this item in the hopes to help my condition and even on the first day, I started to notice a difference immediately. I have now been using my mix for 4 days and haven&#x27;t had a new break out and my skin has honestly cleared up beautifully. I did notice a momentary stinging sensation on my face after I added this rose geranium oil to my water mix, but it felt like it was doing something good so I let it be. The sting dissipated after about 15-30 seconds, but the lovely smell lingered nicely. Perhaps I added too much of the oil to my mix, but whatever I did, it&#x27;s working! I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. This oil is 100% pure and potent! You must add it to a carrier oil/liquid because of the super concentration. I definitely recommend this product and will be ordering again...but not any time soon, this 4 oz. bottle should last quite a while considering it only takes a few drops to do the trick. :)</li>
            <li> I have to have pure Rose Geranium oil in My house. It&#x27;s great for many uses, such as a non toxic floor cleaner. Makes your floors smell heavenly</li>
            <li> I like the scent initally but it fades with a musky odor that I dont find very pleasant . I have ordered from this seller many times and will continue to use them but wont but this particular scent again</li>
            <li> While it does smell nice, it is nothing like the pure rose geranium that I have purchased in the past. First off it is &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (makes me wonder if it is &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; like they say) and the scent smells more like roses than rose geraniumm .  Good thing I like roses tho! I would purchase again if I want to use it for my diffuser or to make a air freshner. Not for soap making tho.</li>
            <li> Had a bad scent with the floral scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like oil...the type you tune up your car with!  Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of sending it back. I should have known.  Pure oils don&#x27;t come in this size for such a low price.</li>
            <li> This rose geranium oil is real and potent. When applied to skin, I can feel it does promote circulation as claimed. I hope it will help with broken capillaries and tightening skin. Will continue to order...</li>
            <li> This is not Rose Geranium EO, but oil from another plant that has a close resemblance to rose oil scent. I like the smell because it smells like roses to me.  However to advertise this as Rose Geranium oil is false advertisement.  In any case, it smells quite nice, so I have to give it two stars.  I can&#x27;t give it more because the product is not what it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s a frangrance or essential oil.  So I feel this company needs to be more forthcoming with their advertisement.  I am keeping the product because it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive and it&#x27;s still smells like roses.</li>
            <li> Good value--smells great, and does not irritate my daughters&#x27; skin (3 year old twins).  Other essential oils are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Loved this !!!! I ordered the Rose Geranium Essential oil for my (HP) HOT PROCESS soap !! and I loved it !! It smelled so soft and lovely and the sent was strong in a very good way. I wanted it to have a scent that lasted in my soaps, not to fade out after curing,this worked wonderfully, I was VERY VERY pleased ! Thank You Enchanted Wilderness</li>
            <li> this essential oil smells heavenly -- i love its unique, natural scent.  i&#x27;m using it because my research indicated it is useful for deterring ticks from dogs, which appears to be true, and the added bonus is that my dog smells amazing!  when he walks through the house, it&#x27;s like air freshener.  absolutely amazing and definitely worthy of being used as a perfume, as well.  :)</li>
            <li> this is the real deal... the good stuff. I put it on everything! I use it for cleaning my skin and disinfecting the house, plus a little squirt every once in awhile on my sheets, carpet, and blankets.  so relaxing.  I also mix with witch hazel and it makes a nice toner for the skin.  you just have to be careful not to use too much are you&#x27;ll be smelling like a lot of roses.</li>
            <li> good price and works to keep the ticks off the dogs</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just my preference.  I bought this to help repel ticks for my dog.  Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and work with them alot, I tried this once and was happy with it, and have purchased it again since then ----</li>
            <li> I bought this one after saw all the reviews. But I had to say the smell is weird, if not horrible. There is some rose smell, but comes with some others that doesnâ€™t make a good combination.  Well, of course you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service is good. Delivered pretty soon and was given a small bottle of  lavender essential oil for free. I definitely recommend this seller, but not this specific product.</li>
            <li> I love rose geranium. I buy essential oils from many sources for my products. This is by far the best rose geranium I have found! Try this and you&#x27;ll discover a new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Mixed with rose water and sprayed went in the woods no ticks...next day didn&#x27;t use and found 3 ticks within 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality and scent of this oil.  I use it to make homemade bath bombs, deodorants, and anything and everything else I need to smell like roses  :)</li>
            <li> Great Value- The picture that was posted was a little misleading because 2 bottles are shown, but the price is very fair and the oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....works great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Just perfect and really smells like roses too</li>
            <li> This is the REAL DEAL!  It makes our home smell great AND more importantly, we got this to control where our Siamese cat goes, or rather where she does NOT go.  Cats do not like this scent and we put it in a mister bottle and spray it on my wife&#x27;s plants, the counter tops, and some furniture.  The cat stays away and the home smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I used this oil to keep ticks off my dog and myself. It really works well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is I noticed it wasn&#x27;t nearly potent enough to only do once a day, so I had to apply twice a day to keep the ticks away. It seemed to be diluted before I even received it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I would say this oil does it&#x27;s job and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect all the way around and also received my order very fast...Im exremely happy and will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> We had read about how Geranium oil works in hot tubs, and only 20 drops clears the water and we don&#x27;t need to use chlorine or bromine in it at all!</li>
            <li> This is a special product that diffuses very nicely in the bath. I found it emotionally soothing and helpful to my nervous system.</li>
            <li> I got this product by accident. I have been surprised by the results. I use a few drops on a pillow meant for aromatic therapy. I find it pleasant &amp; relaxing. I have placed a few a few drops in a carrier oil and used it to simmer with the same results.</li>
            <li> It was hard to believe that I could get this much rose geranium for this price but it does appear to be the real thing. I have been very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Did well for me.  I mix it with Rose oil that extend the life of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!!  It was so affordable I was a little nervous about its quality, but boy was I surprised!  It smells wonderfully of roses with a hint of geranium.  I&#x27;ve used it so far in my homemade deodorant and some lotion with no problems.  My daughter with sensitive skin uses the deodorant and she&#x27;s had no reactions to it at all.  I recommend this manufacturer and I plan to use them again :)</li>
            <li> We purchased this being a little skeptical about the quality of the product in relation to the price.  If you look at other online retailers .5 of an oz will run you about $12 - $14, which is what we paid for 4 ozs. of this product.  We should have gone with our gut feeling but based on the reviews and the cost figured we would give it a try.  We used this product in our cold process soap and the smell of the EO is NON EXISTENT...  We now have 16 bars that we can no longer sell!!!  What a waste of time and money!  We also tried emailing the seller an have yet to receive a reply regarding the integrity of the product; that was 3 days ago.</li>
