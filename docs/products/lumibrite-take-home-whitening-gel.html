            <li>Good difference.</li>
            <li>yes i was very pleased.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice 3 pack one</li>
            <li>32% is very strong.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it requires a bit more attention be paid when applying to the teeth trays, and by that</li>
            <li>Also, I question whether the product is authentic.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>IT PAYS OFF BETTER GOING TO THE DENIST</li>
            <li>I recieved it and it was okay</li>
            <li>It really works great and I am glad it&#x27;s available here.</li>
            <li>So much more economical to order here.</li>
            <li>Like the fact it&#x27;s easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>Great price for the same stuff the dentist sells for 4x as much.</li>
            <li>Great product and half the cost the dental office charges.</li>
            <li>Dentist claims 2 boxes of this product is $500 worth if whitening.</li>
            <li>The 22-24% solution did not irritate my gums so I moved up to 32% and am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>First is that being stronger</li>
            <li>, the bleaching gel works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>You can notice a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>but I think you could get the same result or better with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>sooooo much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>Lumibrite really does work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The LumiBrite 32% only needs about 10-20 minutes to do the same amount as the 22% does in an hour or more.</li>
            <li>Simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Normally, my teeth get somewhat sore (and my gums always do) and neither has occurred</li>
            <li>- neither had the whitening effect I have normally gotten and</li>
            <li>Secondly, because it is stronger it MIGHT not be right for everyone.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase from my dentist directly.</li>
            <li>This is the same product sold in dentist offices at much higher prices.  </li>
            <li>I used this product as direct for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really see a big difference in my teeth!!  </li>
            <li>Not the whitening you would get from a dentist office, but decent enough for some noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now, but always purchased directly from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because one of the vials was empty and one was only half filled.  </li>

            <li> I chose this rating because one of the vials was empty and one was only half filled.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, however,  the  packaging ( plunger on the syringe) only works on about every other gel tube!  </li>
            <li> The teeth whitened a little but but not enough for me to buy this product again!</li>
            <li> There was very little Gel in the tube, this is the first time I could not do my teeth whitening at least two time, J</li>
            <li> If you need to with any  LumiBrite solutions you might consider applying a small amount of Vaseline (I will review that product for anyone that thinks it necessary!)</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Whitens extremely well but requires a bleaching tray, preferably one custom made by your dentist.</li>
            <li> I mean a VERY small amount is all that is required on each tooth to be whitened.</li>
            <li> This product - the syringes have broken or don&#x27;t work (in all of the boxes I bought).</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE GETTING!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Works great to whiten and remove stains. Dentist claims 2 boxes of this product is $500 worth if whitening. So much more economical to order here. I reorder when out. Great shipping too.</li>
            <li> I got three packs for the price of one from my dentist!  I wish I had figured this out earlier.</li>
            <li> Great price for the same stuff the dentist sells for 4x as much.</li>
            <li> Please note that this is a 32% product and NOT similar 16% and 22-24% products. That means several things. First is that being stronger it requires a bit more attention be paid when applying to the teeth trays, and by that I mean a VERY small amount is all that is required on each tooth to be whitened. Secondly, because it is stronger it MIGHT not be right for everyone. If you have had gum irritation with lesser solutions then stay with those as this product will NOT make teeth whiter. Sorry. What it will do is allow you to get the same amount of whitening with EITHER the lesser amount I mentioned OR for a shorter period of time, but NOT both. The LumiBrite 32% only needs about 10-20 minutes to do the same amount as the 22% does in an hour or more. The 22-24% solution did not irritate my gums so I moved up to 32% and am pleased so far. If you need to with any  LumiBrite solutions you might consider applying a small amount of Vaseline (I will review that product for anyone that thinks it necessary!) to the gums before using the whitening product. Best of luck.</li>
            <li> I used this product as direct for 2 weeks. However, it did not make a big diffference to my teeth. The teeth whitened a little but but not enough for me to buy this product again!</li>
            <li> There was very little Gel in the tube, this is the first time I could not do my teeth whitening at least two time, J</li>
            <li> I normally purchase from my dentist directly. This product - the syringes have broken or don&#x27;t work (in all of the boxes I bought). Also, I question whether the product is authentic. Normally, my teeth get somewhat sore (and my gums always do) and neither has occurred - neither had the whitening effect I have normally gotten and 32% is very strong.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff. I really see a big difference in my teeth!!  Same stuff I got from the dentist, but sooooo much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G</li>
            <li> yes i was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the same product sold in dentist offices at much higher prices.  Whitens extremely well but requires a bleaching tray, preferably one custom made by your dentist.</li>
            <li> My dentist friend recommended me to try Lumi Brite and i decided to order on amazon.com Satisfied with results. Thanks</li>
            <li> DIDNT TURN NOT EVEN 1 SHADE LIGHTER. I USED IT AS DIRECTED. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY OR HAVE SHARES IN IT MUST BE THE ONES WRITING THE REVIEWS!!! IT PAYS OFF BETTER GOING TO THE DENIST AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE GETTING!!!!</li>
            <li> This Gel works well. I had to leave it on for 3 min and I applied this for 3 days. Good difference.</li>
            <li> Great stuff..much cheaper than thru the dentist</li>
            <li> 1/2 of what the Dentist charges!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist.  It really does the job. I use it for 14 days alternating months.</li>
            <li> It seems to work but I think you could get the same result or better with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the accuracy of the description of the product, how the produce works and the speed of the transaction.&lt;br /&gt;First rate!</li>
            <li> Lumibrite really does work. I continue to use it for maintenance and always get compliments on my white teeth. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I recieved it and it was okay but it is a nice 3 pack one</li>
            <li> Great product. Like the fact it&#x27;s easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li> Great product and half the cost the dental office charges. Highly recommend!</li>
