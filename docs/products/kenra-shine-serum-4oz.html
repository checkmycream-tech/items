    <ol>
            <li>Great price and awesome shipping time!  </li>
            <li>Great product to get if you need stability and shine...</li>
            <li>Kenra Products are great.  </li>
            <li>Good deal on this serum.  </li>
            <li>It minimizes frizz and enhances control while providing exceptional shine.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Oh my, it is so amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is AMAZING, it makes me want to drink this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has almost no scent of its own</li>
            <li>It works, and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>Too many products have an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it allows me to judge the amount needed to get the look I want.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s easy to change your look-just alter the quantity.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair feel smooth and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light as a feather and fragrance-free, which is a true bonus.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s nice, it tames my flyaways and protects my hair without feeling too oily.</li>
            <li>When (or if) my future great-great grandchildren run out of this stuff they will order more, I&#x27;m sure of it.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product control them, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use very much or it&#x27;s too greasy.</li>
            <li>The serum arrived on time and I use it every day to give my very curly hair some control!  </li>
            <li>have relatively straight hair naturally, but I still get small frizzies and fly- aways.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have any smell at all.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it really works for taming the frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and light weight..does not wear your hard down.</li>
            <li>Style as usual, and if I still want more shine, I&#x27;ll work in a few more drops.  </li>
            <li>My hair is out of control because of humidity since I live in FL.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be I wish I smelled better!  </li>
            <li>My future great-great grandchildren will most likely be able to use this same bottle, this one bottle seriously will last me forever.</li>
            <li>If you are using any other oil in your hair, stop right now and order this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put Kenra Shine Serum on damp hair first before I add any other products.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair, fairly long.  </li>
            <li>apparently this shine isn&#x27;t the same as Kenra Shine in the 4ox spray .....</li>
            <li>Kendra products are top of the line and hard to find&#x27; this shine serum takes out all of the frizz with just a couple of drops!!</li>

            <li> I have really long hair (</li>
            <li> I like to use it before I comb my wet hair after I have washed it, whether I am going to straighten it with the flat iron or just add gel and scrunch.</li>
            <li> I like this serum because it makes my (dry) hair look shinier without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I put it in my hair right after I get out of the shower usually, but I have also used it when I was feeling lazy and skipped taking a shower before work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shine serum I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy looking or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I do believe I will be using this product for a very long time !</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The serum arrived on time and I use it every day to give my very curly hair some control!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product!  This serum truly locks out the humidity.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hard to find locally.  I always have to order through Amazon.  One bottle lasts probably about 7-8 months and my daughter and I use it a few times a week.  It&#x27;s great and light weight..does not wear your hard down.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it won&#x27;t be my last.  It minimizes frizz and enhances control while providing exceptional shine.  Most importantly, it allows me to judge the amount needed to get the look I want.  So, it&#x27;s easy to change your look-just alter the quantity.  Although this bottle doesn&#x27;t look like it lasts, it does.  My previous bottle lasted for 8 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use very much or it&#x27;s too greasy. My hear is thick and course so it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I put Kenra Shine Serum on damp hair first before I add any other products.  Style as usual, and if I still want more shine, I&#x27;ll work in a few more drops.  It has almost no scent of its own and it&#x27;s weightless.  Your hair won&#x27;t be greasy with this product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> If you are using any other oil in your hair, stop right now and order this stuff. Oh my, it is so amazing. I have really long hair (Almost down to my waist) and all it takes is two small pumps of this stuff and my hair goes from looking like I was electrocuted, to Cover-girl model. The smell is AMAZING, it makes me want to drink this stuff. (Probably not a good idea though, just saying..)

            <li> So far it&#x27;s nice, it tames my flyaways and protects my hair without feeling too oily.</li>
            <li> my got to for anit-friz and sleek look.</li>
            <li> No greasy build-up, nothing but shine!  My only complaint would be I wish I smelled better!  Fruity, or something.  It doesn&#x27;t really have any smell at all.</li>
            <li> It works, and it&#x27;s cruelty free! It&#x27;s light as a feather and fragrance-free, which is a true bonus. Too many products have an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3-4 years and I am only on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively straight hair naturally, but I still get small frizzies and fly- aways. Not only does this product control them, but it smells amazing. I have used similar products and they made my hair greasy, but not this. Also, I use one dab a day before straightening my hair and the bottle lasts me over two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is out of control because of humidity since I live in FL.  Great product to get if you need stability and shine...</li>
            <li> Great price and awesome shipping time!  Kendra products are top of the line and hard to find&#x27; this shine serum takes out all of the frizz with just a couple of drops!!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it really works for taming the frizz. It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li> Good deal on this serum.  Quite a bit more expensive at the salon.  I like this serum because it makes my (dry) hair look shinier without being greasy.  It also has a nice clean smell. I like to use it before I comb my wet hair after I have washed it, whether I am going to straighten it with the flat iron or just add gel and scrunch.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for years. I have normal hair, fairly long.  It tends to get just a tad frizzy after blow drying if I don&#x27;t use this.  It&#x27;s the only shine serum I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy looking or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This is used by my wife and she loves it. Does just what the name says, adds shine to her hair. She also likes that it lasts a long time since it requires only a small amount to work.</li>
            <li> Love the SHINE but hated the smell.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel smooth and frizz free.  Does not make it greasy like other products.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my hair so shiny and smooth. I do believe I will be using this product for a very long time !</li>
            <li> Kenra Products are great.  This product has made my hair more manageable. I use it everyday and won&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> apparently this shine isn&#x27;t the same as Kenra Shine in the 4ox spray .....I do not like this at all,  rubbing on hands makes my hands itchy after I apply to hair, as directed,  and I feel there isn&#x27;t any shine at all.....</li>
