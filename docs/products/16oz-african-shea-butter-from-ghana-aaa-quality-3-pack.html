            <li> This product is amazing!  Super moisturizing without greasiness.  I even use it on my face - love it!</li>

            <li> I have been using this shea butter for a couple of years, and I find it is the best moisturizer on the market. Whether battling the sub-zero temperatures in the mid-west or desert temperatures on the Pacific Coast.</li>
            <li> The product actually exceeded my expectations. I plan to reorder product&lt;br /&gt;In the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion. Great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Use on my skin which can get so dry it aches during the winter. I slather this everywhere on me. It does feel thick when rubbed in so I just make sure to do it at night before bed and walk around naked. Also use on my dog&#x27;s elbows in the summer. He has dandruff issues and his skin can get super dry. Rubbing some on every other day does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Can be really hard to first dig some out but the more the tub is used the more it seems to soften up.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes would buy again!</li>

            <li> I bought this product for a friend who uses it for a foot treatment in her spa. She has really loved the quality of the product. The smell was light and earthy and the paste texture softened quickly when rubbed between the hands. I will be ordering again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Great for african skin, no need for lotions</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Thank you vey much</li>
            <li> Tow arrived broken !!!</li>
