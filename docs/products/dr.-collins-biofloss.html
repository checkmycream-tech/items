    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This brand and Tom&#x27;s are the best on the market.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Great floss.</li>
            <li>Not the best floss ever, but certainly better than that slippery stuff that just doesn&#x27;t feel like it does the job.  </li>
            <li>But the reviews for BioFloss were so good, I felt compelled to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tastes good, though.  </li>
            <li>Simply a superior floss.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Very, very light minty flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a week to get the hang of using Biofloss, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush from the same company (Dr. Collins) is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you use the floss picks, but those are much better in my opinion</li>
            <li>Favorite all-time floss.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when you try to save money, it costs you more.</li>
            <li>The floss is really good at gently getting into the smallest of spots and scrubbing them clean.</li>
            <li>Once between the teeth it does a pretty good job scrubbing and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>The floss felt very waxy and it was too slippery to be effective.</li>
            <li>The SWEET mint flavor was sticky and the floss shredded too easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Using this floss leaves each tooth feeling squeaky clean below the gum line.</li>
            <li>Made in Holland, so quality is likely to be superior under auspices of the Dutch.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s any better than normal priced drug store floss.  </li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of glide and similar smooth flosses.  </li>
            <li>The floss works okay, but what I don&#x27;t like is that the powdery coating on the floss becomes as slippery as soap if your hands are not completely dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my first choice of floss.</li>
            <li>This really gets the crud out from between your teeth!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I need to break off a very generous piece of floss to get working, but if it gets my teeth cleaner, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I thought I might be able to use a different floss holder but the size didn&#x27;t match up.  </li>
            <li>You have to get used to the fine threads on this, but the design allows better cleaning in tight spots.</li>
            <li>Great floss really cleans crap from your teeth plus tastes good after doing it</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product until they provide a decent cutter for the thread!</li>
            <li>The price is very high for floss</li>
            <li>In fact, like thread, a scissors will strip the thread, unraveling it, and the container (which is also cheaply made) will come apart, and you will never get the roll of thread back in!</li>
            <li>It pulls so much junk out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Do not like as much as other flosses,  The flavor is just okay</li>
            <li>My old floss really didn&#x27;t do much at all</li>
            <li>The taste is kind of weird, and the floss does have a tendency not to cut cleanly off—if not for that, I would have given five stars.</li>
            <li>I used to be a dental-tape girl because my tightly-spaced teeth would shred normal floss.</li>
            <li>I can floss first with Glide floss and get almost nothing out of my teeth and then floss again with Biofloss and out comes all the food and plaque that Glide floss left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes regular floss seem kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>This really shreds despite its claim to be the next generation of floss.  </li>
            <li>The propensity to shred caused problems with my crown, leaving that tooth sensitive and irritated.</li>
            <li>Well, yes—I can totally feel that this has way more scraping power than regular floss, without being in any way sharp or abrasive.</li>
            <li>I love the minty taste that this floss leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>It is just not sharp enough!.</li>
            <li>The floss itself is good, but it is made of cloth, and the little aluminum cutter that comes with it is so cheaply made that you will have trouble cutting off a strand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too slick and could be improved if it had a little more resistance.</li>

            <li> Better than nothing, but not good if you have tight spaces between teeth.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think he gave Biofloss a long enough chance though.</li>
            <li> When I floss after brushing, I have to pull an extra long section of floss to wrap around my fingers in order for it to not slip off.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it snug while working it in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily a better user experience nor did I feel very much of a difference in my teeth after using in quite a few times in a row.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the difference between dusting with a microfiber cloth vs a dry paper towel: one dusts, the other does not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my usual brand</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think other brands I&#x27;ve used have this issue.</li>
            <li> I had previously gotten other types of stranded floss</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was less expensive and seemed to be close to smart floss.</li>
            <li> The filaments tend to separate when pulled down between teeth</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a full shred.</li>
            <li> Kinda sad the floss didn&#x27;t live up to those standards.</li>
            <li> and I felt it was a waste of time to use it.  </li>
            <li> Also, it left residue on my fingers from some sort of dusty substance on the floss.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it will be a mess!</li>
            <li> I had to find another floss to get this BioFloss out of my tight teeth!  </li>
            <li> it was not a fun flossing experiance to say the least.</li>
            <li> The cutting portion came off the 2nd time I used it.</li>
            <li> Serious bummer.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful to get it all under the cutting blade</li>
            <li> The thread is not wound tight, making it very difficult to cut.  </li>
            <li> The floss is hard to use because it&#x27;s very difficult to get a grip on it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The floss shredded so badly that I had to use &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; floss to remove this floss stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling!!</li>

            <li> Great floss. It&#x27;s now my first choice of floss. Used the entire package without experiencing a break or tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I agree with the other reviews. My second package shreds as it dispenses. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This really shreds despite its claim to be the next generation of floss.  I&#x27;m back to my usual brand</li>
            <li> This brand and Tom&#x27;s are the best on the market. You have to get used to the fine threads on this, but the design allows better cleaning in tight spots. Plenty of mint flavor. Made in Holland, so quality is likely to be superior under auspices of the Dutch.</li>
            <li> The filaments tend to separate when pulled down between teeth but it&#x27;s not a full shred. As long as you keep it snug while working it in I find that it stays together. Once between the teeth it does a pretty good job scrubbing and feels fresh. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This really gets the crud out from between your teeth!  My old floss really didn&#x27;t do much at all and I felt it was a waste of time to use it.  I love the minty taste that this floss leaves behind.  I have ordered the subscribe and save on this after trying it out.</li>
            <li> Well, yes—I can totally feel that this has way more scraping power than regular floss, without being in any way sharp or abrasive. The taste is kind of weird, and the floss does have a tendency not to cut cleanly off—if not for that, I would have given five stars. But I&#x27;m very glad I bought this! And definitely I&#x27;ll be making a permanent change. Makes regular floss seem kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this floss! The floss itself is good, but it is made of cloth, and the little aluminum cutter that comes with it is so cheaply made that you will have trouble cutting off a strand. It is just not sharp enough!. Not only that, but even a scissors won&#x27;t cut it, because it is made of cloth. In fact, like thread, a scissors will strip the thread, unraveling it, and the container (which is also cheaply made) will come apart, and you will never get the roll of thread back in! Do not buy this product until they provide a decent cutter for the thread!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  I was a huge fan of glide and similar smooth flosses.  I had previously gotten other types of stranded floss (colgate i think?) stuck in my teeth and once had to go to the dentist to get it removed.  But the reviews for BioFloss were so good, I felt compelled to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It took a week to get the hang of using Biofloss, but now I love it.  It pulls so much junk out of my teeth.  I can floss first with Glide floss and get almost nothing out of my teeth and then floss again with Biofloss and out comes all the food and plaque that Glide floss left behind.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I need to break off a very generous piece of floss to get working, but if it gets my teeth cleaner, it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my partner didn&#x27;t like it and is sticking with Glide.  I don&#x27;t think he gave Biofloss a long enough chance though.</li>
            <li> It claims it won&#x27;t shred, but it totally does.  Tastes good, though.  The toothbrush from the same company (Dr. Collins) is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Kinda sad the floss didn&#x27;t live up to those standards.</li>
            <li> its ripped apart....it was not a fun flossing experiance to say the least. I don&#x27;t know if you use the floss picks, but those are much better in my opinion</li>
            <li> I used to be a dental-tape girl because my tightly-spaced teeth would shred normal floss. Ugh! I hate that feeling!! Now that I&#x27;ve tried Biofloss, if I accidentally grab the tape, it feels like not even flossing in comparison--it&#x27;s just so inadequate compared to this stuff. It&#x27;s like the difference between dusting with a microfiber cloth vs a dry paper towel: one dusts, the other does not. Using this floss leaves each tooth feeling squeaky clean below the gum line. I have virtually no Tatar build-up between cleanings now. I will use nothing else!</li>
            <li> This floss shreds.  I had to find another floss to get this BioFloss out of my tight teeth!  Better than nothing, but not good if you have tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! You do have to be careful to get it all under the cutting blade other wise it will be a mess!</li>
            <li> The floss shredded so badly that I had to use &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; floss to remove this floss stuck between my teeth. Also, it left residue on my fingers from some sort of dusty substance on the floss. I ended up throwing it out. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to write unfavorable reviews. The floss felt very waxy and it was too slippery to be effective.</li>
            <li> The floss is hard to use because it&#x27;s very difficult to get a grip on it. It&#x27;s too slick and could be improved if it had a little more resistance. I probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Favorite all-time floss. Very, very light minty flavor. Does not burn my mouth like some flosses. The floss is really good at gently getting into the smallest of spots and scrubbing them clean. I have this floss as part of my Subscribe and Save, and hope to use it forever.</li>
            <li> Simply a superior floss.</li>
            <li> Serious bummer. I like the floss but the container is a piece of JUNK. The cutting portion came off the 2nd time I used it. I thought I might be able to use a different floss holder but the size didn&#x27;t match up.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great floss really cleans crap from your teeth plus tastes good after doing it</li>
            <li> The floss works okay, but what I don&#x27;t like is that the powdery coating on the floss becomes as slippery as soap if your hands are not completely dry. When I floss after brushing, I have to pull an extra long section of floss to wrap around my fingers in order for it to not slip off. I don&#x27;t think other brands I&#x27;ve used have this issue.</li>
            <li> I can see where Dr. Collins may have been trying to go with this.  That being said, it&#x27;s not for me.  The price is very high for floss and I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s any better than normal priced drug store floss.  It&#x27;s different.  It&#x27;s not necessarily a better user experience nor did I feel very much of a difference in my teeth after using in quite a few times in a row.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was less expensive and seemed to be close to smart floss. Big mistake. The propensity to shred caused problems with my crown, leaving that tooth sensitive and irritated. Sometimes when you try to save money, it costs you more.</li>
            <li> The thread is not wound tight, making it very difficult to cut.  tip: Roll the floss in your fingers before you run it through the cutter.</li>
            <li> Not the best floss ever, but certainly better than that slippery stuff that just doesn&#x27;t feel like it does the job.  It shreds if you don&#x27;t maneuver it in the right place and hold it with your finger at the right angle when using the cutting blade.</li>
            <li> Do not like as much as other flosses,  The flavor is just okay and it falls apart when using it./</li>
            <li> The SWEET mint flavor was sticky and the floss shredded too easily between my teeth.</li>
