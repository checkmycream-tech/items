            <li>GREAT grip, smooth sharp edges doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Right now I give these 5 stars!!  ;)</li>
            <li>By far my favorite tweezers in the house so easy to grip</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Plucking has never been so simple, and successful on the first tug.  </li>
            <li>more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I have owned many tweezers and this pair has been hands down my favorite!  </li>
            <li>and then recently I upgraded to a Tweezerman tweezer which I thought was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This little tweezers is great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to buy twenty dollar tweezers even though I seem to own several 5-10 dollar versions.  </li>
            <li>They are even great for pulling the very thin hairs, which makes me happy not to have to attempt many times to do with my other tweezers.</li>
            <li>Style is just right for my girly taste.</li>
            <li>The gripping pad is great and they are sharp enough to do exactly what you need them to do.</li>
            <li>These are metal all over kind of feel cheaply made and the main part of the tweezers are very long...</li>
            <li>I think regular tweezers are better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much money for a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li>I brought a pair of Tweezerman tweezers a few years ago which I loved to start with, but over time have become blunt.</li>
            <li>Essential for tweezing eyebrows quickly and easily the fine points grabs tiny eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>I  recommend these to anyone who wants to be able to tweeze their eyebrows in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li>Very sharp and does an amazing job</li>
            <li>They have a nice hand grip, and the point is very sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice grippy tweezers...other tweezers previously owned cannot compare to the performance of these.  </li>
            <li>They worked really well on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these and the reviews seemed great, but they are worse than my blunt Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers which don&#x27;t work very week</li>
            <li>I found the tweezers a bit rough on the edge and not as able to catch a hair</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than tweezers without a grip.</li>
            <li>i have such an easy time getting the precision in my brows that i want with these tweezers highly recommend</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Says it works better than any other tweezers she&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li>They are also cute and stylish with the colors black and pink.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much better these work than just the average set of tweezers.</li>
            <li>These are my new go-to tweezers!</li>
            <li>Love the colors, got mine in black.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel tweezers are very sharp and easily grips the hair or what ever you are using them for.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s harder to work with it comfortable while plucking and</li>
            <li>I like the pink indentation for fingers, nicely detailed and packaged.</li>
            <li>and I should&#x27;ve spent the money long ago to get a nice pair.</li>
            <li>Very sharp though can pull skin easily be careful but if you are paying close attention then they will do good to get the stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Used them on my upper lip and eye brows today, and was able to clean up the hairs that all of my tweezers were not able to do!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a new holy grail for me (product I swear by)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stocking up - good ones are so hard to find!!</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very sharp,  and precise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find the right tweezers that hold well and with a strong enough grip.  </li>
            <li>and the handle is soft</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and a speedy delivery with professional follow up.</li>
            <li>They offer free sharpening, but I was lazy and thought it easier to buy a new pair and also hoped to find a pair that wouldn&#x27;t go blunt</li>
            <li>If these ever get misplaced I will absolutely order again!!!</li>
            <li>am excited to try these during firewood season, all those little splinters....</li>
            <li>on larger, easier hairs (eyebrows, bikini area, face) but the smaller and finer hairs were going wild.  </li>
            <li>The cushion grip was great for my hand that cramp easily.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> They have a nice hand grip, and the point is very sharp.</li>

            <li> They worked really well on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these and the reviews seemed great, but they are worse than my blunt Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers which don&#x27;t work very week</li>
            <li> I found the tweezers a bit rough on the edge and not as able to catch a hair</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than tweezers without a grip.</li>
            <li> i have such an easy time getting the precision in my brows that i want with these tweezers highly recommend</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much better these work than just the average set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are my new go-to tweezers!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, got mine in black.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel tweezers are very sharp and easily grips the hair or what ever you are using them for.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder to work with it comfortable while plucking and</li>
            <li> I like the pink indentation for fingers, nicely detailed and packaged.</li>
            <li> and I should&#x27;ve spent the money long ago to get a nice pair.</li>
            <li> Very sharp though can pull skin easily be careful but if you are paying close attention then they will do good to get the stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Used them on my upper lip and eye brows today, and was able to clean up the hairs that all of my tweezers were not able to do!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a new holy grail for me (product I swear by)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stocking up - good ones are so hard to find!!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp,  and precise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the right tweezers that hold well and with a strong enough grip.  </li>
            <li> and the handle is soft</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and a speedy delivery with professional follow up.</li>
            <li> They offer free sharpening, but I was lazy and thought it easier to buy a new pair and also hoped to find a pair that wouldn&#x27;t go blunt</li>
            <li> If these ever get misplaced I will absolutely order again!!!</li>
            <li> am excited to try these during firewood season, all those little splinters....</li>
            <li> on larger, easier hairs (eyebrows, bikini area, face) but the smaller and finer hairs were going wild.  </li>
            <li> The cushion grip was great for my hand that cramp easily.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The tip &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; the most stubborn hair that my other tweezers fail to get.  </li>
            <li> These work just fine, but I&#x27;d say average,  not great.</li>
            <li> pink circle grip in the middle</li>
            <li> I primarily tweeze hairs that are tough to grab, and these are no better than any other pair I&#x27;ve gotten from stores like marshall&#x27;s in the $5-8 range.</li>
            <li> These are going to work really good for getting those little annoying pieces of wood out of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Other tweezers out there do not have the grips and the metal after awhile hurts your hands, this one does not.</li>
            <li> These are seriously sharp.</li>
            <li> found these to pluck the hairs easier then any other tweezers I have ever owned .Not</li>
            <li> if you press down on it hard enough it can pop out..</li>
            <li> I gave it a found only because of the pink plastic grips, I wish they were made of rubber instead of a thin plastic.  </li>
            <li> They will get every little hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it.</li>

            <li> These tweezers are superior to the other ones I own. These tweezers are very sharp,  and precise.  and the grips  The unique design of the tweezers make it easier to grip the tweezers  to help provide for very comfortable accurate tweeting.</li>
            <li> I got this for a spare to keep in my makeup bag when I am traveling. This is such a great product. The grips on the tweezers is amazing. It actually makes plucking eyebrows easier. Other tweezers out there do not have the grips and the metal after awhile hurts your hands, this one does not. Overall a great product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Comfortable handle and very easy to grip.</li>
            <li> love these tweezers. they work great.</li>
            <li> I gave it a found only because of the pink plastic grips, I wish they were made of rubber instead of a thin plastic.  Other than that it is a great product.  Style is just right for my girly taste.</li>
            <li> This little tweezers is great. I love the silicone non slip material on the handles. The stainless steel tweezers are very sharp and easily grips the hair or what ever you are using them for. The colors makes it easy to keep up with these as well. We&#x27;ve all been known to lose a pair.</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME!  They are the SHARPEST TWEEZERS I have ever owned!  The even get the tiniest hairs!!  Used them on my upper lip and eye brows today, and was able to clean up the hairs that all of my tweezers were not able to do!  Hope my post in the next year is as possitive is this one!  Right now I give these 5 stars!!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;z</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers for the price. Very sharp though can pull skin easily be careful but if you are paying close attention then they will do good to get the stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of these Stainless Steel tweezers with cushion grip.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to hold and use. The slant tip is great for getting those fine stubborn hairs.They worked really well on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to try these during firewood season, all those little splinters....These are going to work really good for getting those little annoying pieces of wood out of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to test and review these tweezers from Tweezerboss, and am really glad I get to test them and give my opinion of how they work for me!&lt;br /&gt;I love the color combination. The cushion grip was great for my hand that cramp easily.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. High quality!</li>
            <li> My wife loves hers.  Says it works better than any other tweezers she&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers!!! so easy to use and the handle is soft i have such an easy time getting the precision in my brows that i want with these tweezers highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are metal all over kind of feel cheaply made and the main part of the tweezers are very long... It works to pluck my eyebrows but find it difficult to use without cutting or grabbing skin.. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it. I think regular tweezers are better. They are big so it&#x27;s harder to work with it comfortable while plucking and etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also pink circle grip in the middle if you press down on it hard enough it can pop out.. So Nay not for me.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers ! Great quality. I Have no problems with them. They are even great for pulling the very thin hairs, which makes me happy not to have to attempt many times to do with my other tweezers. I  recommend these to anyone who wants to be able to tweeze their eyebrows in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dull tweezers all my life and I should&#x27;ve spent the money long ago to get a nice pair. These are seriously sharp. I got these for a cheap price, but I would pay $10 for a nice pair.. I&#x27;m considering getting more pairs for family members.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned!!  Keeping all those ugly and unwanted hairs gone!!!</li>
            <li> Work wonderfully and super cute!</li>
            <li> I brought a pair of Tweezerman tweezers a few years ago which I loved to start with, but over time have become blunt. They offer free sharpening, but I was lazy and thought it easier to buy a new pair and also hoped to find a pair that wouldn&#x27;t go blunt so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these and the reviews seemed great, but they are worse than my blunt Tweezerman tweezers. Maybe I got a dud pair, but I&#x27;m sending them back.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these tweezers. The grip is comfortable and I love the bright pink, making them easy to spot in a drawer or bag. But perhaps I&#x27;m spoiled with my Mr. Tweezerman tweezers. These work just fine, but I&#x27;d say average,  not great. I primarily tweeze hairs that are tough to grab, and these are no better than any other pair I&#x27;ve gotten from stores like marshall&#x27;s in the $5-8 range.</li>
            <li> These are my new go-to tweezers! I can&#x27;t bring myself to buy twenty dollar tweezers even though I seem to own several 5-10 dollar versions.  My search for the perfect pair stops here.  I received these at promotional pricing, but they&#x27;re on my wishlist, too just in case they lose their grip.  I&#x27;ll replace them with another identical pair.  The grip thing is what makes the biggest difference, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This design is good to hold on to plug the unwanted hair. I&#x27;ll get another set for my mom</li>
            <li> Love the grips! The precision is also fabulous. Got a pair for my daughter too!&lt;br /&gt;I hope the sharpness and precision are lasting for the life of the product.</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers which don&#x27;t work very week and then recently I upgraded to a Tweezerman tweezer which I thought was pretty good.  This is even better than my Tweezerman!! This is very precise without grabbing any skin.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned!! They will get every little hair. Must have</li>
            <li> I have owned many tweezers and this pair has been hands down my favorite!  The wider area for your fingers make accuracy so my easier!  If these ever get misplaced I will absolutely order again!!!</li>
            <li> The tweezers have a good grip and its very good for small subborn hairs to get</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers, they have a great grip.</li>

            <li> Very precise tool. I like the pink indentation for fingers, nicely detailed and packaged.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers they are precise and work great</li>
            <li> I found the tweezers a bit rough on the edge and not as able to catch a hair as well as I expected. I reported this to the seller, just as an informational item. The seller was wonderful! Immediately gave me a refund, and I didn&#x27;t even ask for one, figuring I could make do with the tweezers, even if they weren&#x27;t my favorite. With no hesitation, I would buy, again, from this seller.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much money for a pair of tweezers! But, I&#x27;m glad I did.  Revlon, Sally&#x27;s, generic on sale at Ross, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Most work okay on larger, easier hairs (eyebrows, bikini area, face) but the smaller and finer hairs were going wild.  These have been awesome, I should&#x27;ve shelled out years ago. I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay ten bucks for something I could get for two or three! Plucking has never been so simple, and successful on the first tug.  Definitely a new holy grail for me (product I swear by)</li>
            <li> work very good very well built and very good at getting hair love them</li>

            <li> Very sharp and does an amazing job</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I absolutely love these tweezers.  The gripping pad is great and they are sharp enough to do exactly what you need them to do. Had a hard time choosing the color I wanted but when they came in I was happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> The grip on these is so amazing. Much easier to use than tweezers without a grip.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing! They have a great grip and they are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Great pair of tweezers! It has a nice surprisingly heavier weight than expected. They are great quality, very comfy to hold. The ends meet together without gaps like cheapo pairs. Very easy to use. Highly recommend. Love the colors, got mine in black.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite tweezers in the house so easy to grip</li>
