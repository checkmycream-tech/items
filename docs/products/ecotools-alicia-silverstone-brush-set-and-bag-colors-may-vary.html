            <li>I use all the brushes and it&#x27;s great how they are in a separate, clear section.  </li>

            <li>This was my first EcoTools purchase and I am absolutely satisfied!</li>
            <li>So I was very lucky.</li>
            <li>a separate compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  The first one I ordered was from Amazing Innovation, which I returned.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush for foundation and the brush for mascara, but I find all of the brushes to be of excellent quality for the small price.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product and I love it, like most brushes here on amazon they smell when u first get them, which these dont.</li>
            <li>They are always good quality and very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and I loved the handle of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Detailed eye shading brush</li>
            <li>Overall, a really great set.</li>
            <li>They are such a great product for their value.</li>
            <li>I was needing a bag with brushes for my everyday makeup, and this is just perfect for</li>
            <li>The makeup brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed and the bag is a good size.</li>
            <li>And it gets brownie points for being eco and animal friendly.</li>
            <li>Love the tapered powder brush, large concealer brush &amp; lip</li>
            <li>I have been using ecotools brushes for years now, and I have found that they are much softer and more durable than brushes made with animal hair.  </li>
            <li>Alicia brushes are really cool and work well with my makeup.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s just the right size to fit all her makeup</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for soft, nice, easy to use makeup brush set or just need new brushes (like I did), then this may be the set for you.</li>
            <li>Such a great price :) I really like the brushes for my bare minerals makeup and, of course, that they are earth-friendly and non-animal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brown(pretty golden brown).</li>

            <li>I love how natural it all is.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds on brushes and some aren&#x27;t as good of these.</li>
            <li>These are fine for the price, good for traveling, love the little case with the extra compartment for makeup items.</li>
            <li>I received this brush set yesterday and went right to work on trying them out.  </li>
            <li>A bit small, but still works great.</li>
            <li>They are soft and apply my mineral makeup smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It feels great to use products that minimize my negative impact on the earth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would definitely order this product again! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The color was more a burlap brown with an entirely different pattern.  </li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it for powder all over my face, but It&#x27;s good for touch-ups or putting extra powder on your nose or other places where you want more than just the light dusting you get from a powder brush.  </li>
            <li>There is a unique tapered, fluffy brush w/ a smaller brush head, which is great for setting under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>: It really is mini.</li>
            <li>However, it works very well.</li>
            <li>But I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like her brushes</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>I also really like the bag</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand much about makeup, but I am going to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>And I liked all the other designs I&#x27;ve seen so far, so even if I didn&#x27;t get the one pictured since it said \\&quot;colors may vary\\</li>
            <li>Finally - high quality AND reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>For blush, less is more.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are enclosed in a zipped pocket on the side of the bag&#x27;s main compartment, which also has a zipper.  </li>
            <li>The other section is just the right size to fit all my daily makeup items.  </li>
            <li>The bag in the picture has the new design.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>Love the entire kit but especially this latter brush.</li>
            <li>and I got the exact same brush set pictured.  </li>
            <li>Comes with some nice brushes, and an empty pocket on the other side to keep your makeup.  </li>
            <li>They r so so soft.</li>
            <li>The bag I received is tan with the red/orange/purple watercolor floral print (the old Alicia design).  </li>
            <li>Unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;rushes are soft......</li>
            <li>When i purchased this i was excited i wouldn&#x27;t have to spend big dollars on brushes but was let down.  </li>
            <li>I got the green one, but the pink one looks cute too.  </li>
            <li>the only brushes that worked and were soft were the jumbo blush once.</li>
            <li>This case is a bit larger than what I would normally carry in my handbag, but when I use a smaller purse, this goes into my tote instead.  </li>

            <li> I also really like the bag</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand much about makeup, but I am going to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> And I liked all the other designs I&#x27;ve seen so far, so even if I didn&#x27;t get the one pictured since it said \\&quot;colors may vary\\</li>
            <li> Finally - high quality AND reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> For blush, less is more.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are enclosed in a zipped pocket on the side of the bag&#x27;s main compartment, which also has a zipper.  </li>
            <li> The other section is just the right size to fit all my daily makeup items.  </li>
            <li> The bag in the picture has the new design.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Love the entire kit but especially this latter brush.</li>
            <li> and I got the exact same brush set pictured.  </li>
            <li> Comes with some nice brushes, and an empty pocket on the other side to keep your makeup.  </li>
            <li> They r so so soft.</li>
            <li> The bag I received is tan with the red/orange/purple watercolor floral print (the old Alicia design).  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;rushes are soft......</li>
            <li> When i purchased this i was excited i wouldn&#x27;t have to spend big dollars on brushes but was let down.  </li>
            <li> I got the green one, but the pink one looks cute too.  </li>
            <li> the only brushes that worked and were soft were the jumbo blush once.</li>
            <li> This case is a bit larger than what I would normally carry in my handbag, but when I use a smaller purse, this goes into my tote instead.  </li>
            <li> : I was a little scared that this brush wouldn&#x27;t be very good, having been immensely disappointed with the eye shading brush in the 5 pc.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t have any experience with foundation brushes (I usually use my fingers), so I can&#x27;t give much feedback.  </li>
            <li> then the one in the picture, and so that was what I expected would happen for me too, but when it arrived it was actually the same as the picture</li>
            <li> The brushes are actually nicer than I expected, &amp; the case fits plenty.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews said, they received a different bag</li>
            <li> only complaint is that Amazon actually sent me a bag with a design that is different from what is pictured in the item listing.  </li>
            <li> It works well with both pressed and loose powder eyeshadow, as well as cream eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I got lots of brushes, some r totally black, some r mixed brown( like dry grass).</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there was no full size powder brush in it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just a little design on the back, and the rest is an off-white color.</li>
            <li> The brushes are way softer than expected.</li>
            <li> (my daughter favors the pink)  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am keeping this is due to the trouble of having to return it.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are in one clear-covered compartment, with another compartment for other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get those stray strands that come out of other brushes over time.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were an added plus and they stay where they are supposed to due to the elastic holders.</li>
            <li> However, its not just the color that was wrong, the pattern on the product was totally different that the pattern I chose and the color didn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;vary&amp;#34;, it was completely different.  </li>
            <li> I got one that was burlap with green grass.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few of these for gifts.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird, but I only wear liquid foundation on my nose, to control oil.</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of brushes to leave at work &amp; needed a small cosmetic case too.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I suggest future buyers be wary of ordering since you probably will not get what you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li> however I am extremely disappointed in the blatant change to my original order.  </li>
            <li> they were stiff!!</li>
            <li> now i am addicted to these brushes</li>
            <li> EcoTools feel just like my expensive</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that my brush kit was missing some brushes.</li>

            <li> When i purchased this i was excited i wouldn&#x27;t have to spend big dollars on brushes but was let down.  they were stiff!! They don&#x27;t pick up color. they sat in my makeup bag for years until i ran out of brushes and found use for them. They aid better at picking up liquid makeup, they still didn&#x27;t blend. the only brushes that worked and were soft were the jumbo blush once. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase nor would i recommend</li>
            <li> These are fine for the price, good for traveling, love the little case with the extra compartment for makeup items.</li>
            <li> I really like these. They are soft and apply my mineral makeup smoothly and evenly. Also, no bristles popping out and sticking to my face (which happens with cheaper brushes). Great quality, great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazily in love with these brushes. This is the first time I order Ecotools &amp; they don&#x27;t disappoint me, in fact they are so great. They r so so soft. I love the color of bristles too. It&#x27;s brown(pretty golden brown). I got lots of brushes, some r totally black, some r mixed brown( like dry grass). But this is the prettiest &amp; best brush set I&#x27;ve ever own.   [[ASIN:B004KTCU0K Ecotools, Alicia Silverstone Brush Set and Bag]]</li>
            <li> I love the way this bag was designed.  The brushes are enclosed in a zipped pocket on the side of the bag&#x27;s main compartment, which also has a zipper.  The brushes themselves are fantastic.  I have been using ecotools brushes for years now, and I have found that they are much softer and more durable than brushes made with animal hair.  I especially love the powder and blush brushes.  The powder \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; brush is perfect for mineral makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that Amazon actually sent me a bag with a design that is different from what is pictured in the item listing.  The bag I received is tan with the red/orange/purple watercolor floral print (the old Alicia design).  The bag in the picture has the new design.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this from my local drugstore. It&#x27;s great!!   Blush Brush: Unbelievably soft. A bit small, but still works great. Doesn&#x27;t put a ton of product on, which is good. For blush, less is more.  Mini foundation brush: I know it&#x27;s weird, but I only wear liquid foundation on my nose, to control oil. I tried the brush, and it seems very good. However, I don&#x27;t have any experience with foundation brushes (I usually use my fingers), so I can&#x27;t give much feedback.  Mini powder brush: It really is mini. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it for powder all over my face, but It&#x27;s good for touch-ups or putting extra powder on your nose or other places where you want more than just the light dusting you get from a powder brush.  Detailed eye shading brush: I was a little scared that this brush wouldn&#x27;t be very good, having been immensely disappointed with the eye shading brush in the 5 pc. mineral makeup set. However, it works very well. It works well with both pressed and loose powder eyeshadow, as well as cream eyeshadow. It can also be used for eyeliner or a smokey eye affect, though I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  Spoolie brush: I&#x27;ve never seen one of these brushes before. But I really like it. It&#x27;s just like a mascara wand. It works great to comb my eyelashes and groom my brows. I think it works even better than a eyebrow/eyelash comb.  Makeup bag: very cute, good design. The brushes are in one clear-covered compartment, with another compartment for other cosmetics. Great for travel, but I don&#x27;t think it would ft all of my makeup. I wear a lot of mineral makeup, which often has bulky packaging. It&#x27;s very simple. There&#x27;s just a little design on the back, and the rest is an off-white color. However, that is how it is pictured.  Overall, a really great set. Great value. Perfect for travel, but also good for daily use. I love ecotools brushes. They are always good quality and very soft. Plus, they are good for the environment.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth the money! The brushes are way softer than expected. I would recommend these to everyone. No issues with them at all.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that my brush kit was missing some brushes. It was not the same kit as pictures. I should have read the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li> I still use these three years later....amazing brushes for the price...I will only buy Eco-Tools now i am addicted to these brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a teenage girl.  The makeup brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed and the bag is a good size.</li>
            <li> Reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase the product but I am glad I did. I received the product fairly quicker than I had anticipated and despite what some reviews stated I got exactly how the picture has it. I am very pleased with the product and the bristles are sooo soft its great!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Amazing make up brushes :) And I love that they are all natural. Rock on, Ecotools \^/ I like the variety of brushes included and the ecofriendliness of the bag.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend who travels. She said it&#x27;s just the right size to fit all her makeup, it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li> The brushes and bag are awesome!  I love how they are ecofriendly.  I use all the brushes and it&#x27;s great how they are in a separate, clear section.  The other section is just the right size to fit all my daily makeup items.  I love how natural it all is.  Well worth buying and when I&#x27;ve shown family and friends, they love it and want one too!  A great value and a buy I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a make-up artist for 10 years and love eco-tools. They are such a great product for their value. I have spent hundreds on brushes and some aren&#x27;t as good of these. PLUS! The bag is so cute!</li>
            <li> I ordered this bag specifically because of the picture.  I loved the design.  And I liked all the other designs I&#x27;ve seen so far, so even if I didn&#x27;t get the one pictured since it said \\&quot;colors may vary\\&quot; I figured I&#x27;d still get one I liked.  But that&#x27;s not what I got.  I got one that was burlap with green grass.  I hate burlap.&lt;br /&gt;It got one extra star because the size was perfect for what I needed and I like that the brushes have a separate compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  The first one I ordered was from Amazing Innovation, which I returned.  I reordered from Dobbys Deals and got what was pictured, which I am now very happy with.</li>
            <li> I love my ecotools bag and brushes. It feels great to use products that minimize my negative impact on the earth and it&#x27;s inhabitants. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The bag and the brushes were great. The brushes are very soft and I loved the handle of the brushes. This is a great value for 5 brushes and a cute bag. As the other reviews said, they received a different bag then the one in the picture, and so that was what I expected would happen for me too, but when it arrived it was actually the same as the picture shown(which is what I wanted). So I was very lucky. Overall it is a great buy for good quality brushes and bag.</li>
            <li> This was my first EcoTools purchase and I am absolutely satisfied! The brushes are very soft, great quality, and are super affordable! I usually purchase more expensive brushes since they seem to be softer and more durable than others I have tried in the past. EcoTools feel just like my expensive brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bag because there is a separate compartment for your makeup. I like to separate my brushes from my makeup in case of spillage... wouldn&#x27;t want to ruin a $30-$40 brush! And now, I don&#x27;t have to carry 2 makeup bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order this product again! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Eureka! These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! Finally - high quality AND reasonably priced.  You don&#x27;t get those stray strands that come out of other brushes over time.  I&#x27;ll never spend money on a MAC brush again.  The case is the perfect size for all of my makeup and I don&#x27;t have to try to shove my regular brushes into the case.  A separate plastic section for the brushes is a great idea, too.  I received the bag as pictured above.  This case is a bit larger than what I would normally carry in my handbag, but when I use a smaller purse, this goes into my tote instead.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few of these for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the tapered powder brush, large concealer brush &amp; lip brush(I use as a touch-up brush). There is a unique tapered, fluffy brush w/ a smaller brush head, which is great for setting under eye concealer. Love the entire kit but especially this latter brush.</li>
            <li> I really like her brushes and I really liked the bag. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there was no full size powder brush in it. I did have to buy this one seperately. I like the foundation brush it works really well. I also really like the bag it is very handy and compact and was easy to take when I went on vacation. Alicia brushes are really cool and work well with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I received this brush set yesterday and went right to work on trying them out.  I love the brush for foundation and the brush for mascara, but I find all of the brushes to be of excellent quality for the small price.  They were definitely in the case pictured, for those who were worried about getting a different case and I got the exact same brush set pictured.  I ordered this for a present, but after seeing the quality of the brushes, I decided to keep them for myself, and will be ordering a second set as a gift!  Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for soft, nice, easy to use makeup brush set or just need new brushes (like I did), then this may be the set for you.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and the bab is quite convenient.  B&lt;br /&gt;rushes are soft...... i would recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> This brand is always a great value for me. The tools are great quality, I use them often, and love that they&#x27;re eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;The colour of the bag was as advertised and the size of the bag was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this cosmetic bag!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I love it, like most brushes here on amazon they smell when u first get them, which these dont. They are great quality and the bag is great also! I just really wanted to say that the description is kind of misleading, it says that these are mini brushes, and they are really full sized so that was a good surprise!!! I would definitely buy this item again!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my sister who lives overseas. The set is too cute. I don&#x27;t understand much about makeup, but I am going to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes and the case they came in is excellent for travel.  The bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> I was needing a bag with brushes for my everyday makeup, and this is just perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;It fits the makeup that I need to carry with me and it is a gorgeous bag. I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love how it has a brush holder area on the side and it is a nice design and eco friendly.</li>
            <li> I love ecotools! Such a great price :) I really like the brushes for my bare minerals makeup and, of course, that they are earth-friendly and non-animal.</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of brushes to leave at work &amp; needed a small cosmetic case too. This fit the bill for both! The brushes are actually nicer than I expected, &amp; the case fits plenty.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy this set until I saw it at a store for only $5.00. Love the set. Love ecotools â™¥</li>
            <li> I love the foundation and power brush! The feel is great and the hairs don&#x27;t fall off! And it gets brownie points for being eco and animal friendly.</li>
            <li> What a cute bag...perfect for all of my makeup needs. The brushes were an added plus and they stay where they are supposed to due to the elastic holders. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my daughter.  I am very disappointed.  They made a disclaimer in the product description that &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34;.  However, its not just the color that was wrong, the pattern on the product was totally different that the pattern I chose and the color didn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;vary&amp;#34;, it was completely different.  The color was more a burlap brown with an entirely different pattern.  (my daughter favors the pink)  I&#x27;m sure the product itself will function as described however I am extremely disappointed in the blatant change to my original order.  The only reason I am keeping this is due to the trouble of having to return it.  For this reason, I suggest future buyers be wary of ordering since you probably will not get what you see in the picture.  I would not at this time recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I got the green one, but the pink one looks cute too.  Comes with some nice brushes, and an empty pocket on the other side to keep your makeup.  it&#x27;s handy for traveling too.</li>
