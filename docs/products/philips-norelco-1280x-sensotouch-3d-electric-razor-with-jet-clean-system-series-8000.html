            <li>Very nice product!</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very good electric razor though.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 1280XCC SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  is very good</li>
            <li>Just under my chin was one area and this razor does a very good job there as well as the neck.</li>
            <li>Very good product, the long-awaited.</li>
            <li>seems to be a very good razor.</li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>and--worse--my face was incredibly irritated by this razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember electric razors giving an incredible close shave before, but it has been over 10 years since I used one.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, I use it in the shower and it does a excellent job without the irritation.</li>
            <li>He is very happy, and says it works great.</li>
            <li>shave is incredible.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and stunned by the output, it gave me the best shave I have experienced...</li>
            <li>It took about a week for my beard to adjust, but now I get an incredibly close shave from this electric razor.</li>
            <li>and if you are in market looking for one this is as good unit to consider!</li>
            <li>My husband loved it!  </li>
            <li>so good!</li>
            <li>The swivel head ensures maximum contact between the shaver and my skin, and I have not had any instances of razor burn, ingrown hairs or bumps, which is a very exceptional outcome.    </li>
            <li>Thank you Philips Norelco for another great product and thank you Amazon for another GREAT deal on this great shaver!</li>
            <li>The design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>grip and good quality materials, the kit for washing the razor is also a great tool to use!</li>
            <li>Its beautiful.</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hands and the shaving grip is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Thank you Philips Norelco for another great product and thank you Amazon for another GREAT deal on this great shaver!and</li>
            <li>GREAT Product, 5 stars+ for me....</li>
            <li>I have favored the wet/dry razors since they came out because I can use them in the shower and save time.</li>
            <li>can i say it GREAT</li>
            <li>Buy it and you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a while, but the battery performance dropped off after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt that will be a great experience as well.  </li>
            <li>Great electric Shaver.</li>
            <li>Great for every day</li>
            <li>Great shaver.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Things working great</li>
            <li>... happy and all ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, cut my water bill by $40 a month since I used to run the water while I shaved with the razor....</li>
            <li>Phillips makes a great product.</li>
            <li>Great Job Norelco, give this shaver two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>The product reviews for this looked great, the videos looked great, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the pop out trimmer is not that great</li>
            <li>and i am happy that i got Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>All in all great unit</li>
            <li>then which to a rotary shaver, like the Philips/Norelco 1280X/42 and experienced skin irritation?  </li>
            <li>I am happy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2: GREAT DESIGN&lt;</li>
            <li>I had never used an electric razor, but this works great.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning function is great for the absent minded.</li>
            <li>This item works great.</li>
            <li>Great display for minutes charging/left.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>- Looks great  </li>
            <li>Great razor, but upset about losing the upc label for the $30 rebate.</li>
            <li>The tech is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>And the travel case for it is great too.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>I have to say how great this shaver is</li>
            <li>Great shaver, except when the blades(Head) wears out you must through it away.  </li>
            <li>The ability to use shaving cream has helped greatly with the transition from a manual razor.</li>
            <li>once I did it also works great.</li>
            <li>but now it shaves great.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver, wonder why Philips stopped making it.</li>
            <li>in all a great shaver</li>
            <li>Cleaning system does a great job.</li>
            <li>As advertised, works great, including in the shower.</li>
            <li>Sounds great.  </li>
            <li>* Gives a great shave  *</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great that while cleaning the shaver recharges as well, keeping it charged for me.  </li>
            <li>is happy w/</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>1280Xcc---WOW, I am so happy with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>and this works out great for me.</li>
            <li>It works great and with shaving cream</li>
            <li>is great</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>That depends greatly on what you want it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>The LCD is very attractive and the cleaner is nice, although a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>But it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Happy with it.</li>
            <li>Have had and used this razor for over a year now and the razor works great.</li>

            <li>Extremely great shaves.  </li>
            <li>It worked really great either way.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, very suitable for my husband!</li>
            <li>love it !!</li>
            <li>very nice</li>
            <li>Fits well in the hand and glides over the face very nicely.</li>
            <li>very nice deal on this philpis shaver.</li>
            <li>I from China，I like it，It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>If you can deal with that, it&#x27;s a very nice unit to use.  </li>
            <li>Has a very nice quality feel to it.</li>
            <li>very nice carrying case</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, this Norelco handled a 2-3 day growth very nicely.</li>
            <li>Very nice way to start the day</li>
            <li>really nice!  </li>
            <li>A remarkable product.</li>
            <li>This latest model of the Norelco Senso Touch is the best Electric Razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this one for me and I have to say I am even more impressed than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am writing this review more than 3 years after purchasing it and it&#x27;s just as wonderful  </li>
            <li>no doubt this is easily the very best experience  &amp; totally happy.</li>
            <li>This is one of the quietest electrics I&#x27;ve ever used, being pleasantly suprised by the tone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and good to use!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I need stuff\\&quot;  their items sell at a very good price and the company&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING.  </li>
            <li>Amazing shave, great price.</li>
            <li>and I thought I loved it.  </li>
            <li>(2) good looking  </li>
            <li>just to hold it upright for a good looking?    </li>
            <li>shave is good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another one for travel as it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>Received this product 2 days after ordering in good packaging&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Good luck in your search.</li>
            <li>for years I brought razors and blades,blades,blades,but I never wanted to pay the price of a good electric.</li>
            <li>It was a good shaver but the motor went out.</li>
            <li>good razor</li>
            <li>All in all, if you are a electric fan, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a good choice, but won&#x27;t replace a manual for me.</li>
            <li>Makes good business sense for them to design it that way.  </li>
            <li>Good price comparing to market</li>
            <li>Good battery, hold about 1 hour of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>AND PROVIDES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really loved that razor, but it&#x27;s time was up.</li>
            <li>We gave it to our son for Christmas and he was delighted.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is superior to that of the Braun.</li>
            <li>this is a good one to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a good one to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They quit making the good RQ-12 Heads.  </li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>, so good so good sogood  </li>
            <li>I have not had a good shave in fifty years until i purchased the norelco 1280 xcc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh yea, can&#x27;t make $$ if you make them too good.</li>
            <li>the reviews on this are so good, i had to order it and try.</li>
            <li>Wether shaving with electric or blade, I&#x27;ve always gotten fairly irritated because of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I loved this thing, but I cannot get good replacable blades.</li>
            <li>They tell you to give it 21 days to get used to it and get a good shave</li>
            <li>just so I would have a fair comparison</li>
            <li>but for now, it does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>They both do really good job of getting a close shave</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>than that seames to do a good job</li>
            <li>One of the best features is the charging stand which keeps the shave fully charged at all times while allowing you to shave cord free.</li>
            <li>Philips&#x27;s quality is good.</li>
            <li>, Philips product always good quality, if there have any promotion, don&#x27;t miss</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.  </li>

            <li>My husband is very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>great works like a top</li>
            <li>its good for keeping a nice look ,travel a lot ,but nothing beats a razor shave, after one yr.</li>
            <li>nice product, good price</li>
            <li>one seems to be the best shaver on the market right now.  </li>
            <li>I was originally very happy with this shaver -- it was very gentle</li>
            <li>Very good, cool</li>
            <li>If you are giving it as a gift, the guy you give this to will love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did, although it&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor it is a closer shave than clippers and my bumps are gone!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>I tried this shaver the first couple of days and wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing!  </li>
            <li>Come on Philips you could do better!</li>
            <li>Outstanding shave!</li>
            <li>TOP!</li>
            <li>It is, in a word, BETTER!  </li>
            <li>and he love it!</li>
            <li>(It better be for the amount Norelco is charging for the replacement heads!)</li>
            <li>and I was never quite sure how best to clean it</li>
            <li>The travel lock works great, and the battery easily lasts for weeks of travel before it needs a charge.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasure to use and easy to maintain, adding great value to my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Great product haven&#x27;t had any problems, easy to use &amp; the closest shave for men &amp; women (in all the areas you want to go).</li>
            <li>Great feel, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks the shave was not as close as I would have liked but as my skin has become use to the razor it has a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>The razor sounds very light, shave is very smooth, very nice.</li>
            <li>perfect, fell in love when i first saw it!</li>
            <li>However, the shave was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>3D head is amazing allowing the razor to stay in contact with my face.</li>
            <li>The feature of self cleaning is amazing.</li>
            <li>and that is amazing</li>
            <li>The shave is great, the cleaning tray is great and the razor itself is nicel great buy and would definitely stick to this brand</li>
            <li>Great shave, smooth and close without irritation to the skin.  </li>
            <li>is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Well built, amazing quality.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>but when you don&#x27;t have time for that like me some mornings its great to pull out and just use for my face with light neck and moustache cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros- looks amazing</li>
            <li>I suffer from razor bumps and this shaver is just amazing.</li>
            <li>looks amazing and the self cleaning is just out of this world.</li>
            <li>and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Looks great, fortunately, the razor is not made in China, although the charger is.</li>
            <li>Shave quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>I shaver is nice to hold, but that can be said for the Braun.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and probably the best I&#x27;ve had, but I am giving up on trying to find an electric razor that gives a shave as close as the traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is quieter and has a nice shape.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself had a nice flexible design and the cleaning system returned the razor to a \\&quot;new\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li>-&#x27;s:  Still not as effective as a manual on the lip area</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s handy and compact travel case which accomodates the charger</li>
            <li>Gave a nice close shave,</li>
            <li>and I had to figure it out on my own.</li>
            <li>Really good, love it.</li>
            <li>Turns out that the battery capacity rose after 1-2 cycles to 41-42 min, which is where it is now.  </li>
            <li>I bought for my uncle, he really like it and feel very happy!  </li>
            <li>include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>but then again I use the nice ones.</li>
            <li>Recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great shave!</li>
            <li>Probably the best gift I ever got him cause he gets so much use out of it.</li>
            <li>I liked the Braun</li>
            <li>It contains its own battery, so you are not chained to an outlet while you shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves my face beautifully, but my true test is my neck which gave all electric shavers I have tried problems.</li>
            <li>I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Razor fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet</li>
            <li>Not as close as I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li>The is also a nice travel case included.</li>
            <li>I also own a Braun and it does not hold a candle to</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have decided to keep the razor and continue since my Panasonic is effectively unserviceable.</li>
            <li>nice shaver for traveling .and</li>
            <li>It gives him a nice, close shave and it saves him from me nagging him that he looks scrappy.</li>
            <li>Was nice while it worked (about six months).  </li>
            <li>The shaver rotary cutters will effectively cut a stubble beard but not the longer whiskers.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is effective in trimming beards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get a bit warm after about 4 minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li>For right now, I am thoroughly enjoying the best shaves of my life.  </li>
            <li>Okay, this looks like an awesome product right?</li>
            <li>Exceptionally close and leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this at a great discount to begin with ($206) originally $349.</li>
            <li>Jet Clean system is great also.</li>
            <li>I like the display and the jet clean system works great.</li>
            <li>I did my homework before choosing to buy an electric shaver and all the reviews that I read on the internet said that this particular shaver was the best.</li>
            <li>I bought this beautiful looking shaver from reading many reviews on the close smooth shaves without driving/</li>
            <li>A phone call led me to a pleasant woman named Amy, who solved my problem easily and politely.</li>
            <li>much is worth a good, pleasant shave in the morning,</li>
            <li>The unit is very nicely assembled and the shaving heads are quite unique.  </li>
            <li>Flagship product, has the very high technological content, a lot of new technology, can greatly improve the use experience, exquisite packaging, very suitable as a gift</li>
            <li>Sometimes a new design isn&#x27;t always the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this new Norelco shaver</li>
            <li>I had to find something better no matter what the cost, this razor is the best ever.love the fast and clean,smooth,shave.</li>
            <li>in all, super happy with this shaver and sticking with it.</li>
            <li>But customer service was very nice and sent me a brand new one for free!!!</li>
            <li>This shaver is very easy on your face.</li>
            <li>very easy to use, and very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle and is lite to hold.</li>
            <li>The best part is it work great with shaving gel which does not foam like other cream.   </li>
            <li>Each bottle of jet clean lasts about a month, so I would imagine that can get kind of pricey, but BB&amp;B has good price on it.</li>
            <li>jet clean system is really nice and always cleaning the shaver and keeping it in good condition.</li>
            <li>Bottomline: A very good razor that comes very close to a blade.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s nice to use on the blades, but chances are it&#x27;ll get lost before 30 days.  </li>
            <li>This is by far, THE BEST wet/dry electric razor I have EVER owned!   </li>
            <li>This is one nice shaver and sideburn trimmer better than any ever used.</li>
            <li>by far the SensoTouch 3D is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>If you can not waste time and need to get presentable for work, this is the best option.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for a good comfortable</li>
            <li>That being said, this electric is by far the best razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>so far shaves the best.  </li>
            <li>He said this is by far the best razor he has ever used!</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best razor out there.  </li>
            <li>is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>And nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Best one so far.</li>
            <li>you can tell I am very impressed so far</li>
            <li>As you can tell I am very impressed so far</li>
            <li>I was dubious to spend this kind of money on a razor but after using it for a week I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and i&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>But Amazon had by far the best price I found anywhere, and I thoroughly research products like this before purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had the money and got the best razor Norelco offers.  </li>
            <li>The best I have had so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for about 5 years and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is far and away the best shaving electrically I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and rapid and no burning&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner does a great job of bringing the blades back to looking brand new...expect that will extend the life of the blades, as clean blades are happy blades!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how happy I am with it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a cllose comfortable shave!!</li>
            <li>pivoting head of the razor allows it to get a closer shave than the older style electric razors, and the cleaning station does a very good job of charging and cleaning the heads after use.  </li>
            <li>Honestly when i received the shaver, i was glad with all the features and options it has, and when i tried it was shaving well, and i am still using it, and i am satisfied from the way it shaves.</li>
            <li>Good product, as well as the Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>I never could get a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I clean the shaver in it every day and my skin feels  good after a cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>Great shaving experience, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>One of its best features is the smooth, quick comfortable shave even after a 4-5 day growth.  </li>
            <li>Much better built and imuch more effective electric shaving instrument.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful razor for many people, but think twice if you have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning stand works perfectly, although you can clean it allot better just by running hot water on it.</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is very nice, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, my first time trying electric razors</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent smooth shave.</li>
            <li>: VERY SMOOTH SHAVE&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic was very comfortable; using it I could survive without after shave if I had to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>In fact, the jojoba oil is a very light oil and keeps the blades well lubricated.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and close shaves</li>
            <li>And the shaver is VERY light.</li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is the additional fact that it can be effectively and easily cleaned manually.</li>
            <li>The product was as described, fast shippingto Australia, the condition was perfect and full functionality.</li>
            <li>The razor is very easy to clean with warm water.</li>
            <li>However the shave itself was amazingly proficient and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It was amazingly close and smooth ...</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco Products for years and always been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Sure this can save money in not buying cleaners and disinfectants.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t Charge any more.</li>
            <li>Amazon has much better prices on it.</li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors over the years and many blade razors and</li>
            <li>I accidentally broke it and wondered if there was yet a better razor</li>
            <li>(1) shaves slightly better  </li>
            <li>You will NOT be able to charge the shavor wihout the stand.</li>
            <li>(His skin is as smooth as a babys!)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
            <li>After giving this razor more than the recommended time, I&#x27;ve given up on it.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to go over areas of my face to get as close a shave as many times</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After reading most of the reviews for this product on Amazon, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase it.</li>
            <li>One reviewer noted that the Norelco 1280X has a better shave than the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>the smoother parts of your face (like the cheeks and under your nose on the upper lip) is where the Braun does best.</li>
            <li>The Norelco gives you a more uniform shave on all parts of your face.</li>
            <li>I think that Braun&#x27;s design is much better in this aspect.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic better?</li>
            <li>However love the look and ergonomics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m optimistic that this will be able to prevent ruining the shaver&#x27;s battery by overcharging.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it was shaving as perfectly and deep without my ever using any pressure whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wash anything with it for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>- Convenient   - Works better if you shave every day  </li>
            <li>Well, I have been using Norelco for more years</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Better than my Braun, but it also 6 years newer.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this shaver would give me a great shave.</li>
            <li>They say the best results come after 3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>okay ...</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...............</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have many electric razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for many years and thought I&#x27;d treat myself to this shaving</li>
            <li>It was so much better than those that I had been using, that I became a lifetime user.  </li>
            <li>This 1280X/42 is my fourth over all those years, and it without a doubt the best.  </li>
            <li>this latest model has.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 1280X is really most advance shaving system.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and its performance.</li>
            <li>I have a goatee (that i shave off periodically), and have evolved to a two step system - a Gillette Fusion Power razor (love Fusion blades) + a Schick Quattro Beard trimmer (both of which can be used in the shower).  </li>
            <li>As I said before, this electric is better than any i have ever tried before, but still isn&#x27;t as close as a manual.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once the battery in the SensoTouch gets cycled a dozen or more times</li>
            <li>but the shaving doesnt cut it for me.bought the panasonic arc 3 and got a better result.</li>
            <li>you would expect me to rave about the 1280cc/42 like most people do</li>
            <li>Molded case design would have been better for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>in all I returned to Braun and purchased the series 7 the 790CC which an outstanding shaver and to me shaves a touch even closer than the Philips.</li>
            <li>No doubt that these 2 shavers are the best on the market today and I will be using both of them alternately for a while and see which one I like better, I may just keep both of them.</li>
            <li>I love the way it shaves and the way it glides and maneuvers to the shape of my face.     </li>
            <li>My expectations were amped up by many favorable reviews on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Highly satisfied and would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for great customer</li>
            <li>maybe I can&#x27;t hope for much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for great customer</li>
            <li>maybe I can&#x27;t hope for much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because of the price.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to report that I will be continuing to use this product daily, as the ingrown hairs have virtually disappeared.  </li>
            <li>The shave was OK</li>
            <li>the product is better than what i imaging.</li>
            <li>I reviewed all the latest Norelco razors and came this the 1280x.  </li>
            <li>They could have done much better with the case too.</li>
            <li>Others have taken as many as 7 passes.</li>
            <li>Now, after 3 weeks of using it almost daily, I can say that it&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>but I would hard-pressed to see how any electric shaver could do better than this SensoTouch 3D series.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s kind of justified.</li>
            <li>But this one took maybe 3 strokes at most.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how better it&#x27;ll get as it more adjusts to my skin.</li>
            <li>There is nothing cheap about this shaver!</li>
            <li>Phoning Phillips again, I was told this time that the amount of energy used depended on shaving conditions and that the cutters required more force to move through shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>He had a 3- or 4-day beard going Christmas afternoon, and it took him about 3 minutes to shave it all off with the electric, and he was in LOVE.</li>
            <li>If I was going to be traveling for 30 days or more</li>
            <li>Just purchased the Norelco 1280X, all the comments that I have read say that it&#x27;s an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>I tried it this morning and it is much better  than the Panasonic dry/wet foil that I was using.  </li>
            <li>Better than the Brahn.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is probibly the most coomfortable shave I have ever had</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought this shaver</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I choose Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, with only two weeks of use my skin already accustomed to knife blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never use.  </li>
            <li>the M60 was able to shave closer than the norelco.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for myself and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>he love this Razor.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I chose this one from all the competition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Water Proof (love this)&lt;br /&gt;Close</li>
            <li>The shave has become more close with each shave.  </li>
            <li>Better than a trac 2.</li>
            <li>The Braun 3 series is better.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have had many different Razors and this is the best!</li>
            <li>This Norelco shaver was flawless and it&#x27;s so quiet that no one knew i was shaving.    </li>
            <li>Will update again after 2 more weeks...</li>
            <li>Arcitec Men&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be topped but this razor is night and day difference better.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;3d&#x27; head</li>
            <li>The box does include a more compact travel charger for those who do not wish to put a boat on their bathroom vanity.    </li>
            <li>If you are like me, you will love the razor but wonder that they were thinking when designing the cleaning / charging dock.</li>
            <li>It had been many years since I have used an electric razor.</li>
            <li>and it does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>When used with a pre-shave lotion it shaves more closely on the face and neck than the Braun.</li>
            <li>I have used a Braun for several years and thought it was the best.</li>
            <li>What could be better:   </li>
            <li>- A better way to shave corners (it is rotary).  </li>
            <li>so I did not use electric razors for many year afters.  </li>
            <li>It does not cut me and I can shave more than once in a day if I had to (try that with a blade without tearing your skin up).  </li>
            <li>The charging on this unit could be better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than not having one, but it doesn&#x27;t measure up to what Norelco used to put on their shavers.  </li>
            <li>I love the setup, it works great and gives a very close shave, it is not blade</li>
            <li>Light weight, great design, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I look forward to many years of trouble-free shaving.</li>
            <li>As a regular Norelco user, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>The razor is extremely quiet and perfectly contoured to hold in every position.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor was a Easter gift after more then three weeks ( noreclo recommends at lest 3 weeks minimum to condition your skin)</li>
            <li>A lithium ion battery should be better than this.</li>
            <li>When it dies again (one more year at this rate), doubt I will replace with another unless the faulty battery issue is solved.</li>
            <li>There is virtually no afterburn on my face and neck, and I receive a better shave without \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; lotions.  </li>
            <li>This razor does everything it says and more.  </li>
            <li>this and no any other.&lt;br /&gt;i was used many razor (from panasonic, phillips, hitachi, etc), and blade razor with 2,3,4 and five blades.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>After reading features on the latest models of Norelco, It was a choice between 1290 and the 1280 as they have the charge mins remaining instead of bars, looks cooler.</li>
            <li>The JetClean+ is interesting.</li>
            <li>Gives a much better shave and is much better in terms of crafstmenship.  </li>
            <li>This is a state-of-the-art razor, the ultimate Philips 3D razor works perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now to the shaving again this works and will remove most hairs</li>
            <li>should get more close shave for the money</li>
            <li>precision trimmer seems like it should have more power&lt;</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a bit more time to shave.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Buzz saw volume of my Panasonic, I love this feature.</li>
            <li>Most men like a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I could not agree more with the many reviews I saw on amazon.</li>
            <li>and I simply love it.</li>
            <li>Expect more.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is outstanding</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my face for more than 60 years.  </li>
            <li>They were all ok but this time I bought him this one.  </li>
            <li>I watched the videos on the OEM website to make sure it would work for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun for over 10 years and cannot believe how much better this razor is.</li>
            <li>It used to take me 8-10 minutes a day to shave with a medium beard, but now I am able to shave in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a very unique and svelte design which I love, it fits well in your hand and is lightweight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, you can clean the shaver under warm water and add mineral oil once in while...</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is nice.</li>
            <li>I am pain-free with a nice clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Long ago I became convinced triple-header IS the way to go, and for many years I felt that Norelco produces excellent razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great improvement from the older model.</li>
            <li>I liked the Jet Clean option.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable in the hand and the cleaning station is very easy.  </li>
            <li>Functions great if you keep up with shaving, though I&#x27;ve found that if you wait to shave for a couple of days, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of picking up hair that is laying down.  </li>
            <li>For me it is best to be able to wake up and use the shaver dry..</li>
            <li>Nobody&#x27;s perfect, so when I need to go over my neck quite a bit and then use a (dry) razor to finish up, it&#x27;s still a better experience that I had before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many people will say it&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s remorse, but after much research, I thought I was getting a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>, razors were also Norelco and they did a pretty good job</li>
            <li>I took a chance getting an electric for my boyfriend: I had NO other good ideas this year!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced great results with a new shaver head on my Panasonic, but even with a new shaver head the Panasonic does not compare to the Norelco&#x27;s close shave performance.  </li>
            <li>I can get it done and over with a nice shave quickly.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best one I&#x27;ve ever had when it comes to a fast &amp; very close shave.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts about 25 days and it is easy to clean under warm water.</li>
            <li>As it turns out the shaver is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Charges and clean very easily.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much,Preferential aggressive, the best New Year gift,He is the most perfect,I would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to clean it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, has a nice grip and shape and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Well this Norelco is very durable and the jet clean system is great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works flawlessly and keeps the razor clean and sanitary for the next shave.</li>
            <li>Charge of electricity can be very fast, with 60 minutes, very handsome.</li>
            <li>Very good at getting the low front portion of the neck.</li>
            <li>Very cool lighting</li>
            <li>you do not mind to spend that much money and want an excellent shaver buy it by any means, I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well designed Phillips is very good that the overall feel and execution of the design feels good in hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pumped about this shaver -- it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and efficient electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned ( I&#x27;m over 60).  </li>
            <li>Smoothest most comfortable shave Iv&#x27;e had yet.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s best job as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>The difference between the earlier model and the 1280X is absolutely incredible.  </li>
            <li>It is perhaps not as close a shaver as the Braun it replaced, but it is more comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is more comfortable than a blade, but there&#x27;s still a bit of razor burn after using.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the first one and this is just as nice.</li>
            <li>If your have an Arcitec which has a body with a healthy motor you can just change the head and put a Sensotouch 3D head on it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I find that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li>so I keep that close, and more importantly, comfortable shave.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I keep that close, and more importantly, comfortable shave.)    </li>
            <li>so I cant attest to the wet shave, but I can tell you its the best and closest shave</li>
            <li>I really was hoping to give this razor a good review ...</li>
            <li>does  a good fast job</li>
            <li>Nice to have a fresh shave</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean, and very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>Good way to inaugurate the new shaver :-)</li>
            <li>men know how good of a mood a fine shave can put us into, and this 1280 shaver certainly does it.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning machine is awesome, seeing the razor automatically go down to get clean in the solution by the press of a button is just as sophisticated as it sounds, the razor come on and off by itself to ensure the cleaning is done properly and gives you the best smelling and clean shave.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s kind of cool to watch the jet clean system work if you like gadgets and have the patience to wait on it to finish before unplugging it.</li>
            <li>is what I am most familiar with.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great!</li>
            <li>Shaves a full month without a charge!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is the best razor I have owned</li>
            <li>1280cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]is GREAT), just buy the new RQ12 heads</li>
            <li>It is an easy way to recharge the battery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d rather use alcohol to clean my blades since it&#x27;s got a lot of bacteria after so many uses.  </li>
            <li>when my family asked me what I wanted for Christmas, my choice was easy.  </li>
            <li>my wish list was  the top of the line Norelco and the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>I sure it will work just a well as the 1280/42 with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>It is really easy.</li>
            <li>But nevertheless, it&#x27;s still better than a regular razor, so I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>With a razor I can easily go 24 hours before I begin to even think about shaving again.  </li>
            <li>The 1280X easily lets me go 24 hours in between shaves.  </li>
            <li>and it shaves so cloose and so easy.</li>
            <li>Love this razor, best electric razor I have had, and I have had a few..............</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has a sleek styling.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I wanted to move from nicks and cuts to easy and and no cuts,</li>
            <li>and my son says it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy is what seems to work for teens these days.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close and easy to use cleaner for after use</li>
            <li>; I thought the auto cleaner was way over the top, but every morning the shaver is clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Would easily recommend a purchase if the price doesn&#x27;t scare you off.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>And he needs a strong one.</li>
            <li>cleaning unit is ok, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth &amp; quick to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>This means that I need to shave the same area many many times in all directions to get it good</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the shave, leaves a very smooth feel, no need to apply excessive pressure and just gliding it once or twice over the area does the trick.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, the shaving is fine and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyway, its fine now.</li>
            <li>Shaver itself is fine.  </li>
            <li>I like to shave dry and this is perfect for that, close, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li>Did my research and on amazon it shows this is the best shaving electronic period,i went and bought it for black friday,no discount at all.first day i used it</li>
            <li>Smooth glide and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Still work fine</li>
            <li>Just oppening the heads and rinsing it works fine.</li>
            <li>The 1250x and 1290x will do just fine without the cleaning station, and can be cleaned just as well under the sink in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>I have always used the cleaning system to charge this razor and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>At 3X the price, and 5 years of research and innovation, you would think you might just get lucky and get a better shaver?  </li>
            <li>I picked this rating because I was able to use the quick start guide and could take my time about figuring out the option details.</li>
            <li>super job with this creation!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with the sideburn trimmer, though it pops out quickly.  </li>
            <li>but the jet clean solution has it there and its just a more convenient/elegant way to keep the unit clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, reliable close shave time after time.  </li>
            <li>- Easy to use / fits well in my hand   - Easy to clean   - Can be used</li>
            <li>The razor works great dry, but using it wet with shaving cream in the shower gives me the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>daddy like it very much!!</li>
            <li>My beard is fine and skin fair and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The Braun was out for me since I wanted something I could use in the shower / wet although they receive very good reviews.    </li>
            <li>The best razor I have ever owned, hands down, you can not beat this razor!  </li>
            <li>Sure you can rinse it out yourself and get it pretty clean, but the automatic cleaner really does an excellent job and leaves a very pleasing fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>, I use it about once every 3 days (I rinse it with very hot water after every shave) and that seems to keep it very clean and free of debris.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 huge benefits though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy to use and clean and Jet</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet and smooth running--the quietest I&#x27;ve experienced on any electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I may be biased - because I am a HUGE Norelco fan.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;jet clean\\&quot; system that seems more economical and efficient than the Braun one (which uses cartridges); this one uses fluid&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Amazing fit and finish</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product by Phillips.</li>
            <li>I am ok with that seeing as I rarely used the charging cord with my Braun unless I was on vacation.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, it takes me about 8 minutes to shave my entire head, and face with this.  </li>
            <li>The claims of closeness are justified in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The Shaver however is worth every penny, and if you don&#x27;t want the top of the line, buy the Senso Touch 3d lowest cost model.</li>
            <li>, I have found that shaving with shaving cream or a shaving gel with this razor seems to result in the smoothest agitation free shave.  </li>
            <li>, I have found that shaving with shaving cream or a shaving gel with this razor seems to result in the smoothest agitation free shave.  </li>
            <li>and it worked great for several months.  </li>
            <li>The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is smooter dan a knive en so easy to clean.   </li>
            <li>great shaver , i use this daily</li>
            <li>After two years of light use it is worn out.</li>
            <li>The 1280 with the chrome on the side is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>As it charges it cleans and continues a smooth irritaion free shave.</li>
            <li>course,the pirce is cheap too.</li>
            <li>The razor delivers a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They last and give a great shave.  </li>
            <li>, I actually enjoy shaving now.   </li>
            <li>it did a great job of cleaning including the skin oil that inevitably gets into the shaver heads.  </li>
            <li>The solution is inexpensive and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After applying some pre-shave lotion, it glides on smoothly without any of the irritation that I had with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It is also really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Even with that being said, this model is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor because it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm - smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Once you get use to it you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and the battery has 60 minutes of charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean &amp; maintain.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the stand does not fold or fit into the shaver carrying case.    </li>
            <li>was more of a gimmick in my opinion, as I rarely purchased the lotion kits to refill.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean via water (When traveling) or via the included cleaner.</li>
            <li>Like shaving with a smooth damp wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It did work well but was cheap</li>
            <li>And it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The time I used it on vacation, it would barely fit in my shaving kit and when I got to my hotel the razor head assembly had fallen out of the body.  </li>
            <li>Improved greatly from 10 years ago--easy to clean--seems fragile but I will adjust.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>Still under the extended warranty from registering it on-line so another handle was sent free of charge.</li>
            <li>Fortunately be the time it broke  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic construction</li>
            <li>Why is this important?</li>
            <li>does fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gives a great shave and to clean the same is also is easy</li>
            <li>I shave my head with it also and it is so smooth, I will have to replace the heads sooner.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday shaving, the cleaning stand has a electric motor in it to help lower the shaver into the cleaning position.</li>
            <li>B000PJBSSY get a six-pack for cheap]]).</li>
            <li>I have had many different electric shaver and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, precise, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>His face is baby smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Important:  </li>
            <li>Shaving is comfortable and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but all I would say that it is an excellent shaver, very quiet, does the job very well</li>
            <li>The closeness and quality of the shave is wonderful, and I believe this product actually gives me a very close shave,</li>
            <li>So far so good with this razor.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It provides a very, very close shave, gives no irritations and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It was totally logical to me that the \\&quot;counter-rotating blades\\&quot; would be able to cut my beard much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I still have the first one and keep it in my car for when I&#x27;m really in a rush to get out of the house - after 15 years it still runs strong and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Cleaner works great to give the shaver the brand new shaver feeling after cleaning it with hot water after shaving.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean under hot water or just use the brush.</li>
            <li>Smooth and clean as well as easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I clean manually with water and use the jet cleaner when I recharge the razor, Really this is simply the best.</li>
            <li>Norelco has full instructions that are easily understood.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with water and the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li>I have used the Jet Clean several times and it does a really great job cleaning the unit.  </li>
            <li>It is so quiet compared to the older one and the shave is superb.  </li>
            <li>Very Pleased my wife spent the extra money to ensure I had a wonderful product.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for most of my adult life, I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their ability to give a close shave and their long lives.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system is nice, seems to really keep the shaver clean.    </li>
            <li>I could not figure out an indicator light on the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>, razor burn free shave, and a clean trim around my goatee  </li>
            <li>had this smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li>In about couple of mins I was done with a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li>the1280CC and after more than a month he is very pleased with its overall performance.</li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>Under the presumption that this system will last many years, it should still be very worthwhile acquisition.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it gave a close smooth shave...with none of the friction of a usual electric shave.</li>
            <li>Close shave but comfortably, quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>I was in a hurry to replace my 10 year old Philips shaver and honestly its only slightly better performance wise.</li>
            <li>After shaving each head opens up for easy cleaning, after each use, you just give a quick rinse before putting the in the jet clean station.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and the Jet Clean system makes cleaning the razor super easy.</li>
            <li>I always seem to end up going back to Braun as it has always worked best for me, despite having very sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>The Braun worked great and lasted me for a long time...</li>
            <li>In general, with the Braun series 5, I loved the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>Additionally with the Norelco you add solution from a bottle to the cleaning chamber which is significantly cheaper than using the prefilled cartridges from Braun.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in December of 2011.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase it again as I fear that when the warranty is up (2yr continued from the original date of purchase) it will die again.  </li>
            <li>So if it performed this well on the first try, I don&#x27;t know how it can get better.</li>
            <li>I primarily use the trimmer for the pesky ear hair and while the trimmer on the 1280X does an OK job, the old trimmer was better.  </li>
            <li>and they paid for the return shipping of the original item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having used a Norelco shaver for years, I&#x27;m familiar with the benefits and limitations of an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The RQ12+ heads do not come close to the original and pull hairs.</li>
            <li>love it when use it first time :</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have regretted getting the &#x27;2d&#x27; shaving heads as opposed to this &#x27;3d&#x27; model.</li>
            <li>Yes it does cost more than most,but after the first time I used it I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>first electric shaver I have ever used more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>My first was a braun many years ago, which was not close</li>
            <li>Contacted Philips and they are sending me a replacement handle at no charge (original warranty of 2 years that Philips extended by an additional 6 months when registering the thing).  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment!</li>
            <li>I am really impressed on how easy it is to use specially when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a week and the hair is really hard.</li>
            <li>The razor is packaged with the charging stand, the razor, the cleaning unit, a full bottle of cleaner, a travel soft case and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the razor gives an exceptional shave.</li>
            <li>clean system is worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li>My dad really loves it, it is easily to handle and shaves very clean.</li>
            <li>Well, the day after our son got his new shaver he tried it and he was absolutely thrilled that it worked so well.  </li>
            <li>And now, it doesn&#x27;t always startup to clean when you out it in the cradle...</li>
            <li>But the razor is supposed to turn on to clean the heads...</li>
            <li>1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>However the shave itself is clean and close</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t used the Jet Clean system as of yet</li>
            <li>I recommend the 1280X and Jet Clean</li>
            <li>I still like the razor and the Jet Clean system a lot and would recommend it to friends and family.  </li>
            <li>I have used it with and without the jet clean system each for four months</li>
            <li>I have owned several electric razors over the years and this is by far the best shave and cleaner</li>
            <li>The cleaning system on the Norelco is okay, but 20th century compared to the Panasonic (kind of like a semi-automatic sink compared to an automatic dishwasher).  </li>
            <li>and if you do get the Jet Clean System you won&#x27;t know where to put it.</li>
            <li>Just remember NO Jet Clean System, all of us with condo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The charge lasts almost 3 weeks without  recharging and the Jet clean is a neat way to clean it, I use this when its time a charge.</li>
            <li>And the price is also good!Especially the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li>My thinking on getting the cleaning system was that I wanted some mechanism to clean out the skin oil in addition to the shavings.  </li>
            <li>Opperates as advertised and I get a confortable clean shave.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco 1280X/42 Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000), is just what I needed to get the clean, close shave I</li>
            <li>I used to be that in order to clean your razor, you had to:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>that I \\&quot;needed\\&quot; a unit with the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>The clean cycle takes quite some time.  </li>
            <li>and you can just rinse it clean a plus or use the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of electric razors over the years, especially Norelco, this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>- A limit on charging the razor from the cleaner (there should be an option to clean / charge or just clean).  </li>
            <li>The unit should have a clean and clean/charge option.  </li>
            <li>The Jet Clean unit that comes with this shaver is also made well.  </li>
            <li>clean shave just as comfortable and quick.  </li>
            <li>Just shave and clean in your Jetclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the jet clean feature</li>
            <li>/&gt;To clean it using the automatic cleaning device, the razor is placed into a holder.</li>
            <li>This model has a change blades and a clean indicator.</li>
            <li>Now my unit came with the Jet clean</li>
            <li>the Jet clean is an added luxury not needed</li>
            <li>Close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun 8500 series 360 , before this one, and it had a self clean feature also.  </li>
            <li>I’m required to have a clean shave for my job</li>
            <li>A clean shave every time put to use.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system malfunctioned after about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>Attempts to clean the sensor have inconsistent results.</li>
            <li>And eventually the Jet Clean station will cease working altogether, just as my has two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Note that my Jet Clean station has been replaced 2 times within the warranty period.</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li>It does, however, perform well and leaves the shaver clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li>the description at Amazon does not say, but this package *does come* with a charging stand, besides the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>I have not used the clean and charge dock yet</li>
            <li>I even let the razor go for a couple months without manually hitting the clean button and it never auto-cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with different electric razors each year and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Works decently either way and the razor is nice and quick.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my head and got it as a replacement for my very ancient Cool Skin that I had for more than 5 years and whose battery was no longer charging and the razors had become quite blunt.</li>
            <li>An adaptor for use oversea would have been included given the price of this shaver, making use more quick than the need to find first an avalaible one..    </li>
            <li>This is a much improved shaver over the Norelco Arcitec which did a great job but had a less than effective pop-up sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li>I tried other shavers but they did not work well on me as I have curly afro hair, and most products just don&#x27;t do a good job.    </li>
            <li>Other than that I am very happy with the shaves -- much closer that my 10</li>
            <li>But it if the price is right!</li>
            <li>The SensoTouch 3d is an excellent shaver, but I would prefer to have a hard traveling case for maximum protection of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Perfect shave that followed completed my acquisition&#x27;s satisfaction  Highly recommended to electric shavers and whoever considers changing brand or switch from wet- to electric shaving.</li>
            <li>I thought moving from from 2D to 3D would be amazing, but I&#x27;ve gotten so used to shaving with the old 2D model that I think I preferred that one.  </li>
            <li>I use the wet option with any shaving cream and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is equally great for wet shaves as it is for drive.</li>
            <li>I had a lesser norelco model, which was good, would some irritation every now and then,  but this one blows it away no comparision.</li>
            <li>My shave is much closer than I had with the Braun and as a result I&#x27;m able to shave faster.  </li>
            <li>The shave is close and non-irritating, but even after a full cleaning cycle, the removed hair pieces fall out of the razor heads while I shave.  </li>
            <li>More gentle than a razor blade  </li>
            <li>Shaver itself is quiet and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>the concept is cool....</li>
            <li>If a razor has an option for a cleaner get it even the cheap one&#x27;s are worth it for your razor and your face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a space hogger and takes its sweet time;</li>
            <li>So I have been using them alternately now to keep the batteries in good shape on both.</li>
            <li>You would think that I might be able to get a discount on buy-2, e.g., after not shaving for two days, it might take me 1.8 x as much time to shave.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet, smooth shave and an overall excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I assumed that a name brand product such as this would be a good value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good enough.  </li>
            <li>the battery would return to the 60 minute full charge level.</li>
            <li>Edition\\&quot;, $169.99 after Costco&#x27;s current $30 off coupon - a good deal, I thought).  </li>
            <li>Purchased this razor to replace a Norelco \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; model that died after about 3 years of use.</li>
            <li>and my wife had to experiment with it just because it looked so cool.  </li>
            <li>so as I could use just one full trim cut</li>
            <li>It will work in the Jet Cleaner but will not turn on even after a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I love it ,it works very well.</li>
            <li>The Philips SensoTouch 3D Shaver does give a surprisingly good and close shave, and it is quiet.</li>
            <li>Will not keep a full charge</li>
            <li>A whole lot better than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>This razor has a number of cool features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li>I like how the shaver is easy to hold while shaving and how it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean with hot water.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great and never fails, easy to clean plus the jet system is thorough and needs no additional operations other than to turn it on and select the cleaning program.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is get the one with No Jet Clean System, save some money, hot water cleans it just fine</li>
            <li>The trimmer sticks out farther making it easy to use without first removing the shaving head.  </li>
            <li>it tends to miss some of the longer hairs, but other than that it does a super great job.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to more clean shaves with my new shaver.</li>
            <li>However cleaning under running hot water as suggested works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It was quiet, shaved very close and quick on the rest of my face, and the Jet Cleaner worked great.</li>
            <li>From my older Norelco, I did love the shave itself and</li>
            <li>; how lucky I was to break it.  </li>
            <li>close shave, quick (</li>
            <li>got super irritated  leading to tons of bumps under my neck.i</li>
            <li>I really love how the heads come apart including the entire top assembly.  </li>
            <li>It sure beats the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; main brands in quality of shave and quality of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>It makes it quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, this quietness was only a welcome change as it was quick and very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>* Charges quickly  *</li>
            <li>charges up quickly, if needed, but if you leave it on it will charge and (to me) seems to hold the charge better/</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with a bit of extra money to get the good and fun stuff.  </li>
            <li>Well it definitely did, this razor is such a great piece of ingenuity!  </li>
            <li>Most products, especially electronics, come out with a better model after you purchase one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy to clean, and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>if I have 3 or 4 day growth, it still cuts it as close as a baby&#x27;s butt just as quick as my day to day shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Charging is quick too.</li>
            <li>This shaver is MUCH more comfortable on the neck and Adam&#x27;s apple area than the Panasonic--which still nicks me frequently in this area.</li>
            <li>With a wet shave and shave gel, its a good, smooth shave but requires work in the moustache area.....</li>
            <li>Close fast shaves,no irritation,quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I notice any problems with it as it gets older and more use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a carrying case and cleaning kit, but you have to replace the special fluid that the razor uses to clean and lubricate the blades with and that can add up over time.</li>
            <li>The shaver sound is very much quieter.  </li>
            <li>Its gets my head pretty smooth no problems there.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say I have no regrets shelling out the cash for this.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy using it with shaving creme and hot water.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as smooth as my gillette fusion razor, but it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>I first ordered this from Amazon in Frustration Free Packaging and it arrived used --</li>
            <li>My husband likes it very much!</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have had about 4 other Philps razors, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>~I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My partner says it is good use and the battery lasts long.</li>
            <li>However, the adage “You get what you pay for” comes true in a very positive way.</li>
            <li>Cosntruction quality is nice and solid and it comes with a a stand and the jet clean system, which works well.  </li>
            <li>Ok this product works pretty well but for the price I had very high expectations of this unit.  </li>
            <li>The new RQ12 forms to your face much better.  </li>
            <li>I had an 1180 Norelco Shaver and my new 1280 is miles and miles better.  </li>
            <li>This is a great improvement over previous models that Philips Norelco has brought to the market.  </li>
            <li>I set the quick charger up first (not Jet Clean)</li>
            <li>At this point I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about 4 days and had a pretty good amount of hair on my face, not just your short 5:00 clock shadow.</li>
            <li>I am excited to reportm, I have experienced little to none skin irritation!</li>
            <li>I figured they must have improved it significantly, but never thought it would be that evident.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you notice is the price, but wait!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Just opened the box and pretty excited about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have used my new Norelco for just a few days now, and I have to say it is the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Other problem areas: right under the nose, it just doesn&#x27;t reach those hairs very easily; the sideburn area seems to grow in more quickly.    </li>
            <li>I use it only as a dry shaver and the results are the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The razor is very easy to clean by itself so those who don&#x27;t want to pay extra for the cleaning station, don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s solely for luxury.  </li>
            <li>Hi,  the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black\\&quot; is the first electric shaver y have ever used and it´s</li>
            <li>So I am happy with my philips ( I bought my first philips shaver in 1955 and never have used a other brand.</li>
            <li>The carrying case holds the razor nicely and there is a &#x27;soft&#x27; lock feature that keeps the razor from turning on in the suit case, so if you need less than an hour&#x27;s shaving time on your trip then you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>After the shaving, my dad can clean it by water, it&#x27;s really so convenient!</li>
            <li>but since it is a nice, new streamlined design, well built excellent unit I will keep it for the next few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchase this because I have and old Philips Norelco that I was happy, but with this one having the 3D works great, less time of shaving since it only need a couple of passes and you are done</li>
            <li>But what I really love is how it will glide around a goatee (or beard or mustache) and get all the little hairs without pulling and catching on the longer hairs nearby.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system is a fantastic add on..keeps your shaver just like brand new.</li>
            <li>The shave is comfortable, takes minutes, and is very close....</li>
            <li>The razor is quiet, smooth, contours my face well and even gives me a good shave on my neck, which was always a place I would have to use an old fashion razor to get rid of the stubble before.</li>
            <li>- shaves very well leaves smooth skin   </li>
            <li>This razor is so smooth going over your skin, shaving cream really isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its really fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>When off you have no idea there is so much detail available when turned on.</li>
            <li>- Very close and smooth shave  -</li>
            <li>- i use it with shaving cream and it is smooth and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>I did choose the version with the Jet Clean system mainly to do \\&quot;a maintenance clean\\&quot; about every 3 weeks or so as I plan to rinse and manually clean the majority of the time.</li>
            <li>Philips unit is FAR FAR superior to the Braun product - for me...</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning system since my old Norelco got a \\&quot;funky\\&quot; smell to it after awhile</li>
            <li>And definteley worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you are buying this for yourself, spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but it the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and it&#x27;s quiet</li>
            <li>pricey, but worth it if you have the bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far I love it and look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li>the Norelco is far better.  </li>
            <li>but I plan on using it probably after 3-4 uses or so just to get my money&#x27;s worth of the solution.</li>
            <li>Is it really worth the $200 (after the rebate)?</li>
            <li>I would like to shave every day, but some days I don&#x27;t manage, and so I end up having two days worth of hair to shave.  </li>
            <li>I can, however, tell that the old shavers from Philips were much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric shavers: my problem has never been irritation, but rather the fact that they rarely give you a close shave.</li>
            <li>BUT DEFINITELY WORTH</li>
            <li>You can make your own fluid from alcohol and oil but that voids the warranty.</li>
            <li>: I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a top of the line (but old) Braun.</li>
            <li>And realize that not all of the service techs at Norelcto will provide useful answers.</li>
            <li>It is on the pricey side, but for me worth it.</li>
            <li>But the most important thing to me is that this in an incredibly quiet shaver!  </li>
            <li>Potentially useful, if not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>so far, more info below...    </li>
            <li>The shave quality is good, which I expected from the Norelco brand and this price point.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricy, but the quality and results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my old Braun better</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you&#x27;re reading this review, you want to know if the razor is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was using a 30 year old norelco for many years.</li>
            <li>It shaves better than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Takes forever to shave,  my old Schick and Remington foil headed shaver was much more efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I haver really enjoyed using this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have owned many electric shavers over the course of several years and this seems to be the best for my beard type, which would be considered thick.</li>
            <li>Still not as good as a standard razor but very close.</li>
            <li>Bought this nice electric razor for my boyfriend for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>I wanted the best since I know I will be using it for a long long time.</li>
            <li>but after I bought the 1280, I think it&#x27;s not that useful of a feature to be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Travelling pouch is useful.</li>
            <li>Well worth this price.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, enjoyable, elegantly slides on the face following the natural contours.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors for almost 20 years and really liked them until recently.  </li>
            <li>GREATWELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>going from a Braun style razor to a Norelco takes some getting used to but in the end it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaving surface rotates nicely to match your facial curves.</li>
            <li>I am always surprised at how many large corporations do not have user friendly  user interfaces on their websites.  </li>
            <li>razor gives a good dry shave and pretty good wet shave.</li>
            <li>So I returned it and went for the normal packaging (Blister pack in a box) which arrived nice and new with no hair.    </li>
            <li>In 60 years of shaving from a straight razor, barber shaves, Remington, Grundig, Shick, Braum, &amp; other Norelco shavers; without a doubt this 3D 880X Shaver is BY FAR the GREATEST Men&#x27;s Shaver I have ever had!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!oke the other one,</li>
            <li>Easily cuts hairs even when you haven&#x27;t shaved in longer than normal.</li>
            <li>Usually I favored the razor due to the very close shave it gave.</li>
            <li>Also, the product had a problem when it first arrived, Amazon was quick to send me another one overnight at no charge to me,</li>
            <li>I usually do not shave over the weekend and my previous electric razors (including Norelco 8240) would not give me a good shave with more than a days worth of stubble</li>
            <li>This shaver is even better than my last one, probably because the Jet Clean process prevents the blades from corroding/dulling from having the water air-dry and leave mineral deposits every day.  </li>
            <li>but I was lucky to buy it when there was a $200 off coupon so it would be wise to wait till Black Friday to pick this up if your in the market for a razor.</li>
            <li>(took like 10 minutes); really just to get familiar with the item.</li>
            <li>Extremely close shave that is as good as a Gillette razor blade.  </li>
            <li>The other sensotouch models are good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for good electric razor, especially if you have curly and/or afro hair.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>The curves on the Norelco get right in there with no problem.  </li>
            <li>I had to use an electric shaver when I broke my right arm.</li>
            <li>For right now, after 6-months of use, it&#x27;s working as well as the day I bought it</li>
            <li>Design, grip, gentle sound are the first postive impressions.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system is very well thought out and from what I&#x27;ve seen gives the heads a thorough washing on even the econo mode.</li>
            <li>clean sideburns, a very close</li>
            <li>really need the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>Having exclusively used Norelco (and 1 Remington) shavers over the past 30 years, I can say that this is by far the best shaver I have used yet.  </li>
            <li>Has a durable feel to it, decent weight where it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>This razor not only gives me a close shave, but also is very easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Also the cleaning fluid that comes with the jetclean has a very strong offensive [to some] smell and it will permeate everywhere.</li>
            <li>This makes the head very large and it does not follow the contours of my face and neck well.  </li>
            <li>but this magnificent razor lets you shave either dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I feel it works best dry on my face wet for my neck</li>
            <li>Upgraded from a very well used norelco electric shaver, the very first one  that dispensed shave lotion and almost got the new model of that style, but glad I looked on the Norelco website and read about new technology and the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it as a dry razor, but it works great as a wet razor too!</li>
            <li>The jet clean works pretty quickly, seems like it has a lot of moving parts though and may brake easily though (relative to the Braun cleaning system).         </li>
            <li>no questions asked basically, and the new one they provided seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>I usually don’t write reviews, but I wanted to take the time to share my great experiences.</li>
            <li>First electric shaver purchased and it was worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>Long ago, I found that Norelco razors were best for me, and I never looked at any other.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly does a much better job than my old Remington.</li>
            <li>This one need some more improvement as far as trimmer is concerned for sharp and more clean finishing.</li>
            <li>Customer support reported the new head wouldn&#x27;t fit the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>If you clean the razor frequently you can do the quick \\&quot;eco\\&quot; setting, or if you return from a trip and haven&#x27;t had a chance for a thorough cleaning, use the intensive setting.</li>
            <li>- The trimmer is not as strong as old school razors</li>
            <li>Easy to clean both daily and in the automatic cleaner.</li>
            <li>Quiet  - Easy to clean and maintain  - Shaves with foam or gel</li>
            <li>The shave is so incredibly comfortable, so incredibly smooth yet so close and left 0 irritation on me.</li>
            <li>If you use blades, my recommendation is to use at least a 3 blade razor with Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream - it is, by far, the best shaving cream I have used with a blade (I have not used a safety razor and soap).  </li>
            <li>Philips 1280 X / 42 SensoTouch force 3 d electric razor with jet cleaning system, black good razor</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week and had a good about half centimeter stubble on me.</li>
            <li>I know for me this was an easy buy but for budget conscious or close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice device that feels solid and very substantial in your hand.  </li>
            <li>he base for recharging and cleaning, but other than that, it&#x27;s great to see him get a good shave on his own again!</li>
            <li>The digital display is very classy and neat and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>From the very first time, I&#x27;ve had nothing less than a great shave with no uneven spots or pinching/irritation.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a really clean shave.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful design, you can use during bath and the battery last long hours!</li>
            <li>I have used it almost daily since then and it did pretty good even on a day old shadow.</li>
            <li>Other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast charging, it says an hour for charging but it felt shorter than that.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>Very, very sleek looking machine.</li>
            <li>Finally...&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fast shave.</li>
            <li>i very much~~</li>
            <li>Cleaning kit: As I mentioned above, I do use the cleaning kit with mine because it came with one when I purchased it, however, I really don&#x27;t think you need it as simply running the blades under warm water removes most of the hair particles.</li>
            <li>The digital &#x27;time left&#x27; viewer is nice, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s necessary for a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Stars are fine but they don&#x27;t give a clear picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,i enjoy it very much,the charging time is short and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>Without the ability to replace the battery or use it plugged in, it seems it would be better to buy a new one rather than buy a new head.</li>
            <li>The original heads, RQ12, are no longer manufactured, and the new RQ12+ have been reviewed as below par here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>second star is for how quickly customer support, via chat, helped me and how easy it was to get them to send a replacement product.</li>
            <li>plus I&#x27;ve read that can damage the blades so mainly running warm water over the blades after moderate use</li>
            <li>Using it wet is very easy and useful.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to at first, I started to have a really good shave after a week.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco Spectra, which is about 10 years old, is still going strong on its original heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Jet Stream clean the shaver like new each time.</li>
            <li>I have a new appreciation for the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>I am in the military and have to shave every morning and this does the job amazing.</li>
            <li>Just the first time ... and not since then!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how smooth and close the shave was.</li>
            <li>(I washed it with hot water every day and let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then why I need this stand in the first place?</li>
            <li>I sent it back to Philips for a refund, but they magically \\&quot;lost it\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Today I tried my first attempt at trying to address this problem --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in not having to prematurely replace the shaver&#x27;s battery because I&#x27;m not always paying close attention when I charge it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just programmed the countdown mode (CTD) for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the top of the line Braun shavers for the last six or seven years.</li>
            <li>As the last two times, this one shaves even better and closer.</li>
            <li>I think that they&#x27;re pretty good overall, but generally break after 4-6 years of use.</li>
            <li>Almost look forward to shaving (did I really type that!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure individual results vary depending on circumstances of the person</li>
            <li>sales is very attetion.!</li>
            <li>I thought the three settings it has was overkill at first</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I was bit nervous at first with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I Bought my first Norelco (Phillips) shaver in Germany in 1960.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny and...</li>
            <li>:  I bought the Braun Series 7 790cc and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>still have this Braun 790CC which works well but always has been pretty noisy</li>
            <li>They equal in closeness of shave and the Philips appears to be made from better material.</li>
            <li>But first things first.  </li>
            <li>At $69, there are plenty of old style shavers available.  </li>
            <li>Once should definitely try this one for sure.</li>
            <li>Though not perfect in all aspect but the best as of today.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric chaver and it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>thing I saw people asking about was the chrome piece of plastic making a squeaking or clicking noise when they first got the razor.  </li>
            <li>Had not even used it much at all!  </li>
            <li>With the Braun, I always had to trim the hair first, otherwise the shave will be bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also travel extensively with my company, and the charge the razor holds is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>this is the first time i purchase on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal to me either way, but if it were, this would have put Panasonic over the top.</li>
            <li>All the 3d Philips are the same so to save even more money you can get the 1250.</li>
            <li>I have a rolly-polly face that can challenge the shaver to get the hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews here on Amazon and on the Internet; it seems that a majority of expert and regular electric shaver users think that the Braun Series 7 gives the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different electrics over the years including many different Norelcos, Braun CC-790 and some Remingtons and this</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I kept.</li>
            <li>First some background on me:  </li>
            <li>With the old Norelco shaver, 24 hours was the maximum that I could comfortably go in between shavings.  </li>
            <li>The 1280X has a digital read-out on the body of the shaver telling you how many minutes of charge are remaining on the shaver&#x27;s rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li>I will update based on how those electrics work out for me once the ingrowns clear.ving with the double edge is more for the experience and not as convenient at 4AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That, along with the cleaning fluid that you have to replace every 2 weeks, makes this razor even more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Norelco is unfortunately the best rotary razor out there.</li>
            <li>Charge time seems to last many Shaves.  </li>
            <li>scrinping on hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time I used it I decided it was.</li>
            <li>I almost bought another Panasonic since I was completely satisfied with the last 6 years of its performance, but I instead opted to try the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>There are some items that could have been designed better for the overall experience, but they do not influence the shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to the SensoTouch 3D</li>
            <li>Works very well - easy to clean - definitely a daily time saver for me.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works great and you get a dry razor when the cleaning/drying cycle is complete, unlike older Norelco models with the automatic cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>you need a razor that doesn&#x27;t need much fuss, this razor will probably be worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is said that it would do.</li>
            <li>I would say that this product does cut your beard pretty well</li>
            <li>First, I have used this shaver about 4 weeks with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This is, however, my first water-proof shaver.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed this about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I still have my first one and still use it after 15 years.</li>
            <li>What I discovered is, unless I filled it nearly to the top, it was really only cleaning 2 of the 3 heads.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic!.</li>
            <li>I am just blown away at how much easier this has made my life and completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I plugged it out and it was really hot.</li>
            <li>So its about few weeks since I bought this model and a good time to write a review.</li>
            <li>that with a little more attention to detail Philips could have easily addressed.      </li>
            <li>Replacement head is different than original in that blades are not anchored to the head; they just come off when you brush shaver out or clean under faucet.  </li>
            <li>The 3 head pod is easily replaced by simply gripping the pod firmly and pulling it from its support.</li>
            <li>I have not tried that since the dry shaving that I do gives me such great results.  </li>
            <li>An added plus over the Arcitec is that the sideburn trimmer actually works quite well and is very useful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended that you do this after every shave, but who wants to do that every morning, right before work (not me, anyway)?  </li>
            <li>I purchased this unit and was very happy at first until the blades went dull after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li>The side burn trimmer is not too great and is very small as compared to my Braun razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since all my electric razor experience has been with Norelco, I can&#x27;t honestly compare this model with any other brand</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of beard other people have</li>
            <li>I was using and old model of norelco, and this new technology really like it, better cut quality, easier cleaning, etc.</li>
            <li>decided to pay a bit more and get the jet clean system because its another added convenience for me and one less thing I have to worry about.  </li>
            <li>and I find that with the use of the jet clean system there is a slight bit more shave efficiency/close shaving feel.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to buy them from a physical store where you&#x27;ll easily pay $5-$10 more for the same replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers I have owned will not get the long hairs, and this 3d gets them on the first pass.   </li>
            <li>As a bonus, the $30 coupon available when I ordered covered a Xbox 360 game I wanted, so all is good...</li>
            <li>Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I think keeping the blades properly cleaned and lubricated is crucial to good shaving performance.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m light on the stars because I think this razor has a major problem.</li>
            <li>I can report that I am positively delighted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have since purchased a Braun 790cc4 (the new one just released) and not only is the shave better - but the shaver feels more solid.</li>
            <li>As the title says, this was my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who might need an electronic shaver!It moves pretty smothly and also in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>Very close shaving on the first try.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty I guess, but it&#x27;s very impractical.  </li>
            <li>The old style heads (when you could find them) were going for almost as much as the razor sold for originally.</li>
            <li>True, you cannot charge directly from the chord.</li>
            <li>The cleaning thing is cool to watch in action as it turns the razor on and off as it dunks the unit in the cleaning</li>
            <li>But as interesting note I would like to add that after I purchased a new cutting head for my 11 years old Braun 7570 (since the shaver still keeps the charge very well and works perfectly)</li>
            <li>You can of course not purchase the system and clean the shaver under the faucet, but this procedure does waste more water.</li>
            <li>The cleaning attachment/stand is nice and makes it easier to charge although at least on mine, the \\&quot;automatic\\&quot; clean setting does not appear to work.</li>
            <li>It performs better on a decent stubble though and its kinda obvious.</li>
            <li>Having been a regular user of Philips Norelco Speed 8240 for the past, oh, maybe 4 years, I was very happy to order this new and improved shaver from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I believe it provides a much better and faster shave than the high end</li>
            <li>the best electric I have ever used, and (b) routinely gives me as close a shave as my razor without the mess and in considerably less time.  </li>
            <li>Very nice shave, not much different than the other Norelco razors I&#x27;ve had,</li>
            <li>If you get a new razor every year the Norelco may be worth adding to your arsenal though.</li>
            <li>It is nice, and brand new, It is exactly the same as what i saw in stores, but nearly $100 cheaper than that.</li>
            <li>No burn no scraping feeling, just a smooth as ice feel on skin &amp; smae as moving the shaver on my face - charging &amp; stowage is also 200% better then in past</li>
            <li>Is it really worth that much - probably not, but it is a nice shaver and I am sure it will last me another 8 years at least.</li>
            <li>The battery will last a month, easy.</li>
            <li>It is extraordinary how far electric shavers have come.</li>
            <li>the cover for the head breaks easily, they only warranty the motor ,</li>
            <li>It is easy and only goes in one way.</li>
            <li>again a very clever design from Phillips</li>
            <li>Except for a poor shave on my neck, it was great for the first eight or nine months.</li>
            <li>It certainly has all the bells and whistles anyone could ever want.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a new razor and new Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>since I do my current routine in the shower, this is a viable option if I need to shave on a non-shower day or for a touchup), moves with your face contour as well or better than any shaver before, quiet, charges quickly, ergonomically friendly, less razor irritation than any electric I have ever had (but not as little as a manual), sleek and beautiful.    </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t waste hundreds on buying everyone&#x27;s top of the line razor, but are willing to spend enough for one of the top razors get the Braun.</li>
            <li>It also give a very comfortable wet shave with shaving creme....</li>
            <li>If it were available, it cost almost as much as the complete razor did when new.</li>
            <li>Early days yet, but jet clean system works well and shaver seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>Great buy from Amazon since a less advance model cost twice as much thanks to the Chinese government&#x27;s &amp;#34;TAX&amp;#34; policy.</li>
            <li>The razor cuts ok, maybe a tiny bit better than my previous Norelco 8894XL.  </li>
            <li>The older model was actually a pretty lausy shaver.  </li>
            <li>My older daugther was in AH!</li>
            <li>The digital screen is nice and tells you exactly how much time you have left before a recharge is required and has been fairly accurately until just recently.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers about not needing the Jet Clean System (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet -- washing the heads with hot water seems quite adequate).  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I would pay the 100.00 more for the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li>The blades clean in hot water, and I only use the cleaning system weekly.  </li>
            <li>So -- it is but another twenty seconds to run hot water over the heads (they life up and tilt open like petals on a flower) to clean them and then set the razor on the stand to manually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jet Clean System is interesting to watch, but I&#x27;ve not had this long enough to really evaluate effectiveness.</li>
            <li>From the relatively quiet noise to the fact that hairs were not being spit out all over my counter, were already a huge improvement over the Series 7.  </li>
            <li>This thing is extremely quiet and gives a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s this huge triangular thing that is not form-fitting and way too big.  </li>
            <li>I bought it during Christmas week with low price,I really like it, make you comfortable</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t know if it helps or not.  </li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m dressed and on my way to work, I really don&#x27;t have the time to wait for that.</li>
            <li>with the 1280cc I fear nothing and actually enjoy shaving DAILY....  </li>
            <li>pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn</li>
            <li>Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn trimmer.    </li>
            <li>how fast you could get things done with the triple head--using the Braun takes much longer for me and never was quite as close of a shave...</li>
            <li>This shaves noticeably closer and with more comfort than I expected.</li>
            <li>After much researching I let my husband choose which shaver he would like.</li>
            <li>The shaver is doing great on my cheeks, but is still irritating my neck.    </li>
            <li>To begin with it&#x27;s much quieter than the Braun 7.</li>
            <li>Both the razor itself and the cleaning system are much quieter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even grown a beard to avoid the whole shaving</li>
            <li>My ski thanks you</li>
            <li>The razor itself is easier to hold and use, and is much lighter and quieter than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the display that indicates the number of shaving minutes remaining.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you travel much at all, you won&#x27;t like this razor.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the self cleaning</li>
            <li>I really, really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>makes a nice shave, very close, even with the most difficult hairs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Philips and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>The shave is close and the trimmer really works.  </li>
            <li>The motor is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>question that the Philips is quieter, but as it appears I really did not need it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Jim</li>
            <li>Works even better as a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close a shave as you&#x27;d get with a proper 4-blade razor, but it&#x27;s amazingly smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>looks of this thing are very futuristic.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my husband, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE REALLY DID THE TRICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the price of the shaver was very competitive.  </li>
            <li>It provided a very close shave and it did not irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette Power Fusion razors but with the price of blades being so much now I decided to switch.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to spend this much on an electric razor</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there would be this much difference</li>
            <li>It looks really handsome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am amazed how fast and close it was.</li>
            <li>and so you really don&#x27;t need a jetclean unit.</li>
            <li>The Braun 790 and this razor both give me a very close shave</li>
            <li>but this one is much faster.  </li>
            <li>When I needed a really close shave, I would use my multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a much improved design to me.    </li>
            <li>the activity price is very</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>very much!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets around his jaw and on his neck really well</li>
            <li>I dont really think you need the cleaning solution very often at all if you just rinse out the blades after each use.</li>
            <li>It charges really fast as well.</li>
            <li>This razor is &amp;#34;badass&amp;#34;, my guy loves this thing so much.</li>
            <li>much cheaper at around $75.  </li>
            <li>(fast recharge)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much quieter than any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>every week or so, I will, after doing the daily cleaning, which takes about 30 seconds, place the razor in the cleaning device, after having filled that with the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>razor requires a replacement head once a year, so get ready to spend some money just to maintain.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference...</li>
            <li>things I really like with this that I&#x27;ve never had before...</li>
            <li>the cleaning system seems to work really well</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so much easier getting around my face and feeling</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Clean up was fairly easy, only issue is one of the heads doesn&#x27;t always stay open when i&#x27;m brushing out the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave, its fast without any irritation.</li>
            <li>the charge holds up very well</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I receive VERY close shaves with a blade and Kiehl&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It was also very noisy.  </li>
            <li>have shaved my face well and as close as a blade (but not as fast as a blade).    </li>
            <li>the shave is very close to a blade.  </li>
            <li>I also reviewed the Panasonic, which I was very close in trying / buying because I did like the Remington foil shaver (3D is rotary).  </li>
            <li>and I really like that too.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cleanser tray.</li>
            <li>The triple head swivels &amp; adjusts to every contour of your face and gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can go wet/dry, and wet shaving gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even closer than a safety blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like the shaver with the wet/dry ability</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing when pressing the on/off button and absolutely nothing when placing it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li>This looked like it would work very well</li>
            <li>It cuts just as smoothly as it does the second day even after a week of growth!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a high annual cost!</li>
            <li>After a more thorough wet shave, I can still feel some stubble on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and fast.</li>
            <li>It is also a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It has a nifty self cleaner thing that seems to not be really doing anything.  </li>
            <li>The 1280X/42 Senso Touch worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>very close shave as well as</li>
            <li>It glided effortlessly over my face actually better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Even though you have a very dense beard this 1280XCC will give you a baby-face.</li>
            <li>It looks like I used a straight razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons- Very expensive&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a 5-6 minute shave time (avg 7-8 with the Panasonic) it really is quicker to shave by almost 25%.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, I feel I need to shave again if I go out with the Norelco (I didn&#x27;t feel this need as much with the Panasonic).</li>
            <li>It cleans itself, I think that he wants the blades to cut closer.  </li>
            <li>no matter how gentle I use it</li>
            <li>The self-adjusting heads really do flex around every curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How much do you want to bet that they will try to blame me.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I really felt the difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t much stubble to plug it up.  </li>
            <li>The charging stand is important if you take the shaver on a trip and do not want to carry the bulky jet system (as the shaver can only be charged either in the jet system, or in the stand).</li>
            <li>Shaves very close ,does not pull ,very quite.</li>
            <li>Its fast, and cuts very close.  </li>
            <li>My third shave was wet (shaving gel), and I must say, that the shave was just as good as the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>When I need to replace the head, I will go back to Panasonic and the nice and simple cartridge system they use.</li>
            <li>There is only one item I would like to see changed with this product;    You should be able to charge the shaver with a plug in directly.</li>
            <li>Yet, the fact that it also lubricates the shaving heads and gives it a fresh feel the next use, makes the cleaning stand worth while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the shaver head which contains the 3 rotary blade assemblies \\&quot;floats\\&quot; which allows the individual shaver heads to adjust to the contour of my face and clearly is part of the reason I get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the trimmer on the old 7825XL better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>(kind of messy).  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product for an everyday task that needs to get done (in my world it does).</li>
            <li>so getting right up under your nose takes a little more effort.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very, very close -- much more than any previous Norelco that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>the shave is not as close as my old shaver!!!  </li>
            <li>Secondly, and most importantly to me, the reservoir that holds the shavings really didn&#x27;t hold any shavings due to the design.  </li>
            <li>Now, instead of it charging up to full and showing 60 minutes available, it sometimes shows, 64 minutes, 68 minutes, and sometimes it shows less, like 55 minutes.</li>
            <li>That was the problem I had when I got my first one, but Amazon swapped it for a new one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Jet Clean System which works extremely well in keeping the shaver blades clean and at peak efficiency.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, other than the short life span.</li>
            <li>Much better than the other type of razors too very close shave.</li>
            <li>leaves the razor clean and ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>I have used both Norelco and Braun shavers in the past, and have liked certain aspects of both.  </li>
            <li>it was engineered much better than alot of other bathroom items.</li>
            <li>Before, I was not able to use my electric razor more than three days in a row, because my skin started to get irritated on the 4th day!</li>
            <li>which is something I have never been able to say about any other electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>This one is better than any other Razer,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I have not used the 1290, I did research both and could not find any reason it was a better \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; other than some \\&quot;touchscreen button\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, battery last long.</li>
            <li>compared to other electric razors which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco support is top notch.</li>
            <li>Shaves like most other electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The dry is very close and smooth; the wet shave is better still.  </li>
            <li>I dont think it causes alarm since you will not be replacing them too often if the shaver is kept clean and lubricated regularly.    </li>
            <li>When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I have used several electric shavers in the past and always experienced irritation on my neck from the shaver.</li>
            <li>It is shinny clean next time I use it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it you are not suppose to leave the Jet Clean system plug in the electric outlet.  </li>
            <li>I have found that opening the heads and just blowing them out after each shave has kept the unit clean enough without the need for the cleaning unit or the faucet.</li>
            <li>Back to the Jet Clean system - you start of by filling the bowl which is housed in the lower portion of the cleaning assembly with the cleaning solution provided.  </li>
            <li>c. Take the actual razors out of the protective shield that runs across your skin, and clean each piece separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have not used shaving cream with this unit yet and next weekend I plan to use the solution to clean up the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the 30 minutes with the Auto / Eco mode (which cuts the drying cycle short) and the 3 hour with the intensive clean.  </li>
            <li>The only fault to it is that when you plug it in &amp; clean the shaver, it also charges it after the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>My plan is to use the automatic cleaning unit occasionally and otherwise basically clean the razor manually.</li>
            <li>It is such a clean shave</li>
            <li>The cleaning machine is fantastic, but the cleaning solution is extremely difficult if not impossible to find in stores, so I&#x27;ve had to purchase it from Amazon (which is a better deal, anyway, because I can [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Enjoy being able to use dry or wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done that, you can open up the head cover and get an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li>More about the shaver:  Since my old Norelco was a 2004 vintage, I was not terribly surprised that progress had been made in shaver design in the intervening 7 years.  </li>
            <li>It worked decent at first, helping a little with the neck irritation, but I gave it more time since</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D electric shaver I bought was very reasonably priced, inculding the complete cleaning kit.  </li>
            <li>honestly think you&#x27;ll get quite a few years out of this razor before needing to purchase something new.</li>
            <li>Before buying it I was a little skeptical about how good (and by good</li>
            <li>After much research at that time, I went for a Braun Series 7 and was fairly loyal to it until recently.  </li>
            <li>In the past I have used electric shavers mostly - the most recent before this new Norelco being a Norelco 7825XL which I purchased in 2004.  </li>
            <li>When skimming through the net I came upon the new Philips 3d models they looked really promising and decided to buy one with the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the wet shave, which other reviewers report is even better than the dry shave, but the dry shave for me was very good.    </li>
            <li>This unit is also easy to clean, you can open up each of the three heads and empty out the hair in it.</li>
            <li>(3) lots of digital display which looks cool    </li>
            <li>For sideburns, this shaver has a pop-out cutter that does a good job - but it still leaves too much stubble and the round rotary head can&#x27;t get close enough...</li>
            <li>I have used electric shavers successfully in the past, and thought it was time to return to them after shelling out too much money on replacement blades for my regular razor.  </li>
            <li>The cool skin lotion pump on my last razor</li>
            <li>myy current Norelco, about ten years old--works just fine! )  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like new afterwards!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you be the judge as to whether it is worth its very high price, but this next generation of shavers can replace a shaving blade.  </li>
            <li>* Looks stylish, alot slimmer than previous models    </li>
            <li>This worked well, gave me a shave that was markedly better than my previous Norelco</li>
            <li>When it is finished, like a dishwasher, the light changes on the cleaning unit and the razor is lifted from the solution to air dry.</li>
            <li>It shaves close, quietly and quickly...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shaver to replaced my older braun shaver.</li>
            <li>The unit charge time is fairly quick and can last around (4-5 shaves approx.).</li>
            <li>still like this shaver well and works as expected, nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>I have an older Norelco shaver and the blades on it are still working</li>
            <li>The stores carried older models, but not the model our son requested.  </li>
            <li>His older electric shaver, which he could not use in the shower, was beginning to  irritate his skin</li>
            <li>How ever, it did prove somewhat of a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I had an older Philips shaver and now I got this one.</li>
            <li>always find out more about a product before you buy , the replacement  blade are over 100.00   to have a razor for one yr. , and have  the expense to up keep it ,I will go back to the razor there customer relations to me, are a low standing  .</li>
            <li>I only have some mild irritation on my lower neck from this unit.    </li>
            <li>Norelco should reengineer the dock to be more compact and simple than the monstrosity that it currently is.</li>
            <li>Check other prices for possible better deals, have seen in the one forty range!</li>
            <li>I preferred the older models that could be opened with just the flip of your thumb, but maybe the intricate design of the heads prevents that.  </li>
            <li>would not recommend this product because:&lt;br /&gt;1)It does not shave as well as the older model&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all, it is a decent shaver</li>
            <li>I love the shave with digital readout and especially the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular model is a bit overkill.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor to replace an older Philips Artilec model.  </li>
            <li>My older Philishave had served me well</li>
            <li>Cleaning was a breeze, open the blade compartment with quick click and run it under faucet and let it air dry...done.</li>
            <li>But, it is definitely a decent shave.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this one is because the top metal piece that holds the blades in place finally broke.  </li>
            <li>more than it say (depends on how much you use everyday, of course).</li>
            <li>The unit has to be started multiple times until the sensor is eventually able to detect the fluid level and start the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for 25 years, with a brief 2-3 years interlude of Gillette razors (caused, interestingly, by an incompatibility of electrical plugs when I moved from one country to another two decades ago, and not finding an adapter, forcing me to buy an emergency Gillette razor, taking me 2-3 years to go back to Norelco).</li>
            <li>The shave closeness is better than any Braun shaver I have used, although i find it more difficult to get up closer to the nose than I did with the Braun...</li>
            <li>This is particularly a problem in the neck area where the whiskers lie in all directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both seem very cheap and I am a little concerned about the stand breaking when I travel.</li>
            <li>the Philips since you need to shave in circular motion, it got every single hair and at the end it was extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Other than that, gives me a great shave with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>Filling it to the top also caused it to make a mess and leak anytime</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t wrong it is every bit as good as good as the reviews said if not more.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is way louder, not unpleasant, but it made me appreciate how quiet the Norelco had been all my life.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this model.</li>
            <li>The price is alittle high</li>
            <li>I must admit that my expectations may have been a bit too high for this razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The choice of an electric shaver is highly subjective.  </li>
            <li>(would light up the low fluid light when the fluid level was correct).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommends it to every one.</li>
            <li>excellent product, the base is very practical to use as much as support for fast cleaning, the machine is well adapted to the face</li>
            <li>in all I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this unit.</li>
            <li>Plus my brother had the 1280X and recommended it highly to me and his beard is heavier than mine.  </li>
            <li>And I highly recommend the seller,</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Norelco</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>On balance the quality and quietness of the shave inclines me to rate the product highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend the 1280X.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I also dread the high cost of changing razor heads.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would buy again ,and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The switch on the cleaner should be Clean On, Charge On, Clean/Charge On, but that&#x27;s a minor fault.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I&#x27;ve used several other electric razors and they didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>It works by far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had or used.  </li>
            <li>These spots, and many others, later turned into whiteheads, ingrown hairs, and very sensitive red welts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was only the first day!   </li>
            <li>it could be a little wider and cut better.</li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid lasts a long time, and the other features are great</li>
            <li>seriously, even my wife felt it was a smooth pokie free shave.    </li>
            <li>If your new razor squeaks return it before use for a new one!  </li>
            <li>The unit cleans very easily by running hot water on the blades for a few minutes (per the manual), after which you can open up the blades (they flip up) and continue to rinse.  </li>
            <li>In addition I found that the blade type used on the older Spectra gives a closer shave than the new style on the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The test I use in judging a shaver is how much time has to elapse after the shave to get to the point that when I feel my face, it is clear to me that I need to shave.  </li>
            <li>Wet or dry, clean smooth shave,</li>
            <li>Now that I have had this awhile, I feel although this is an expensive Razor it is a great razor.</li>
            <li>The razor glides smoothly over my face causing absolutely NO</li>
            <li>you want the closest shave, learn the old fashioned way with either a safety razor or a straight edge</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased, but the shave quality is not near what I was expecting for the product.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints:  Non-Universal Power Supply - I also own the Philips Body Shaver and while the power cords look the same and actually do plug into the charging bases, they are not compatible.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the chemical smell of a freshly cleaned public bathroom.</li>
            <li>Current location keeps the unit from being tucked into a corner and unnecessarily takes up more top space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommends that the head assembly be replaced every year, and I’m sure that that will cost a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the trimmer is sub-standard and just barely does the job.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much shave daily except on weekends.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time and the digital minute count down is definitely a great benefit for travel use.</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher than I would have liked to spend, but the razor shaves very well and does not irritate my skin nearly as much as other electric razors</li>
            <li>Even though this product will clean you dry, their new one won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Since my initial experience, I&#x27;ve shaved two more times (both dry).  </li>
            <li>It took more than 10 minutes each time and was DRY only (use remington face saver with this - it works well).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>This razor might be good for someone who shaves every single day, but for people who shave every few days it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because strait razors were giving the right side of my neck back irritation.</li>
            <li>After a full charge, I started dry shaving.</li>
            <li>And except for the most difficult chin areas, I do not have go back and forth multiple times in order to get a good close shave there.    </li>
            <li>The contraption that this razor charges in is huge, mainly due to the cleaning basin that is below.</li>
            <li>The original RQ12 replacement heads are still on the market, but sell for $180+ due to high demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I decided to try the new razor with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>like when using a safety razor with a new cartridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used either a Mach 3, Fushion or the New Hydro disposables.</li>
            <li>it gives, rathrer than buy a new unit (the 1280 [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The cleaning feature makes it like new after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Because it had a 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;Philips replaced the defective body with a new one.</li>
            <li>I exchanged it through my AMAZON order ... got a brand new one....</li>
            <li>and they told me they were seending a NEW unit IN a box .....</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  </li>
            <li>but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  </li>
            <li>So, re-contacting them they sent a new replacement handle.</li>
            <li>Still works like new too.</li>
            <li>with my new razor.</li>
            <li>yourself the expense, and buy their new Series 9000 razor.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I used my new Senso 1280xcc without the gillette and man, what a finish...    </li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver and had never used a Norelco</li>
            <li>Also, on this new Norelco if you take care of the heads you may not have to replace them every year.</li>
            <li>Also, on this new Norelco if you take care of the heads you may not have to replace them every year.</li>
            <li>If you are new to electric razors like I was, you should know that there is still a consumable item you need to buy with this.  </li>
            <li>After seeing this Norelco on TV, I decided it might be time to think about getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all shavers, a new one takes time to get used to.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I may as well just replace the razor since I needed new blades too.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this new one because the battery needs replaced</li>
            <li>I just bought the new Panasonic Arc 5.</li>
            <li>The increased number of cutting heads not only provide a closer shave, but greatly decrease required shaving time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly fond of using the old fashioned shaving soap and a silver tipped badger hair shaving brush method of shaving [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>After a month of using this razor I am simply amazed at how stubble free my skin is now and didn&#x27;t think a shave this close with an electric was even possible.</li>
            <li>If the user does leave the shaver pugged in, then it is possible to hear a clicking sound as the shaver keeps trying to recharge every second once the shaver is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I did so much research on what my next electric razor would be and was really hoping this razor would meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li>but I finally decided to take the plunge, and so far it has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was very satisfied with the unit; after about 7 months, the handle unit failed to take a charge; the company replaced the handle unit, indicating the unit was covered under the original purchase date</li>
            <li>you have been on the fence; are prone to ingrown hairs; or have frequent irritation after shaving with a foil or blade, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this razor cuts as close as a blade without the damage.   </li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive hearing).  </li>
            <li>all I can come up with is that the cleaning station is a little big and it does take up counterspace...and the plug is kinda big which for me is good since you&#x27;re supposed to unplug it after charging or cleaning and my wife needs all the plugs for her hair...</li>
            <li>** After steering away from electric shavers for at least 10 years due to the quality of the shave, i have been really happy with the closeness of the shave provided by this shaver.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>The hairs were mostly gone, but the small scabs reappeared.  </li>
            <li>have to go around the same area too many times compared to other products.my skin</li>
            <li>I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my shavers to one of the top of the line shavers on the market, the Philips 1280cc/42, especially since Philips-Norelco has a $50 rebate going on at the present time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing with the Philips that it gives me a touch more skin irritation sometimes if I am not careful enough around the lower neck area, but very close and extremely quiet shave.</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t say enough about how much he enjoys using it!  </li>
            <li>The beauty of all this was that it was just outside of the standard 2 year warranty, but I found out that by registering my product purchase online they added 6 months to the warranty, and my now 2.5 year warranty now started at my registration date, not my original purchase date (registered about a month after purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update for March 2013:  The jet cleaning system completely stopped working!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely frozen!</li>
            <li>However, I prefer my Philips Norelco since I believe the 3 head shaver gives my face a better shave than other designs by manufacturers such as Braun.  </li>
            <li>first week I used it just as I have every electric for the last 20 years, just the shaver and my face.  </li>
            <li>Totally logical ... and totally didn&#x27;t work that way.     </li>
            <li>Same problem happened with the first one I got after 2 months.  </li>
            <li>but my experience with Norelco razors tells me that this shaver will last many years with only occasional blade replacements needed!  </li>
            <li>Super wet shave withy new Notelco...</li>
            <li>Each head move individually, and it only takes a couple passes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>wanted to mention that after 2 years of use my razor quit charging and at the same time my Jet Clean system suddenly wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>The only thing I would do different is get one without the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>Second, pulling each individual head out to manually clean the unit under the faucet</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued... but initially was put off by the high price.  </li>
            <li>To sum it up this model gives me a very fast and close shave that works just as well with a few days worth of growth</li>
            <li>I recently bought the Norelco 1280X to replace my old arcitec shaver, which I bought back in 2008 when this line was originally launched.  </li>
            <li>I have reached this conclusion based on having used BOTH the old Philips Norelco Speed 8240 without any fancy 2D, 3D, 4D, or 5G functions, and the new 1280X / 42.  </li>
            <li>Compared to previous models, Norelco has made huge strides in improvement in this area.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is cheap, but you need to buy a bottle every 2 and a half months or so.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my previous razor, this one is quieter, in fact, it is so quiet that you can actually hear someone talking outside of the bathroom which is nice as I always seem to get interrupted with questions while I&#x27;m trying to shave!</li>
            <li>Is worth every single dollar.</li>
            <li>I wrote a positive review when I got this razor initially.  </li>
            <li>The digital display lets you know exactly how much time is left, no guessing from the bars.</li>
            <li>it is really a toss up since I just repurchased a new Philips 1280XX/42 and alternately using both of them.</li>
            <li>It works as it says, wet or dry, which I love.  </li>
            <li>And three,I don&#x27;t see any need for the jet clean system, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to disinfect, takes up a lot of space, and I can still see a little bit of debris that it didn&#x27;t remove from normal shaving.</li>
            <li>wet   - Can be used more than once with limited skin irritation  </li>
            <li>and I use that function about once or twice a month to really clean the blades as the time it takes to do all the time is not worth it</li>
            <li>Overall, I give both razors a 4 and would easily recommend either one, but different people will have different priorities on what they want to get out of it.  </li>
            <li>As a person who used arcitec for several years, this Sensotouch 3D device is giving me a nice time shaving my face either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>If you use everyday it is some what fine</li>
            <li>original handle lasted approximately 2 weeks before the battery charge started to degrade to the point that a full charge became 36 minutes not 60.</li>
            <li>He spent his first couple of uses just playing with his new toy!</li>
            <li>Just received my shaver from Amazon this evening and had my first (dry) shave with the new shaver.</li>
            <li>I find this two step system results in keeping my goatee short on a much more frequent basis (trimming in my sink makes a mess),</li>
            <li>Was a little hesitant spending so much for a razor, but let me tell you it is very much \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Super wet shave, forever!</li>
            <li>SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]</li>
            <li>My neck was even clear.</li>
            <li>- Charges fast (60 minutes of charging will give you roughly 60 minutes of shaving) and holds the charge very well  </li>
            <li>A hour or so later, the shaver was clean, dry and fully charged.  </li>
            <li>As I was transferringthe solution out of the cleaning system I purposely did not transfer the \\&quot;dregs\\&quot; if you will at the bottom of the bowl because there was clearly visible particulate matter in the solution.  </li>
            <li>far this has been worth the money spent on it, even if I picked it out  myself for</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would upgrade my old shaver rather than purchase another set of cutters.  </li>
            <li>Even though I routinely used a Norelco razor, the first use of this model did indeed cause some minor razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product as a whole is that there is no automatic shut off when its done charging.</li>
            <li>It can not be fixed, parts are no longer made.</li>
            <li>What I do have a problem with is the fact that the razor has to be removed from the charging unit as soon as the charge is complete.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco Spectra 8894XL after my dog attacked it and broke it.</li>
            <li>The technological difference is analogous to an old rotary phone to an iPhone.</li>
            <li>cuts or razor burns were frequent.  </li>
            <li>Light touch and few strokes - close shave.  </li>
            <li>(It would show about 60 minutes when fully charged, and now only shows 30 minutes straight off the charger.)  </li>
            <li>My skin is highly sensitive, and I find myself returning to Norelco products again and again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does, however shave very well, and so, I added one star back.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and get a lot of irritation or bumps with a razor, try a premium electric like this.</li>
            <li>but WOW sums it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Boy, was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>and so far I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do have to go over my face a few times to get it smooth</li>
            <li>Now what I don&#x27;t like is the grip, it doesn&#x27;t feel natural in my hand.</li>
            <li>he has sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>Looks like Norelco took the complaints of that model and fixed them with the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 1280x / 42 falls FAR below expectations in meeting my shaving needs, as follows.  </li>
            <li>- god forbid that I go without shaving for two days (48 hours) straight, and try using the Philips Norelco 1280X/42 to get a regular shave.  </li>
            <li>Evidently my facial hair wasn&#x27;t really compatible with foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Norelco was an impulse buy, after I&#x27;d almost given up on electric shavers, and it completely changed my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am now told to discharge the unit completely and attempt a recharge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>I actually did buy one for my Dad for Christmas and he really likes his too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so my razor gets banged around by TSA frequently</li>
            <li>and so my razor gets banged around by TSA frequently</li>
            <li>Especially like the fast charge feature.</li>
            <li>I use skin cleanser that is applied with a cotton swab and with my old razors, I would always end with a face covered in cotton swab fragments.</li>
            <li>can this razor bring to my face that my 6 year old $99 Norelco couldn&#x27;t?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This one topped the charts as far as reviews go, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>It was almost 10 years old and the battery started failing and not holding a charge.</li>
            <li>However, I developed a rash under my chin and it would not go away.  </li>
            <li>P.S. our son gave his old electric shaver to his dad.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t change my mind upon reading the negative review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says It cuts very close, has a durable feel to it, and works quiet...</li>
            <li>miss my old Braun, but I guess even Braun doesn&#x27;t make them like they used to based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>Its only $200 and the replacement heads are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t something that made me say WOW...  </li>
            <li>Also want to note, searched before purchase the cost for replacement cleaning fluid and heads, and found all are reasonably price.  </li>
            <li>my husband want to change his old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning this item with the knowledge that I&#x27;m not missing out.</li>
            <li>Neck is not as close as a blade, but is near blade status, if you spend the time.  </li>
            <li>All electric razors I have used, sans the early Braun</li>
            <li>The 3D is a whole different animal.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this because my old Spectra model was dropped and the retaining ring broke.  </li>
            <li>The shave quality is very similar to the results from the Braun foil shaver I have, but was much faster.</li>
            <li>Note: The cleaning system for this model offers three options for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I attribute the life of my old Norelco&#x27;s heads to routine cleaning and lubrication of its heads.</li>
            <li>I attribute the life of my old Norelco&#x27;s heads to routine cleaning and lubrication of its heads.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>but I do still need to use an old fashion razor to get the places where the Philips razor missed.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the razor is very simple and charge time is fast.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: the shaver just does not give me that polished, soft skin after the shave that the Panasonic does.</li>
            <li>I am concerned, however, about the reviews of the RQ12+ on the Amazon site as MANY are extremely negative.</li>
            <li>and you want to completely shave it off</li>
            <li>My almost 16 year old began shaving about a year ago and we purchase a wahl shaver.  </li>
            <li>Battery not holding complete charge need to get replacement.</li>
            <li>A complete charge is 60 minutes.  </li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t affected the use</li>
            <li>Quiet and fast.  </li>
            <li>- on regular shave days (i.e., on those days when I have only 24-hours worth of hair), no matter how much time I spend shaving, there are still occasional hairs, scattered all over my face, which are completely un-cut.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this in wet shaving and will do so one of these days for fun.</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but surprisingly good.    </li>
            <li>And well... It&#x27;s good but definitely not as perfect as the maker portraits it to be.</li>
            <li>My beard tends to lay down under razors easily, so when using an electric, have to go over the same places many times and press hard.  </li>
            <li>The morning shave in not a little torture for me anymore</li>
            <li>The first two (2) shaves withe the 1280 were dry shaves.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and dry, never fails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to set the razor in the cleaning station every couple of uses to deep clean and lubricate the cutting heads</li>
            <li>Cleaning system only notifies that it must be changed after you start a cycle-it then refuses to clean and shaver is wet from solution.  </li>
            <li>then I can remember and this is the third one and the last two did not fail</li>
            <li>I returned it for a Norelco 8250, which has the exact same razors, but the traditional electric razor shape.  </li>
            <li>At first I used it as a wet razor like my old one.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use a regular Gillette shaver and then I use my Panasonic electric shaver to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used a foil-type shaver for the last several years, this was my first rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>The one star rating may seem a little harsh for a razor that does actually shave, however the razor is being sold as a top of the line razor and it is no better than the 20 year old travel Norelco I own.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality shaver, look no further.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially as a gift.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is it&#x27;s high cost.  </li>
            <li>The Braun has a little bit closer shave on specific areas than the Norelco, but overall the better shave between the electric&#x27;s was with the 1280X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but will when I need to do deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product but a little expensive.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very ergonomically designed, lighter than previous models and comes at a very affordable price.    </li>
            <li>This shaver does do a pretty good job of close shaving on dry skin as long as you use your other hand or facial muscles to stretch the skin as tightly</li>
            <li>I went with the assumption that more expensive has to be better and with how bad my neck was getting, it would have been worth every penny if my assumption would hold to be true.</li>
            <li>I can now shave daily and only get light to minimal redness if any on my neck.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re waiting for a long time.but it&#x27; s really worth.i bought it before.the same,perfect.</li>
            <li>fast charging 1 hour long keeps charging.</li>
            <li>Normally my Norelco&#x27;s were around the $40-60 price range and would last (battery/blades) about 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>Now (5 weeks later) the razor irritates my upper lip, side of my mouth, and all of my neck where before it was only the right side of the neck.</li>
            <li>I have used both and will shave wet most of the time after a shower with little risk of cuts.  </li>
            <li>Other than that he really likes his new razor.</li>
            <li>They originally shipped the wrong item, but with ONE quick email the problem was corrected and I received the correct item within two days</li>
            <li>other words, when you buy this razor, you pay for the convenience of a quick, painless, relatively close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried pre-shave gels and creams before finally doing research for a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>For Christmas 2011, I decided to give the new wet/dry norelco electric shaver a try sort of a Christmas present to myself and with the $30 off</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a new razor from Braun, the company that made my last electric razor that I used for years.  </li>
            <li>After using this, the new RQ12 is a big improvement over the RQ10 of the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>It was at my door 6 jan 11.Sorry for not getting $50 because i live outside the USA.  </li>
            <li>The new 3 head pod can then be simply snapped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I ordered and received my new razor and the second time I recharged my razor</li>
            <li>Was using an ancient Norelco that I had put numerous new blades in.  </li>
            <li>I also got a much closer shave, so I guess I will stick with the dry shaving for now.</li>
            <li>Use wet or dry and the result, is a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-That&#x27;s pretty much all I can think of beyond the usual things intrinsic to an electric razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the Braun refill cartridges are more expensive than the Norelco&#x27;s, I like the fact that it is much neater and eaiser to use.  </li>
            <li>This is only personal preference and absolutely nothing against the performance of the Philips shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close and gentle shaving experience everyday.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver ever, so I don&#x27;t have any experiences with other shavers to compare with.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t think the ink rubbing off was major</li>
            <li>The instructions stated to give the product a minimum of four weeks to allow your face to adjust, and allow your facial hair to grow straight out vs. straight down against the face and curling under the skin.    </li>
            <li>It is a very nice experience using this razor, after being used to the tugs and snags of other electrics, or the general roughness that some of the others had left behind.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how another shaver could do better than this.</li>
            <li>The razor charges quickly, and I mean REALLY quickly--way faster than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned and probably twice as fast as the 5-year-old Braun razor</li>
            <li>The razor shaves fabulously, face wet with cream or dry regular and it can be eaisly cleaned in the sink under running water!  </li>
            <li>really gets the job done Wet or Dry again if your looking for a very close shave I would suggest going with a razor or using a combo of both</li>
            <li>Razor is a little pricy, but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have had a hard time getting a comfortable close shave, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>Says every time he uses it, that it is so smooth,  he can hardly feel  it.  </li>
            <li>First, the heads pivoted so much, it was hard to get a truly close shave since they pivoted away from the face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t add anything to the other positive reviews at this site.     </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well especially around the neck area.</li>
            <li>It barely holds the shavor.</li>
            <li>Of the two razors I used prior to, and after getting the Norelco, the Fusion by far is the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes does not provide a complete shave especially with hair longer than stubble.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I had to fix several spots with my old razor to even out</li>
            <li>One is that it doesn&#x27;t cut the longer hairs around the neck and upper cheek areas nowhere nearly as well as it claims to do in the advertizing.</li>
            <li>My initial concern with buying it was price and the fact I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No regrets at all.</li>
            <li>With my old razor, I had to go multiple times (like 10 times) to feel that skin is like baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>Traveling with the 1280X - From my experience so far I think I could travel with the 1280X for 25 days without needing to take the charging stand and cord with me - that&#x27;s assuming it was fully charged when I left</li>
            <li>Using it wet with shave cream gives a very close shave with no skin irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely used it since purchasing it, but once I started using it again</li>
            <li>so he had to give up his trusty, old circa 1960&#x27;s double edged razor.  </li>
            <li>He was using some cheap electric foil razor for a few months that practically left his facial hairs longer rather than shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a handful of electric shavers since I was old enough to shave.  </li>
            <li>It is way too much money invested in electric razors for no reasonable replacement parts...</li>
            <li>Straight to be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposed to be a wet shaver...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old with both heavy and medium whisker areas on my face; it&#x27;s my first electric razor in over 35 years.  </li>
            <li>I had the 1280 for a few months now and can say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.   </li>
            <li>So, if the cleaning unit fails, the razor can be just as effectively cleaned manually.</li>
            <li>When the read-out got down to 4 minutes remaining (after about a month), I got the cleaner system out and did my first cleaning on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also, the head on this model has extra room for hair clippings to store, whereas the old models were too small and the head would fill up quick with clippings</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and gets places where most other less expensive electric razors miss, like on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life as well.</li>
            <li>The razor was great but finding replacement heads a year later was nearly impossible.</li>
            <li>far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i guess it might take few shaves to get it right and speed things up a bit).</li>
            <li>The application of using works well with my face I will say I did have some slight irritation with my neck at first</li>
            <li>This not only provides you with a close shave, but is quiet and can last pretty long.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure the other razors I have had were garbage, such as the single foil Braun for like $40.</li>
            <li>I was extremely hesitant to pay this much for a razor.  </li>
            <li>Cost was reasonable in comparison with other advertised.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would be future-proofed for at least 4 or 5 years and this fit the bill, especially given Amazon&#x27;s online price which was substantially lower than anywhere else including Wal*Mart and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Norelco was a 53rd birthday present, and after owning several electric shavers from Norelco generations in my time I am surprised that they could yet make improvements.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these \\&quot;latest\\&quot; Philips electric razor (same model without the ) to replace the current one (also Philips brand) which is 7 years old.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;After an additional few more months of use I noticed a slightly noisier electric shaver motor than before, all else being equal.</li>
            <li>I have watched videos of various shavers in action and, as I saw on videos, this one is very quiet compared to Braun or Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I just upgraded from a similar model that was 2D and about 4 years old (the battery died on me and couldn&#x27;t be brought back to life).  </li>
            <li>The problem is, after only owning and using this razor daily for two months, it is not charging completely.  </li>
            <li>The main factor in this is, ability to wet shave (using shaving cream).  </li>
            <li>It is also by far the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like that it can be used for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>The actual razor heads did their job well, but I had two major complaints that caused me to return the product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this shaver could do a little bit better job especially if you have a little bit longer hair</li>
            <li>I pondered over purchasing a new shaver for quite some time, specially an expensive shaver such as the 1280XL, since the old one was otherwise working fine.</li>
            <li>I spent a little more and got the top of the line because even at $229 it is still less than what I had spent in the past.</li>
            <li>After Shave Gel (ironically) for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>But the time I save is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li>the first few weeks is supposed to be the roughest (until your face gets used to it).</li>
            <li>hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.  </li>
            <li>hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.  </li>
            <li>The first times i suffered a little \\&quot;like friction burn\\&quot; in the low part of the neck (where there is not hairs, but it started to disappear with the continue use ant</li>
            <li>but for such a high price i expected more.love the slef cleaning feature</li>
            <li>be prepared for the capacity to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your shaving conditions, which will probably mean that you will NOT get a full 60 min of shaving time.  </li>
            <li>It still charges completely and lasts a very long time between charges.  </li>
            <li>posted a Vine of this piece of junk that went viral and the Norelco contracted social media company got back to me on Twitter.</li>
            <li>It is battery operated only and for what it costs, I am not sure that the shave is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty short and gives me trouble when trying to shave around my ears to trim up the sideburn area.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my old Norelco razor, I at first thought this razor sounded slow.  </li>
            <li>When it was about time to purchase me second replacement head I found a new complete razor for less than the price of the replacement head (which is totally overpriced).  </li>
            <li>I am not as crazy about the Braun cleaning system when compared to the Norelco, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li>Though, when used wet with shaving gel... WOW!  </li>
            <li>It really works well dry or wet, it shaves close.</li>
            <li>appreciated is usage dry and wet and changable head unit, for beard styler</li>
            <li>Your face doesn&#x27;t feel raw or funny when you finish.</li>
            <li>in the past the electric shavers I have used have been SoSo- this on the other hand was so smooth</li>
            <li>Cons:  (1) bulky, as compared with old models (although slightly powerful which really does not make too much difference to me personally)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to be interested over the long term how this shaver holds up, it worries me a little that the lockdown mechanism for the shaver head will stop latching correctly as the pieces for that seem rather fragile.  </li>

            <li>Thus, you gamble that you&#x27;ll get a good unit OR a bad unit ....</li>

            <li> Very good product, the long-awaited.</li>
            <li> seems to be a very good razor.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.</li>
            <li> and--worse--my face was incredibly irritated by this razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember electric razors giving an incredible close shave before, but it has been over 10 years since I used one.</li>

            <li> It took about a week for my beard to adjust, but now I get an incredibly close shave from this electric razor.</li>
            <li> and if you are in market looking for one this is as good unit to consider!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it!  </li>
            <li> so good!</li>
            <li> The swivel head ensures maximum contact between the shaver and my skin, and I have not had any instances of razor burn, ingrown hairs or bumps, which is a very exceptional outcome.    </li>
            <li> Thank you Philips Norelco for another great product and thank you Amazon for another GREAT deal on this great shaver!</li>

            <li> It appears to be a great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a while, but the battery performance dropped off after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that will be a great experience as well.  </li>
            <li> Great electric Shaver.</li>

            <li> Great shaver.    </li>

            <li> ... happy and all ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, cut my water bill by $40 a month since I used to run the water while I shaved with the razor....</li>
            <li> Phillips makes a great product.</li>
            <li> Great Job Norelco, give this shaver two thumbs up.</li>

            <li> Also the pop out trimmer is not that great</li>
            <li> and i am happy that i got Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> All in all great unit</li>
            <li> then which to a rotary shaver, like the Philips/Norelco 1280X/42 and experienced skin irritation?  </li>
            <li> I am happy.  </li>

            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> I have to say how great this shaver is</li>
            <li> Great shaver, except when the blades(Head) wears out you must through it away.  </li>
            <li> The ability to use shaving cream has helped greatly with the transition from a manual razor.</li>
            <li> once I did it also works great.</li>
            <li> but now it shaves great.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, wonder why Philips stopped making it.</li>

            <li> The LCD is very attractive and the cleaner is nice, although a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> But it does a great job.</li>

            <li> very nice deal on this philpis shaver.</li>
            <li> I from China，I like it，It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> If you can deal with that, it&#x27;s a very nice unit to use.  </li>
            <li> Has a very nice quality feel to it.</li>
            <li> very nice carrying case</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, this Norelco handled a 2-3 day growth very nicely.</li>

            <li> A remarkable product.</li>

            <li> My wife bought this one for me and I have to say I am even more impressed than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am writing this review more than 3 years after purchasing it and it&#x27;s just as wonderful  </li>
            <li> no doubt this is easily the very best experience  &amp; totally happy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the quietest electrics I&#x27;ve ever used, being pleasantly suprised by the tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and good to use!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I need stuff\\&quot;  their items sell at a very good price and the company&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING.  </li>
            <li> Amazing shave, great price.</li>
            <li> and I thought I loved it.  </li>
            <li> (2) good looking  </li>
            <li> just to hold it upright for a good looking?    </li>
            <li> shave is good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another one for travel as it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> Received this product 2 days after ordering in good packaging&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Good luck in your search.</li>
            <li> for years I brought razors and blades,blades,blades,but I never wanted to pay the price of a good electric.</li>
            <li> It was a good shaver but the motor went out.</li>
            <li> good razor</li>
            <li> All in all, if you are a electric fan, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a good choice, but won&#x27;t replace a manual for me.</li>
            <li> Makes good business sense for them to design it that way.  </li>
            <li> Good price comparing to market</li>
            <li> Good battery, hold about 1 hour of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> AND PROVIDES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really loved that razor, but it&#x27;s time was up.</li>
            <li> We gave it to our son for Christmas and he was delighted.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is superior to that of the Braun.</li>
            <li> this is a good one to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a good one to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They quit making the good RQ-12 Heads.  </li>
            <li> so good</li>
            <li> , so good so good sogood  </li>
            <li> I have not had a good shave in fifty years until i purchased the norelco 1280 xcc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh yea, can&#x27;t make $$ if you make them too good.</li>
            <li> the reviews on this are so good, i had to order it and try.</li>
            <li> Wether shaving with electric or blade, I&#x27;ve always gotten fairly irritated because of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I loved this thing, but I cannot get good replacable blades.</li>
            <li> They tell you to give it 21 days to get used to it and get a good shave</li>
            <li> just so I would have a fair comparison</li>
            <li> but for now, it does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  </li>
            <li> They both do really good job of getting a close shave</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> than that seames to do a good job</li>
            <li> One of the best features is the charging stand which keeps the shave fully charged at all times while allowing you to shave cord free.</li>
            <li> Philips&#x27;s quality is good.</li>
            <li> , Philips product always good quality, if there have any promotion, don&#x27;t miss</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> This product feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> And it looks good, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> Also good for when you need to shave at night and not make a ton of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave is ok not as good as a razor!  </li>
            <li> Very good shaver, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Phillips for the best electric razor on the market and thanks to Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m very glad I bought it --</li>
            <li> and my husband is very pleased.</li>
            <li> great shave :)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and would recommend this shaver without reservation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than happy  </li>
            <li> After using the unit, I am very pleased with the shaving performance, as well as the cleaning.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m is very satisfied with the product, recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and my skin seems to be also.</li>
            <li> The battery life is really good, close shave, no damage to skin, looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Very smoothly!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li> great works like a top</li>
            <li> its good for keeping a nice look ,travel a lot ,but nothing beats a razor shave, after one yr.</li>
            <li> nice product, good price</li>
            <li> one seems to be the best shaver on the market right now.  </li>
            <li> I was originally very happy with this shaver -- it was very gentle</li>
            <li> Very good, cool</li>
            <li> If you are giving it as a gift, the guy you give this to will love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I did, although it&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor it is a closer shave than clippers and my bumps are gone!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver the first couple of days and wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing!  </li>
            <li> Come on Philips you could do better!</li>
            <li> Outstanding shave!</li>
            <li> TOP!</li>
            <li> It is, in a word, BETTER!  </li>
            <li> and he love it!</li>
            <li> (It better be for the amount Norelco is charging for the replacement heads!)</li>
            <li> and I was never quite sure how best to clean it</li>
            <li> The travel lock works great, and the battery easily lasts for weeks of travel before it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> It is a pleasure to use and easy to maintain, adding great value to my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Great product haven&#x27;t had any problems, easy to use &amp; the closest shave for men &amp; women (in all the areas you want to go).</li>
            <li> Great feel, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks the shave was not as close as I would have liked but as my skin has become use to the razor it has a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> The razor sounds very light, shave is very smooth, very nice.</li>
            <li> perfect, fell in love when i first saw it!</li>
            <li> However, the shave was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> 3D head is amazing allowing the razor to stay in contact with my face.</li>
            <li> The feature of self cleaning is amazing.</li>
            <li> and that is amazing</li>
            <li> The shave is great, the cleaning tray is great and the razor itself is nicel great buy and would definitely stick to this brand</li>
            <li> Great shave, smooth and close without irritation to the skin.  </li>
            <li> is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Well built, amazing quality.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> but when you don&#x27;t have time for that like me some mornings its great to pull out and just use for my face with light neck and moustache cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros- looks amazing</li>
            <li> I suffer from razor bumps and this shaver is just amazing.</li>
            <li> looks amazing and the self cleaning is just out of this world.</li>
            <li> and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Looks great, fortunately, the razor is not made in China, although the charger is.</li>
            <li> Shave quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> I shaver is nice to hold, but that can be said for the Braun.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and probably the best I&#x27;ve had, but I am giving up on trying to find an electric razor that gives a shave as close as the traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is quieter and has a nice shape.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself had a nice flexible design and the cleaning system returned the razor to a \\&quot;new\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li> -&#x27;s:  Still not as effective as a manual on the lip area</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s handy and compact travel case which accomodates the charger</li>
            <li> Gave a nice close shave,</li>
            <li> and I had to figure it out on my own.</li>
            <li> Really good, love it.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the battery capacity rose after 1-2 cycles to 41-42 min, which is where it is now.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my uncle, he really like it and feel very happy!  </li>
            <li> include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> but then again I use the nice ones.</li>
            <li> Recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great shave!</li>
            <li> Probably the best gift I ever got him cause he gets so much use out of it.</li>
            <li> I liked the Braun</li>
            <li> It contains its own battery, so you are not chained to an outlet while you shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves my face beautifully, but my true test is my neck which gave all electric shavers I have tried problems.</li>
            <li> I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet</li>
            <li> Not as close as I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li> The is also a nice travel case included.</li>
            <li> I also own a Braun and it does not hold a candle to</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have decided to keep the razor and continue since my Panasonic is effectively unserviceable.</li>
            <li> nice shaver for traveling .and</li>
            <li> It gives him a nice, close shave and it saves him from me nagging him that he looks scrappy.</li>
            <li> Was nice while it worked (about six months).  </li>
            <li> The shaver rotary cutters will effectively cut a stubble beard but not the longer whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is effective in trimming beards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get a bit warm after about 4 minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li> For right now, I am thoroughly enjoying the best shaves of my life.  </li>
            <li> Okay, this looks like an awesome product right?</li>
            <li> Exceptionally close and leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great discount to begin with ($206) originally $349.</li>
            <li> Jet Clean system is great also.</li>
            <li> I like the display and the jet clean system works great.</li>
            <li> I did my homework before choosing to buy an electric shaver and all the reviews that I read on the internet said that this particular shaver was the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this beautiful looking shaver from reading many reviews on the close smooth shaves without driving/</li>
            <li> A phone call led me to a pleasant woman named Amy, who solved my problem easily and politely.</li>
            <li> much is worth a good, pleasant shave in the morning,</li>
            <li> The unit is very nicely assembled and the shaving heads are quite unique.  </li>
            <li> Flagship product, has the very high technological content, a lot of new technology, can greatly improve the use experience, exquisite packaging, very suitable as a gift</li>
            <li> Sometimes a new design isn&#x27;t always the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this new Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> I had to find something better no matter what the cost, this razor is the best ever.love the fast and clean,smooth,shave.</li>
            <li> in all, super happy with this shaver and sticking with it.</li>
            <li> But customer service was very nice and sent me a brand new one for free!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very easy on your face.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, and very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle and is lite to hold.</li>
            <li> The best part is it work great with shaving gel which does not foam like other cream.   </li>
            <li> Each bottle of jet clean lasts about a month, so I would imagine that can get kind of pricey, but BB&amp;B has good price on it.</li>
            <li> jet clean system is really nice and always cleaning the shaver and keeping it in good condition.</li>
            <li> Bottomline: A very good razor that comes very close to a blade.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s nice to use on the blades, but chances are it&#x27;ll get lost before 30 days.  </li>
            <li> This is by far, THE BEST wet/dry electric razor I have EVER owned!   </li>
            <li> This is one nice shaver and sideburn trimmer better than any ever used.</li>
            <li> by far the SensoTouch 3D is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> If you can not waste time and need to get presentable for work, this is the best option.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for a good comfortable</li>
            <li> That being said, this electric is by far the best razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> so far shaves the best.  </li>
            <li> He said this is by far the best razor he has ever used!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best razor out there.  </li>
            <li> is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> And nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Best one so far.</li>
            <li> you can tell I am very impressed so far</li>
            <li> As you can tell I am very impressed so far</li>
            <li> I was dubious to spend this kind of money on a razor but after using it for a week I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and i&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> But Amazon had by far the best price I found anywhere, and I thoroughly research products like this before purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had the money and got the best razor Norelco offers.  </li>
            <li> The best I have had so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for about 5 years and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is far and away the best shaving electrically I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and rapid and no burning&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner does a great job of bringing the blades back to looking brand new...expect that will extend the life of the blades, as clean blades are happy blades!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how happy I am with it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a cllose comfortable shave!!</li>
            <li> pivoting head of the razor allows it to get a closer shave than the older style electric razors, and the cleaning station does a very good job of charging and cleaning the heads after use.  </li>
            <li> Honestly when i received the shaver, i was glad with all the features and options it has, and when i tried it was shaving well, and i am still using it, and i am satisfied from the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> Good product, as well as the Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> I never could get a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I clean the shaver in it every day and my skin feels  good after a cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> Great shaving experience, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> One of its best features is the smooth, quick comfortable shave even after a 4-5 day growth.  </li>
            <li> Much better built and imuch more effective electric shaving instrument.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful razor for many people, but think twice if you have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning stand works perfectly, although you can clean it allot better just by running hot water on it.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is very nice, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, my first time trying electric razors</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent smooth shave.</li>
            <li> : VERY SMOOTH SHAVE&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was very comfortable; using it I could survive without after shave if I had to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> In fact, the jojoba oil is a very light oil and keeps the blades well lubricated.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and close shaves</li>
            <li> And the shaver is VERY light.</li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is the additional fact that it can be effectively and easily cleaned manually.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, fast shippingto Australia, the condition was perfect and full functionality.</li>
            <li> The razor is very easy to clean with warm water.</li>
            <li> However the shave itself was amazingly proficient and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was amazingly close and smooth ...</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Products for years and always been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Sure this can save money in not buying cleaners and disinfectants.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t Charge any more.</li>
            <li> Amazon has much better prices on it.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years and many blade razors and</li>
            <li> I accidentally broke it and wondered if there was yet a better razor</li>
            <li> (1) shaves slightly better  </li>
            <li> You will NOT be able to charge the shavor wihout the stand.</li>
            <li> (His skin is as smooth as a babys!)</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
            <li> After giving this razor more than the recommended time, I&#x27;ve given up on it.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to go over areas of my face to get as close a shave as many times</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews for this product on Amazon, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase it.</li>
            <li> One reviewer noted that the Norelco 1280X has a better shave than the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> the smoother parts of your face (like the cheeks and under your nose on the upper lip) is where the Braun does best.</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives you a more uniform shave on all parts of your face.</li>
            <li> I think that Braun&#x27;s design is much better in this aspect.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic better?</li>
            <li> However love the look and ergonomics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m optimistic that this will be able to prevent ruining the shaver&#x27;s battery by overcharging.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it was shaving as perfectly and deep without my ever using any pressure whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wash anything with it for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> - Convenient   - Works better if you shave every day  </li>
            <li> Well, I have been using Norelco for more years</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Better than my Braun, but it also 6 years newer.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this shaver would give me a great shave.</li>
            <li> They say the best results come after 3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> okay ...</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...............</li>
            <li> enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have many electric razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for many years and thought I&#x27;d treat myself to this shaving</li>
            <li> It was so much better than those that I had been using, that I became a lifetime user.  </li>
            <li> This 1280X/42 is my fourth over all those years, and it without a doubt the best.  </li>
            <li> this latest model has.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1280X is really most advance shaving system.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and its performance.</li>
            <li> I have a goatee (that i shave off periodically), and have evolved to a two step system - a Gillette Fusion Power razor (love Fusion blades) + a Schick Quattro Beard trimmer (both of which can be used in the shower).  </li>
            <li> As I said before, this electric is better than any i have ever tried before, but still isn&#x27;t as close as a manual.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once the battery in the SensoTouch gets cycled a dozen or more times</li>
            <li> but the shaving doesnt cut it for me.bought the panasonic arc 3 and got a better result.</li>
            <li> you would expect me to rave about the 1280cc/42 like most people do</li>
            <li> Molded case design would have been better for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> in all I returned to Braun and purchased the series 7 the 790CC which an outstanding shaver and to me shaves a touch even closer than the Philips.</li>
            <li> No doubt that these 2 shavers are the best on the market today and I will be using both of them alternately for a while and see which one I like better, I may just keep both of them.</li>
            <li> I love the way it shaves and the way it glides and maneuvers to the shape of my face.     </li>
            <li> My expectations were amped up by many favorable reviews on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Highly satisfied and would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for great customer</li>
            <li> maybe I can&#x27;t hope for much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for great customer</li>
            <li> maybe I can&#x27;t hope for much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because of the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to report that I will be continuing to use this product daily, as the ingrown hairs have virtually disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The shave was OK</li>
            <li> the product is better than what i imaging.</li>
            <li> I reviewed all the latest Norelco razors and came this the 1280x.  </li>
            <li> They could have done much better with the case too.</li>
            <li> Others have taken as many as 7 passes.</li>
            <li> Now, after 3 weeks of using it almost daily, I can say that it&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> but I would hard-pressed to see how any electric shaver could do better than this SensoTouch 3D series.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s kind of justified.</li>
            <li> But this one took maybe 3 strokes at most.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how better it&#x27;ll get as it more adjusts to my skin.</li>
            <li> There is nothing cheap about this shaver!</li>
            <li> Phoning Phillips again, I was told this time that the amount of energy used depended on shaving conditions and that the cutters required more force to move through shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> He had a 3- or 4-day beard going Christmas afternoon, and it took him about 3 minutes to shave it all off with the electric, and he was in LOVE.</li>
            <li> If I was going to be traveling for 30 days or more</li>
            <li> Just purchased the Norelco 1280X, all the comments that I have read say that it&#x27;s an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> I tried it this morning and it is much better  than the Panasonic dry/wet foil that I was using.  </li>
            <li> Better than the Brahn.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is probibly the most coomfortable shave I have ever had</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I bought this shaver</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I choose Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, with only two weeks of use my skin already accustomed to knife blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never use.  </li>
            <li> the M60 was able to shave closer than the norelco.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for myself and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> he love this Razor.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I chose this one from all the competition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water Proof (love this)&lt;br /&gt;Close</li>
            <li> The shave has become more close with each shave.  </li>
            <li> Better than a trac 2.</li>
            <li> The Braun 3 series is better.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have had many different Razors and this is the best!</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver was flawless and it&#x27;s so quiet that no one knew i was shaving.    </li>
            <li> Will update again after 2 more weeks...</li>
            <li> Arcitec Men&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be topped but this razor is night and day difference better.</li>
            <li> I love the &#x27;3d&#x27; head</li>
            <li> The box does include a more compact travel charger for those who do not wish to put a boat on their bathroom vanity.    </li>
            <li> If you are like me, you will love the razor but wonder that they were thinking when designing the cleaning / charging dock.</li>
            <li> It had been many years since I have used an electric razor.</li>
            <li> and it does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> When used with a pre-shave lotion it shaves more closely on the face and neck than the Braun.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun for several years and thought it was the best.</li>
            <li> What could be better:   </li>
            <li> - A better way to shave corners (it is rotary).  </li>
            <li> so I did not use electric razors for many year afters.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut me and I can shave more than once in a day if I had to (try that with a blade without tearing your skin up).  </li>
            <li> The charging on this unit could be better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than not having one, but it doesn&#x27;t measure up to what Norelco used to put on their shavers.  </li>
            <li> I love the setup, it works great and gives a very close shave, it is not blade</li>
            <li> Light weight, great design, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I look forward to many years of trouble-free shaving.</li>
            <li> As a regular Norelco user, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> The razor is extremely quiet and perfectly contoured to hold in every position.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor was a Easter gift after more then three weeks ( noreclo recommends at lest 3 weeks minimum to condition your skin)</li>
            <li> A lithium ion battery should be better than this.</li>
            <li> When it dies again (one more year at this rate), doubt I will replace with another unless the faulty battery issue is solved.</li>
            <li> There is virtually no afterburn on my face and neck, and I receive a better shave without \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; lotions.  </li>
            <li> This razor does everything it says and more.  </li>
            <li> this and no any other.&lt;br /&gt;i was used many razor (from panasonic, phillips, hitachi, etc), and blade razor with 2,3,4 and five blades.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> After reading features on the latest models of Norelco, It was a choice between 1290 and the 1280 as they have the charge mins remaining instead of bars, looks cooler.</li>
            <li> The JetClean+ is interesting.</li>
            <li> Gives a much better shave and is much better in terms of crafstmenship.  </li>
            <li> This is a state-of-the-art razor, the ultimate Philips 3D razor works perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to the shaving again this works and will remove most hairs</li>
            <li> should get more close shave for the money</li>
            <li> precision trimmer seems like it should have more power&lt;</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a bit more time to shave.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Buzz saw volume of my Panasonic, I love this feature.</li>
            <li> Most men like a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I could not agree more with the many reviews I saw on amazon.</li>
            <li> and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> Expect more.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is outstanding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my face for more than 60 years.  </li>
            <li> They were all ok but this time I bought him this one.  </li>
            <li> I watched the videos on the OEM website to make sure it would work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun for over 10 years and cannot believe how much better this razor is.</li>
            <li> It used to take me 8-10 minutes a day to shave with a medium beard, but now I am able to shave in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a very unique and svelte design which I love, it fits well in your hand and is lightweight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, you can clean the shaver under warm water and add mineral oil once in while...</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is nice.</li>
            <li> I am pain-free with a nice clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Long ago I became convinced triple-header IS the way to go, and for many years I felt that Norelco produces excellent razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great improvement from the older model.</li>
            <li> I liked the Jet Clean option.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable in the hand and the cleaning station is very easy.  </li>
            <li> Functions great if you keep up with shaving, though I&#x27;ve found that if you wait to shave for a couple of days, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of picking up hair that is laying down.  </li>
            <li> For me it is best to be able to wake up and use the shaver dry..</li>
            <li> Nobody&#x27;s perfect, so when I need to go over my neck quite a bit and then use a (dry) razor to finish up, it&#x27;s still a better experience that I had before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many people will say it&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s remorse, but after much research, I thought I was getting a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> , razors were also Norelco and they did a pretty good job</li>
            <li> I took a chance getting an electric for my boyfriend: I had NO other good ideas this year!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced great results with a new shaver head on my Panasonic, but even with a new shaver head the Panasonic does not compare to the Norelco&#x27;s close shave performance.  </li>
            <li> I can get it done and over with a nice shave quickly.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best one I&#x27;ve ever had when it comes to a fast &amp; very close shave.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts about 25 days and it is easy to clean under warm water.</li>
            <li> As it turns out the shaver is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Charges and clean very easily.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much,Preferential aggressive, the best New Year gift,He is the most perfect,I would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to clean it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has a nice grip and shape and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well this Norelco is very durable and the jet clean system is great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works flawlessly and keeps the razor clean and sanitary for the next shave.</li>
            <li> Charge of electricity can be very fast, with 60 minutes, very handsome.</li>
            <li> Very good at getting the low front portion of the neck.</li>
            <li> Very cool lighting</li>
            <li> you do not mind to spend that much money and want an excellent shaver buy it by any means, I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very well designed Phillips is very good that the overall feel and execution of the design feels good in hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pumped about this shaver -- it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and efficient electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned ( I&#x27;m over 60).  </li>
            <li> Smoothest most comfortable shave Iv&#x27;e had yet.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s best job as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> The difference between the earlier model and the 1280X is absolutely incredible.  </li>
            <li> It is perhaps not as close a shaver as the Braun it replaced, but it is more comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is more comfortable than a blade, but there&#x27;s still a bit of razor burn after using.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the first one and this is just as nice.</li>
            <li> If your have an Arcitec which has a body with a healthy motor you can just change the head and put a Sensotouch 3D head on it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I find that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li> so I keep that close, and more importantly, comfortable shave.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I keep that close, and more importantly, comfortable shave.)    </li>
            <li> so I cant attest to the wet shave, but I can tell you its the best and closest shave</li>
            <li> I really was hoping to give this razor a good review ...</li>
            <li> does  a good fast job</li>
            <li> Nice to have a fresh shave</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to clean, and very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and easy to clean!  </li>
            <li> Good way to inaugurate the new shaver :-)</li>
            <li> men know how good of a mood a fine shave can put us into, and this 1280 shaver certainly does it.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning machine is awesome, seeing the razor automatically go down to get clean in the solution by the press of a button is just as sophisticated as it sounds, the razor come on and off by itself to ensure the cleaning is done properly and gives you the best smelling and clean shave.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s kind of cool to watch the jet clean system work if you like gadgets and have the patience to wait on it to finish before unplugging it.</li>
            <li> is what I am most familiar with.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> Shaves a full month without a charge!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is the best razor I have owned</li>
            <li> 1280cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]is GREAT), just buy the new RQ12 heads</li>
            <li> It is an easy way to recharge the battery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather use alcohol to clean my blades since it&#x27;s got a lot of bacteria after so many uses.  </li>
            <li> when my family asked me what I wanted for Christmas, my choice was easy.  </li>
            <li> my wish list was  the top of the line Norelco and the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> I sure it will work just a well as the 1280/42 with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> It is really easy.</li>
            <li> But nevertheless, it&#x27;s still better than a regular razor, so I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> With a razor I can easily go 24 hours before I begin to even think about shaving again.  </li>
            <li> The 1280X easily lets me go 24 hours in between shaves.  </li>
            <li> and it shaves so cloose and so easy.</li>
            <li> Love this razor, best electric razor I have had, and I have had a few..............</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has a sleek styling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I wanted to move from nicks and cuts to easy and and no cuts,</li>
            <li> and my son says it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy is what seems to work for teens these days.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close and easy to use cleaner for after use</li>
            <li> ; I thought the auto cleaner was way over the top, but every morning the shaver is clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Would easily recommend a purchase if the price doesn&#x27;t scare you off.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> And he needs a strong one.</li>
            <li> cleaning unit is ok, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth &amp; quick to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> This means that I need to shave the same area many many times in all directions to get it good</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the shave, leaves a very smooth feel, no need to apply excessive pressure and just gliding it once or twice over the area does the trick.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, the shaving is fine and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway, its fine now.</li>
            <li> Shaver itself is fine.  </li>
            <li> I like to shave dry and this is perfect for that, close, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li> Did my research and on amazon it shows this is the best shaving electronic period,i went and bought it for black friday,no discount at all.first day i used it</li>
            <li> Smooth glide and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Still work fine</li>
            <li> Just oppening the heads and rinsing it works fine.</li>
            <li> The 1250x and 1290x will do just fine without the cleaning station, and can be cleaned just as well under the sink in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have always used the cleaning system to charge this razor and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> At 3X the price, and 5 years of research and innovation, you would think you might just get lucky and get a better shaver?  </li>
            <li> I picked this rating because I was able to use the quick start guide and could take my time about figuring out the option details.</li>
            <li> super job with this creation!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with the sideburn trimmer, though it pops out quickly.  </li>
            <li> but the jet clean solution has it there and its just a more convenient/elegant way to keep the unit clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, reliable close shave time after time.  </li>
            <li> - Easy to use / fits well in my hand   - Easy to clean   - Can be used</li>
            <li> The razor works great dry, but using it wet with shaving cream in the shower gives me the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> daddy like it very much!!</li>
            <li> My beard is fine and skin fair and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The Braun was out for me since I wanted something I could use in the shower / wet although they receive very good reviews.    </li>
            <li> The best razor I have ever owned, hands down, you can not beat this razor!  </li>
            <li> Sure you can rinse it out yourself and get it pretty clean, but the automatic cleaner really does an excellent job and leaves a very pleasing fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> , I use it about once every 3 days (I rinse it with very hot water after every shave) and that seems to keep it very clean and free of debris.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 huge benefits though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to use and clean and Jet</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet and smooth running--the quietest I&#x27;ve experienced on any electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I may be biased - because I am a HUGE Norelco fan.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;jet clean\\&quot; system that seems more economical and efficient than the Braun one (which uses cartridges); this one uses fluid&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Amazing fit and finish</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product by Phillips.</li>
            <li> I am ok with that seeing as I rarely used the charging cord with my Braun unless I was on vacation.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, it takes me about 8 minutes to shave my entire head, and face with this.  </li>
            <li> The claims of closeness are justified in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The Shaver however is worth every penny, and if you don&#x27;t want the top of the line, buy the Senso Touch 3d lowest cost model.</li>
            <li> , I have found that shaving with shaving cream or a shaving gel with this razor seems to result in the smoothest agitation free shave.  </li>
            <li> , I have found that shaving with shaving cream or a shaving gel with this razor seems to result in the smoothest agitation free shave.  </li>
            <li> and it worked great for several months.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is smooter dan a knive en so easy to clean.   </li>
            <li> great shaver , i use this daily</li>
            <li> After two years of light use it is worn out.</li>
            <li> The 1280 with the chrome on the side is cheap plastic.</li>

            <li> , I actually enjoy shaving now.   </li>
            <li> it did a great job of cleaning including the skin oil that inevitably gets into the shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> The solution is inexpensive and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After applying some pre-shave lotion, it glides on smoothly without any of the irritation that I had with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It is also really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Even with that being said, this model is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it had such great reviews.  </li>

            <li> It gives a smooth shave and the battery has 60 minutes of charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean &amp; maintain.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the stand does not fold or fit into the shaver carrying case.    </li>
            <li> was more of a gimmick in my opinion, as I rarely purchased the lotion kits to refill.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean via water (When traveling) or via the included cleaner.</li>
            <li> Like shaving with a smooth damp wash cloth.</li>

            <li> And it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The time I used it on vacation, it would barely fit in my shaving kit and when I got to my hotel the razor head assembly had fallen out of the body.  </li>
            <li> Improved greatly from 10 years ago--easy to clean--seems fragile but I will adjust.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> Still under the extended warranty from registering it on-line so another handle was sent free of charge.</li>
            <li> Fortunately be the time it broke  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic construction</li>
            <li> Why is this important?</li>

            <li> Perfect for everyday shaving, the cleaning stand has a electric motor in it to help lower the shaver into the cleaning position.</li>

            <li> I have had many different electric shaver and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, precise, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> His face is baby smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Important:  </li>
            <li> Shaving is comfortable and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but all I would say that it is an excellent shaver, very quiet, does the job very well</li>
            <li> The closeness and quality of the shave is wonderful, and I believe this product actually gives me a very close shave,</li>
            <li> So far so good with this razor.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It provides a very, very close shave, gives no irritations and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It was totally logical to me that the \\&quot;counter-rotating blades\\&quot; would be able to cut my beard much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I still have the first one and keep it in my car for when I&#x27;m really in a rush to get out of the house - after 15 years it still runs strong and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Cleaner works great to give the shaver the brand new shaver feeling after cleaning it with hot water after shaving.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean under hot water or just use the brush.</li>
            <li> Smooth and clean as well as easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I clean manually with water and use the jet cleaner when I recharge the razor, Really this is simply the best.</li>
            <li> Norelco has full instructions that are easily understood.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with water and the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li> I have used the Jet Clean several times and it does a really great job cleaning the unit.  </li>
            <li> It is so quiet compared to the older one and the shave is superb.  </li>
            <li> Very Pleased my wife spent the extra money to ensure I had a wonderful product.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for most of my adult life, I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their ability to give a close shave and their long lives.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system is nice, seems to really keep the shaver clean.    </li>
            <li> I could not figure out an indicator light on the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> , razor burn free shave, and a clean trim around my goatee  </li>
            <li> had this smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> In about couple of mins I was done with a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> the1280CC and after more than a month he is very pleased with its overall performance.</li>
            <li> Super easy.</li>
            <li> Under the presumption that this system will last many years, it should still be very worthwhile acquisition.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it gave a close smooth shave...with none of the friction of a usual electric shave.</li>
            <li> Close shave but comfortably, quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry to replace my 10 year old Philips shaver and honestly its only slightly better performance wise.</li>
            <li> After shaving each head opens up for easy cleaning, after each use, you just give a quick rinse before putting the in the jet clean station.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and the Jet Clean system makes cleaning the razor super easy.</li>
            <li> I always seem to end up going back to Braun as it has always worked best for me, despite having very sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> The Braun worked great and lasted me for a long time...</li>
            <li> In general, with the Braun series 5, I loved the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> Additionally with the Norelco you add solution from a bottle to the cleaning chamber which is significantly cheaper than using the prefilled cartridges from Braun.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in December of 2011.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it again as I fear that when the warranty is up (2yr continued from the original date of purchase) it will die again.  </li>
            <li> So if it performed this well on the first try, I don&#x27;t know how it can get better.</li>
            <li> I primarily use the trimmer for the pesky ear hair and while the trimmer on the 1280X does an OK job, the old trimmer was better.  </li>
            <li> and they paid for the return shipping of the original item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having used a Norelco shaver for years, I&#x27;m familiar with the benefits and limitations of an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The RQ12+ heads do not come close to the original and pull hairs.</li>
            <li> love it when use it first time :</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have regretted getting the &#x27;2d&#x27; shaving heads as opposed to this &#x27;3d&#x27; model.</li>
            <li> Yes it does cost more than most,but after the first time I used it I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> first electric shaver I have ever used more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> My first was a braun many years ago, which was not close</li>
            <li> Contacted Philips and they are sending me a replacement handle at no charge (original warranty of 2 years that Philips extended by an additional 6 months when registering the thing).  </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed on how easy it is to use specially when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a week and the hair is really hard.</li>
            <li> The razor is packaged with the charging stand, the razor, the cleaning unit, a full bottle of cleaner, a travel soft case and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the razor gives an exceptional shave.</li>
            <li> clean system is worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> My dad really loves it, it is easily to handle and shaves very clean.</li>
            <li> Well, the day after our son got his new shaver he tried it and he was absolutely thrilled that it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> And now, it doesn&#x27;t always startup to clean when you out it in the cradle...</li>
            <li> But the razor is supposed to turn on to clean the heads...</li>
            <li> 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> However the shave itself is clean and close</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t used the Jet Clean system as of yet</li>
            <li> I recommend the 1280X and Jet Clean</li>
            <li> I still like the razor and the Jet Clean system a lot and would recommend it to friends and family.  </li>
            <li> I have used it with and without the jet clean system each for four months</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors over the years and this is by far the best shave and cleaner</li>
            <li> The cleaning system on the Norelco is okay, but 20th century compared to the Panasonic (kind of like a semi-automatic sink compared to an automatic dishwasher).  </li>
            <li> and if you do get the Jet Clean System you won&#x27;t know where to put it.</li>
            <li> Just remember NO Jet Clean System, all of us with condo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The charge lasts almost 3 weeks without  recharging and the Jet clean is a neat way to clean it, I use this when its time a charge.</li>
            <li> And the price is also good!Especially the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li> My thinking on getting the cleaning system was that I wanted some mechanism to clean out the skin oil in addition to the shavings.  </li>
            <li> Opperates as advertised and I get a confortable clean shave.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco 1280X/42 Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000), is just what I needed to get the clean, close shave I</li>
            <li> I used to be that in order to clean your razor, you had to:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> that I \\&quot;needed\\&quot; a unit with the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> The clean cycle takes quite some time.  </li>
            <li> and you can just rinse it clean a plus or use the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric razors over the years, especially Norelco, this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> - A limit on charging the razor from the cleaner (there should be an option to clean / charge or just clean).  </li>
            <li> The unit should have a clean and clean/charge option.  </li>
            <li> The Jet Clean unit that comes with this shaver is also made well.  </li>
            <li> clean shave just as comfortable and quick.  </li>
            <li> Just shave and clean in your Jetclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the jet clean feature</li>
            <li> /&gt;To clean it using the automatic cleaning device, the razor is placed into a holder.</li>
            <li> This model has a change blades and a clean indicator.</li>
            <li> Now my unit came with the Jet clean</li>
            <li> the Jet clean is an added luxury not needed</li>
            <li> Close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 8500 series 360 , before this one, and it had a self clean feature also.  </li>
            <li> I’m required to have a clean shave for my job</li>
            <li> A clean shave every time put to use.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system malfunctioned after about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> Attempts to clean the sensor have inconsistent results.</li>
            <li> And eventually the Jet Clean station will cease working altogether, just as my has two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Note that my Jet Clean station has been replaced 2 times within the warranty period.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li> It does, however, perform well and leaves the shaver clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> the description at Amazon does not say, but this package *does come* with a charging stand, besides the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> I have not used the clean and charge dock yet</li>
            <li> I even let the razor go for a couple months without manually hitting the clean button and it never auto-cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with different electric razors each year and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Works decently either way and the razor is nice and quick.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my head and got it as a replacement for my very ancient Cool Skin that I had for more than 5 years and whose battery was no longer charging and the razors had become quite blunt.</li>
            <li> An adaptor for use oversea would have been included given the price of this shaver, making use more quick than the need to find first an avalaible one..    </li>
            <li> This is a much improved shaver over the Norelco Arcitec which did a great job but had a less than effective pop-up sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li> I tried other shavers but they did not work well on me as I have curly afro hair, and most products just don&#x27;t do a good job.    </li>
            <li> Other than that I am very happy with the shaves -- much closer that my 10</li>
            <li> But it if the price is right!</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch 3d is an excellent shaver, but I would prefer to have a hard traveling case for maximum protection of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Perfect shave that followed completed my acquisition&#x27;s satisfaction  Highly recommended to electric shavers and whoever considers changing brand or switch from wet- to electric shaving.</li>
            <li> I thought moving from from 2D to 3D would be amazing, but I&#x27;ve gotten so used to shaving with the old 2D model that I think I preferred that one.  </li>
            <li> I use the wet option with any shaving cream and it works great.</li>
            <li> It is equally great for wet shaves as it is for drive.</li>
            <li> I had a lesser norelco model, which was good, would some irritation every now and then,  but this one blows it away no comparision.</li>
            <li> My shave is much closer than I had with the Braun and as a result I&#x27;m able to shave faster.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and non-irritating, but even after a full cleaning cycle, the removed hair pieces fall out of the razor heads while I shave.  </li>
            <li> More gentle than a razor blade  </li>
            <li> Shaver itself is quiet and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> the concept is cool....</li>
            <li> If a razor has an option for a cleaner get it even the cheap one&#x27;s are worth it for your razor and your face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a space hogger and takes its sweet time;</li>
            <li> So I have been using them alternately now to keep the batteries in good shape on both.</li>
            <li> You would think that I might be able to get a discount on buy-2, e.g., after not shaving for two days, it might take me 1.8 x as much time to shave.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet, smooth shave and an overall excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I assumed that a name brand product such as this would be a good value.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good enough.  </li>
            <li> the battery would return to the 60 minute full charge level.</li>
            <li> Edition\\&quot;, $169.99 after Costco&#x27;s current $30 off coupon - a good deal, I thought).  </li>
            <li> Purchased this razor to replace a Norelco \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; model that died after about 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> and my wife had to experiment with it just because it looked so cool.  </li>
            <li> so as I could use just one full trim cut</li>
            <li> It will work in the Jet Cleaner but will not turn on even after a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I love it ,it works very well.</li>
            <li> The Philips SensoTouch 3D Shaver does give a surprisingly good and close shave, and it is quiet.</li>
            <li> Will not keep a full charge</li>
            <li> A whole lot better than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This razor has a number of cool features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li> I like how the shaver is easy to hold while shaving and how it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean with hot water.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great and never fails, easy to clean plus the jet system is thorough and needs no additional operations other than to turn it on and select the cleaning program.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is get the one with No Jet Clean System, save some money, hot water cleans it just fine</li>
            <li> The trimmer sticks out farther making it easy to use without first removing the shaving head.  </li>
            <li> it tends to miss some of the longer hairs, but other than that it does a super great job.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to more clean shaves with my new shaver.</li>
            <li> However cleaning under running hot water as suggested works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It was quiet, shaved very close and quick on the rest of my face, and the Jet Cleaner worked great.</li>
            <li> From my older Norelco, I did love the shave itself and</li>
            <li> ; how lucky I was to break it.  </li>
            <li> close shave, quick (</li>
            <li> got super irritated  leading to tons of bumps under my neck.i</li>
            <li> I really love how the heads come apart including the entire top assembly.  </li>
            <li> It sure beats the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; main brands in quality of shave and quality of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> It makes it quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, this quietness was only a welcome change as it was quick and very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> * Charges quickly  *</li>
            <li> charges up quickly, if needed, but if you leave it on it will charge and (to me) seems to hold the charge better/</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a bit of extra money to get the good and fun stuff.  </li>
            <li> Well it definitely did, this razor is such a great piece of ingenuity!  </li>
            <li> Most products, especially electronics, come out with a better model after you purchase one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy to clean, and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> if I have 3 or 4 day growth, it still cuts it as close as a baby&#x27;s butt just as quick as my day to day shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Charging is quick too.</li>
            <li> This shaver is MUCH more comfortable on the neck and Adam&#x27;s apple area than the Panasonic--which still nicks me frequently in this area.</li>
            <li> With a wet shave and shave gel, its a good, smooth shave but requires work in the moustache area.....</li>
            <li> Close fast shaves,no irritation,quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I notice any problems with it as it gets older and more use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a carrying case and cleaning kit, but you have to replace the special fluid that the razor uses to clean and lubricate the blades with and that can add up over time.</li>
            <li> The shaver sound is very much quieter.  </li>
            <li> Its gets my head pretty smooth no problems there.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say I have no regrets shelling out the cash for this.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy using it with shaving creme and hot water.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as smooth as my gillette fusion razor, but it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this from Amazon in Frustration Free Packaging and it arrived used --</li>
            <li> My husband likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have had about 4 other Philps razors, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> ~I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My partner says it is good use and the battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> However, the adage “You get what you pay for” comes true in a very positive way.</li>
            <li> Cosntruction quality is nice and solid and it comes with a a stand and the jet clean system, which works well.  </li>
            <li> Ok this product works pretty well but for the price I had very high expectations of this unit.  </li>
            <li> The new RQ12 forms to your face much better.  </li>
            <li> I had an 1180 Norelco Shaver and my new 1280 is miles and miles better.  </li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over previous models that Philips Norelco has brought to the market.  </li>
            <li> I set the quick charger up first (not Jet Clean)</li>
            <li> At this point I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about 4 days and had a pretty good amount of hair on my face, not just your short 5:00 clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I am excited to reportm, I have experienced little to none skin irritation!</li>
            <li> I figured they must have improved it significantly, but never thought it would be that evident.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you notice is the price, but wait!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Just opened the box and pretty excited about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have used my new Norelco for just a few days now, and I have to say it is the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Other problem areas: right under the nose, it just doesn&#x27;t reach those hairs very easily; the sideburn area seems to grow in more quickly.    </li>
            <li> I use it only as a dry shaver and the results are the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The razor is very easy to clean by itself so those who don&#x27;t want to pay extra for the cleaning station, don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s solely for luxury.  </li>
            <li> Hi,  the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black\\&quot; is the first electric shaver y have ever used and it´s</li>
            <li> So I am happy with my philips ( I bought my first philips shaver in 1955 and never have used a other brand.</li>
            <li> The carrying case holds the razor nicely and there is a &#x27;soft&#x27; lock feature that keeps the razor from turning on in the suit case, so if you need less than an hour&#x27;s shaving time on your trip then you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> After the shaving, my dad can clean it by water, it&#x27;s really so convenient!</li>
            <li> but since it is a nice, new streamlined design, well built excellent unit I will keep it for the next few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchase this because I have and old Philips Norelco that I was happy, but with this one having the 3D works great, less time of shaving since it only need a couple of passes and you are done</li>
            <li> But what I really love is how it will glide around a goatee (or beard or mustache) and get all the little hairs without pulling and catching on the longer hairs nearby.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system is a fantastic add on..keeps your shaver just like brand new.</li>
            <li> The shave is comfortable, takes minutes, and is very close....</li>
            <li> The razor is quiet, smooth, contours my face well and even gives me a good shave on my neck, which was always a place I would have to use an old fashion razor to get rid of the stubble before.</li>
            <li> - shaves very well leaves smooth skin   </li>
            <li> This razor is so smooth going over your skin, shaving cream really isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its really fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> When off you have no idea there is so much detail available when turned on.</li>
            <li> - Very close and smooth shave  -</li>
            <li> - i use it with shaving cream and it is smooth and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I did choose the version with the Jet Clean system mainly to do \\&quot;a maintenance clean\\&quot; about every 3 weeks or so as I plan to rinse and manually clean the majority of the time.</li>
            <li> Philips unit is FAR FAR superior to the Braun product - for me...</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning system since my old Norelco got a \\&quot;funky\\&quot; smell to it after awhile</li>
            <li> And definteley worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this for yourself, spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but it the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and it&#x27;s quiet</li>
            <li> pricey, but worth it if you have the bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I love it and look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> the Norelco is far better.  </li>
            <li> but I plan on using it probably after 3-4 uses or so just to get my money&#x27;s worth of the solution.</li>
            <li> Is it really worth the $200 (after the rebate)?</li>
            <li> I would like to shave every day, but some days I don&#x27;t manage, and so I end up having two days worth of hair to shave.  </li>
            <li> I can, however, tell that the old shavers from Philips were much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric shavers: my problem has never been irritation, but rather the fact that they rarely give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> BUT DEFINITELY WORTH</li>
            <li> You can make your own fluid from alcohol and oil but that voids the warranty.</li>
            <li> : I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a top of the line (but old) Braun.</li>
            <li> And realize that not all of the service techs at Norelcto will provide useful answers.</li>
            <li> It is on the pricey side, but for me worth it.</li>
            <li> But the most important thing to me is that this in an incredibly quiet shaver!  </li>
            <li> Potentially useful, if not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> so far, more info below...    </li>
            <li> The shave quality is good, which I expected from the Norelco brand and this price point.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricy, but the quality and results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my old Braun better</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re reading this review, you want to know if the razor is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was using a 30 year old norelco for many years.</li>
            <li> It shaves better than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Takes forever to shave,  my old Schick and Remington foil headed shaver was much more efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I haver really enjoyed using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the course of several years and this seems to be the best for my beard type, which would be considered thick.</li>
            <li> Still not as good as a standard razor but very close.</li>
            <li> Bought this nice electric razor for my boyfriend for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li> I wanted the best since I know I will be using it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> but after I bought the 1280, I think it&#x27;s not that useful of a feature to be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Travelling pouch is useful.</li>
            <li> Well worth this price.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, enjoyable, elegantly slides on the face following the natural contours.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for almost 20 years and really liked them until recently.  </li>
            <li> GREATWELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> going from a Braun style razor to a Norelco takes some getting used to but in the end it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaving surface rotates nicely to match your facial curves.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised at how many large corporations do not have user friendly  user interfaces on their websites.  </li>
            <li> razor gives a good dry shave and pretty good wet shave.</li>
            <li> So I returned it and went for the normal packaging (Blister pack in a box) which arrived nice and new with no hair.    </li>
            <li> In 60 years of shaving from a straight razor, barber shaves, Remington, Grundig, Shick, Braum, &amp; other Norelco shavers; without a doubt this 3D 880X Shaver is BY FAR the GREATEST Men&#x27;s Shaver I have ever had!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!oke the other one,</li>
            <li> Easily cuts hairs even when you haven&#x27;t shaved in longer than normal.</li>
            <li> Usually I favored the razor due to the very close shave it gave.</li>
            <li> Also, the product had a problem when it first arrived, Amazon was quick to send me another one overnight at no charge to me,</li>
            <li> I usually do not shave over the weekend and my previous electric razors (including Norelco 8240) would not give me a good shave with more than a days worth of stubble</li>
            <li> This shaver is even better than my last one, probably because the Jet Clean process prevents the blades from corroding/dulling from having the water air-dry and leave mineral deposits every day.  </li>
            <li> but I was lucky to buy it when there was a $200 off coupon so it would be wise to wait till Black Friday to pick this up if your in the market for a razor.</li>
            <li> (took like 10 minutes); really just to get familiar with the item.</li>
            <li> Extremely close shave that is as good as a Gillette razor blade.  </li>
            <li> The other sensotouch models are good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for good electric razor, especially if you have curly and/or afro hair.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> The curves on the Norelco get right in there with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I had to use an electric shaver when I broke my right arm.</li>
            <li> For right now, after 6-months of use, it&#x27;s working as well as the day I bought it</li>
            <li> Design, grip, gentle sound are the first postive impressions.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system is very well thought out and from what I&#x27;ve seen gives the heads a thorough washing on even the econo mode.</li>
            <li> clean sideburns, a very close</li>
            <li> really need the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> Having exclusively used Norelco (and 1 Remington) shavers over the past 30 years, I can say that this is by far the best shaver I have used yet.  </li>
            <li> Has a durable feel to it, decent weight where it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> This razor not only gives me a close shave, but also is very easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Also the cleaning fluid that comes with the jetclean has a very strong offensive [to some] smell and it will permeate everywhere.</li>
            <li> This makes the head very large and it does not follow the contours of my face and neck well.  </li>
            <li> but this magnificent razor lets you shave either dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I feel it works best dry on my face wet for my neck</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a very well used norelco electric shaver, the very first one  that dispensed shave lotion and almost got the new model of that style, but glad I looked on the Norelco website and read about new technology and the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it as a dry razor, but it works great as a wet razor too!</li>
            <li> The jet clean works pretty quickly, seems like it has a lot of moving parts though and may brake easily though (relative to the Braun cleaning system).         </li>
            <li> no questions asked basically, and the new one they provided seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> I usually don’t write reviews, but I wanted to take the time to share my great experiences.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver purchased and it was worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> Long ago, I found that Norelco razors were best for me, and I never looked at any other.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly does a much better job than my old Remington.</li>
            <li> This one need some more improvement as far as trimmer is concerned for sharp and more clean finishing.</li>
            <li> Customer support reported the new head wouldn&#x27;t fit the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> If you clean the razor frequently you can do the quick \\&quot;eco\\&quot; setting, or if you return from a trip and haven&#x27;t had a chance for a thorough cleaning, use the intensive setting.</li>
            <li> - The trimmer is not as strong as old school razors</li>
            <li> Easy to clean both daily and in the automatic cleaner.</li>
            <li> Quiet  - Easy to clean and maintain  - Shaves with foam or gel</li>
            <li> The shave is so incredibly comfortable, so incredibly smooth yet so close and left 0 irritation on me.</li>
            <li> If you use blades, my recommendation is to use at least a 3 blade razor with Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream - it is, by far, the best shaving cream I have used with a blade (I have not used a safety razor and soap).  </li>
            <li> Philips 1280 X / 42 SensoTouch force 3 d electric razor with jet cleaning system, black good razor</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week and had a good about half centimeter stubble on me.</li>
            <li> I know for me this was an easy buy but for budget conscious or close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice device that feels solid and very substantial in your hand.  </li>
            <li> he base for recharging and cleaning, but other than that, it&#x27;s great to see him get a good shave on his own again!</li>
            <li> The digital display is very classy and neat and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> From the very first time, I&#x27;ve had nothing less than a great shave with no uneven spots or pinching/irritation.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a really clean shave.</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful design, you can use during bath and the battery last long hours!</li>
            <li> I have used it almost daily since then and it did pretty good even on a day old shadow.</li>
            <li> Other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast charging, it says an hour for charging but it felt shorter than that.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Very, very sleek looking machine.</li>
            <li> Finally...&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fast shave.</li>
            <li> i very much~~</li>
            <li> Cleaning kit: As I mentioned above, I do use the cleaning kit with mine because it came with one when I purchased it, however, I really don&#x27;t think you need it as simply running the blades under warm water removes most of the hair particles.</li>
            <li> The digital &#x27;time left&#x27; viewer is nice, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s necessary for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Stars are fine but they don&#x27;t give a clear picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,i enjoy it very much,the charging time is short and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> Without the ability to replace the battery or use it plugged in, it seems it would be better to buy a new one rather than buy a new head.</li>
            <li> The original heads, RQ12, are no longer manufactured, and the new RQ12+ have been reviewed as below par here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> second star is for how quickly customer support, via chat, helped me and how easy it was to get them to send a replacement product.</li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;ve read that can damage the blades so mainly running warm water over the blades after moderate use</li>
            <li> Using it wet is very easy and useful.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to at first, I started to have a really good shave after a week.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco Spectra, which is about 10 years old, is still going strong on its original heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Jet Stream clean the shaver like new each time.</li>
            <li> I have a new appreciation for the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and have to shave every morning and this does the job amazing.</li>
            <li> Just the first time ... and not since then!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how smooth and close the shave was.</li>
            <li> (I washed it with hot water every day and let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then why I need this stand in the first place?</li>
            <li> I sent it back to Philips for a refund, but they magically \\&quot;lost it\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Today I tried my first attempt at trying to address this problem --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in not having to prematurely replace the shaver&#x27;s battery because I&#x27;m not always paying close attention when I charge it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just programmed the countdown mode (CTD) for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the top of the line Braun shavers for the last six or seven years.</li>
            <li> As the last two times, this one shaves even better and closer.</li>
            <li> I think that they&#x27;re pretty good overall, but generally break after 4-6 years of use.</li>
            <li> Almost look forward to shaving (did I really type that!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure individual results vary depending on circumstances of the person</li>
            <li> sales is very attetion.!</li>
            <li> I thought the three settings it has was overkill at first</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was bit nervous at first with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I Bought my first Norelco (Phillips) shaver in Germany in 1960.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny and...</li>
            <li> :  I bought the Braun Series 7 790cc and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> still have this Braun 790CC which works well but always has been pretty noisy</li>
            <li> They equal in closeness of shave and the Philips appears to be made from better material.</li>
            <li> But first things first.  </li>
            <li> At $69, there are plenty of old style shavers available.  </li>
            <li> Once should definitely try this one for sure.</li>
            <li> Though not perfect in all aspect but the best as of today.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric chaver and it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> thing I saw people asking about was the chrome piece of plastic making a squeaking or clicking noise when they first got the razor.  </li>
            <li> Had not even used it much at all!  </li>
            <li> With the Braun, I always had to trim the hair first, otherwise the shave will be bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also travel extensively with my company, and the charge the razor holds is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> this is the first time i purchase on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal to me either way, but if it were, this would have put Panasonic over the top.</li>
            <li> All the 3d Philips are the same so to save even more money you can get the 1250.</li>
            <li> I have a rolly-polly face that can challenge the shaver to get the hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews here on Amazon and on the Internet; it seems that a majority of expert and regular electric shaver users think that the Braun Series 7 gives the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different electrics over the years including many different Norelcos, Braun CC-790 and some Remingtons and this</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I kept.</li>
            <li> First some background on me:  </li>
            <li> With the old Norelco shaver, 24 hours was the maximum that I could comfortably go in between shavings.  </li>
            <li> The 1280X has a digital read-out on the body of the shaver telling you how many minutes of charge are remaining on the shaver&#x27;s rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li> I will update based on how those electrics work out for me once the ingrowns clear.ving with the double edge is more for the experience and not as convenient at 4AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That, along with the cleaning fluid that you have to replace every 2 weeks, makes this razor even more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Norelco is unfortunately the best rotary razor out there.</li>
            <li> Charge time seems to last many Shaves.  </li>
            <li> scrinping on hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time I used it I decided it was.</li>
            <li> I almost bought another Panasonic since I was completely satisfied with the last 6 years of its performance, but I instead opted to try the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> There are some items that could have been designed better for the overall experience, but they do not influence the shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to the SensoTouch 3D</li>
            <li> Works very well - easy to clean - definitely a daily time saver for me.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works great and you get a dry razor when the cleaning/drying cycle is complete, unlike older Norelco models with the automatic cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> you need a razor that doesn&#x27;t need much fuss, this razor will probably be worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is said that it would do.</li>
            <li> I would say that this product does cut your beard pretty well</li>
            <li> First, I have used this shaver about 4 weeks with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is, however, my first water-proof shaver.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed this about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I still have my first one and still use it after 15 years.</li>
            <li> What I discovered is, unless I filled it nearly to the top, it was really only cleaning 2 of the 3 heads.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic!.</li>
            <li> I am just blown away at how much easier this has made my life and completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I plugged it out and it was really hot.</li>
            <li> So its about few weeks since I bought this model and a good time to write a review.</li>
            <li> that with a little more attention to detail Philips could have easily addressed.      </li>
            <li> Replacement head is different than original in that blades are not anchored to the head; they just come off when you brush shaver out or clean under faucet.  </li>
            <li> The 3 head pod is easily replaced by simply gripping the pod firmly and pulling it from its support.</li>
            <li> I have not tried that since the dry shaving that I do gives me such great results.  </li>
            <li> An added plus over the Arcitec is that the sideburn trimmer actually works quite well and is very useful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended that you do this after every shave, but who wants to do that every morning, right before work (not me, anyway)?  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and was very happy at first until the blades went dull after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li> The side burn trimmer is not too great and is very small as compared to my Braun razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since all my electric razor experience has been with Norelco, I can&#x27;t honestly compare this model with any other brand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of beard other people have</li>
            <li> I was using and old model of norelco, and this new technology really like it, better cut quality, easier cleaning, etc.</li>
            <li> decided to pay a bit more and get the jet clean system because its another added convenience for me and one less thing I have to worry about.  </li>
            <li> and I find that with the use of the jet clean system there is a slight bit more shave efficiency/close shaving feel.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to buy them from a physical store where you&#x27;ll easily pay $5-$10 more for the same replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers I have owned will not get the long hairs, and this 3d gets them on the first pass.   </li>
            <li> As a bonus, the $30 coupon available when I ordered covered a Xbox 360 game I wanted, so all is good...</li>
            <li> Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I think keeping the blades properly cleaned and lubricated is crucial to good shaving performance.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m light on the stars because I think this razor has a major problem.</li>
            <li> I can report that I am positively delighted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have since purchased a Braun 790cc4 (the new one just released) and not only is the shave better - but the shaver feels more solid.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this was my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone who might need an electronic shaver!It moves pretty smothly and also in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> Very close shaving on the first try.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty I guess, but it&#x27;s very impractical.  </li>
            <li> The old style heads (when you could find them) were going for almost as much as the razor sold for originally.</li>
            <li> True, you cannot charge directly from the chord.</li>
            <li> The cleaning thing is cool to watch in action as it turns the razor on and off as it dunks the unit in the cleaning</li>
            <li> But as interesting note I would like to add that after I purchased a new cutting head for my 11 years old Braun 7570 (since the shaver still keeps the charge very well and works perfectly)</li>
            <li> You can of course not purchase the system and clean the shaver under the faucet, but this procedure does waste more water.</li>
            <li> The cleaning attachment/stand is nice and makes it easier to charge although at least on mine, the \\&quot;automatic\\&quot; clean setting does not appear to work.</li>
            <li> It performs better on a decent stubble though and its kinda obvious.</li>
            <li> Having been a regular user of Philips Norelco Speed 8240 for the past, oh, maybe 4 years, I was very happy to order this new and improved shaver from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I believe it provides a much better and faster shave than the high end</li>
            <li> the best electric I have ever used, and (b) routinely gives me as close a shave as my razor without the mess and in considerably less time.  </li>
            <li> Very nice shave, not much different than the other Norelco razors I&#x27;ve had,</li>
            <li> If you get a new razor every year the Norelco may be worth adding to your arsenal though.</li>
            <li> It is nice, and brand new, It is exactly the same as what i saw in stores, but nearly $100 cheaper than that.</li>
            <li> No burn no scraping feeling, just a smooth as ice feel on skin &amp; smae as moving the shaver on my face - charging &amp; stowage is also 200% better then in past</li>
            <li> Is it really worth that much - probably not, but it is a nice shaver and I am sure it will last me another 8 years at least.</li>
            <li> The battery will last a month, easy.</li>
            <li> It is extraordinary how far electric shavers have come.</li>
            <li> the cover for the head breaks easily, they only warranty the motor ,</li>
            <li> It is easy and only goes in one way.</li>
            <li> again a very clever design from Phillips</li>
            <li> Except for a poor shave on my neck, it was great for the first eight or nine months.</li>
            <li> It certainly has all the bells and whistles anyone could ever want.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a new razor and new Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> since I do my current routine in the shower, this is a viable option if I need to shave on a non-shower day or for a touchup), moves with your face contour as well or better than any shaver before, quiet, charges quickly, ergonomically friendly, less razor irritation than any electric I have ever had (but not as little as a manual), sleek and beautiful.    </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t waste hundreds on buying everyone&#x27;s top of the line razor, but are willing to spend enough for one of the top razors get the Braun.</li>
            <li> It also give a very comfortable wet shave with shaving creme....</li>
            <li> If it were available, it cost almost as much as the complete razor did when new.</li>
            <li> Early days yet, but jet clean system works well and shaver seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> Great buy from Amazon since a less advance model cost twice as much thanks to the Chinese government&#x27;s &amp;#34;TAX&amp;#34; policy.</li>
            <li> The razor cuts ok, maybe a tiny bit better than my previous Norelco 8894XL.  </li>
            <li> The older model was actually a pretty lausy shaver.  </li>
            <li> My older daugther was in AH!</li>
            <li> The digital screen is nice and tells you exactly how much time you have left before a recharge is required and has been fairly accurately until just recently.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about not needing the Jet Clean System (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet -- washing the heads with hot water seems quite adequate).  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would pay the 100.00 more for the Jet Clean system.  </li>
            <li> The blades clean in hot water, and I only use the cleaning system weekly.  </li>
            <li> So -- it is but another twenty seconds to run hot water over the heads (they life up and tilt open like petals on a flower) to clean them and then set the razor on the stand to manually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jet Clean System is interesting to watch, but I&#x27;ve not had this long enough to really evaluate effectiveness.</li>
            <li> From the relatively quiet noise to the fact that hairs were not being spit out all over my counter, were already a huge improvement over the Series 7.  </li>
            <li> This thing is extremely quiet and gives a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this huge triangular thing that is not form-fitting and way too big.  </li>
            <li> I bought it during Christmas week with low price,I really like it, make you comfortable</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t know if it helps or not.  </li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m dressed and on my way to work, I really don&#x27;t have the time to wait for that.</li>
            <li> with the 1280cc I fear nothing and actually enjoy shaving DAILY....  </li>
            <li> pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn</li>
            <li> Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn trimmer.    </li>
            <li> how fast you could get things done with the triple head--using the Braun takes much longer for me and never was quite as close of a shave...</li>
            <li> This shaves noticeably closer and with more comfort than I expected.</li>
            <li> After much researching I let my husband choose which shaver he would like.</li>
            <li> The shaver is doing great on my cheeks, but is still irritating my neck.    </li>
            <li> To begin with it&#x27;s much quieter than the Braun 7.</li>
            <li> Both the razor itself and the cleaning system are much quieter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even grown a beard to avoid the whole shaving</li>
            <li> My ski thanks you</li>
            <li> The razor itself is easier to hold and use, and is much lighter and quieter than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the display that indicates the number of shaving minutes remaining.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you travel much at all, you won&#x27;t like this razor.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the self cleaning</li>
            <li> I really, really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> makes a nice shave, very close, even with the most difficult hairs.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> The shave is close and the trimmer really works.  </li>
            <li> The motor is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> question that the Philips is quieter, but as it appears I really did not need it.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Jim</li>
            <li> Works even better as a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close a shave as you&#x27;d get with a proper 4-blade razor, but it&#x27;s amazingly smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> looks of this thing are very futuristic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> BUT THIS ONE REALLY DID THE TRICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the price of the shaver was very competitive.  </li>
            <li> It provided a very close shave and it did not irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Power Fusion razors but with the price of blades being so much now I decided to switch.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend this much on an electric razor</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there would be this much difference</li>
            <li> It looks really handsome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am amazed how fast and close it was.</li>
            <li> and so you really don&#x27;t need a jetclean unit.</li>
            <li> The Braun 790 and this razor both give me a very close shave</li>
            <li> but this one is much faster.  </li>
            <li> When I needed a really close shave, I would use my multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a much improved design to me.    </li>
            <li> the activity price is very</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> very much!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets around his jaw and on his neck really well</li>
            <li> I dont really think you need the cleaning solution very often at all if you just rinse out the blades after each use.</li>
            <li> It charges really fast as well.</li>
            <li> This razor is &amp;#34;badass&amp;#34;, my guy loves this thing so much.</li>
            <li> much cheaper at around $75.  </li>
            <li> (fast recharge)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much quieter than any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> every week or so, I will, after doing the daily cleaning, which takes about 30 seconds, place the razor in the cleaning device, after having filled that with the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> razor requires a replacement head once a year, so get ready to spend some money just to maintain.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference...</li>
            <li> things I really like with this that I&#x27;ve never had before...</li>
            <li> the cleaning system seems to work really well</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so much easier getting around my face and feeling</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Clean up was fairly easy, only issue is one of the heads doesn&#x27;t always stay open when i&#x27;m brushing out the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave, its fast without any irritation.</li>
            <li> the charge holds up very well</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I receive VERY close shaves with a blade and Kiehl&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It was also very noisy.  </li>
            <li> have shaved my face well and as close as a blade (but not as fast as a blade).    </li>
            <li> the shave is very close to a blade.  </li>
            <li> I also reviewed the Panasonic, which I was very close in trying / buying because I did like the Remington foil shaver (3D is rotary).  </li>
            <li> and I really like that too.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cleanser tray.</li>
            <li> The triple head swivels &amp; adjusts to every contour of your face and gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can go wet/dry, and wet shaving gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even closer than a safety blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like the shaver with the wet/dry ability</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing when pressing the on/off button and absolutely nothing when placing it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> This looked like it would work very well</li>
            <li> It cuts just as smoothly as it does the second day even after a week of growth!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a high annual cost!</li>
            <li> After a more thorough wet shave, I can still feel some stubble on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and fast.</li>
            <li> It is also a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It has a nifty self cleaner thing that seems to not be really doing anything.  </li>
            <li> The 1280X/42 Senso Touch worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> very close shave as well as</li>
            <li> It glided effortlessly over my face actually better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Even though you have a very dense beard this 1280XCC will give you a baby-face.</li>
            <li> It looks like I used a straight razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons- Very expensive&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a 5-6 minute shave time (avg 7-8 with the Panasonic) it really is quicker to shave by almost 25%.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, I feel I need to shave again if I go out with the Norelco (I didn&#x27;t feel this need as much with the Panasonic).</li>
            <li> It cleans itself, I think that he wants the blades to cut closer.  </li>
            <li> no matter how gentle I use it</li>
            <li> The self-adjusting heads really do flex around every curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How much do you want to bet that they will try to blame me.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I really felt the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t much stubble to plug it up.  </li>
            <li> The charging stand is important if you take the shaver on a trip and do not want to carry the bulky jet system (as the shaver can only be charged either in the jet system, or in the stand).</li>
            <li> Shaves very close ,does not pull ,very quite.</li>
            <li> Its fast, and cuts very close.  </li>
            <li> My third shave was wet (shaving gel), and I must say, that the shave was just as good as the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li> When I need to replace the head, I will go back to Panasonic and the nice and simple cartridge system they use.</li>
            <li> There is only one item I would like to see changed with this product;    You should be able to charge the shaver with a plug in directly.</li>
            <li> Yet, the fact that it also lubricates the shaving heads and gives it a fresh feel the next use, makes the cleaning stand worth while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shaver head which contains the 3 rotary blade assemblies \\&quot;floats\\&quot; which allows the individual shaver heads to adjust to the contour of my face and clearly is part of the reason I get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the trimmer on the old 7825XL better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> (kind of messy).  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product for an everyday task that needs to get done (in my world it does).</li>
            <li> so getting right up under your nose takes a little more effort.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very, very close -- much more than any previous Norelco that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> the shave is not as close as my old shaver!!!  </li>
            <li> Secondly, and most importantly to me, the reservoir that holds the shavings really didn&#x27;t hold any shavings due to the design.  </li>
            <li> Now, instead of it charging up to full and showing 60 minutes available, it sometimes shows, 64 minutes, 68 minutes, and sometimes it shows less, like 55 minutes.</li>
            <li> That was the problem I had when I got my first one, but Amazon swapped it for a new one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Jet Clean System which works extremely well in keeping the shaver blades clean and at peak efficiency.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, other than the short life span.</li>
            <li> Much better than the other type of razors too very close shave.</li>
            <li> leaves the razor clean and ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> I have used both Norelco and Braun shavers in the past, and have liked certain aspects of both.  </li>
            <li> it was engineered much better than alot of other bathroom items.</li>
            <li> Before, I was not able to use my electric razor more than three days in a row, because my skin started to get irritated on the 4th day!</li>
            <li> which is something I have never been able to say about any other electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This one is better than any other Razer,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While I have not used the 1290, I did research both and could not find any reason it was a better \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; other than some \\&quot;touchscreen button\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, battery last long.</li>
            <li> compared to other electric razors which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco support is top notch.</li>
            <li> Shaves like most other electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The dry is very close and smooth; the wet shave is better still.  </li>
            <li> I dont think it causes alarm since you will not be replacing them too often if the shaver is kept clean and lubricated regularly.    </li>
            <li> When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I have used several electric shavers in the past and always experienced irritation on my neck from the shaver.</li>
            <li> It is shinny clean next time I use it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it you are not suppose to leave the Jet Clean system plug in the electric outlet.  </li>
            <li> I have found that opening the heads and just blowing them out after each shave has kept the unit clean enough without the need for the cleaning unit or the faucet.</li>
            <li> Back to the Jet Clean system - you start of by filling the bowl which is housed in the lower portion of the cleaning assembly with the cleaning solution provided.  </li>
            <li> c. Take the actual razors out of the protective shield that runs across your skin, and clean each piece separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not used shaving cream with this unit yet and next weekend I plan to use the solution to clean up the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the 30 minutes with the Auto / Eco mode (which cuts the drying cycle short) and the 3 hour with the intensive clean.  </li>
            <li> The only fault to it is that when you plug it in &amp; clean the shaver, it also charges it after the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> My plan is to use the automatic cleaning unit occasionally and otherwise basically clean the razor manually.</li>
            <li> It is such a clean shave</li>
            <li> The cleaning machine is fantastic, but the cleaning solution is extremely difficult if not impossible to find in stores, so I&#x27;ve had to purchase it from Amazon (which is a better deal, anyway, because I can [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Enjoy being able to use dry or wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done that, you can open up the head cover and get an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li> More about the shaver:  Since my old Norelco was a 2004 vintage, I was not terribly surprised that progress had been made in shaver design in the intervening 7 years.  </li>
            <li> It worked decent at first, helping a little with the neck irritation, but I gave it more time since</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D electric shaver I bought was very reasonably priced, inculding the complete cleaning kit.  </li>
            <li> honestly think you&#x27;ll get quite a few years out of this razor before needing to purchase something new.</li>
            <li> Before buying it I was a little skeptical about how good (and by good</li>
            <li> After much research at that time, I went for a Braun Series 7 and was fairly loyal to it until recently.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have used electric shavers mostly - the most recent before this new Norelco being a Norelco 7825XL which I purchased in 2004.  </li>
            <li> When skimming through the net I came upon the new Philips 3d models they looked really promising and decided to buy one with the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the wet shave, which other reviewers report is even better than the dry shave, but the dry shave for me was very good.    </li>
            <li> This unit is also easy to clean, you can open up each of the three heads and empty out the hair in it.</li>
            <li> (3) lots of digital display which looks cool    </li>
            <li> For sideburns, this shaver has a pop-out cutter that does a good job - but it still leaves too much stubble and the round rotary head can&#x27;t get close enough...</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers successfully in the past, and thought it was time to return to them after shelling out too much money on replacement blades for my regular razor.  </li>
            <li> The cool skin lotion pump on my last razor</li>
            <li> myy current Norelco, about ten years old--works just fine! )  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like new afterwards!   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you be the judge as to whether it is worth its very high price, but this next generation of shavers can replace a shaving blade.  </li>
            <li> * Looks stylish, alot slimmer than previous models    </li>
            <li> This worked well, gave me a shave that was markedly better than my previous Norelco</li>
            <li> When it is finished, like a dishwasher, the light changes on the cleaning unit and the razor is lifted from the solution to air dry.</li>
            <li> It shaves close, quietly and quickly...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replaced my older braun shaver.</li>
            <li> The unit charge time is fairly quick and can last around (4-5 shaves approx.).</li>
            <li> still like this shaver well and works as expected, nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco shaver and the blades on it are still working</li>
            <li> The stores carried older models, but not the model our son requested.  </li>
            <li> His older electric shaver, which he could not use in the shower, was beginning to  irritate his skin</li>
            <li> How ever, it did prove somewhat of a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I had an older Philips shaver and now I got this one.</li>
            <li> always find out more about a product before you buy , the replacement  blade are over 100.00   to have a razor for one yr. , and have  the expense to up keep it ,I will go back to the razor there customer relations to me, are a low standing  .</li>
            <li> I only have some mild irritation on my lower neck from this unit.    </li>
            <li> Norelco should reengineer the dock to be more compact and simple than the monstrosity that it currently is.</li>
            <li> Check other prices for possible better deals, have seen in the one forty range!</li>
            <li> I preferred the older models that could be opened with just the flip of your thumb, but maybe the intricate design of the heads prevents that.  </li>
            <li> would not recommend this product because:&lt;br /&gt;1)It does not shave as well as the older model&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all, it is a decent shaver</li>
            <li> I love the shave with digital readout and especially the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> particular model is a bit overkill.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace an older Philips Artilec model.  </li>
            <li> My older Philishave had served me well</li>
            <li> Cleaning was a breeze, open the blade compartment with quick click and run it under faucet and let it air dry...done.</li>
            <li> But, it is definitely a decent shave.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this one is because the top metal piece that holds the blades in place finally broke.  </li>
            <li> more than it say (depends on how much you use everyday, of course).</li>
            <li> The unit has to be started multiple times until the sensor is eventually able to detect the fluid level and start the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 25 years, with a brief 2-3 years interlude of Gillette razors (caused, interestingly, by an incompatibility of electrical plugs when I moved from one country to another two decades ago, and not finding an adapter, forcing me to buy an emergency Gillette razor, taking me 2-3 years to go back to Norelco).</li>
            <li> The shave closeness is better than any Braun shaver I have used, although i find it more difficult to get up closer to the nose than I did with the Braun...</li>
            <li> This is particularly a problem in the neck area where the whiskers lie in all directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both seem very cheap and I am a little concerned about the stand breaking when I travel.</li>
            <li> the Philips since you need to shave in circular motion, it got every single hair and at the end it was extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Other than that, gives me a great shave with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> Filling it to the top also caused it to make a mess and leak anytime</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t wrong it is every bit as good as good as the reviews said if not more.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is way louder, not unpleasant, but it made me appreciate how quiet the Norelco had been all my life.  </li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this model.</li>
            <li> The price is alittle high</li>
            <li> I must admit that my expectations may have been a bit too high for this razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The choice of an electric shaver is highly subjective.  </li>
            <li> (would light up the low fluid light when the fluid level was correct).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommends it to every one.</li>
            <li> excellent product, the base is very practical to use as much as support for fast cleaning, the machine is well adapted to the face</li>
            <li> in all I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this unit.</li>
            <li> Plus my brother had the 1280X and recommended it highly to me and his beard is heavier than mine.  </li>
            <li> And I highly recommend the seller,</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Norelco</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> On balance the quality and quietness of the shave inclines me to rate the product highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend the 1280X.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I also dread the high cost of changing razor heads.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would buy again ,and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The switch on the cleaner should be Clean On, Charge On, Clean/Charge On, but that&#x27;s a minor fault.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I&#x27;ve used several other electric razors and they didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> It works by far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had or used.  </li>
            <li> These spots, and many others, later turned into whiteheads, ingrown hairs, and very sensitive red welts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was only the first day!   </li>
            <li> it could be a little wider and cut better.</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid lasts a long time, and the other features are great</li>
            <li> seriously, even my wife felt it was a smooth pokie free shave.    </li>
            <li> If your new razor squeaks return it before use for a new one!  </li>
            <li> The unit cleans very easily by running hot water on the blades for a few minutes (per the manual), after which you can open up the blades (they flip up) and continue to rinse.  </li>
            <li> In addition I found that the blade type used on the older Spectra gives a closer shave than the new style on the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The test I use in judging a shaver is how much time has to elapse after the shave to get to the point that when I feel my face, it is clear to me that I need to shave.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry, clean smooth shave,</li>
            <li> Now that I have had this awhile, I feel although this is an expensive Razor it is a great razor.</li>
            <li> The razor glides smoothly over my face causing absolutely NO</li>
            <li> you want the closest shave, learn the old fashioned way with either a safety razor or a straight edge</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased, but the shave quality is not near what I was expecting for the product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints:  Non-Universal Power Supply - I also own the Philips Body Shaver and while the power cords look the same and actually do plug into the charging bases, they are not compatible.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the chemical smell of a freshly cleaned public bathroom.</li>
            <li> Current location keeps the unit from being tucked into a corner and unnecessarily takes up more top space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends that the head assembly be replaced every year, and I’m sure that that will cost a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the trimmer is sub-standard and just barely does the job.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much shave daily except on weekends.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time and the digital minute count down is definitely a great benefit for travel use.</li>
            <li> The price is a little higher than I would have liked to spend, but the razor shaves very well and does not irritate my skin nearly as much as other electric razors</li>
            <li> Even though this product will clean you dry, their new one won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Since my initial experience, I&#x27;ve shaved two more times (both dry).  </li>
            <li> It took more than 10 minutes each time and was DRY only (use remington face saver with this - it works well).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> This razor might be good for someone who shaves every single day, but for people who shave every few days it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because strait razors were giving the right side of my neck back irritation.</li>
            <li> After a full charge, I started dry shaving.</li>
            <li> And except for the most difficult chin areas, I do not have go back and forth multiple times in order to get a good close shave there.    </li>
            <li> The contraption that this razor charges in is huge, mainly due to the cleaning basin that is below.</li>
            <li> The original RQ12 replacement heads are still on the market, but sell for $180+ due to high demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I decided to try the new razor with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> like when using a safety razor with a new cartridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used either a Mach 3, Fushion or the New Hydro disposables.</li>
            <li> it gives, rathrer than buy a new unit (the 1280 [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The cleaning feature makes it like new after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Because it had a 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;Philips replaced the defective body with a new one.</li>
            <li> I exchanged it through my AMAZON order ... got a brand new one....</li>
            <li> and they told me they were seending a NEW unit IN a box .....</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  </li>
            <li> but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  </li>
            <li> So, re-contacting them they sent a new replacement handle.</li>
            <li> Still works like new too.</li>
            <li> with my new razor.</li>
            <li> yourself the expense, and buy their new Series 9000 razor.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I used my new Senso 1280xcc without the gillette and man, what a finish...    </li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and had never used a Norelco</li>
            <li> Also, on this new Norelco if you take care of the heads you may not have to replace them every year.</li>
            <li> Also, on this new Norelco if you take care of the heads you may not have to replace them every year.</li>
            <li> If you are new to electric razors like I was, you should know that there is still a consumable item you need to buy with this.  </li>
            <li> After seeing this Norelco on TV, I decided it might be time to think about getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all shavers, a new one takes time to get used to.  </li>
            <li> So I thought I may as well just replace the razor since I needed new blades too.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this new one because the battery needs replaced</li>
            <li> I just bought the new Panasonic Arc 5.</li>
            <li> The increased number of cutting heads not only provide a closer shave, but greatly decrease required shaving time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly fond of using the old fashioned shaving soap and a silver tipped badger hair shaving brush method of shaving [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After a month of using this razor I am simply amazed at how stubble free my skin is now and didn&#x27;t think a shave this close with an electric was even possible.</li>
            <li> If the user does leave the shaver pugged in, then it is possible to hear a clicking sound as the shaver keeps trying to recharge every second once the shaver is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I did so much research on what my next electric razor would be and was really hoping this razor would meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> but I finally decided to take the plunge, and so far it has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was very satisfied with the unit; after about 7 months, the handle unit failed to take a charge; the company replaced the handle unit, indicating the unit was covered under the original purchase date</li>
            <li> you have been on the fence; are prone to ingrown hairs; or have frequent irritation after shaving with a foil or blade, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor cuts as close as a blade without the damage.   </li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive hearing).  </li>
            <li> all I can come up with is that the cleaning station is a little big and it does take up counterspace...and the plug is kinda big which for me is good since you&#x27;re supposed to unplug it after charging or cleaning and my wife needs all the plugs for her hair...</li>
            <li> ** After steering away from electric shavers for at least 10 years due to the quality of the shave, i have been really happy with the closeness of the shave provided by this shaver.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> The hairs were mostly gone, but the small scabs reappeared.  </li>
            <li> have to go around the same area too many times compared to other products.my skin</li>
            <li> I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my shavers to one of the top of the line shavers on the market, the Philips 1280cc/42, especially since Philips-Norelco has a $50 rebate going on at the present time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing with the Philips that it gives me a touch more skin irritation sometimes if I am not careful enough around the lower neck area, but very close and extremely quiet shave.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t say enough about how much he enjoys using it!  </li>
            <li> The beauty of all this was that it was just outside of the standard 2 year warranty, but I found out that by registering my product purchase online they added 6 months to the warranty, and my now 2.5 year warranty now started at my registration date, not my original purchase date (registered about a month after purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update for March 2013:  The jet cleaning system completely stopped working!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely frozen!</li>
            <li> However, I prefer my Philips Norelco since I believe the 3 head shaver gives my face a better shave than other designs by manufacturers such as Braun.  </li>
            <li> first week I used it just as I have every electric for the last 20 years, just the shaver and my face.  </li>
            <li> Totally logical ... and totally didn&#x27;t work that way.     </li>
            <li> Same problem happened with the first one I got after 2 months.  </li>
            <li> but my experience with Norelco razors tells me that this shaver will last many years with only occasional blade replacements needed!  </li>
            <li> Super wet shave withy new Notelco...</li>
            <li> Each head move individually, and it only takes a couple passes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> wanted to mention that after 2 years of use my razor quit charging and at the same time my Jet Clean system suddenly wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The only thing I would do different is get one without the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> Second, pulling each individual head out to manually clean the unit under the faucet</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued... but initially was put off by the high price.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up this model gives me a very fast and close shave that works just as well with a few days worth of growth</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Norelco 1280X to replace my old arcitec shaver, which I bought back in 2008 when this line was originally launched.  </li>
            <li> I have reached this conclusion based on having used BOTH the old Philips Norelco Speed 8240 without any fancy 2D, 3D, 4D, or 5G functions, and the new 1280X / 42.  </li>
            <li> Compared to previous models, Norelco has made huge strides in improvement in this area.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is cheap, but you need to buy a bottle every 2 and a half months or so.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my previous razor, this one is quieter, in fact, it is so quiet that you can actually hear someone talking outside of the bathroom which is nice as I always seem to get interrupted with questions while I&#x27;m trying to shave!</li>
            <li> Is worth every single dollar.</li>
            <li> I wrote a positive review when I got this razor initially.  </li>
            <li> The digital display lets you know exactly how much time is left, no guessing from the bars.</li>
            <li> it is really a toss up since I just repurchased a new Philips 1280XX/42 and alternately using both of them.</li>
            <li> It works as it says, wet or dry, which I love.  </li>
            <li> And three,I don&#x27;t see any need for the jet clean system, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to disinfect, takes up a lot of space, and I can still see a little bit of debris that it didn&#x27;t remove from normal shaving.</li>
            <li> wet   - Can be used more than once with limited skin irritation  </li>
            <li> and I use that function about once or twice a month to really clean the blades as the time it takes to do all the time is not worth it</li>
            <li> Overall, I give both razors a 4 and would easily recommend either one, but different people will have different priorities on what they want to get out of it.  </li>
            <li> As a person who used arcitec for several years, this Sensotouch 3D device is giving me a nice time shaving my face either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> If you use everyday it is some what fine</li>
            <li> original handle lasted approximately 2 weeks before the battery charge started to degrade to the point that a full charge became 36 minutes not 60.</li>
            <li> He spent his first couple of uses just playing with his new toy!</li>
            <li> Just received my shaver from Amazon this evening and had my first (dry) shave with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I find this two step system results in keeping my goatee short on a much more frequent basis (trimming in my sink makes a mess),</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant spending so much for a razor, but let me tell you it is very much \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Super wet shave, forever!</li>
            <li> SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]</li>
            <li> My neck was even clear.</li>
            <li> - Charges fast (60 minutes of charging will give you roughly 60 minutes of shaving) and holds the charge very well  </li>
            <li> A hour or so later, the shaver was clean, dry and fully charged.  </li>
            <li> As I was transferringthe solution out of the cleaning system I purposely did not transfer the \\&quot;dregs\\&quot; if you will at the bottom of the bowl because there was clearly visible particulate matter in the solution.  </li>
            <li> far this has been worth the money spent on it, even if I picked it out  myself for</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would upgrade my old shaver rather than purchase another set of cutters.  </li>
            <li> Even though I routinely used a Norelco razor, the first use of this model did indeed cause some minor razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product as a whole is that there is no automatic shut off when its done charging.</li>
            <li> It can not be fixed, parts are no longer made.</li>
            <li> What I do have a problem with is the fact that the razor has to be removed from the charging unit as soon as the charge is complete.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco Spectra 8894XL after my dog attacked it and broke it.</li>
            <li> The technological difference is analogous to an old rotary phone to an iPhone.</li>
            <li> cuts or razor burns were frequent.  </li>
            <li> Light touch and few strokes - close shave.  </li>
            <li> (It would show about 60 minutes when fully charged, and now only shows 30 minutes straight off the charger.)  </li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive, and I find myself returning to Norelco products again and again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does, however shave very well, and so, I added one star back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and get a lot of irritation or bumps with a razor, try a premium electric like this.</li>
            <li> but WOW sums it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Boy, was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> and so far I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do have to go over my face a few times to get it smooth</li>
            <li> Now what I don&#x27;t like is the grip, it doesn&#x27;t feel natural in my hand.</li>
            <li> he has sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Looks like Norelco took the complaints of that model and fixed them with the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1280x / 42 falls FAR below expectations in meeting my shaving needs, as follows.  </li>
            <li> - god forbid that I go without shaving for two days (48 hours) straight, and try using the Philips Norelco 1280X/42 to get a regular shave.  </li>
            <li> Evidently my facial hair wasn&#x27;t really compatible with foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco was an impulse buy, after I&#x27;d almost given up on electric shavers, and it completely changed my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am now told to discharge the unit completely and attempt a recharge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I actually did buy one for my Dad for Christmas and he really likes his too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so my razor gets banged around by TSA frequently</li>
            <li> and so my razor gets banged around by TSA frequently</li>
            <li> Especially like the fast charge feature.</li>
            <li> I use skin cleanser that is applied with a cotton swab and with my old razors, I would always end with a face covered in cotton swab fragments.</li>
            <li> can this razor bring to my face that my 6 year old $99 Norelco couldn&#x27;t?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This one topped the charts as far as reviews go, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> It was almost 10 years old and the battery started failing and not holding a charge.</li>
            <li> However, I developed a rash under my chin and it would not go away.  </li>
            <li> P.S. our son gave his old electric shaver to his dad.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t change my mind upon reading the negative review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says It cuts very close, has a durable feel to it, and works quiet...</li>
            <li> miss my old Braun, but I guess even Braun doesn&#x27;t make them like they used to based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> Its only $200 and the replacement heads are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t something that made me say WOW...  </li>
            <li> Also want to note, searched before purchase the cost for replacement cleaning fluid and heads, and found all are reasonably price.  </li>
            <li> my husband want to change his old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning this item with the knowledge that I&#x27;m not missing out.</li>
            <li> Neck is not as close as a blade, but is near blade status, if you spend the time.  </li>
            <li> All electric razors I have used, sans the early Braun</li>
            <li> The 3D is a whole different animal.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old Spectra model was dropped and the retaining ring broke.  </li>
            <li> The shave quality is very similar to the results from the Braun foil shaver I have, but was much faster.</li>
            <li> Note: The cleaning system for this model offers three options for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I attribute the life of my old Norelco&#x27;s heads to routine cleaning and lubrication of its heads.</li>
            <li> I attribute the life of my old Norelco&#x27;s heads to routine cleaning and lubrication of its heads.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> but I do still need to use an old fashion razor to get the places where the Philips razor missed.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor is very simple and charge time is fast.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: the shaver just does not give me that polished, soft skin after the shave that the Panasonic does.</li>
            <li> I am concerned, however, about the reviews of the RQ12+ on the Amazon site as MANY are extremely negative.</li>
            <li> and you want to completely shave it off</li>
            <li> My almost 16 year old began shaving about a year ago and we purchase a wahl shaver.  </li>
            <li> Battery not holding complete charge need to get replacement.</li>
            <li> A complete charge is 60 minutes.  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t affected the use</li>
            <li> Quiet and fast.  </li>
            <li> - on regular shave days (i.e., on those days when I have only 24-hours worth of hair), no matter how much time I spend shaving, there are still occasional hairs, scattered all over my face, which are completely un-cut.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in wet shaving and will do so one of these days for fun.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but surprisingly good.    </li>
            <li> And well... It&#x27;s good but definitely not as perfect as the maker portraits it to be.</li>
            <li> My beard tends to lay down under razors easily, so when using an electric, have to go over the same places many times and press hard.  </li>
            <li> The morning shave in not a little torture for me anymore</li>
            <li> The first two (2) shaves withe the 1280 were dry shaves.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and dry, never fails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to set the razor in the cleaning station every couple of uses to deep clean and lubricate the cutting heads</li>
            <li> Cleaning system only notifies that it must be changed after you start a cycle-it then refuses to clean and shaver is wet from solution.  </li>
            <li> then I can remember and this is the third one and the last two did not fail</li>
            <li> I returned it for a Norelco 8250, which has the exact same razors, but the traditional electric razor shape.  </li>
            <li> At first I used it as a wet razor like my old one.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use a regular Gillette shaver and then I use my Panasonic electric shaver to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used a foil-type shaver for the last several years, this was my first rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> The one star rating may seem a little harsh for a razor that does actually shave, however the razor is being sold as a top of the line razor and it is no better than the 20 year old travel Norelco I own.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality shaver, look no further.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially as a gift.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it&#x27;s high cost.  </li>
            <li> The Braun has a little bit closer shave on specific areas than the Norelco, but overall the better shave between the electric&#x27;s was with the 1280X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but will when I need to do deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very ergonomically designed, lighter than previous models and comes at a very affordable price.    </li>
            <li> This shaver does do a pretty good job of close shaving on dry skin as long as you use your other hand or facial muscles to stretch the skin as tightly</li>
            <li> I went with the assumption that more expensive has to be better and with how bad my neck was getting, it would have been worth every penny if my assumption would hold to be true.</li>
            <li> I can now shave daily and only get light to minimal redness if any on my neck.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re waiting for a long time.but it&#x27; s really worth.i bought it before.the same,perfect.</li>
            <li> fast charging 1 hour long keeps charging.</li>
            <li> Normally my Norelco&#x27;s were around the $40-60 price range and would last (battery/blades) about 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> Now (5 weeks later) the razor irritates my upper lip, side of my mouth, and all of my neck where before it was only the right side of the neck.</li>
            <li> I have used both and will shave wet most of the time after a shower with little risk of cuts.  </li>
            <li> Other than that he really likes his new razor.</li>
            <li> They originally shipped the wrong item, but with ONE quick email the problem was corrected and I received the correct item within two days</li>
            <li> other words, when you buy this razor, you pay for the convenience of a quick, painless, relatively close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried pre-shave gels and creams before finally doing research for a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> For Christmas 2011, I decided to give the new wet/dry norelco electric shaver a try sort of a Christmas present to myself and with the $30 off</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a new razor from Braun, the company that made my last electric razor that I used for years.  </li>
            <li> After using this, the new RQ12 is a big improvement over the RQ10 of the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> It was at my door 6 jan 11.Sorry for not getting $50 because i live outside the USA.  </li>
            <li> The new 3 head pod can then be simply snapped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I ordered and received my new razor and the second time I recharged my razor</li>
            <li> Was using an ancient Norelco that I had put numerous new blades in.  </li>
            <li> I also got a much closer shave, so I guess I will stick with the dry shaving for now.</li>
            <li> Use wet or dry and the result, is a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-That&#x27;s pretty much all I can think of beyond the usual things intrinsic to an electric razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the Braun refill cartridges are more expensive than the Norelco&#x27;s, I like the fact that it is much neater and eaiser to use.  </li>
            <li> This is only personal preference and absolutely nothing against the performance of the Philips shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close and gentle shaving experience everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver ever, so I don&#x27;t have any experiences with other shavers to compare with.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t think the ink rubbing off was major</li>
            <li> The instructions stated to give the product a minimum of four weeks to allow your face to adjust, and allow your facial hair to grow straight out vs. straight down against the face and curling under the skin.    </li>
            <li> It is a very nice experience using this razor, after being used to the tugs and snags of other electrics, or the general roughness that some of the others had left behind.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how another shaver could do better than this.</li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly, and I mean REALLY quickly--way faster than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned and probably twice as fast as the 5-year-old Braun razor</li>
            <li> The razor shaves fabulously, face wet with cream or dry regular and it can be eaisly cleaned in the sink under running water!  </li>
            <li> really gets the job done Wet or Dry again if your looking for a very close shave I would suggest going with a razor or using a combo of both</li>
            <li> Razor is a little pricy, but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have had a hard time getting a comfortable close shave, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> Says every time he uses it, that it is so smooth,  he can hardly feel  it.  </li>
            <li> First, the heads pivoted so much, it was hard to get a truly close shave since they pivoted away from the face.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add anything to the other positive reviews at this site.     </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well especially around the neck area.</li>
            <li> It barely holds the shavor.</li>
            <li> Of the two razors I used prior to, and after getting the Norelco, the Fusion by far is the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes does not provide a complete shave especially with hair longer than stubble.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I had to fix several spots with my old razor to even out</li>
            <li> One is that it doesn&#x27;t cut the longer hairs around the neck and upper cheek areas nowhere nearly as well as it claims to do in the advertizing.</li>
            <li> My initial concern with buying it was price and the fact I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No regrets at all.</li>
            <li> With my old razor, I had to go multiple times (like 10 times) to feel that skin is like baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Traveling with the 1280X - From my experience so far I think I could travel with the 1280X for 25 days without needing to take the charging stand and cord with me - that&#x27;s assuming it was fully charged when I left</li>
            <li> Using it wet with shave cream gives a very close shave with no skin irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely used it since purchasing it, but once I started using it again</li>
            <li> so he had to give up his trusty, old circa 1960&#x27;s double edged razor.  </li>
            <li> He was using some cheap electric foil razor for a few months that practically left his facial hairs longer rather than shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a handful of electric shavers since I was old enough to shave.  </li>
            <li> It is way too much money invested in electric razors for no reasonable replacement parts...</li>
            <li> Straight to be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposed to be a wet shaver...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old with both heavy and medium whisker areas on my face; it&#x27;s my first electric razor in over 35 years.  </li>
            <li> I had the 1280 for a few months now and can say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.   </li>
            <li> So, if the cleaning unit fails, the razor can be just as effectively cleaned manually.</li>
            <li> When the read-out got down to 4 minutes remaining (after about a month), I got the cleaner system out and did my first cleaning on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, the head on this model has extra room for hair clippings to store, whereas the old models were too small and the head would fill up quick with clippings</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and gets places where most other less expensive electric razors miss, like on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life as well.</li>
            <li> The razor was great but finding replacement heads a year later was nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i guess it might take few shaves to get it right and speed things up a bit).</li>
            <li> The application of using works well with my face I will say I did have some slight irritation with my neck at first</li>
            <li> This not only provides you with a close shave, but is quiet and can last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure the other razors I have had were garbage, such as the single foil Braun for like $40.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hesitant to pay this much for a razor.  </li>
            <li> Cost was reasonable in comparison with other advertised.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would be future-proofed for at least 4 or 5 years and this fit the bill, especially given Amazon&#x27;s online price which was substantially lower than anywhere else including Wal*Mart and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Norelco was a 53rd birthday present, and after owning several electric shavers from Norelco generations in my time I am surprised that they could yet make improvements.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these \\&quot;latest\\&quot; Philips electric razor (same model without the ) to replace the current one (also Philips brand) which is 7 years old.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;After an additional few more months of use I noticed a slightly noisier electric shaver motor than before, all else being equal.</li>
            <li> I have watched videos of various shavers in action and, as I saw on videos, this one is very quiet compared to Braun or Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I just upgraded from a similar model that was 2D and about 4 years old (the battery died on me and couldn&#x27;t be brought back to life).  </li>
            <li> The problem is, after only owning and using this razor daily for two months, it is not charging completely.  </li>
            <li> The main factor in this is, ability to wet shave (using shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> It is also by far the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like that it can be used for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> The actual razor heads did their job well, but I had two major complaints that caused me to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this shaver could do a little bit better job especially if you have a little bit longer hair</li>
            <li> I pondered over purchasing a new shaver for quite some time, specially an expensive shaver such as the 1280XL, since the old one was otherwise working fine.</li>
            <li> I spent a little more and got the top of the line because even at $229 it is still less than what I had spent in the past.</li>
            <li> After Shave Gel (ironically) for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> But the time I save is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li> the first few weeks is supposed to be the roughest (until your face gets used to it).</li>
            <li> hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.  </li>
            <li> hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.  </li>
            <li> The first times i suffered a little \\&quot;like friction burn\\&quot; in the low part of the neck (where there is not hairs, but it started to disappear with the continue use ant</li>
            <li> but for such a high price i expected more.love the slef cleaning feature</li>
            <li> be prepared for the capacity to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your shaving conditions, which will probably mean that you will NOT get a full 60 min of shaving time.  </li>
            <li> It still charges completely and lasts a very long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> posted a Vine of this piece of junk that went viral and the Norelco contracted social media company got back to me on Twitter.</li>
            <li> It is battery operated only and for what it costs, I am not sure that the shave is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty short and gives me trouble when trying to shave around my ears to trim up the sideburn area.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my old Norelco razor, I at first thought this razor sounded slow.  </li>
            <li> When it was about time to purchase me second replacement head I found a new complete razor for less than the price of the replacement head (which is totally overpriced).  </li>
            <li> I am not as crazy about the Braun cleaning system when compared to the Norelco, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> Though, when used wet with shaving gel... WOW!  </li>
            <li> It really works well dry or wet, it shaves close.</li>
            <li> appreciated is usage dry and wet and changable head unit, for beard styler</li>
            <li> Your face doesn&#x27;t feel raw or funny when you finish.</li>
            <li> in the past the electric shavers I have used have been SoSo- this on the other hand was so smooth</li>
            <li> Cons:  (1) bulky, as compared with old models (although slightly powerful which really does not make too much difference to me personally)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be interested over the long term how this shaver holds up, it worries me a little that the lockdown mechanism for the shaver head will stop latching correctly as the pieces for that seem rather fragile.  </li>

            <li> Thus, you gamble that you&#x27;ll get a good unit OR a bad unit ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> The manual cleaning with the removable cutting head is also very fast and easy on this Braun model, never needs the wet cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and have never before been able to use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> In 12 minutes my face was clear no more hair right down to the skin.</li>
            <li> I can see how doing this at least a few days a week will keep the unit very clean, without the hassle and expense of dealing with the cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> No more allergies and choose a dry or wet shave, I forgot you don&#x27;t need de jet clean.</li>
            <li> In other words, the shaver completely misses those hairs.  </li>
            <li> Various site rankings and products reviewed led me to considering the Norelco 3D line and long story short, I made the purchase with moderate expectations despite some of the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pricey but less than a new razor).</li>
            <li> You cannot change just the blades, as I have always done on previous razors, you have to pop the head off and install a new one costing from $70 - $100,  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the wet shave was much more irritating to my skin and didn&#x27;t get any closer than the dry shave.    </li>
            <li> only thing that I am not pleased with is the trimmer, I wish it was much wider</li>
            <li> I hope it last as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> After the first one I reread the instructions to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being an idiot.  </li>
            <li> it is definitely a little bit closer in some places in a normal razor.</li>
            <li> last a very long time between charges I find myself only charging maybe once or twice a month&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previous rotary shavers I have used did not perform as well as this one, and were a bit more irritating.</li>
            <li> If I could use just this shaver everyday (or every few days), without needing a razor blade, then it would be 5 star worthy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it makes a real difference.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for man, who is lazy like me.</li>
            <li> The old shaver was at least 20 years old still running the only maintenance that I have done was replace the blades once a year.</li>
            <li> however, in my experience it only took 2 days - probably because I have been on an electric shaver for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with spots where i had long whiskers that I needed to cut with a regular razor blade.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I hope the head last as long as the speed XL because I see it cost 1/2 what the razor does.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor long enough to replace the head a couple of times.</li>
            <li> had been using for 6 months, didn&#x27;t have any problem, long lasting battery life,</li>
            <li> With care it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little high priced, but wondered if it cold be worth twice as much as the 8138.</li>
            <li> only one problem that I have is that if I shave too frequently without letting my hair grow out a little bit it can sometimes give me an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> It even passed my ultimate test, my 5 yr old little girl who does not like me having \\&quot;pokies\\&quot; on my face...</li>
            <li> The major down side is that the shaver should not be left plugged in to the mains once the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve thought that such a quality product would have that feature built in, but that is very minor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver if you have a hard time shaving as your facial hair grows in multiple directions and you struggle to shave in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly blade close, but with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I then decided to go back to dry shaving and the rash went away.</li>
            <li> the noise made by the razor is considerably less than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I then leave the shaving module open, to dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cleaning system:&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only if you use dry for me.</li>
            <li> I only shave dry</li>
            <li> Roughly the same thing happened with the second handle.  </li>
            <li> This product appears to be designed to last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> At this price point, skimping out the extra 25 cents that the cord is probably worth is pretty bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li> In general it was quicker than me using a blade or other electrics.  </li>
            <li> Dry shave irritates my skin and doesnt shave properly anyway, takes too long to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> (I have the 3 mode model, but I assume the next level down shaver, which only has 1 cleaning cycle, does the same cleaning).  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that the new and improved Philips Norelco 1280x / 42 leaves my neck red and irritated and irritation lasts for good 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was as if the razor molded to every contour and edge of my jaw line; the upper lip area (which typically was the most uncomfortable spot to shave) was a breeze and just took one pass as opposed to 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li> I warned my family  that it is expensive and told them that it would be fine to get me something else.  </li>
            <li> Hi, I was always skeptical to pay more than $200 for a shaver that looked flimsy and was afraid it would break easy if dropped.  </li>
            <li> My loyalty to the foil razor even persisted through the last couple years of loathing shaving due to irritation and areas that were not always shaved properly i.e. neck and jaw line.  </li>
            <li> The neck did feel slightly irritated, but I believe that&#x27;s because my hair was actually shaved and trimmed for the first time as I usually had to resort to a blade to get all the missed areas with the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet, gives close shaves, one charge last 60 minutes before you have to charge it again, it is sharp looking</li>
            <li> I have probably tried every type of electric razor on the market only to have to quit using them after several weeks due to severe neck skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> but I found that when using the other foil shavers on a daily basis my neck area would always become red and irritated.</li>
            <li> tried it last night initially, expecting the first time to be a bit uncomfortable, as the skin and hair will typically take 3 weeks to adapt to a new method of shaving.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long I used these shavers (allowing for the adjustment)</li>
            <li> This shave picks up the long hairs on your neck, under you chin and on the side of your face.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s strange ... and tried it in the cradle ...</li>
            <li> check out how long the line is ...</li>
            <li> I gave my face a long time to adapt (I&#x27;ve been through this before)</li>
            <li> Not loud    </li>
            <li> Why did I stick with the Braun foil-type shaver for so long, I don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> Long story condensed: purchased the 1280xx - used it for a week and all of the ink rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> My last razor was the wet razor that had the lotion container.</li>
            <li> I was a lifelong Norelco user but, I recently purchased a Panasonic ES LA93 and a Norelco 1280X/42 for a head-to-head comparison.  </li>
            <li> So for being away from electric shavers for about 35 years, the technology has come a long, long way</li>
            <li> The razor attention have been here for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have now used the Norelco Senso Touch for about 6 months with no similar problems (note that I use it wet with shave cream).  </li>
            <li> razor is well made, but it just takes way too long to get anywhere, and it is not as close as non-electric razors.</li>
            <li> But it was getting a bit long in the tooth.  </li>
            <li> the battery can use for long time.</li>
            <li> I would not consider a razor that could not be used in the shower, as I personally feel that you can get a closer shave by using a wet razor when your skin and hair are saturated with water.    </li>
            <li> somehow after 6 months of use or so..lost interest as it was hurting my skin and taking long time compared to razor....</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work on long beard.</li>
            <li> The difference is how long the unit cleans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost be roughly the same Gillette shaving effect</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I spent well over $100 on a Braun foil-type shaver with a cleaner/charger machine.  </li>
            <li> Electric shavers have come a long way.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> As long as you do this maybe once a week or so, you shouldn&#x27;t need the cleaning kit.</li>
            <li> It is really sad because two days ago I recommended this electric razor to my friend!.&lt;br /&gt;the small charging unit should have been labeled \\&quot;use on your own risk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that comes in fast</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it would only charge 48min and 2-3 charges later dropped down to 38min where it held.</li>
            <li> I also have tried wet and dry shave, using a variety of different lotions and soaps, etc.</li>
            <li> The 3D help with covering some spot on the edge of the face that was hard to get otherwise on a first pass or even 10 with my other ones.  </li>
            <li> I mean how fast and how close) of a shave this razor can give.</li>
            <li> He ended up shaving with a plain old razor blade after trying to get this fancy one to work...</li>
            <li> If you are travelling with your shaver and you are likely to need to recharge the shaver while you are away, then you have to take the stand with you as there is no direct connection to the shaver other than the stand.  </li>
            <li> (they need to be sharp to get close and do not last long).  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have strayed from my linear foil shaver (Braun - currently a Series 7) for forays in to other ways of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Simply put this is leagues ahead of other electrics I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun top-of-the-line model for a few years and unless I used it daily, my facial hair would grow too long for the shaver to cut it efficiently</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bother dismantling them to see if I could diagnose the cause of the problems so have no way of knowing whether one of the two had an electrical problem that later broke the other one,</li>
            <li> This may be due to the blade lubrication effect or it may just be psychological, I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for over 25 years and have tried other brands but alway come back to Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I already have to replace the blades; when other models last me 12-16 months.</li>
            <li> He also has extremely course facial hair</li>
            <li> Only one other model of this razor uses a cleaning stand and it has one setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working like a charm all these years, but recently, it started acting funny when sitting in the cleaner/charger (it would randomly start cleaning itself, which isn&#x27;t supposed to happen).  </li>
            <li> Other than that, my cheeks, upper lip, and chin are smoooooooth.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall I have with the razor is the little detailer that pops out of the back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have also mentioned that replacement heads are expensive - and while I agree - I dont think it causes alarm since you will not be replacing them too often if the shaver is kept clean and lubricated</li>
            <li> making a clean line difficult.    </li>
            <li> I charged the shaver for a couple hours and then shaved dry and was amazed.</li>
            <li> The unit fails to charge on either the jet clean dock or on the charge stand.</li>
            <li> I have used it dry, and with pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> I suspect I would get some irritation if I used the razor dry,</li>
            <li> dry shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t use a razor blade all the time and wanted something as close to a shave as I could get and shaving with this thing dry</li>
            <li> and it was a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I like the dry shave cause</li>
            <li> you can use this dry without any problem.  </li>
            <li> This razor does work in the shower and dry.</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean station that comes with it is simply flawed in its design.</li>
            <li> The last time I owned one I was late teens early twenties</li>
            <li> It operates fine for a few months, and then the water level sensor becomes dirty or scaled and the unit is unable to properly detect the water/cleaning fluid level, continuously indicating that the fluid reservoir is empty although it is full.</li>
            <li> (originally, before discounts)&lt;br /&gt;-The head is a little bulky compared to the body--it&#x27;s not quite as compact for travel as the Braun and makes me worry that it could get broken or damaged at the neck stalk&lt;</li>
            <li> C30002 Auto Shut-Off Safety Outlet, Single Setting]].  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who, like me has limited time to shave and needs to get that chore completed</li>
            <li> There has not been a single electric that I had found that would shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I use this electric razor every single day.</li>
            <li> every single day?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have what I consider to be a moderate beard - the only possible exception being the chin area which is hard to shave with either an electric or a razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I noticed that I developed dozens of small scabs on my neck and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It cuts extremely close (especially when wet), has a neat looking LCD display that tells you the minutes remaining in the battery, and is well built/finished.    </li>
            <li> Also, I am not sure if it is mentioned but this shaver can not plug-in directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always owned Norelco razors but this is the first one that has broken.  </li>
            <li> : TAKES LONG TO SHAVE ROUGHLY 6-7 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;2:</li>
            <li> It is very irritating to have to take the shaver out of the jet clean system once it has finished cleaning or charging.  </li>
            <li> I started with circular motions on one cheek with zero pressure, per the instructions, and was shocked at how easily this shaver cut the hair - not a single tug or the tiniest bit of irritation, although it takes about 10 circular passes over every inch to get all of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered new blades and once again in about a month they were dull.  </li>
            <li> Just opening the heads and blowing them out into my shower after each shave does the trick and the water simply carries all the hair down the drain.</li>
            <li> The motor is a low torque so the thing sounds like its bogging down but never does.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is required to cut down the extended whiskers, then the rotary cutters will handle the remaining short stuff.  </li>
            <li> Conclusion:  Highly recommended without reservation for all except for those few guys who have an exceptionally heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I researched high and low for electric razors as I was tired of paying for blades</li>
            <li> I believe that the new generation of Philips Norelco shavers are \\&quot;gentler\\&quot; devices, with a lot reduced ability to cut through thick and dense hair.  </li>
            <li> This is very inconvenient particularly if you use the jet clean system.  </li>
            <li> As a Black male it didn&#x27;t matter what style razor or what brand of shaving/after shave gel I used</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver dry, wet and with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the subtle quietness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months of use</li>
            <li> I decided to try this sensotouch 3d because I hoped that it will cause less irritation and cuts than a regular razor that I was using before.</li>
            <li> I just hope it will last another 10 years like my previous one.</li>
            <li> Battery only half charges and replacement head is unavailable.</li>
            <li> but I gave it a chance; I have used it both dry and wet with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> After the cream ran out, I switched to the same brand of shaving soap -- which is less viscous.  </li>
            <li> Less of a big deal to me but still noticeable -</li>
            <li> (though a wet shave will always get closer than a dry one).</li>
            <li> There has been a lot less irritation than with a manual razor, actually.</li>
            <li> 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]and</li>
            <li> In addition, besides shaving my face, less the area around my goatee, I also shave the sides and back of my head where the remnants of my scalp attempt, pitiably, to grow</li>
            <li> My previous top-of-the-line Remington had the cleaning kit (similar to the Norelco setup).  </li>
            <li> I can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is pretty useless as it doesn&#x27;t  get close enough</li>
            <li> but I found that that the blades are further apart than the previous models I had used.  </li>
            <li> Well, while the razor has a two and a half year warranty (when registered), these mechanical cleaning contraptions have been known to last just beyond the warranty.</li>
            <li> The Norelco requires a different shaving technique than the typical linear foil shavers.</li>
            <li> I typically shave daily to avoid the hassles of a longer shave time and missed hairs if I skip days.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 previous electric razors in the same price range and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will out last the previous razor (Braun)</li>
            <li> In addition to a thick beard I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , razor burns particularly on the neck, does not trim around a goatee very well, expensive!    </li>
            <li> I do not have to push down as hard as I did with the old Norelco to get a proper shave.  </li>
            <li> Far less pull on a few day&#x27;s growth.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> No razor shaves completely around the neck, press hard, causing skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This was a big, big, BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!  </li>
            <li> The razor worked great on my cheeks, but was horrible for my neck.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get a very close shave without a LOT of extra time and effort that I shouldn&#x27;t need with an expensive shaver like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not yet tried shaving with a foam or gel - wet shaving...</li>
            <li> Shaving in wet with foam does not appeal to me, so</li>
            <li> But after use for 3 weeks, I think I got a mediocre product which I&#x27;ll use, but after getting my money&#x27;s worth, be looking forward to buying another shaver.</li>
            <li> rough to lite beards it will amaze you as it did me.</li>
            <li> For wet shaves with a premium gel/foam (Nivea, Gillette, etc)</li>
            <li> - Wet shaves   -</li>
            <li> Just keep the razor head wet</li>
            <li> Just keep the razor head wet</li>
            <li> There are only a few negatives.</li>
            <li> I read it takes 3 weeks for your face to get use to the electric shaver and that some skin irritation would be expected.</li>
            <li> It comes fully uncharged, but within a few minutes there is enough juice for a shave.</li>
            <li> I am in the military, so I need to keep a close shave, and haven&#x27;t heard anything yet after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Nowhere close to what I expected.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for a wet shave</li>
            <li> Reason is that I bought an electric shaver just so I can avoid the \\&quot;mess\\&quot; a wet shave brings (excluding using it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I expect to get what I spent $200 dollars</li>
            <li> I had been using wet shave with a container of brush-applied shaving cream -- which was quite viscous.  </li>
            <li> I had expected the cleaning solution to contain either alcohol or acetone, but</li>
            <li> 6 months after buying the Norelco I am going to go back to shaving with my dual edge safety razor for a few weeks and try</li>
            <li> I’ve never before spent even $100 for a razor, this one, on sale, was over $200.</li>
            <li> I use a wet shave process with Edge Shaving Gel (Aloe).</li>
            <li> I always wet shave</li>
            <li> So, on a whim I decided to try out the wet shaving method.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- using it with a wet beard was a piece of cake, even if its an all weekend beard on Monday</li>
            <li> And, like they advertise, it is the closest shave this side of a blade and doesn&#x27;t rough up your skin.  </li>
            <li> The product of course didn&#x27;t cut as close as a strait razor, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I happened by accident onto Amazon when they had it reduced for only a few hours by a lot</li>
            <li> If you use pro glide or any wet solution that solves that.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for a electric razor but worth the money in the end.</li>
            <li> I am comparing to my Panasonic ES-LV81 for wet shaving which I have owned just over 2 years.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, after a few shaves, it was a fairly simple transition.</li>
            <li> Keys here are a circular motion and on the jaw line using the foils along the jaw line with the Y of the foils straddling the ear lobe to catch those last few whiskers.</li>
            <li> Wet shave is the way to go</li>
            <li> I have always been careful not to over charge this unit.  </li>
            <li> and I use it daily and have done so for the passed few months without issue.  </li>
            <li> The wet function is convenient in cleaning the cutter heads.</li>
            <li> the price I expected longer service than 2 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I kind of wish that you could store it in the cleaning system base without having to unplug it each time</li>
            <li> My Arcitec currently holds 98 minutes of shave time due to cycling the battery over a few years.  </li>
            <li> Given that my shaving, both face and head, takes less than 2 minutes, there is no issue if you want to use it that long without recharging.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the shaver is it does not lay flat or have a hole to thread a string handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update after 7 months:&lt;br /&gt;Although I can not say anything bad about this shaver, probably the best Philips ever made, but after 50 years of using Braun shavers only I could not get used to the rotary system and the little clumsy design of using the charging stand to charge it and the travel case design is ridiculously large and stupid.</li>
            <li> tryed in dry shave, and irritation came up, tryed wet shave, less irritation, tryed with shaving cream from nivea,</li>
            <li> Used to take me close to 30 minutes to just shave, minus any other detail or trim work, now takes about 15.</li>
            <li> The only very minor issue is the cutting heads are slightly larger than the old models</li>
            <li> The down side is that they give you so little cleaning fluid with it.</li>
            <li> I also have the jet clean system and have not noticed a dirty razor yet.</li>
            <li> Not good to shave near neck if your skin is rough</li>
            <li> Not easy to clean heads, and replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> I even shaved with little long hair and no problem at all.</li>
            <li> The second disappointment is the quality of the stand (not the jet clean system but the small plastic stand).  </li>
            <li> however, the problem is that i tried to use the trimmer of it, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work, and i can&#x27;t return it, as i live outside US and bought it through Shop&amp;Ship account.</li>
            <li> I usually do a wet shave, but I have dry shaved a few times with it</li>
            <li> I wet and lathered up the other half of my face and gave the SensoTouch 3d a try wet.  </li>
            <li> After using a blade for over 30 years I started to develop in grown hairs, and I was becoming incredibly frustrated.</li>
            <li> no irritation, tugs, pulls, and or any other hinderances.  </li>
            <li> The Electric Shaver is no better than my simple Braun Electric Shaver that I bought 20 years ago for 10% of the cost of this one.</li>
            <li> With this shaver I still have trouble with whiskers that are an eight of an inch or so ,long.</li>
            <li> It includes the shaver, travel bag, one small (tiny) brush, a triangular recharge stand, the cutter cover, and a plug.  </li>
            <li> (4)  Small, if not tiny, trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other type, styles &amp; brands, but nothing beats the 3 floating blades</li>
            <li> Not all of my bumps were due to ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> You have to allocate other space for the charger etc when you travel  </li>
            <li> I decided to shave half my face wet and half my face dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt leave alot of shaving bumps like the other electric shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned the razor has to be charged in either the stand or the cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> I had done my due dilligence , and I knew that at the head of  </li>
            <li> OTHER thing I thought was this....</li>
            <li> have been using Braun shavers for the past 50 years, then 2 years ago I purchased a Philips-Norelco 8260 XL shaver also and used them alternately side by side with my Braun 7570 and 8595 together.</li>
            <li> Whether the deficiency comes from weaker and duller blades, or whatever other \\&quot;technological</li>
            <li> I did try lot of products from other brand and Philips itself, trust me non of them</li>
            <li> I have never shaved with anything other than an electric razor in over 25 years</li>
            <li> One stand cleans and sanitizes, the other just charges.  </li>
            <li> However Im not sure how necessary this is.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this one due to performance issues.</li>
            <li> and though I can&#x27;t compare to other electrics</li>
            <li> It stays charged extremely well when he goes on longer business trips too.</li>
            <li> Extremely close shave</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the high-pitch whine I often would hear from other motors either</li>
            <li> It seems to only work when there is a small amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> There seems to be no logical reason to get the 1290 vs. 1280.  </li>
            <li> There are a few negatives though, which is why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but they are fairly minor.  </li>
            <li> You select the type of cleaning desired by repetitive pushes on a button (there are only three selections).</li>
            <li> I prefer to use electric razors due to the speed and ease of shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> When I plugged the charger in the small charging unit, I heard some noises then the charger started to get bigger.</li>
            <li> I found the foil on the Panasonic to be farther from the edge of the body than I expected and particularly under the nose was a little tough to get to.  </li>
            <li> product, buy if you don&#x27;t have a tough beard and/or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> On closeness, I find it impossible to get a perfectly smooth shave, even with a blade.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a slight difficulty with shaving the neck area, but it is minimal with this razor.    </li>
            <li> The wet shave also did not feel as close as my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> What really annoyed me was that if I rinsed the Panasonic and left it together it would have a musty smell later.  </li>
            <li> Today, while at Costco (sorry Amazon), my wife bought me the Norelco 1280x (no cleaning kit) as an early Xmas present</li>
            <li> and I think it will get even better once my skin adjusts to the new style cutting heads (never used the 3 cutting heads before).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this razor almost everyday with a dry face and it shaves my face smoother than my schick quatro!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and was a little skeptical about how close of a shave i could get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really hard to tell which shaves closer between an actually razor blade or this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical on spending this much money on a shaver</li>
            <li> But Senso touch 3D give the closest possible shaving with least irritation.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> For those guys I would recommend at least checking the 1280X out if that is at all possible.</li>
            <li> I never really liked having to buy the cleaning fluid, and changing the filters, etc.</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is how, when shaving my neck, I have to shave six different directions at least a dozen times.     </li>
            <li> I have always had problems in the past with 1 or two whiskers that would get missed and grow long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is you have to unplug the unit after it recharges or damage the batteries.</li>
            <li> ;  I did not think there would be much difference between the 9160XL and this 1280, but I was pleasantly wrong.</li>
            <li> I was fearful at first to spend so much on an razor</li>
            <li> Additionally my hair is thick and grows rather quickly so regular blade shaving had to be eliminated.  </li>
            <li> Sent it with a return box postage paid for the old broken one.</li>
            <li> I would say I have a thick bread that goes over my face and need daily shaving.</li>
            <li> and frankly it was worse than my old one (I keep it around for the trimmer).  </li>
            <li> wet my face, apply a few drops of [[ASIN:B0000C0XL8</li>
            <li> If you use to leavy your beard a few days I just recommend to use this wet, for every-day shave</li>
            <li> My 8894XL is approximately 10 years old, and guess what?  </li>
            <li> I allowed the shaver battery to run down until it was at 00 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave twice a day just to keep it down.</li>
            <li> Plug in the cleaning system, insert the 1280X shaver head down, and turn it on and walk away.  </li>
            <li> why use the cleaning machine when you cannot run the battery level down if you use it?).  </li>
            <li> I was told the type of battery used in the shaver should be run down &amp; then re-charged, not charged again after every cleaning.  </li>
            <li> All other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, including previous Norelco models, all pulled and botched up trying to shave with a few days growth, and had to be trimmed with clippers before.  </li>
            <li> Here I noticed a bit of irritation, but it was much less than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Previously used Panasonic shaver, decided to change it for something with less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that after using this shaver just a couple of times, I noticed the irritation became less and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This might be because my neck was already conditioned by previous Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I gently pressed slightly harder and re-did spots where it wasn&#x27;t cutting well.  </li>
            <li> And then, after painstaking and extensive efforts of trying to get my neck shaved, there are still hairs left uncut.  </li>
            <li> Typical to any electric razor</li>
            <li> It seems like Norelco does have a slight quality control issue with that part, although it doesn&#x27;t affect functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using disposables for a number of years, but wanted less hassle in an electric</li>
            <li> I can be on the road for for 5-6 days, and will return home with over half a charge.    </li>
            <li> The self cleaning half of the razor stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have had the 1280X for about a month and a half and for me I am averaging about 2 minutes of battery usage per shave.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used Braun shavers for over 2 years</li>
            <li> Let me set the background for you: I have been shaving over half a century now.</li>
            <li> Alot less irritation than previous razors.  </li>
            <li> it takes up less space on the counter then</li>
            <li> Faster, cleaner and with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I previously had 2 Norelco 8138 speed XLs.</li>
            <li> And lastly, the travel pouch is just ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Previously I have used Braun, Remington, &amp; a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I dock one star for the less than close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference between this rotary shaver and the previous foils I have used is night and day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for quite a while now alternating between a previous Philips model and a razor.</li>
            <li> whether shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as I typically do in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I could shave my face in a minute or two less time with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I had previously reviewed this product with an unfavorable comment about the cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It was less than half the price of this razor.  </li>
            <li> Appears to shave closer than previous Philips Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco and Remington razors before but the design and versatility of this razor surpasses my previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> Must quieter than the previous Braun razor</li>
            <li> min like my previous razors.</li>
            <li> The main warnings are to never use the unit if part of the protective cutting guide over the cutters has broken or is now missing, unless you really want to find what razor burn is like.</li>
            <li> The main warnings are to never use the unit if part of the protective cutting guide over the cutters has broken or is now missing, unless you really want to find what razor burn is like.</li>
            <li> This makes a mess on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Figuring I was pressing down too hard and cutting the skin, I avoided pressure the next time and found that it left too much hair behind.  </li>
            <li> On the 1050, it even fits tightly into the portable travel recharging case.</li>
            <li> This unit has a very quiet motor--it is hardly audible!</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and my face has yet to even be slightly irritated.</li>
            <li> and I have stretch skin a little.</li>
            <li> i felt little onches when held to close to skin.you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little bit</li>
            <li> their little irritation took a little bit to get used to the razor</li>
            <li> Seriously this out performed my handheld (Gillette) razor by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It works well wet, cutting slightly closer than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> this shaver beats the Philips 1280cc/42 for speed and closeness of shave HANDS DOWN!.</li>
            <li> On the Braun 790CC some of the nice metal looking parts are silver paint covered plastic and this paint coating is now bubbling up at the back under the cutting head after a couple of years of use and Jet cleaning which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> And I need to do some clean-up job with a Gillette Razor,  - at my sides, where I need a precision job, I am unable to get a clear line, using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the whole rest of the box as a reminder of my stupidity.</li>
            <li> It does not stand up every hair as well as I expected for such an expensive shaver</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely not purchase another one with the same flawed design.</li>
            <li> but I dont think i realized what I was missing out on until this 1280cc came along.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong so far.    </li>
            <li> After a few months of use the razors lights started to flicker and would not turn on.</li>
            <li> Now the razor is completely dead.</li>
            <li> Waste of $200.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday for work and find razor blades chafe my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rated it 3 stars because if I go a few days without shaving then it will not work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been few years since i had bought an electric shaver</li>
            <li> I got tired of nicks when shaving, especially when I shave my head.  </li>
            <li> then I end up with entire patches on my face that are poorly shaved.  </li>
            <li> Two, I have to go over some areas a few times.</li>
            <li> it was dead.  </li>
            <li> Though the delivery was delayed for a few days, I can find the shipping details on line.</li>
            <li> The inconvenience is that when you travel, the charging stand will not fit in the carrying case and you can&#x27;t plug the charging plug into the razor.  </li>
            <li> The one spot that this gives me trouble in is around my adams apple.</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> We ordered it from Amazon.com and received it a few days after placing our order.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go through quite a few handles.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to figure out how to use the auto cleaning box with the cleaning solution...</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard I suggest saving your money and stick with blade razors.</li>
            <li> For me personally, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Yes, the cleaning solution is not cheap, about $4 per month, according to others....  </li>
            <li> I decided to return to an electric I could also use in the shower once we move into our house in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> When shaving after letting it grow out for a few days (maybe a 1/8 inch), it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> With the 1280 I don&#x27;t have to worry about missing one even after three days of not shaving.</li>
            <li> even and also a few swipes around my mustache.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have never found an electric shaver that would work for me.  </li>
            <li> After a few seconds of soaking, it starts.</li>
            <li> I have bought from Amazon for 15 years and do so whenever possible because they truly stand behind their products and merchants that they have authorized sellers sell from their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought from Amazon for 15 years and do so whenever possible because they truly stand behind their products and merchants that they have authorized sellers sell from their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor as I got tired of shaving daily basis.</li>
            <li> The shaver is not cheap...</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, my skin is so much less irritated and no more beard bumps that I would get from my gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> - my Braun would have me AFRAID to go near it on a Monday due to pulling and tugging (I would use a gillette razor on Mondays)...</li>
            <li> As with all other rotary shavers, sideburns and my upper lip are extremely difficult.  </li>
            <li> Product got here quick but am disappointed that there is no way to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> Sideburn trimmer is a little narrow and small but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it for anybody that gets tired of the nicks and tediousness behind razors.</li>
            <li> Includes: Shaver, Jet Clean Base, Charger, Cleaning solution, Travel stand, shaver head cover, and</li>
            <li> I guess if you have thin sideburns, but I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re saving space with a tiny trimmer.    </li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> I have noted that product failure has occurred in other reviews.</li>
            <li> (in my case wet shave is less irritating)  </li>
            <li> After shaving with a Schick Quattro for the past few years, I decided to try electric (again)...    </li>
            <li> I have thick and dark stubble</li>
            <li> Finally got frustrated enough to just throw cleaning system away and just rinse under faucet.  </li>
            <li> I cannot remember a time when either friends or girlfriends did not comment on the fact that it seemed that I was always missing areas or a random facial hair here or there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2)It is unreliable and failed to operate after only a few months&lt;br /&gt;Although this is under Julie&#x27;s name, this reviewer is her husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit annoying getting the fluid into the cleaning chamber as there&#x27;s no marks telling you how far to fill it.</li>
            <li> The poor rating was due to the cardboard box that it came in, it was missing the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> and he can do it any time at all with very little prep or cleanup: just rinses the heads and he&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I have very little need for the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other razor again!!!</li>
            <li> A little expensive but battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It does not charge anymore, thanks to the bad quality of the small charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually go into BUM mode on weekends and dont shave until Monday</li>
            <li> Instead of my usual 7 minute shave with the Schick Quattro, the 1280 took about 5.</li>
            <li> I had 1 small pencil sized cut on my chin</li>
            <li> /&gt;However .... since I couldn&#x27;t, I was at the mercy of Norelco Philips .... who, in my opinion ... stinks, as far as customer response goes ... 7 - 10 BUSINESS days to get your replacement ....</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard growth with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> if not more so than a blade.    </li>
            <li> He was never able to get a close shave and he can with this.</li>
            <li> I found this out when I plugged the wrong one into this unit and all of the lights started flashing at the same time with an alarm beep.</li>
            <li> It is small and difficult to maneuver around the larger 3D head.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t charge past that.</li>
            <li> No more $30.00 every 3 months buying razors.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is just unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaves as close to any razor that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all three times they elevated my concerns to a higher up supervisor who was to call me back before 48 hrs past and still no calls after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I am done with the Bic razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used both blade and electric razors.  </li>
            <li> These are small matters</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t cut a few days growth!</li>
            <li> It needs to be plugged into the cleaning system or a small stand, both of which are included.  </li>
            <li> you know, the ones electric razors usually miss, or like when you haven&#x27;t shaved for 2-3 days ...</li>
            <li> so I resumed using the Spectra and this just reinforced how uncomfortable the larger head on the Senso Touch is.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> This razor is an improvement over my past Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> A small door opens and the razor is lowered into the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now past 30 days</li>
            <li> Cleaning unit failed twice; finally threw it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this razor for the past 6-months</li>
            <li> I have never used the small charging unit not the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> While the head is designed very well in order to get into tight places on the face, the design for opening the heads for cleaning is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have to take points off for the pop-up trimmer, which I found to be narrow, awkward, easily bogged down, and not particularly useful for all of my grooming needs.</li>
            <li> I also tried charging the razor on the charging only base (only time I tried to use it) and it still wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li> You think that reviews this bad can not get worse, right?  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering how long I have until this expensive razor is done...</li>
            <li> the only thing i could comment on it is that the head need to be more fitted with the base as some times it fall from the base thats all</li>
            <li> When I have used it dry, the blades in the head seem to heat and it becomes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> (the rattle definitely was) - I was concerned that if Philips sent me three shavers all with the ink rubbing off within a week - then where is their quality control and what else will go bad down the line.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this feature was not high on my replacement list.    </li>
            <li> The blades are dull.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I see hardly any difference between this and the Gillette Power Fusion.      </li>
            <li> and I will have a hard time using the 8138 again.</li>
            <li> bad that you can&#x27;t plug this shaver directly into a wall socket, you have to bring the charging stand with you.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution isn&#x27;t too badly priced vs. my old Braun that I had to fork out $45 for two solution cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about cutting my head with a traditional razor.      </li>
            <li> charging stand in a suitcase (when travelling) is a negative.  </li>
            <li> Another negative is worrying about ruining the battery by overcharging.  </li>
            <li> ..... there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute.....</li>
            <li> The cost is expensive no doubt, but last I checked a 12 pack of fusions is like $40-$50 and if you don&#x27;t change out those blades it gets worse for irritation.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the only disappointing thing on this unit.</li>
            <li> The recharging on this shaver is confusing and it seems like you can ruin if if you leave it plugged in.   </li>
            <li> It is confusing to leave it in the cleaner when it will recharge it every time, which I do not think the manufacturers prefer (the instructions are contradictory -</li>
            <li> However, I do have a negative comment about the battery charging results.  </li>
            <li> The user manual states that the entire shaver unit: body, battery, motor and cutting heads must be discarded when the battery dies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked, nor used, electric razor trimmers, and have always used an inexpensive Norelco mustache/beard trimmer, which I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately common, disposable razors are not an option for me (they do not shave the beard, they remove the skin and the beard)</li>
            <li> At least now I can hear people.</li>
            <li> My hair is dense (per square inch) and thick.  </li>
            <li> It is the cleaning system that is plain frustrating.  </li>
            <li> and I worry about premature failure.     </li>
            <li> Way too expensive, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to put down within the shower once my shave is completed.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, $4 per month?  </li>
            <li> Seriously guys, it is</li>
            <li> But the thing that&#x27;s really got me frustrated is that the Jet cleaner has completely failed.</li>
            <li> and though it was not good</li>
            <li> The washing/charging base completely flaked out and won&#x27;t lower.</li>
            <li> just plain ole lousy....</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product and there are a couple of annoying areas which Philips really should have thought about.    </li>
            <li> It feels weak and it doesn&#x27;t give me the confidence that I can leave the house with a thorough shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave is the closest I have ever had and the issue with random missed hairs is a problem of the past.</li>
            <li> but since I had used rotary&#x27;s only before decided to stick with them and this razor hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun razor in the past but the charger cord frayed and the cleaning solution needed was ridiculously expensive to buy.  </li>
            <li> I would imagine about 6-7 minutes of continuous used would get uncomfortable, but I am usually done in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried Norelco shavers in the past with very poor results.  </li>
            <li> I used to get very bad rash and bumps with regular razors; Now no more bumps or damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> If you think that the replacement heads are expensive, just imagine what a new cleaning base with all of its electronics and motors would cost.</li>
            <li> Since he shaves in the shower, it&#x27;s also tough on the water bill.</li>
            <li> I have a rather tough beard.</li>
            <li> The floating heads allow you to get to the tough spots on your face.</li>
            <li> Poor engineering.  </li>
            <li> , I just got tired of them and wanted a newer one (I must have had about 8 or 10 years each).</li>
            <li> , I need to do a clean-up job with a Gillette Razor,  - around my neck and chin area, this shaver does a poor job of reaching the touch angles.  </li>
            <li> I recommend ordering the shaver without the jetclean unit as it appears to be unnecessary.</li>
            <li> so I do not use the cleaning base I simply rinse after each use and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating</li>
            <li> After a year of use the blasted thing went completely dead.</li>
            <li> I had replace the broken retaining ring</li>
            <li> I got tired of looking like I needed a transfusion.</li>
            <li> Poor quality control</li>
            <li> I had already replaced the head holder once ($25.00) about two years ago, and I was tired of having to do this for a part that should not have to be replaced, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I switched to a foil razor from a blade about 4 years ago due to persistent and painful ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Norelco had changed the replacements &amp; reviews on the new replacement heads were terrible.</li>
            <li> but I have a thin face with some angles that were difficult to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that you steer clear of this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The RQ12+ blades are terrible, they barely give me a shave.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, not only with the shave, but also because it didn&#x27;t have a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Others have also mentioned that replacement heads are expensive - and while I agree -</li>
            <li> For the past 6 years I have had 3 the Panasonic wet/dry razors and have kept buying the newest versions on hopes of improvement but they had all disappointed me in one way or another.   </li>
            <li> The travel pouch leaves the razor vulnerable to damage and you have to take the stand along to charge the unit.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, ran out of time ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be that the AMAZON seller is selling FAILED LOTS ...</li>
            <li> .that&#x27;s becuase they buy failed lots ... and turn around and sell it to YOU....</li>
            <li> dont know if i used it wrong or is the shaver</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver is basically USELESS.  </li>
            <li> Well, wrong.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is no longer a tedious hassel.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an expensive gadget, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Silly because if I was travelling for extended time I would have to pack both cords which look identical.</li>
            <li> FAIL by Philips.     </li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL WITH ELECTRIC SHAVERS</li>
            <li> DESIGN MAKES IT UNCOMFORTABLE TO SHAVE, MY HAND HURTS SOMETIMES FROM HOLDING IT FOR 5 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Comfort - 5   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 3   Noise - 2   Cleaning System - 5  Norelco</li>
            <li> Comfort - 4   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 5   Noise - 4   Cleaning System - 3  </li>
            <li> For the difficult spots (under the nose, under the chin, etc.)</li>
            <li> My husband figured it was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Users are unlikely to be waiting around for the cleaning process to finish so that they are there to take the shaver out of the cradle or unplug the cradle from the wall.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but is still cheaper than buying blades each week.</li>
            <li> After buying an expensive Braun shaver, with the expensive cleaning cartridge, I was leery on spending a lot of money for the 1280X/42.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement heads are expensive though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the battery for this model (1280X/42) can NOT be replaced.  </li>
            <li> After about a month the razor started irritating my neck just as bad, then started to get WORSE from then on.</li>
            <li> and they are expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> He is legally blind....</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re sorry, but now I evaluate the product.</li>
            <li> you set the wrong goods?</li>
            <li> Yes it is a bit expensive but have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this electric shaver to all,you cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are preposterously expensive.</li>
            <li> It just gyrates and makes weird noises.</li>
            <li> I hope that this has not been too long and boring.</li>
            <li> I hope that this has not been too long and boring.</li>
            <li> Aside from that little bump, I can’t wait to take it for a spin (terrible pun</li>
            <li> If you bought a Norelco 1050 or any Arctec 2d razor are unhappy with the lousey shave[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> In summary: what a disappointment this shaver has been.  </li>
            <li> The cutting heads started to fall apart after 6 months.</li>
            <li> It is awkward and made of plastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I was getting this as Christmas Gift for myself and we are living in the Motorhome during the snowy cold part of the season in Colorado</li>
            <li> In spite of this disappointing battery life, I will probably buy another Norelco 1280/42 or equivalent when this one expires.</li>
            <li> The shaver has no problem cutting my beard even after 2-3 days of growth.</li>
            <li> Also, the replacement heads are really expensive!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this thing works!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> While this razor is VERY expensive, I do not regret the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> [very expensive]</li>
            <li> Here comes the worst: the ridiculous design for charging: If you travel, you will have to carry the stand with you in order to charge this thing, and the stand is quite flimsy/bulky.</li>
            <li> I CAN give it a bad review, which is what I&#x27;m going to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> The BAD:  </li>
            <li> But because I wanted an electric razor really bad</li>
            <li> My bad, and I re-sent the proof-of-purchase as an attachment.</li>
            <li> Their customer service isn&#x27;t bad: it&#x27;s non-existent.</li>
            <li> Now the UGLY:  </li>
            <li> I also had issues with the fact that if I missed a couple of days shaving then I was always in for a painful hair pulling experience which I did not relish at all.</li>

            <li> :  (1)  Waterproof.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, still have a lot of irritation, shaving takes longer time.</li>
            <li> this electric razor is: (a)</li>
            <li> The battery died after a year :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reasons are:  (1)</li>
            <li> When I put the razor into the charging base ...</li>
            <li> to me their warranty is worthless.  </li>
            <li> and I go around rubbing my face all day amazed at the shave and probably looking like an idiot.  </li>
            <li> The charging / cleaning base seems way over-engineered for what its purpose is.</li>
            <li> Also you can&#x27;t charge the shaver without the cleaning base, a problem if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People have said don&#x27;t bother with this model and get the one without the cleaning base, I disagree.  </li>
            <li> Always hated rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed in the gift wrapping that it came in.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend, but was very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed considering the price.</li>
            <li> I tried the RQ-12+ heads and they were terrible.  </li>
            <li> I get a shave that would rival anything I could get from a manual razor AND no nicks, cuts or bloody shirts!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I switched to a foil razor from a blade about 4 years ago due to persistent and painful ingrown hairs.  Additionally my hair is thick and grows rather quickly so regular blade shaving had to be eliminated.  After much research at that time, I went for a Braun Series 7 and was fairly loyal to it until recently.  My loyalty to the foil razor even persisted through the last couple years of loathing shaving due to irritation and areas that were not always shaved properly i.e. neck and jaw line.  I tried pre-shave gels and creams before finally doing research for a new shaver.  Various site rankings and products reviewed led me to considering the Norelco 3D line and long story short, I made the purchase with moderate expectations despite some of the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it last night initially, expecting the first time to be a bit uncomfortable, as the skin and hair will typically take 3 weeks to adapt to a new method of shaving.  However, the shave was absolutely amazing.  From the relatively quiet noise to the fact that hairs were not being spit out all over my counter, were already a huge improvement over the Series 7.  However the shave itself was amazingly proficient and comfortable.  It was as if the razor molded to every contour and edge of my jaw line; the upper lip area (which typically was the most uncomfortable spot to shave) was a breeze and just took one pass as opposed to 2 or 3.  The neck did feel slightly irritated, but I believe that&#x27;s because my hair was actually shaved and trimmed for the first time as I usually had to resort to a blade to get all the missed areas with the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been on the fence; are prone to ingrown hairs; or have frequent irritation after shaving with a foil or blade, I highly recommend this product.  I did choose the version with the Jet Clean system mainly to do \\&quot;a maintenance clean\\&quot; about every 3 weeks or so as I plan to rinse and manually clean the majority of the time.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for nearly 40 years.  I thought I would upgrade my old shaver rather than purchase another set of cutters.  There was also a $50 Phillips rebate which did not hurt.  I did not think the wet/dry aspect would be a big deal but I was pleasantly surprised!  I had several days off (and did not shave) when I decided to try the new razor with shaving cream.  It was amazingly close and smooth ... like when using a safety razor with a new cartridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions warn that it may take a short time for your face to adjust to the razor.  Even though I routinely used a Norelco razor, the first use of this model did indeed cause some minor razor burn on my neck.  Just the first time ... and not since then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the cleaning apparatus that comes with it but I really don&#x27;t know if it helps or not.  It is an easy way to recharge the battery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since all my electric razor experience has been with Norelco, I can&#x27;t honestly compare this model with any other brand but it is, beyond any shadow of doubt, the best Norelco razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Wife just purchased for me. I have always used either a Mach 3, Fushion or the New Hydro disposables. Awesome product! I&#x27;m on day 3 of using it and I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how smooth and close the shave was. I shave everyday and my face has yet to even be slightly irritated. Jet Clean system is great also. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product as a whole is that there is no automatic shut off when its done charging. So I have to let it charge up all the way and once it&#x27;s done I have to remove it from the charger so as not to damage the battery. Seeing as though I shave at 3:45am in the morning after my shower and then I&#x27;m dressed and on my way to work, I really don&#x27;t have the time to wait for that. Would&#x27;ve thought that such a quality product would have that feature built in, but that is very minor. If you are looking for a high quality shaver, look no further.</li>
            <li> I always used gillette razors and about 1.5 years ago decided that electric was the way to go for me...for convenience sake.  I started out with a Braun that also had the cleaning system attachment.  The Braun worked great and lasted me for a long time...but I dont think i realized what I was missing out on until this 1280cc came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips unit is FAR FAR superior to the Braun product - for me...your experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pay a bit more and get the jet clean system because its another added convenience for me and one less thing I have to worry about.  Yes, you can clean the shaver under warm water and add mineral oil once in while...but the jet clean solution has it there and its just a more convenient/elegant way to keep the unit clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips recommends that you use the shaver for 21 days so it can adjust to your face and your face can adjust to it...however, in my experience it only took 2 days - probably because I have been on an electric shaver for a long time.  After using it for multiple days now I am happier than I anticipated I would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually go into BUM mode on weekends and dont shave until Monday - my Braun would have me AFRAID to go near it on a Monday due to pulling and tugging (I would use a gillette razor on Mondays)...with the 1280cc I fear nothing and actually enjoy shaving DAILY....  The shave is comfortable, takes minutes, and is very close....no irritation, tugs, pulls, and or any other hinderances.  LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: As others have said before - shaving your moustache area is a bit of a challenge with this...but once you get the hang of it, the shaving is fine and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried shaving with a foam or gel - wet shaving...I do not anticipate trying it.  For me it is best to be able to wake up and use the shaver dry..no wetting the face or using gel....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box Includes: Shaver, Jet Clean Base, Charger, Cleaning solution, Travel stand, shaver head cover, and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I have come across as of yet....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have also mentioned that replacement heads are expensive - and while I agree - I dont think it causes alarm since you will not be replacing them too often if the shaver is kept clean and lubricated regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT Product, 5 stars+ for me....Pros: Very Very quiet, no razor burn/irritation, ver close and comfortable shave, and side burn trimmer.    Cons: None that I have come across as of yet....    Others have also mentioned that replacement heads are expensive - and while I agree - I dont think it causes alarm since you will not be replacing them too often if the shaver is kept clean and lubricated regularly.    GREAT Product, 5 stars+ for me....</li>
            <li> I have used both Norelco and Braun shavers in the past, and have liked certain aspects of both.  In general, with the Braun series 5, I loved the cleaning process.  From my older Norelco, I did love the shave itself and how fast you could get things done with the triple head--using the Braun takes much longer for me and never was quite as close of a shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this razor!  It had the Norelco shave and now with the cleaning system!  I was very intrigued... but initially was put off by the high price.  Well, since then, Amazon has knocked off $100 and there is a $50 rebate!  I pulled trigger last week and used it yesterday and today.  I can report that I am positively delighted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful shaving experience--the closest of any I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;-Quick shaving given the 3 heads and excellent form-fitting movement&lt;br /&gt;-Easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful \\&quot;jet clean\\&quot; system that seems more economical and efficient than the Braun one (which uses cartridges); this one uses fluid&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing fit and finish&lt;br /&gt;-Reasonable price (with the $100 off and additional $50 discount)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;-Price (originally, before discounts)&lt;br /&gt;-The head is a little bulky compared to the body--it&#x27;s not quite as compact for travel as the Braun and makes me worry that it could get broken or damaged at the neck stalk&lt;br /&gt;-I kind of wish that you could store it in the cleaning system base without having to unplug it each time (well, that&#x27;s what they recommend at least)&lt;br /&gt;-That&#x27;s pretty much all I can think of beyond the usual things intrinsic to an electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is the best electric razor I have ever used or imagined.  I am deeply impressed.  I love the cleaning system since my old Norelco got a \\&quot;funky\\&quot; smell to it after awhile and I was never quite sure how best to clean it (I washed it with hot water every day and let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a month now and the performance is flawless.  I use it only as a dry shaver and the results are the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Design, grip, gentle sound are the first postive impressions.  Perfect shave that followed completed my acquisition&#x27;s satisfaction  Highly recommended to electric shavers and whoever considers changing brand or switch from wet- to electric shaving.</li>
            <li> Honestly when i received the shaver, i was glad with all the features and options it has, and when i tried it was shaving well, and i am still using it, and i am satisfied from the way it shaves. however, the problem is that i tried to use the trimmer of it, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work, and i can&#x27;t return it, as i live outside US and bought it through Shop&amp;Ship account.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong so far.    An adaptor for use oversea would have been included given the price of this shaver, making use more quick than the need to find first an avalaible one..    Anyway, its fine now.</li>
            <li> The poor rating was due to the cardboard box that it came in, it was missing the bottom of the container. No idea what kept it there during shipping. It had a note on it, that said that it was damaged before it came to the carrier. The post office told me that if I refused to accept, it might be 2 months before I receive a replacement. What can a man do?   The Electric Shaver is no better than my simple Braun Electric Shaver that I bought 20 years ago for 10% of the cost of this one. It can not be fixed, parts are no longer made. With this shaver I still have trouble with whiskers that are an eight of an inch or so ,long. I have to go over and over each way to cut them. Shaving in wet with foam does not appeal to me, so no comment for that.     The ESTO man.[[ASIN:B003V3476G Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Products for years and always been pleased with them. I have to say that they have out done themselves with this 1280XCC electric razor. It is simply \\&quot;FANTASTIC\\&quot; and I would rate it a 5 star plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that Amazon delivered the product a day earlier that anticipated. GREAT SERVICE!!</li>
            <li> After shaving with a Schick Quattro for the past few years, I decided to try electric (again)...    I choose the Phillips 1280CC based on reviews I read here on Amazon...    The first two (2) shaves withe the 1280 were dry shaves.  Not perfect, but surprisingly good.    My third shave was wet (shaving gel), and I must say, that the shave was just as good as the Schick Quattro.  Instead of my usual 7 minute shave with the Schick Quattro, the 1280 took about 5.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. HIGHLY recommend it for anybody that gets tired of the nicks and tediousness behind razors. Probably the best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> This Norelco was a 53rd birthday present, and after owning several electric shavers from Norelco generations in my time I am surprised that they could yet make improvements. This shaves noticeably closer and with more comfort than I expected. The jet clean system is very well thought out and from what I&#x27;ve seen gives the heads a thorough washing on even the econo mode. Highly recommended, especially as a gift.</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant spending so much for a razor, but let me tell you it is very much \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;. I had a lesser norelco model, which was good, would some irritation every now and then,  but this one blows it away no comparision. The jet clean system is very nice, and easy to use. I would highly reccomend this model. And definteley worth the money.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Norelco Philips Sensotouch 3D 1280x.  I bought this razor from Costco in Asia.  It includes the shaver, travel bag, one small (tiny) brush, a triangular recharge stand, the cutter cover, and a plug.  All this in an oversized box.  Looks like you&#x27;re getting alot, but it&#x27;s all boxed space.  Been using this for 3 weeks now.  I have to say, this shaver is over-rated.  I&#x27;ve read hundreds of reviews for shavers before I decided on this one.  And it&#x27;s only because I saw it in Costco.  The shaver sound is very much quieter.  But I think that&#x27;s because the shaver is weaker and slower than the Braun.  I shaver is nice to hold, but that can be said for the Braun.  The digital &#x27;time left&#x27; viewer is nice, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s necessary for a good shave.  The shave, to get the point, does not cut as well as the Braun.  I find myself shaving for longer periods because I don&#x27;t feel it has gotten all the hairs on my chin and neck.  It feels weak and it doesn&#x27;t give me the confidence that I can leave the house with a thorough shave.  In fact, to me, the shave feels girly.  Additional comments:  (1)  True, you cannot charge directly from the chord. You MUST have the triangular stand to charge.  I travel often and this is not conevenient.  (2)  You must unplug the stand after use or else the stand will have a shorter life span.  It&#x27;s a hassle to plug in and then plug out.  Poor engineering.  (3)  The brush is tiny.  Sure, it&#x27;s nice to use on the blades, but chances are it&#x27;ll get lost before 30 days.  (4)  Small, if not tiny, trimmer.  I guess if you have thin sideburns, but I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re saving space with a tiny trimmer.    Pros:  (1)  Waterproof.  Can use in the shower.  (2)  Wash with water.  Sure this can save money in not buying cleaners and disinfectants.  But I&#x27;d rather use alcohol to clean my blades since it&#x27;s got a lot of bacteria after so many uses.  (3)  Cheaper than a Braun.  But in retrospect, I may want to shell out an additional $100-200 for a Braun.  I&#x27;m sure many people will say it&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s remorse, but after much research, I thought I was getting a good shaver.  But after use for 3 weeks, I think I got a mediocre product which I&#x27;ll use, but after getting my money&#x27;s worth, be looking forward to buying another shaver.</li>
            <li> Ive been using cordless razors since 1976 when I was in the US Navy. Didn&#x27;t want to fight for a sink &amp; mirror every morning so I went to the electric razors...Norelco! All I had to do was set up on the side of my rack &amp; shave! I&#x27;ve had several over the years...getting ~10yrs on each one. Eventually the batteries give out &amp; die... Won&#x27;t Charge any more. This is without a doubt the best one I&#x27;ve ever had when it comes to a fast &amp; very close shave. Your face doesn&#x27;t feel raw or funny when you finish. Putting on aftershave doesn&#x27;t make you scream like a banshee.   I&#x27;ve tried other type, styles &amp; brands, but nothing beats the 3 floating blades Norelco electric shavers &amp; this is the best I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> This razor not only gives me a close shave, but also is very easy to maintain.  I only use the auto-clean part of it once a week and that seems to be sufficient.  Kudos to Phillips for the best electric razor on the market and thanks to Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with electric razors for about 20 years, including razors from Braun , Remmington and Panasonic. I have favored the wet/dry razors since they came out because I can use them in the shower and save time. For the past 6 years I have had 3 the Panasonic wet/dry razors and have kept buying the newest versions on hopes of improvement but they had all disappointed me in one way or another.   When I saw this Norelco 1280X/42 Senso Touch 3d, I thought I would give it a shot. I spent a little more and got the top of the line because even at $229 it is still less than what I had spent in the past. This is by far, THE BEST wet/dry electric razor I have EVER owned!   The razor is quiet, smooth, contours my face well and even gives me a good shave on my neck, which was always a place I would have to use an old fashion razor to get rid of the stubble before. I no longer need to go over my face with a razor after shaving in the shower.   If you are buying this for yourself, spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it. If you are giving it as a gift, the guy you give this to will love it! These sell in stores for $350 but Amazon has much better prices on it. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> This is one nice shaver and sideburn trimmer better than any ever used. Just pop head off and turn on trimmer. very nice</li>
            <li> As a Black male it didn&#x27;t matter what style razor or what brand of shaving/after shave gel I used I would still get bumps. For Christmas 2011, I decided to give the new wet/dry norelco electric shaver a try sort of a Christmas present to myself and with the $30 off I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m really glad I did, although it&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor it is a closer shave than clippers and my bumps are gone! Not all of my bumps were due to ingrown hairs I have sensitive skin as well especially around the neck area.</li>
            <li> this is the best razor that i have ever had.the best money that i have ever spent.what else can i say it GREAT</li>
            <li> After a few months of use the razors lights started to flicker and would not turn on. Now the razor is completely dead. Does not work at all. Waste of $200.</li>
            <li> I buy is 1280X, received is 1250X</li>
            <li> Thank You Phillips Norelco.  I have had many electric razors over the years and many blade razors and by far the SensoTouch 3D is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  My last razor, Braun, gave me a close shave and I thought I loved it.  I accidentally broke it and wondered if there was yet a better razor; how lucky I was to break it.  The Braun would actually cut my skin.  People thought I used a blade as often as I got cut.  My 3D is not only the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten but it the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and it&#x27;s quiet (my wife loves that).  If you have had a hard time getting a comfortable close shave, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these \\&quot;latest\\&quot; Philips electric razor (same model without the ) to replace the current one (also Philips brand) which is 7 years old.    Here is my personal opinion: Overall, I regret purchasing it.    Pros:   (1) shaves slightly better  (2) good looking  (3) lots of digital display which looks cool    Cons:  (1) bulky, as compared with old models (although slightly powerful which really does not make too much difference to me personally)  (2) pouch is a joke. It barely holds the shavor. You have to allocate other space for the charger etc when you travel  (3) Here comes the worst: the ridiculous design for charging: If you travel, you will have to carry the stand with you in order to charge this thing, and the stand is quite flimsy/bulky. You will NOT be able to charge the shavor wihout the stand. The manual also says: \\&quot;always unplug the charging stand from the electrical outlet immediately after use, except for recharging\\&quot;, then why I need this stand in the first place? just to hold it upright for a good looking?    The one I have is going back to where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li> If you bought a Norelco 1050 or any Arctec 2d razor are unhappy with the lousey shave[[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] it gives, rathrer than buy a new unit (the 1280 [[ASIN:B003V3476G Philips Norelco 1280cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]is GREAT), just buy the new RQ12 heads [[ASIN:B003V37Z6U Philips Norelco Rq12 Replacement Heads for SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Silver]] instead of a RQ10 [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit]]replacement (pricey but less than a new razor). The RQ12 fits the Arctec 2d unit. On the 1050, it even fits tightly into the portable travel recharging case.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and probably the best I&#x27;ve had, but I am giving up on trying to find an electric razor that gives a shave as close as the traditional razor.  I use the Gillette Sensor and nothing even comes close to it.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t cut, this doesn&#x27;t work. junk…</li>
            <li> After much researching I let my husband choose which shaver he would like. He chose the1280CC and after more than a month he is very pleased with its overall performance. He has never used a shaver that gave  as close a shave with no skin irritation. (His skin is as smooth as a babys!) He also likes the automatic cleaning device that comes with this model. Overall it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
            <li> This is a much improved shaver over the Norelco Arcitec which did a great job but had a less than effective pop-up sideburn trimmer. The increased number of cutting heads not only provide a closer shave, but greatly decrease required shaving time! An added plus over the Arcitec is that the sideburn trimmer actually works quite well and is very useful! I highly recommend the Jet Clean System which works extremely well in keeping the shaver blades clean and at peak efficiency. The SensoTouch 3d is an excellent shaver, but I would prefer to have a hard traveling case for maximum protection of the shaver. Overall.....great choice!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have strayed from my linear foil shaver (Braun - currently a Series 7) for forays in to other ways of shaving.  I&#x27;ve tried every razor Gillette has put out, an old-fashion double edge razor, and several Phillips Norelco rotary shavers.  I always seem to end up going back to Braun as it has always worked best for me, despite having very sensitive skin.    When the Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 3d (1280cc) showed up last week, it had been about 4 days since my last shave (which means about 4.5mm hairs - or ~3/16in).  I decided to shave half my face wet and half my face dry.  I started with circular motions on one cheek with zero pressure, per the instructions, and was shocked at how easily this shaver cut the hair - not a single tug or the tiniest bit of irritation, although it takes about 10 circular passes over every inch to get all of the hair.  I continued on to my neck.  Here I noticed a bit of irritation, but it was much less than my Braun.  I wet and lathered up the other half of my face and gave the SensoTouch 3d a try wet.  In my opinion, the wet shave was much more irritating to my skin and didn&#x27;t get any closer than the dry shave.    As with all other rotary shavers, sideburns and my upper lip are extremely difficult.  For sideburns, this shaver has a pop-out cutter that does a good job - but it still leaves too much stubble and the round rotary head can&#x27;t get close enough... making a clean line difficult.    Since my initial experience, I&#x27;ve shaved two more times (both dry).  The shaver is doing great on my cheeks, but is still irritating my neck.    I&#x27;ve decided to give Phillips the 21 days they claim it takes to adjust to the razor, so I will update my review when I have made a final decision.    UPDATE: After giving this razor more than the recommended time, I&#x27;ve given up on it.  The razor worked great on my cheeks, but was horrible for my neck.  I sent it back to Philips for a refund, but they magically \\&quot;lost it\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m still waiting on my refund.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco&#x27;s for years but 4 years ago tried the Braun 7 Series.  It never shaved as close as my Norelco&#x27;s but I was reluctant to try the Arcitec because of the mixed reviews.  The 1280cc was on sale at Kohls so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  To begin with it&#x27;s much quieter than the Braun 7. Both the razor itself and the cleaning system are much quieter.  Additionally with the Norelco you add solution from a bottle to the cleaning chamber which is significantly cheaper than using the prefilled cartridges from Braun.  My shave is much closer than I had with the Braun and as a result I&#x27;m able to shave faster.  I also don&#x27;t have to go over areas of my face to get as close a shave as many times as I had to with the Braun. Overall I think this is a great razor. Hopefully it will last through the years but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> The Smoothest shave I have evere had. in the past the electric shavers I have used have been SoSo- this on the other hand was so smooth i did not even realize i was shaving. No tug No burn no scraping feeling, just a smooth as ice feel on skin &amp; smae as moving the shaver on my face - charging &amp; stowage is also 200% better then in past shavers- I set the quick charger up first (not Jet Clean) it was engineered much better than alot of other bathroom items. Suction cups on bottom prevent slide. But don&#x27;t prevent removel. No Juggling around with cords.Stright forward &amp; Simple. Once again One of the Best Shaves Ever</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried dual razor blades, triple razor blades, five razor blades, Braun electric razors and Panasonic razors. I&#x27;ve even grown a beard to avoid the whole shaving issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shave I&#x27;ve had was with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco ROCKS! It shaves close, quietly and quickly... without foam and cleaning up or risk of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it if you have the bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend using Gillette After Shave Gel (ironically) for the first few weeks. It will help your skin adapt.</li>
            <li> I have been using this electric shaver for about 1 week now and this shaver is the best. It is queit and it cuts all hairs on my face. It doesnt leave alot of shaving bumps like the other electric shavers I have tried. The price is alittle high but it is worth every penny. If you have any doubts about this electric shaver. Dont. Buy it and you will be happy with it. So far I love it and look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> I orderd this product for my boyfriend for his bday. It appears to be a great product but I was very disappointed in the gift wrapping that it came in. When you spend money for it to be wrapped, I woul expect it to atleast be a neat wrapping job.</li>
            <li> The easiest razor to use and it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;From rough to lite beards it will amaze you as it did me. The cleaning feature makes it like new after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Fantastic product by Phillips. I can&#x27;t believe for years I have put my face through the turmoil of a razor blade compared to the electric razor of this calibre. My ski thanks you and I am very happy. I love this product. 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews for this product on Amazon, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase it. Overall I am pleased, but the shave quality is not near what I was expecting for the product.  I must admit that my expectations may have been a bit too high for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently switch off between using The Braun 7 series razor and the Gillette Fusion.  The majority of this review will be a comparison of the Norelco and the Braun seeing as that is what I am most familiar with. Of the two razors I used prior to, and after getting the Norelco, the Fusion by far is the closest shave.  One reviewer noted that the Norelco 1280X has a better shave than the Fusion.  Not even close!  The Braun has a little bit closer shave on specific areas than the Norelco, but overall the better shave between the electric&#x27;s was with the 1280X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the smoother parts of your face (like the cheeks and under your nose on the upper lip) is where the Braun does best. On your chin and especailly the neck area the Norelco is far better.  The Norelco gives you a more uniform shave on all parts of your face. The razor itself is easier to hold and use, and is much lighter and quieter than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned the razor has to be charged in either the stand or the cleaning unit.  I am ok with that seeing as I rarely used the charging cord with my Braun unless I was on vacation.  The Norelco&#x27;s charge lasts a lot longer so no big deal when I&#x27;m on vacation now.  What I do have a problem with is the fact that the razor has to be removed from the charging unit as soon as the charge is complete.  It cannot remain in the charging stand or cleaning unit when fully charged or it will damage the battery. In my opinion the poorest design of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit is ok, nothing special.  I think that Braun&#x27;s design is much better in this aspect.  Even though the Braun refill cartridges are more expensive than the Norelco&#x27;s, I like the fact that it is much neater and eaiser to use.  When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.  Also the Braun&#x27;s cleaning unit heat dries the razor.  The Norelco just air dries in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product. I will continue to use it and prefer it to the Braun.h neater and eaiser to use.  When the cartridge is no longer useable you just cap it and throw it away, No having to clean the unit and possibly spilling cleaning solution when it is time to replenish the supply with the Norelco.

            <li> Not as close shave as it says. Over prioed for the quality job it is supposed to do. Panasonic better?</li>
            <li> As the title says, this was my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  The reason I bought this was razor was to start shaving my head, and I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about cutting my head with a traditional razor.      I think this is a great product, it takes me about 8 minutes to shave my entire head, and face with this.  Each head move individually, and it only takes a couple passes to get a clean shave.  After shaving each head opens up for easy cleaning, after each use, you just give a quick rinse before putting the in the jet clean station.  The jet clean system is nice, seems to really keep the shaver clean.    At this point I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about a month and have no complaints.  Each bottle of jet clean lasts about a month, so I would imagine that can get kind of pricey, but BB&amp;B has good price on it.</li>
            <li> Good product, as well as the Jet Clean. These devices make our lives easier. If you can not waste time and need to get presentable for work, this is the best option. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco Spectra 8894XL after my dog attacked it and broke it. I like the display and the jet clean system works great.</li>
            <li> Previously used Panasonic shaver, decided to change it for something with less skin irritation. A bit disappointed, still have a lot of irritation, shaving takes longer time. However love the look and ergonomics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Norelco user.  I&#x27;m ugrading from a Norelco Sectra 8865XL.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is good.  The shaver is quieter and has a nice shape.  I really like the display that indicates the number of shaving minutes remaining.  I agree with other reviewers about not needing the Jet Clean System (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet -- washing the heads with hot water seems quite adequate).  I also agree that having to pack the (fragile?) charging stand in a suitcase (when travelling) is a negative.  Another negative is worrying about ruining the battery by overcharging.  Today I tried my first attempt at trying to address this problem -- [[ASIN:B002KKCVZK Simple Touch C30002 Auto Shut-Off Safety Outlet, Single Setting]].  I paid $14.99 without shipping charges).  I allowed the shaver battery to run down until it was at 00 minutes.  I then charged it (the razors second or third charge) using the Simple Touch C30002 one-hour countdown timer.  I disconnected the charging stand when I the display said \\&quot;60 minutes\\&quot; -- after about 40-45 minutes.  The Countdown timer still had another 15-20 minutes before it shut off.  I&#x27;m now looking for a variable count-down timer.  I&#x27;m interested in not having to prematurely replace the shaver&#x27;s battery because I&#x27;m not always paying close attention when I charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I went to Lowe&#x27;s and purchased a Utilitech timer #0155671.  I just programmed the countdown mode (CTD) for the first time.  I&#x27;m optimistic that this will be able to prevent ruining the shaver&#x27;s battery by overcharging.</li>
            <li> Just received my shaver from Amazon this evening and had my first (dry) shave with the new shaver. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was shaving as perfectly and deep without my ever using any pressure whatsoever. It glided over my face, neck and chin and gave me the closest shave I have ever received, including shaves from blades. I had been using the top of the line Braun shavers for the last six or seven years. The technological difference is analogous to an old rotary phone to an iPhone. This is without a doubt the best shaver made - period!</li>
            <li> The washing/charging base completely flaked out and won&#x27;t lower. It shorts out when plugged in and has to be rebooted to come back on. I haven&#x27;t been able to wash anything with it for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a Vine of this piece of junk that went viral and the Norelco contracted social media company got back to me on Twitter. Said they would look into it. Asked for my serial number and then never got back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and non-irritating, but even after a full cleaning cycle, the removed hair pieces fall out of the razor heads while I shave.  This makes a mess on the counter.  Also, if you travel much at all, you won&#x27;t like this razor.  The travel pouch leaves the razor vulnerable to damage and you have to take the stand along to charge the unit.  This is extra stuff to pack.  I have been a Norelco fan over the years, but this razor I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have used several electric shavers in the past and always experienced irritation on my neck from the shaver. No matter how long I used these shavers (allowing for the adjustment) my neck would be irritated and burned after the shave. I can truly say that after using this shaver just a couple of times, I noticed the irritation became less and less noticeable. Now after using this shaver for over a month I have no irritation after I shave. I have used this shaver dry, wet and with shaving gel. I get the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric shaver. I was kinda hesitant about spending $349.99 for an electric shaver but now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch 3d gives me the best shaves I have ever had!!  My beard is fine and skin fair and sensitive.  Have used different kinds of shavers, blade systems, soaps, creams, etc. cuts or razor burns were frequent.  My beard tends to lay down under razors easily, so when using an electric, have to go over the same places many times and press hard.  Not so with the 3d.  Light touch and few strokes - close shave.  Same results with one day or three day growth.  Easy to clean with water and the Jet Clean System works as advertised.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a while, but the battery performance dropped off after about 6 months.  (It would show about 60 minutes when fully charged, and now only shows 30 minutes straight off the charger.)  Now I&#x27;m wondering how long I have until this expensive razor is done...</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for almost a year now. I have to shave everyday for work and find razor blades chafe my skin.  Pros- More gentle than a razor blade  - Convenient   - Works better if you shave every day  Con- Sometimes does not provide a complete shave especially with hair longer than stubble.  I&#x27;ve rated it 3 stars because if I go a few days without shaving then it will not work as well. Also, I sometimes need to use a razor in-between to get rid of stubborn hair. If I could use just this shaver everyday (or every few days), without needing a razor blade, then it would be 5 star worthy.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been using Norelco for more years then I can remember and this is the third one and the last two did not fail, I just got tired of them and wanted a newer one (I must have had about 8 or 10 years each). As the last two times, this one shaves even better and closer. I also really like the self cleaning - just plop it in after im done, hit a button and leave. It is shinny clean next time I use it. Is it really worth that much - probably not, but it is a nice shaver and I am sure it will last me another 8 years at least.</li>
            <li> I will admit my bias.  I have  almost exclusively  used Norelco electric shavers for over 40 years.  The choice of an electric shaver is highly subjective.  I have used several others over the years, and I have on occasion used a blade and shaving  cream.  My skin is highly sensitive, and I find myself returning to Norelco products again and again.  This fall when my family asked me what I wanted for Christmas, my choice was easy.  I had done my due dilligence , and I knew that at the head of  my wish list was  the top of the line Norelco and the Jet Clean system.  I warned my family  that it is expensive and told them that it would be fine to get me something else.  (Not another shaver--myy current Norelco, about ten years old--works just fine! )  I have used my new Norelco for just a few days now, and I have to say it is the best shaver I have ever owned.  The claims of closeness are justified in my opinion.  The toughest part for me has been navigating the Philips web page for registration and a customer service question I needed answered.  I am always surprised at how many large corporations do not have user friendly  user interfaces on their websites.  I could not figure out an indicator light on the Jet Clean system.  A phone call led me to a pleasant woman named Amy, who solved my problem easily and politely. I have not yet indulged in a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave, even one in the shower.  I have no doubt that will be a great experience as well.  For right now, I am thoroughly enjoying the best shaves of my life.  Yes, it is a lot of money for a shaver.  It certainly has all the bells and whistles anyone could ever want.  I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy the Jet Clean system.  I like the idea of having a \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; shaver each morning. It is  my opinion,  that once again, Philips  Norelco lives up its well deserved reputation for excellence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco products since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 39 now. I think that they&#x27;re pretty good overall, but generally break after 4-6 years of use. I&#x27;m pretty pumped about this shaver -- it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had. It shaves very, very close -- much more than any previous Norelco that I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s easy to use, has a nice grip and shape and is easy to clean. I really, really like this shaver. I&#x27;m going to buy another one for travel as it&#x27;s so good. I was hesitant about the price but now I&#x27;m very glad I bought it -- well worth the money! Definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> Had it for a week now.  Best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned!  Very smooth &amp; quick to get the job done.  Almost look forward to shaving (did I really type that!)</li>
            <li> Shaver itself is fine.  It is the cleaning system that is plain frustrating.  Have used for over a year, received as XMAS gift for 2013 and recently replaced the head.  Cleaning system only notifies that it must be changed after you start a cycle-it then refuses to clean and shaver is wet from solution.  Taking it apart, cleaning and refilling is a hit and miss job.  50% of time it &amp;#34;dips&amp;#34; again and then stops, showing again the &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; icon.  Finally got frustrated enough to just throw cleaning system away and just rinse under faucet.  Replacement head is different than original in that blades are not anchored to the head; they just come off when you brush shaver out or clean under faucet.  Shaver itself is quiet and does a good job.  When I need to replace the head, I will go back to Panasonic and the nice and simple cartridge system they use. Had a Panasonic 3 blade for about 6 years before it finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Great electric Shaver. This shaver is very easy on your face. I love it. Better than my Braun, but it also 6 years newer.  The Senso Touch 3d take care of all your wiskers.  Great for every day, I also let my beard grow for 4 days, to see how it would peform on the longer hairs. This shave picks up the long hairs on your neck, under you chin and on the side of your face.  Most electric shavers I have owned will not get the long hairs, and this 3d gets them on the first pass.   Great shaver.    The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it you are not suppose to leave the Jet Clean system plug in the electric outlet.  When I asked why on a chat, they just told me not to leave it plug in.  Not sure if I would pay the 100.00 more for the Jet Clean system.  The Shaver however is worth every penny, and if you don&#x27;t want the top of the line, buy the Senso Touch 3d lowest cost model. I sure it will work just a well as the 1280/42 with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> Hi,  the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black\\&quot; is the first electric shaver y have ever used and it´s really nice!  The first times i suffered a little \\&quot;like friction burn\\&quot; in the low part of the neck (where there is not hairs, but it started to disappear with the continue use ant the skin got habituated.  makes a nice shave, very close, even with the most difficult hairs.  Very nice choice!!!</li>
            <li> I got this at a great discount to begin with ($206) originally $349. Received this product 2 days after ordering in good packaging&#x3D;no damage. I really didn&#x27;t think this shaver would give me a great shave. Right out of the box I read the directions (took like 10 minutes); really just to get familiar with the item. At this point I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about 4 days and had a pretty good amount of hair on my face, not just your short 5:00 clock shadow. I charged the shaver for a couple hours and then shaved dry and was amazed. In 12 minutes my face was clear no more hair right down to the skin. I had 1 small pencil sized cut on my chin that&#x27;s it. My neck was even clear. Seriously this out performed my handheld (Gillette) razor by a long shot. They say the best results come after 3 weeks of daily use. This was only the first day!   I like how the shaver is easy to hold while shaving and how it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean with hot water. I have yet to use the jet cleaning system but I plan on using it probably after 3-4 uses or so just to get my money&#x27;s worth of the solution. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s fine.  To those who doubt this razor, don&#x27;t! I&#x27;m sure individual results vary depending on circumstances of the person but honestly I&#x27;ve used several other electric razors and they didn&#x27;t compare. This is one item that you get what you pay for. Thanks to Philips and Amazon.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using Norelco after I used Braun for almost one year. I noticed how quite is Norelco !I used different Norelco over  20 years. This one toped them all.</li>
            <li> Bought this about three months ago12/3/11). Works like to should and is quieter than the former&lt;br /&gt;Norelco it replaced. Sideburn trimmer is a little narrow and small but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Have not used it in the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode yet.&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/8/13: I originally bought this in December of 2011. The shaver died on 3/26/13. Because it had a 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;Philips replaced the defective body with a new one. Sent it with a return box postage paid for the old broken one. I thought that was very&lt;br /&gt;good customer service!</li>
            <li> I really was hoping to give this razor a good review ... however .... I CAN give it a bad review, which is what I&#x27;m going to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the razor in December ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 weeks, it failed to charge more than 52 minutes.... \\&quot;Fine\\&quot; .... I exchanged it through my AMAZON order ... got a brand new one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things working great ... happy and all ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, cut my water bill by $40 a month since I used to run the water while I shaved with the razor....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 weeks ago .... When I put the razor into the charging base ... \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; ... No lights ... no beep ... No activity ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, okay ... that&#x27;s strange ... and tried it in the cradle ... still ... nada....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately, ran out of time .... because at this point, I would have returned the piece of junk .... and that&#x27;s what it is ... a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However .... since I couldn&#x27;t, I was at the mercy of Norelco Philips .... who, in my opinion ... stinks, as far as customer response goes ... 7 - 10 BUSINESS days to get your replacement ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discussed the problem and they told me they were seending a NEW unit IN a box ..... \\&quot;Great\\&quot; ... I thought....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I received a 6\\&quot; tall tube.... inside, containing the body, only, of the razor ... No power cord ... No razor head ... no charging unit ... JUST the body of the razor ... which WASN&#x27;T the problem any ways ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Norelco AGAIN!!!! and they could not find me in their database .... they don&#x27;t have it together ... just plain ole lousy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I \\&quot;helped\\&quot; THEM find ME, they said, \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; we&#x27;ll send you out a cord....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Geeeez.... THANK YOU!!!!\\&quot; and I get to wait another 7-10 business days....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me an opportunity to try out BRAUN or something like that..... Perhaps a BRAUN will work....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ashame ... the concept is cool....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OTHER thing I thought was this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that the AMAZON seller is selling FAILED LOTS ... You know ... Like how FRIES ELECTRONICS does it? Thus, you gamble that you&#x27;ll get a good unit OR a bad unit .... Check it out .... next time you go to FRIES .... check out how long the line is ... .that&#x27;s becuase they buy failed lots ... and turn around and sell it to YOU.... Probably what this vendor is doing ...... LOL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well ..... there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to take my razor and run over it with my car..... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have this piece of junk..... And now, it doesn&#x27;t always startup to clean when you out it in the cradle... Oh, it goes through the motions.... But the razor is supposed to turn on to clean the heads... And I doesn&#x27;t... Not all the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, however shave very well, and so, I added one star back.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, easy to use. it will take u 2-3 times to get used to it - but after that you&#x27;ll be very happy. it&#x27;s not heavy. enjoy!</li>
            <li> The one star rating may seem a little harsh for a razor that does actually shave, however the razor is being sold as a top of the line razor and it is no better than the 20 year old travel Norelco I own. I have many electric razors and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfact razor. I purchased the 1280X/42 as a replacement for my Braun. Save your money and get Braun. I still will use the Norelco, but the Braun is almost perfact. If you can&#x27;t waste hundreds on buying everyone&#x27;s top of the line razor, but are willing to spend enough for one of the top razors get the Braun. The Norelco is descent but its realy a $40.00 razor not a $240.00 razor. If you get a new razor every year the Norelco may be worth adding to your arsenal though. Good luck in your search. P.S. If a razor has an option for a cleaner get it even the cheap one&#x27;s are worth it for your razor and your face.</li>
            <li> i have just started using this shave and i must say its one of the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Recommended! 100% Very Satisfacation!The Product is very good! I receive all the items in the correctly time os ship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sales is very attetion.!</li>
            <li> Simply put this is leagues ahead of other electrics I have used. Full disclosure the other razors I have had were garbage, such as the single foil Braun for like $40. So go figure this would out perform it, as it should for the cost! Nonetheless, my skin is so much less irritated and no more beard bumps that I would get from my gillette fusion. I like to shave dry and this is perfect for that, close, comfortable and quick. For wet shaves with a premium gel/foam (Nivea, Gillette, etc) it&#x27;s nearly blade close, but with less irritation. The travel lock works great, and the battery easily lasts for weeks of travel before it needs a charge. The digital display lets you know exactly how much time is left, no guessing from the bars. The jet clean system is nice. I thought the three settings it has was overkill at first but actually it&#x27;s quite convenient. If you clean the razor frequently you can do the quick \\&quot;eco\\&quot; setting, or if you return from a trip and haven&#x27;t had a chance for a thorough cleaning, use the intensive setting. It&#x27;s like new afterwards!   If you have sensitive skin and get a lot of irritation or bumps with a razor, try a premium electric like this. The cost is expensive no doubt, but last I checked a 12 pack of fusions is like $40-$50 and if you don&#x27;t change out those blades it gets worse for irritation. This should pay itself off in razor savings in 6-8 months for me... Hopefully it will last for years. Phillips makes a great product. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> for years I brought razors and blades,blades,blades,but I never wanted to pay the price of a good electric.I tried foil razors too.  I never could get a good clean shave.  I new I had to find something better no matter what the cost, this razor is the best ever.love the fast and clean,smooth,shave.Quite buying blades.  step up,get on of these and u will never regret it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for many years and thought I&#x27;d treat myself to this shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the shave rivals a blade razor.  I&#x27;ve had none of the neck irritation reported elsewhere.  This might be because my neck was already conditioned by previous Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jet Clean System is interesting to watch, but I&#x27;ve not had this long enough to really evaluate effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was bit nervous at first with this purchase. It takes a little getting used to at first, I started to have a really good shave after a week. Easy to clean, Charges quickly. I am really impressed on how easy it is to use specially when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a week and the hair is really hard.</li>
            <li> bought it 4 weeks back, used it for two weeks and returned. Not good to shave near neck if your skin is rough</li>
            <li> Was skeptical on spending this much money on a shaver but WOW sums it up. Amazing shave, great price. Upgraded from a very well used norelco electric shaver, the very first one  that dispensed shave lotion and almost got the new model of that style, but glad I looked on the Norelco website and read about new technology and the Jet Clean system. Cleaner works great to give the shaver the brand new shaver feeling after cleaning it with hot water after shaving. I would highly recommend this shaver if you have a hard time shaving as your facial hair grows in multiple directions and you struggle to shave in a timely manner. Used to take me close to 30 minutes to just shave, minus any other detail or trim work, now takes about 15. Great Job Norelco, give this shaver two thumbs up. 5 stars. A 100 on a 0-10 scale. Great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I Bought my first Norelco (Phillips) shaver in Germany in 1960. It was so much better than those that I had been using, that I became a lifetime user.  This 1280X/42 is my fourth over all those years, and it without a doubt the best.  The shave is close and the trimmer really works.  The blades clean in hot water, and I only use the cleaning system weekly.  I have used it in the shower, but not with foam or lotion, It&#x27;s not necessary.    Bob</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers successfully in the past, and thought it was time to return to them after shelling out too much money on replacement blades for my regular razor.  The product reviews for this looked great, the videos looked great, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I surprised.  The shave wasn&#x27;t that close and--worse--my face was incredibly irritated by this razor.  I gave my face a long time to adapt (I&#x27;ve been through this before) but I now dread shaving to the point that I avoid doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I noticed that I developed dozens of small scabs on my neck and cheeks.  Figuring I was pressing down too hard and cutting the skin, I avoided pressure the next time and found that it left too much hair behind.  So, I gently pressed slightly harder and re-did spots where it wasn&#x27;t cutting well.  The hairs were mostly gone, but the small scabs reappeared.  These spots, and many others, later turned into whiteheads, ingrown hairs, and very sensitive red welts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look and hurt SO BAD it&#x27;s not even funny and... the kicker... the shave is not as close as my old shaver!!!  In fact, I had to fix several spots with my old razor to even out the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a new razor from Braun, the company that made my last electric razor that I used for years.  Hopefully this will go better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I like anything?  The razor itself had a nice flexible design and the cleaning system returned the razor to a \\&quot;new\\&quot; feeling.  I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful razor for many people, but think twice if you have very sensitive skin.  Even as a I write this, having shaved over 24 hours ago, my face is still burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I bought the Braun Series 7 790cc and used it for the first time today.  I am pain-free with a nice clean, close shave.  I am not as crazy about the Braun cleaning system when compared to the Norelco, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replaced my older braun shaver. It was a good shaver but the motor went out. I had this shaver about a month now and so far I would recommend it. I have a heavy beard growth with thick curly hair.I have to shave twice a day just to keep it down.Also I shave my head too,so this shaver gets used quite a bit every day.I do have to go over my face a few times to get it smooth and I have stretch skin a little.I do gets some irritation but only in some spots. Its gets my head pretty smooth no problems there. I know some people do not like the cleaning station that comes with it, but I like it a lot. I clean the shaver in it every day and my skin feels  good after a cleaning cycle. Now what I don&#x27;t like is the grip, it doesn&#x27;t feel natural in my hand.Also the pop out trimmer is not that great it could be a little wider and cut better.</li>
            <li> **Initial problem with non delivery of the product** After steering away from electric shavers for at least 10 years due to the quality of the shave, i have been really happy with the closeness of the shave provided by this shaver. Early days yet, but jet clean system works well and shaver seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> good razor but it gave my guy razor burn. he has sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different electric razors including earlier Norelco models, Braun, and others.  None have provided the closeness and non-irritating shave this latest model has.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1280X is really most advance shaving system. I have tried a couple of electric shavers before and always end up with irritation and especially hairs at my neck. But Senso touch 3D give the closest possible shaving with least irritation. I am completely satisfied with the product and its performance.</li>
            <li> I did as Norelco asked and gave this a couple of weeks, and my reaction is that it is the closest electric shave I have ever gotten, but the downsides are still the downsides.    I have a goatee (that i shave off periodically), and have evolved to a two step system - a Gillette Fusion Power razor (love Fusion blades) + a Schick Quattro Beard trimmer (both of which can be used in the shower).  I find this two step system results in keeping my goatee short on a much more frequent basis (trimming in my sink makes a mess), clean sideburns, a very close, razor burn free shave, and a clean trim around my goatee  As I said before, this electric is better than any i have ever tried before, but still isn&#x27;t as close as a manual.    +&#x27;s:  close shave, quick (since I do my current routine in the shower, this is a viable option if I need to shave on a non-shower day or for a touchup), moves with your face contour as well or better than any shaver before, quiet, charges quickly, ergonomically friendly, less razor irritation than any electric I have ever had (but not as little as a manual), sleek and beautiful.    -&#x27;s:  Still not as effective as a manual on the lip area, razor burns particularly on the neck, does not trim around a goatee very well, expensive!    All in all, if you are a electric fan, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a good choice, but won&#x27;t replace a manual for me.</li>
            <li> I contacted Norelco&#x27;s customer support prior to purchasing the 1280XCC to find out if RQ12 fits the Arcitec. Customer support reported the new head wouldn&#x27;t fit the Arcitec.  Makes good business sense for them to design it that way.  Received the 1280 today and the RQ12 head fits the Arcitec perfectly.    Giving it 3 stars for Norelco&#x27;s customer support misleading customers.    Update:  After using this, the new RQ12 is a big improvement over the RQ10 of the Arcitec.  The Arcitec gave a close shave but required multiple passes over the same area.  My shave time went from 4 minutes with a 8894XL to about 7 with the Arcitec because of this.  The new RQ12 forms to your face much better.  The 4 minute shave is back.  The body of the shaver is larger than the Arcitec.  Looks like Norelco took the complaints of that model and fixed them with the SensoTouch.  The trimmer sticks out farther making it easy to use without first removing the shaving head.  The motor is much quieter.  The shape is similar with the SensoTouch being slightly larger.  My Arcitec currently holds 98 minutes of shave time due to cycling the battery over a few years.  I&#x27;m sure once the battery in the SensoTouch gets cycled a dozen or more times the shave time will start increasing as well.    So if you&#x27;re using an Arcitec, buy the RQ12.  If you want a quieter shave, get one of the 1200 series shavers with the RQ12.  If you want to save some money pick up an Arcitec and an RQ12 for it.</li>
            <li> Did my research and on amazon it shows this is the best shaving electronic period,i went and bought it for black friday,no discount at all.first day i used it i felt little onches when held to close to skin.you have to go around the same area too many times compared to other products.my skin got super irritated  leading to tons of bumps under my neck.i dont know if i used it wrong or is the shaver but for such a high price i expected more.love the slef cleaning feature but the shaving doesnt cut it for me.bought the panasonic arc 3 and got a better result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been few years since i had bought an electric shaver and i am happy that i got Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean. The shave takes a bit longer as compared to a Razor and cleaning the unit is a lengthy process. However the shave itself is clean and close (i guess it might take few shaves to get it right and speed things up a bit). The unit charge time is fairly quick and can last around (4-5 shaves approx.). I Haven&#x27;t used the Jet Clean system as of yet it&#x27;s a space hogger and takes its sweet time; However cleaning under running hot water as suggested works just fine.  All in all great unit and if you are in market looking for one this is as good unit to consider!</li>
            <li> In 60 years of shaving from a straight razor, barber shaves, Remington, Grundig, Shick, Braum, &amp; other Norelco shavers; without a doubt this 3D 880X Shaver is BY FAR the GREATEST Men&#x27;s Shaver I have ever had! The Jet Stream clean the shaver like new each time. Well worth the price!.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my shavers to one of the top of the line shavers on the market, the Philips 1280cc/42, especially since Philips-Norelco has a $50 rebate going on at the present time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Braun shavers for the past 50 years, then 2 years ago I purchased a Philips-Norelco 8260 XL shaver also and used them alternately side by side with my Braun 7570 and 8595 together. My final conclusion is that both gave me the same close shave, the Philips being a lot quieter.&lt;br /&gt;Now you would expect me to rave about the 1280cc/42 like most people do but all I would say that it is an excellent shaver, very quiet, does the job very well and I may even talk myself into that it gives me a bit closer shave. All in all I like this shaver and definitely deserves the 5 star rating and a keeper for me. Is it really worth the $200 (after the rebate)? I do not think so but since it is a nice, new streamlined design, well built excellent unit I will keep it for the next few years.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not mind to spend that much money and want an excellent shaver buy it by any means, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 5 months of use:&lt;br /&gt;I still like this shaver well and works as expected, nice and quiet. But as interesting note I would like to add that after I purchased a new cutting head for my 11 years old Braun 7570 (since the shaver still keeps the charge very well and works perfectly) this shaver beats the Philips 1280cc/42 for speed and closeness of shave HANDS DOWN!. The manual cleaning with the removable cutting head is also very fast and easy on this Braun model, never needs the wet cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;No question that the Philips is quieter, but as it appears I really did not need it. So I have been using them alternately now to keep the batteries in good shape on both. However for travel, the Braun is a lot easier to take in it&#x27;s handy and compact travel case which accomodates the charger also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 7 months:&lt;br /&gt;Although I can not say anything bad about this shaver, probably the best Philips ever made, but after 50 years of using Braun shavers only I could not get used to the rotary system and the little clumsy design of using the charging stand to charge it and the travel case design is ridiculously large and stupid. Molded case design would have been better for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I returned to Braun and purchased the series 7 the 790CC which an outstanding shaver and to me shaves a touch even closer than the Philips. This is only personal preference and absolutely nothing against the performance of the Philips shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after almost 3 years:&lt;br /&gt;I still have this Braun 790CC which works well but always has been pretty noisy and although I commented before that it gives me a touch closer shave than the Philips 1280XX it is really a toss up since I just repurchased a new Philips 1280XX/42 and alternately using both of them. They equal in closeness of shave and the Philips appears to be made from better material. On the Braun 790CC some of the nice metal looking parts are silver paint covered plastic and this paint coating is now bubbling up at the back under the cutting head after a couple of years of use and Jet cleaning which is very disappointing. The only thing with the Philips that it gives me a touch more skin irritation sometimes if I am not careful enough around the lower neck area, but very close and extremely quiet shave. No doubt that these 2 shavers are the best on the market today and I will be using both of them alternately for a while and see which one I like better, I may just keep both of them.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He can&#x27;t say enough about how much he enjoys using it!  Truly an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This Shaver works incredible!  I got tired of nicks when shaving, especially when I shave my head.  This thing does it all and both it and the cleaning system are very quiet.  Save for it if you have to but if your looking for an electric, buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of electric shavers through out the years but never had one like this. I love the way it shaves and the way it glides and maneuvers to the shape of my face.     Norelco you got a winner here. You just beat all your \\&quot;triple track\\&quot;, \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; you&#x27;ve ever priduced.</li>
            <li> Having been a regular user of Philips Norelco Speed 8240 for the past, oh, maybe 4 years, I was very happy to order this new and improved shaver from Amazon.  My expectations were amped up by many favorable reviews on Amazon.com.  In summary: what a disappointment this shaver has been.  But first things first.  I have a lot of facial hair.  My hair is dense (per square inch) and thick.  I would like to shave every day, but some days I don&#x27;t manage, and so I end up having two days worth of hair to shave.  And on occasional days, by 5 pm I have enough hair that for some people would qualify as \\&quot;not shaven for 2 days\\&quot;.  The Philips Norelco 1280x / 42 falls FAR below expectations in meeting my shaving needs, as follows.  The BAD:  - on regular shave days (i.e., on those days when I have only 24-hours worth of hair), no matter how much time I spend shaving, there are still occasional hairs, scattered all over my face, which are completely un-cut.  In other words, the shaver completely misses those hairs.  And I need to do some clean-up job with a Gillette Razor,  - at my sides, where I need a precision job, I am unable to get a clear line, using the trimmer.  The trimmer on this shaver is basically USELESS.  And again, you guessed it, I need to do a clean-up job with a Gillette Razor,  - around my neck and chin area, this shaver does a poor job of reaching the touch angles.  I need to spend quite a lot of time in order to get my neck and chin shaved.  And then, after painstaking and extensive efforts of trying to get my neck shaved, there are still hairs left uncut.  And once again, I need to do a cleanup job with a Gillette Razor.  The worst part is that the new and improved Philips Norelco 1280x / 42 leaves my neck red and irritated and irritation lasts for good 20-30 minutes.  Now the UGLY:  - god forbid that I go without shaving for two days (48 hours) straight, and try using the Philips Norelco 1280X/42 to get a regular shave.  My shaving time increases 3x (not kidding), and of course, the battery drainage also increases 3x.  You would think that I might be able to get a discount on buy-2, e.g., after not shaving for two days, it might take me 1.8 x as much time to shave.  But no, not with the Philips Norelco 1280X/42.  After 2 days of hair growth, if I don&#x27;t work extra diligently (3x the time and the effort) then I end up with entire patches on my face that are poorly shaved.  I believe that the new generation of Philips Norelco shavers are \\&quot;gentler\\&quot; devices, with a lot reduced ability to cut through thick and dense hair.  I have reached this conclusion based on having used BOTH the old Philips Norelco Speed 8240 without any fancy 2D, 3D, 4D, or 5G functions, and the new 1280X / 42.  Whether the deficiency comes from weaker and duller blades, or whatever other \\&quot;technological improvements\\&quot; that have been put by Philips, I can not tell.  I can, however, tell that the old shavers from Philips were much better.  You think that reviews this bad can not get worse, right?  Well, wrong.  At $69, there are plenty of old style shavers available.  So paying $219 (or whatever price they are going for).  At 3X the price, and 5 years of research and innovation, you would think you might just get lucky and get a better shaver?  No, not today, not from Philips Norelco.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it.  Get one, and try it out.  It might work for you.</li>
            <li> Has anyone gone from a foil shaver, such as the Panasonic ES8249 then which to a rotary shaver, like the Philips/Norelco 1280X/42 and experienced skin irritation?  I&#x27;d like to try the Norelco, but I&#x27;ve always heard you&#x27;re either a foil or rotary kinda guy.  Any thoughts would be helpful.  Thanks, Jim</li>
            <li> I did try lot of products from other brand and Philips itself, trust me non of them had this smooth and clean shave. This one need some more improvement as far as trimmer is concerned for sharp and more clean finishing. The best part is it work great with shaving gel which does not foam like other cream.   Once should definitely try this one for sure. Though not perfect in all aspect but the best as of today.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric chaver and it has surpassed my expectations. It is a pleasure to use and easy to maintain, adding great value to my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and efficient electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned ( I&#x27;m over 60).  Works even better as a wet shaver.  Easy to clean, easy to use. I have very sensitive skin and this razor cuts as close as a blade without the damage.   Highly satisfied and would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Before, I was not able to use my electric razor more than three days in a row, because my skin started to get irritated on the 4th day! With this razor I am on my 14th day in a row without any problem. The main factor in this is, ability to wet shave (using shaving cream).  Typical to any electric razor there&#x27;s a slight difficulty with shaving the neck area, but it is minimal with this razor.    Pros:   - shaves very well leaves smooth skin   - Wet shaves   - Not loud    Cons:   - The trimmer is not as strong as old school razors</li>
            <li> I used this razor for about a month.  The actual razor heads did their job well, but I had two major complaints that caused me to return the product.  First, the heads pivoted so much, it was hard to get a truly close shave since they pivoted away from the face.  Secondly, and most importantly to me, the reservoir that holds the shavings really didn&#x27;t hold any shavings due to the design.  The instructions stay to shave over a sink and wash after each shave, but I&#x27;m not always in front of a sink when I shave, so the shavings fall over my shirt or elsewhere.  I returned it for a Norelco 8250, which has the exact same razors, but the traditional electric razor shape.  Sometimes a new design isn&#x27;t always the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, reliable close shave time after time.  And it holds a charge well, I don&#x27;t even recharge it every month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric shavers: my problem has never been irritation, but rather the fact that they rarely give you a close shave. I&#x27;ve had a Braun top-of-the-line model for a few years and unless I used it daily, my facial hair would grow too long for the shaver to cut it efficiently and I ended up with spots where i had long whiskers that I needed to cut with a regular razor blade. Evidently my facial hair wasn&#x27;t really compatible with foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco was an impulse buy, after I&#x27;d almost given up on electric shavers, and it completely changed my opinion. From the very first time, I&#x27;ve had nothing less than a great shave with no uneven spots or pinching/irritation. It&#x27;s not as close a shave as you&#x27;d get with a proper 4-blade razor, but it&#x27;s amazingly smooth and efficient. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Why did I stick with the Braun foil-type shaver for so long, I don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was very satisfied with the unit; after about 7 months, the handle unit failed to take a charge; the company replaced the handle unit, indicating the unit was covered under the original purchase date warranty;&lt;br /&gt;less than three months later, the handle unit fails to take a charge of more than 37 minutes (the advertised and users&#x27; manual length is indicated to be 60 minutes). The unit fails to charge on either the jet clean dock or on the charge stand. I have called the manufacturer/seller a second time. I am now told to discharge the unit completely and attempt a recharge. I did this the last time and the result was the current situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now October 2012; I continue to have problems with the charging of the unit; it charged for some time fully; now it repeats the same pattern, charging only to 40 minutes. The blades are dull. I have an older Norelco shaver and the blades on it are still working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3RN3OGK47KPBL]]Excellent razor, and Norelco is a name you can trust.  Also, the product had a problem when it first arrived, Amazon was quick to send me another one overnight at no charge to me, so excellent service there too!  Overall I recommend the 1280X and Jet Clean system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/26/2013 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I saw people asking about was the chrome piece of plastic making a squeaking or clicking noise when they first got the razor.  That was the problem I had when I got my first one, but Amazon swapped it for a new one no questions asked basically, and the new one they provided seemed fine.  If your new razor squeaks return it before use for a new one!  It seems like Norelco does have a slight quality control issue with that part, although it doesn&#x27;t affect functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the razor for over 2 years now.  I still like the razor and the Jet Clean system a lot and would recommend it to friends and family.  I actually did buy one for my Dad for Christmas and he really likes his too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to mention that after 2 years of use my razor quit charging and at the same time my Jet Clean system suddenly wouldn&#x27;t work (would light up the low fluid light when the fluid level was correct).  I also tried charging the razor on the charging only base (only time I tried to use it) and it still wouldn&#x27;t charge.  I contacted Norelco&#x27;s customer service online via chat and they sent me a new razor and new Jet Clean system.  The beauty of all this was that it was just outside of the standard 2 year warranty, but I found out that by registering my product purchase online they added 6 months to the warranty, and my now 2.5 year warranty now started at my registration date, not my original purchase date (registered about a month after purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t bother dismantling them to see if I could diagnose the cause of the problems so have no way of knowing whether one of the two had an electrical problem that later broke the other one, but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  Thanks Philips for great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.  Considering I travel a lot for work and so my razor gets banged around by TSA frequently maybe I can&#x27;t hope for much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note, I have found that shaving with shaving cream or a shaving gel with this razor seems to result in the smoothest agitation free shave.  Just keep the razor head wet and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!oke the other one, but now I have all new parts and all seem to be working well.  Thanks Philips for great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I get at least another 2 years out of this razor and Jet Clean system, meaning over 4 years of total use.

Just keep the razor head wet and you&#x27;ll have a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li> The razor sounds very light, shave is very smooth, very nice. Charge of electricity can be very fast, with 60 minutes, very handsome.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a month ago and after you get used to using it, it rocks! Smoothest most comfortable shave Iv&#x27;e had yet. Very good at getting the low front portion of the neck. I also use this with shaving cream once in a while but it&#x27;s not necessary. This razor is so smooth going over your skin, shaving cream really isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> There are only a few negatives. One is that it doesn&#x27;t cut the longer hairs around the neck and upper cheek areas nowhere nearly as well as it claims to do in the advertizing. Two, I have to go over some areas a few times. And three,I don&#x27;t see any need for the jet clean system, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to disinfect, takes up a lot of space, and I can still see a little bit of debris that it didn&#x27;t remove from normal shaving. But, it&#x27;s kind of cool to watch the jet clean system work if you like gadgets and have the patience to wait on it to finish before unplugging it. This shaver does do a pretty good job of close shaving on dry skin as long as you use your other hand or facial muscles to stretch the skin as tightly as you can while you use it. It does it&#x27;s best job as a wet shaver. I particularly like the subtle quietness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months of use I have a new appreciation for the jet clean system. I have used it with and without the jet clean system each for four months and I find that with the use of the jet clean system there is a slight bit more shave efficiency/close shaving feel. This may be due to the blade lubrication effect or it may just be psychological, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an additional few more months of use I noticed a slightly noisier electric shaver motor than before, all else being equal. But still shaves as close as before and with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for March 2013:  The jet cleaning system completely stopped working! It&#x27;s completely frozen! Had not even used it much at all!  But customer service was very nice and sent me a brand new one for free!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 2 weeks. My initial concern with buying it was price and the fact I have sensitive skin. I read it takes 3 weeks for your face to get use to the electric shaver and that some skin irritation would be expected. I am excited to reportm, I have experienced little to none skin irritation! I use this razor almost everyday with a dry face and it shaves my face smoother than my schick quatro! I am amazed. Shaving is no longer a tedious hassel. It takes me about 3 minutes to shave my face and I&#x27;m ready to go. The battery life has been quite excelent as well. I charged it once and I still have plenty of battery usage left and that was about 2 weeks ago when I charged it. This is an excellent product and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver. Yes, it is a bit expensive but I can honestly say I have no regrets shelling out the cash for this.</li>
            <li> Good price comparing to market</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Norelco 1280X to replace my old arcitec shaver, which I bought back in 2008 when this line was originally launched.  The difference between the earlier model and the 1280X is absolutely incredible.  I figured they must have improved it significantly, but never thought it would be that evident.  The older model was actually a pretty lausy shaver.  The 1280X is as close as you can get to a razor shave.  I am using it with saving gel and the shaves I am getting are truly razor-quality, without all the irritation.  It does help to use an aftershave product, but there is virtaully no irritation and the shave is almost as close as as a razor (if not equal).  Cosntruction quality is nice and solid and it comes with a a stand and the jet clean system, which works well.  Strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Foil shavers before and I decided to go to Philips and it was the correct choice. My beard hair is always growing in different directions. With the Braun, they ask you to shave against the direction of hair growth. This means that I need to shave the same area many many times in all directions to get it good and though it was not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Philips since you need to shave in circular motion, it got every single hair and at the end it was extremely smooth. I even shaved with little long hair and no problem at all. With the Braun, I always had to trim the hair first, otherwise the shave will be bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really fast and smooth. I would recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for a good comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean system is really nice and always cleaning the shaver and keeping it in good condition.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver Oct 23, 2011 and it worked great for several months.  Gave a nice close shave, closest I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.  I used it the night of 4/27 and the morning of 4/28 it was dead.  I contacted customer support and they have to replace the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; and will send me a replacement in 7-10 days, but which time I&#x27;ll look like a Grizzly bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always owned Norelco razors but this is the first one that has broken.  It is also by far the most expensive.  I would not purchase it again as I fear that when the warranty is up (2yr continued from the original date of purchase) it will die again.  I cannot justify spending $150/yr on a shaver no matter how close a shave I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second star is for how quickly customer support, via chat, helped me and how easy it was to get them to send a replacement product.</li>
            <li> I did my homework before choosing to buy an electric shaver and all the reviews that I read on the internet said that this particular shaver was the best. They weren&#x27;t wrong it is every bit as good as good as the reviews said if not more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as ecpected and so handsomeful, maybe i&#x27;ll get another one for my friend.I like it very much.OH YEAH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco waterproof shaver in the shower for years, but the batteries were starting to not hold a charge (they were NiCads) so I have been looking for an upgrade with LiIon batteries.  I found this one on Amazon, and the sale coupon Norelco was offering at the time clinched the deal for me.  This shaver is even better than my last one, probably because the Jet Clean process prevents the blades from corroding/dulling from having the water air-dry and leave mineral deposits every day.  The lubrication from the Jet Cleaning can&#x27;t hurt, either.  I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I like it very much,Preferential aggressive, the best New Year gift,He is the most perfect,I would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Great shaving experience, easy to clean. Good battery, hold about 1 hour of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad that you can&#x27;t plug this shaver directly into a wall socket, you have to bring the charging stand with you.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how to get the cleaning portion setup of this razor figured out. The shave is close and comfortable. Fits well in the hand and glides over the face very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Philips Norelco electric men&#x27;s shavers for over 20 years. I also have a Braun Men&#x27;s electric shaver.  However, I prefer my Philips Norelco since I believe the 3 head shaver gives my face a better shave than other designs by manufacturers such as Braun.  This is a great improvement over previous models that Philips Norelco has brought to the market.  I particularly like that it can be used for wet shaving.  I&#x27;m particularly fond of using the old fashioned shaving soap and a silver tipped badger hair shaving brush method of shaving [[ASIN:B003V32UDI Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]since I believe this shaving method gives my face a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Okay, this looks like an awesome product right? Well, it is. This not only provides you with a close shave, but is quiet and can last pretty long. This razor is one of the best. I will never go back to razor blades because this will not give you the cuts that regular razors give you. This unit is also easy to clean, you can open up each of the three heads and empty out the hair in it. It is really easy. Even though head replacements are quite pricey, but it is said that each one of the heads can last 1+ years. This is a must buy and a great product!</li>
            <li> This razor works like a charm....bought it for my &#x27;beginner&#x27; shaver and he LOVES it!  Smooth glide and so easy to use.  The results are excellent!</li>
            <li> Recently purchased a Philips Norelco electric shaver. No regrets at all. I have a very tough beard and have never before been able to use an electric shaver. I particularly enjoy using it with shaving creme and hot water. A remarkable product. Especially like the fast charge feature. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because of the price. I have been using disposables for a number of years, but wanted less hassle in an electric so I got this one. It comes fully uncharged, but within a few minutes there is enough juice for a shave. I don&#x27;t remember electric razors giving an incredible close shave before, but it has been over 10 years since I used one. This thing is extremely quiet and gives a very close comfortable shave. It almost looks like I don&#x27;t need to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The looks of this thing are very futuristic. The display shows the power left and updates while charging. When off you have no idea there is so much detail available when turned on. The cleaning thing is cool to watch in action as it turns the razor on and off as it dunks the unit in the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an expensive gadget, but I like it.</li>
            <li> After using a blade for over 30 years I started to develop in grown hairs, and I was becoming incredibly frustrated. My wife purchased this product for me for Christmas, and after I read instructions, I committed to a daily use of the razor for a minimum of four weeks prior to making any decision. The instructions stated to give the product a minimum of four weeks to allow your face to adjust, and allow your facial hair to grow straight out vs. straight down against the face and curling under the skin.    I am very happy to report that I will be continuing to use this product daily, as the ingrown hairs have virtually disappeared.  I highly recommend this product.  I also travel extensively with my company, and the charge the razor holds is outstanding.  I can be on the road for for 5-6 days, and will return home with over half a charge.    The closeness and quality of the shave is wonderful, and I believe this product actually gives me a very close shave, if not more so than a blade.    Very Pleased my wife spent the extra money to ensure I had a wonderful product.    Calvyone</li>
            <li> If you want your whiskers pulled out then buy it.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors over the years and this is by far the best shave and cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband, he absolutely loves it. He has said that he has never had a razor that shaves as close as this one does. He has only had to re-charge it once since he received it. I gave it to him for Christmas 2010 and he re-charged it on Feb, 15 2011. Highly recommends it to every one.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver ever, so I don&#x27;t have any experiences with other shavers to compare with. I decided to try this sensotouch 3d because I hoped that it will cause less irritation and cuts than a regular razor that I was using before. And well... It&#x27;s good but definitely not as perfect as the maker portraits it to be. I still get a lot of irritation even after I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. But nevertheless, it&#x27;s still better than a regular razor, so I&#x27;m happy I bought it. The price could be lower though.</li>
            <li> Long story condensed: purchased the 1280xx - used it for a week and all of the ink rubbed off.  I called Philips Norelco and they had me return that one and sent me another. Within a week the same thing happened but this one also rattled.  I called again and they again sent me another.  This one also had the ink rub off and also rattled.  I called them up and they said they would refund my purchase price. While I didn&#x27;t think the ink rubbing off was major (the rattle definitely was) - I was concerned that if Philips sent me three shavers all with the ink rubbing off within a week - then where is their quality control and what else will go bad down the line.  The shave was OK but I have since purchased a Braun 790cc4 (the new one just released) and not only is the shave better - but the shaver feels more solid.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it!  He was never able to get a close shave and he can with this.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the philips senso touch 3 d &#x60;1280cc/42. It is smooter dan a knive en so easy to clean.   When you send it you told me deliverd 7 jan 11. It was at my door 6 jan 11.Sorry for not getting $50 because i live outside the USA.  So I am happy with my philips ( I bought my first philips shaver in 1955 and never have used a other brand. I whent from 1 to 2 to 3 shaving heads.) all wel dan AMASON.  greetings will Lazoe</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very ergonomically designed, lighter than previous models and comes at a very affordable price.    I primarily use it on my head and got it as a replacement for my very ancient Cool Skin that I had for more than 5 years and whose battery was no longer charging and the razors had become quite blunt. I tried other shavers but they did not work well on me as I have curly afro hair, and most products just don&#x27;t do a good job.    I am very impressed with the shave, leaves a very smooth feel, no need to apply excessive pressure and just gliding it once or twice over the area does the trick. The swivel head ensures maximum contact between the shaver and my skin, and I have not had any instances of razor burn, ingrown hairs or bumps, which is a very exceptional outcome.    Highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for good electric razor, especially if you have curly and/or afro hair.</li>
            <li> I have never shaved with anything other than an electric razor in over 25 years and I have owned everything from rotaries to foil shavers during this time. No matter what brand I went to I always ended up coming back to Norelco. Over the years I found that while these razors did get the job done, they were not without their flaws and problems. I cannot remember a time when either friends or girlfriends did not comment on the fact that it seemed that I was always missing areas or a random facial hair here or there. I also had issues with the fact that if I missed a couple of days shaving then I was always in for a painful hair pulling experience which I did not relish at all. That being said, this electric is by far the best razor that I have ever owned. The shave is the closest I have ever had and the issue with random missed hairs is a problem of the past. After a month of using this razor I am simply amazed at how stubble free my skin is now and didn&#x27;t think a shave this close with an electric was even possible. I use skin cleanser that is applied with a cotton swab and with my old razors, I would always end with a face covered in cotton swab fragments. Now with the close shave, the cotton pads just glide over my skin. While this razor is VERY expensive, I do not regret the purchase at all. If you can swing it then you need to pull the trigger on this unit. I have found that opening the heads and just blowing them out after each shave has kept the unit clean enough without the need for the cleaning unit or the faucet. Even though it&#x27;s designed to do so, my mind tells me that water and electronics do not mix and I worry about premature failure.     My only complaints:  Non-Universal Power Supply - I also own the Philips Body Shaver and while the power cords look the same and actually do plug into the charging bases, they are not compatible. I found this out when I plugged the wrong one into this unit and all of the lights started flashing at the same time with an alarm beep. Nothing in the instructions warned of this problem and I had to figure it out on my own. Silly because if I was travelling for extended time I would have to pack both cords which look identical. FAIL by Philips.     Head Design - While the head is designed very well in order to get into tight places on the face, the design for opening the heads for cleaning is annoying. Each head is hinged on the outside and individually and since they recommend cleaning after each shave, you have to grab each head and open individually. Also I have had a couple of times when my chin caught one of the heads and popped it open. This has only happened twice and I have learned how to use it without this happening.     Cleaning Unit - I have no plans of using this unit as I am not a fan of the scent of the cleaning solution. Reminds me of the chemical smell of a freshly cleaned public bathroom. Just opening the heads and blowing them out into my shower after each shave does the trick and the water simply carries all the hair down the drain.</li>
            <li> It is perhaps not as close a shaver as the Braun it replaced, but it is more comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li> Really good, love it.</li>
            <li> this is the first time i purchase on Amazon.  the product is better than what i imaging. It is nice, and brand new, It is exactly the same as what i saw in stores, but nearly $100 cheaper than that. My partner says it is good use and the battery lasts long. Though the delivery was delayed for a few days, I can find the shipping details on line. i would choose Amazon again.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this razor I thought to myself,\\&quot;What can this razor bring to my face that my 6 year old $99 Norelco couldn&#x27;t?\\&quot;.  Well, this razor shaves like a blade, and without the burn.  The razor shaves fabulously, face wet with cream or dry regular and it can be eaisly cleaned in the sink under running water!  The one drawback is the charging stands.        One stand cleans and sanitizes, the other just charges.  The inconvenience is that when you travel, the charging stand will not fit in the carrying case and you can&#x27;t plug the charging plug into the razor.  The carrying case holds the razor nicely and there is a &#x27;soft&#x27; lock feature that keeps the razor from turning on in the suit case, so if you need less than an hour&#x27;s shaving time on your trip then you are good to go.  But, I prefer a charger &#x27;just in case&#x27;, because I have had an experience where mine discharged during travel.  I really like this razor and I would purchase it again now.       *****  All in all I rate five stars out of five.  Martin</li>
            <li> Hi, I was always skeptical to pay more than $200 for a shaver that looked flimsy and was afraid it would break easy if dropped.  Well this Norelco is very durable and the jet clean system is great.  I have always had a rotary type shaver and this one so far shaves the best.  I am happy.  But it if the price is right!</li>
            <li> This latest model of the Norelco Senso Touch is the best Electric Razor I have ever owned. I have used it dry, and with pre-shave lotion. Excellent shaves both ways. In addition I have also used it in the Shower with some Shaving Gel and I got my closest shave ever that way.</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet, gives close shaves, one charge last 60 minutes before you have to charge it again, it is sharp looking and my husband is very pleased.</li>
            <li> very nice deal on this philpis shaver.I recommend it to everyone who might need an electronic shaver!It moves pretty smothly and also in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> great shaver , i use this daily</li>
            <li> Very quiet, smooth shave and an overall excellent product.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Great product! tryed in dry shave, and irritation came up, tryed wet shave, less irritation, tryed with shaving cream from nivea, zero irritation great shave :)</li>
            <li> IT DOES TAKE GETTING USED TO BUT DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY, PHILIPS STANDS BY IT&#x27;S PRODUCTS VERY WELL AND PROVIDES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL WITH ELECTRIC SHAVERS BUT THIS ONE REALLY DID THE TRICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1: VERY SMOOTH SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;2: GREAT DESIGN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1: TAKES LONG TO SHAVE ROUGHLY 6-7 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;2: DESIGN MAKES IT UNCOMFORTABLE TO SHAVE, MY HAND HURTS SOMETIMES FROM HOLDING IT FOR 5 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL I WOULD BUY THE REDEFINED VERSION OF THIS AGAIN WHEN (NEWER VERSION).</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading several reviews for electric razors. This one topped the charts as far as reviews go, so I decided to buy it. This was a switch from manual razors. I had never used an electric razor, but this works great. It doesn&#x27;t get as smooth as my gillette fusion razor, but it gets pretty close. I am in the military, so I need to keep a close shave, and haven&#x27;t heard anything yet after about two weeks of use. The one spot that this gives me trouble in is around my adams apple. Other than that, gives me a great shave with little to no irritation. The price is a downfall of this. I also have the jet clean system and have not noticed a dirty razor yet. However Im not sure how necessary this is.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a birthday gift for my dad. My dad really loves it, it is easily to handle and shaves very clean. After the shaving, my dad can clean it by water, it&#x27;s really so convenient!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor last March. I assumed that a name brand product such as this would be a good value. I was wrong. The self cleaning half of the razor stopped working after 2 months. The cutting heads started to fall apart after 6 months. From the beginning it did not shave as close as the worn out Braun it replaced. This product turned out to be a waste of money. I&#x27;ll never buy another one.Do yourself a favor and keep on looking if this razor is on your shopping list.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D electric shaver I bought was very reasonably priced, inculding the complete cleaning kit.  I even used another $30 off instant e-coupon at checkout.  And the shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have had my Norelco 1280x42 for almost two months. I have been using Norelco razors for over 25 years and have tried other brands but alway come back to Norelco.  My last razor was the wet razor that had the lotion container. It was almost 10 years old and the battery started failing and not holding a charge. I really loved that razor, but it&#x27;s time was up. I reviewed all the latest Norelco razors and came this the 1280x.  After bitting the bullet on the cost, I finally received the razor.  At first I used it as a wet razor like my old one. I used shaving cream and water and got a close shave. However, I developed a rash under my chin and it would not go away.  The wet shave also did not feel as close as my previous shaver.  I then decided to go back to dry shaving and the rash went away. I also got a much closer shave, so I guess I will stick with the dry shaving for now. The unit is very nicely assembled and the shaving heads are quite unique.  I really love how the heads come apart including the entire top assembly.  I have used the Jet Clean several times and it does a really great job cleaning the unit.  The only gripe I have about the shaver is the charging stand and travel case.  Both seem very cheap and I am a little concerned about the stand breaking when I travel. It is awkward and made of plastic.  They could have done much better with the case too. Otherwise I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a really clean shave. I just hope it will last another 10 years like my previous one.</li>
            <li> Our son requested a Philips Norelco 1280 XCC electric shaver for Christmas.  So my husband and I looked in all the local stores we could think of and it was nowhere to be found.  The stores carried older models, but not the model our son requested.  I checked on-line and found the model shaver my son wanted at Amazon.com.  And the price of the shaver was very competitive.  We ordered it from Amazon.com and received it a few days after placing our order.  We gave it to our son for Christmas and he was delighted.  He told us that ever since telling us what he wanted for Christmas he could not wait to get it and try it.  His older electric shaver, which he could not use in the shower, was beginning to  irritate his skin and it was no longer giving him a close shave.  Well, the day after our son got his new shaver he tried it and he was absolutely thrilled that it worked so well.  It provided a very close shave and it did not irritate his skin.  End of story.  P.S. our son gave his old electric shaver to his dad.</li>
            <li> Nowhere close to what I expected. After two years of light use it is worn out. Battery only half charges and replacement head is unavailable. If it were available, it cost almost as much as the complete razor did when new. How ever, it did prove somewhat of a decent shave.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best product from philips as its my 4th experience with philips the only thing i could comment on it is that the head need to be more fitted with the base as some times it fall from the base thats all</li>
            <li> I was a lifelong Norelco user but, I recently purchased a Panasonic ES LA93 and a Norelco 1280X/42 for a head-to-head comparison.  Here&#x27;s how I rated each.  Obviously, this is subjective and not every item gets equal weight:  Panasonic ES LA93:   Comfort - 5   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 3   Noise - 2   Cleaning System - 5  Norelco 1280X/42   Comfort - 4   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 5   Noise - 4   Cleaning System - 3  Overall, I give both razors a 4 and would easily recommend either one, but different people will have different priorities on what they want to get out of it.  Comments for each category:  The Panasonic was very comfortable; using it I could survive without after shave if I had to.  The Norelco is more comfortable than a blade, but there&#x27;s still a bit of razor burn after using.  On closeness, I find it impossible to get a perfectly smooth shave, even with a blade.  If I want a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shave, I would take 10 minutes with a blade and have a stinging face all morning, so I don&#x27;t bother. Two or three minutes with either one of these razors and I&#x27;m good enough.  There was no appreciable difference between the two.  For the difficult spots (under the nose, under the chin, etc.) I found the foil on the Panasonic to be farther from the edge of the body than I expected and particularly under the nose was a little tough to get to.  The curves on the Norelco get right in there with no problem.  The Panasonic is way louder, not unpleasant, but it made me appreciate how quiet the Norelco had been all my life.  The cleaning system on the Norelco is okay, but 20th century compared to the Panasonic (kind of like a semi-automatic sink compared to an automatic dishwasher).  Not a big deal to me either way, but if it were, this would have put Panasonic over the top.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all when I received it.I supposed to buy it as a gift for my father,but now I must send it to Philips repair center to get it fixed because it can not be charged.I donn&#x27;t get any receipt either!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need JetClean System.</li>
            <li> excellent product, the base is very practical to use as much as support for fast cleaning, the machine is well adapted to the face</li>
            <li> All you have to do is get the one with No Jet Clean System, save some money, hot water cleans it just fine and if you do get the Jet Clean System you won&#x27;t know where to put it. All the 3d Philips are the same so to save even more money you can get the 1250. The 1280 with the chrome on the side is cheap plastic. Just remember NO Jet Clean System, all of us with condo&#x27;s end up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cheaper model. I ended up purchasing this one due to performance issues. The self cleaning function is great for the absent minded. As it charges it cleans and continues a smooth irritaion free shave.</li>
            <li> This item works great. Personally, I believe it provides a much better and faster shave than the high end Braun model I used to have. The jet clean works pretty quickly, seems like it has a lot of moving parts though and may brake easily though (relative to the Braun cleaning system).         There is only one item I would like to see changed with this product;    You should be able to charge the shaver with a plug in directly. The way it currently is, you have to bring the charging stand with you when you travel. Probably it would be alright on short trips because it has around 60 minutes of battery life though.      Still a 5 star item none-the-less.</li>
            <li> Best electric shave I have had in years.  It sure beats the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; main brands in quality of shave and quality of the unit itself.  Easy to clean both daily and in the automatic cleaner.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice is the price, but wait! The razor is packaged with the charging stand, the razor, the cleaning unit, a full bottle of cleaner, a travel soft case and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the razor gives an exceptional shave. Smooth and clean as well as easy to use and clean. I would recommend this to anyone who, like me has limited time to shave and needs to get that chore completed post haste.&lt;br /&gt;The 3D head is amazing allowing the razor to stay in contact with my face. I have a rolly-polly face that can challenge the shaver to get the hair on the first pass. Others have taken as many as 7 passes. This reduces razor burn. That is welcome! The trimmer is the only disappointing thing on this unit. It is small and difficult to maneuver around the larger 3D head.</li>
            <li> Before buying it I was a little skeptical about how good (and by good I mean how fast and how close) of a shave this razor can give. But because I wanted an electric razor really bad I gave in and bought it. Now, after 3 weeks of using it almost daily, I can say that it&#x27;s perfect for my needs. It provides a very, very close shave, gives no irritations and is very easy to use and clean. The cleaning stand works perfectly, although you can clean it allot better just by running hot water on it. Yet, the fact that it also lubricates the shaving heads and gives it a fresh feel the next use, makes the cleaning stand worth while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it for a wet shave so I have no idea how that is. Reason is that I bought an electric shaver just so I can avoid the \\&quot;mess\\&quot; a wet shave brings (excluding using it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I highly recommend this product. I found no faults to it yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in Sep of 2011. I already have to replace the blades; when other models last me 12-16 months. The max battery life has gone from 60 to a max of 43 minutes... it won&#x27;t charge past that. Save your money for a different razor. I know I will be getting a different brand for my next razor purchase.</li>
            <li> Exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> I picked this rating because I was able to use the quick start guide and could take my time about figuring out the option details.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  He said this is by far the best razor he has ever used!</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! I had an older Philips shaver and now I got this one. It has a beautiful design, you can use during bath and the battery last long hours! Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> On my fourth one since Christmas.  Every one has just quit working with no forewarning.  I&#x27;m not using them underwater or dropping them on the floor.  After the first one I reread the instructions to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being an idiot.  Just as I suspected: I was not.  They just quit.  So if you get one, save the box.  Good shaver, other than the short life span.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, I use it in the shower and it does a excellent job without the irritation. The charge lasts almost 3 weeks without  recharging and the Jet clean is a neat way to clean it, I use this when its time a charge. Best shaver you can buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about three weeks ago.  I&#x27;m 54 years old with both heavy and medium whisker areas on my face; it&#x27;s my first electric razor in over 35 years.  The last time I owned one I was late teens early twenties and it was also a Norelco.  I have been using Gillette Power Fusion razors but with the price of blades being so much now I decided to switch.  I read many reviews here on Amazon and on the Internet; it seems that a majority of expert and regular electric shaver users think that the Braun Series 7 gives the closest shave.  I have nothing to compare this to but I would hard-pressed to see how any electric shaver could do better than this SensoTouch 3D series.  I have watched videos of various shavers in action and, as I saw on videos, this one is very quiet compared to Braun or Panasonic.  I tried this shaver the first couple of days and wasn&#x27;t impressed but I gave it a chance; I have used it both dry and wet with shaving gel.  The dry is very close and smooth; the wet shave is better still.  After three weeks I see hardly any difference between this and the Gillette Power Fusion.      So for being away from electric shavers for about 35 years, the technology has come a long, long way and though I can&#x27;t compare to other electrics it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how another shaver could do better than this.</li>
            <li> Great product haven&#x27;t had any problems, easy to use &amp; the closest shave for men &amp; women (in all the areas you want to go). And it  cleans itself!!!!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend this much on an electric razor but I feel like it&#x27;s kind of justified. I would say I have a thick bread that goes over my face and need daily shaving. Before this razor, I was using another Norelco machine bought for 30 bucks. I didn&#x27;t think there would be this much difference but there is. I am glad I didn&#x27;t change my mind upon reading the negative review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fast charging, it says an hour for charging but it felt shorter than that.&lt;br /&gt;+ Great display for minutes charging/left. Very cool lighting effects.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very, very sleek looking machine. It looks really handsome.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very close shaving on the first try. After reading lots of reviews and people telling they can&#x27;t get the same closeness as they get from razors, well I think I am exception. With my old razor, I had to go multiple times (like 10 times) to feel that skin is like baby&#x27;s butt. But this one took maybe 3 strokes at most. I am amazed how fast and close it was. Finally...&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fast shave. I could say it cut the shaving time by half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It&#x27;s a definite buy. I can&#x27;t imagine how better it&#x27;ll get as it more adjusts to my skin. Electric razors need 2-3 weeks to adjust to the thickness of your beard/stub. So if it performed this well on the first try, I don&#x27;t know how it can get better.</li>
            <li> I from China，I like it，It&#x27;s very nice.My face is cleaning.I hope I can use for ever.&lt;br /&gt;of course,the pirce is cheap too.</li>
            <li> The Jetclean unit malfunctioned after 1 week. Norelco offered to ship out a replacement. The unit has been on backorder since then, and I am still waiting for the replacement. As it turns out the shaver is very easy to clean and so you really don&#x27;t need a jetclean unit. Great shaver. I recommend ordering the shaver without the jetclean unit as it appears to be unnecessary. Also the cleaning fluid that comes with the jetclean has a very strong offensive [to some] smell and it will permeate everywhere. You can make your own fluid from alcohol and oil but that voids the warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this beautiful looking shaver from reading many reviews on the close smooth shaves without driving/stopping at stores to buy razors, besides I have 3 pugs at home that I feared would someday jump in the bathtub to find something to chew on. There is nothing cheap about this shaver! No more $30.00 every 3 months buying razors.</li>
            <li> Stars are fine but they don&#x27;t give a clear picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a top of the line (but old) Braun. Being a Norelco (now part of the Phillips line) I had high hopes for this unit. It functions well. The razor delivers a close smooth shave. The motor is a low torque so the thing sounds like its bogging down but never does. The cleaning system is superior to that of the Braun. It can also be cleaned by simply opening the heads and washing it under the tap. However, I would recommend the cleaning fluid since it is also a lubricant. The 3 head pod is easily replaced by simply gripping the pod firmly and pulling it from its support. The new 3 head pod can then be simply snapped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m light on the stars because I think this razor has a major problem. The problem is the battery system lasted only 2 weeks before it began to degrade (granted that no one actually needs 60 minutes to shave. But the razor was advertised that way and I expect to get what I spent $200 dollars for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original handle lasted approximately 2 weeks before the battery charge started to degrade to the point that a full charge became 36 minutes not 60. I contacted Phillips and they said to charge fully then discharge fully over a period of several days and the battery would return to the 60 minute full charge level. That never happened. So, re-contacting them they sent a new replacement handle. That was in mid February. I have contacted them again. The replacement handle received in mid February is now suffering from the same problem here at the end of March. With a 2 year warranty and a battery system that only last 6 weeks I&#x27;m going to go through quite a few handles.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift to my husband. He is very happy, and says it works great. He says It cuts very close, has a durable feel to it, and works quiet...</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best razor out there.  I&#x27;ve been an electric shaver since my teen years.  Thirty some years later, all I have ever owned is Norelco.  They last and give a great shave.  This one tops them all ... and I don&#x27;t have to clean it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this elsewhere about 4 months ago and have waited now to write a review since I was concerned about the rated battery capacity.  When I began using it, I found that the capacity rapidly dropped from 60 min (out of the box) to around 30 min after 2-3 discharge/recharge cycles.  I contacted Norelco and they sent a replacement handle.  I was also told that I should fully discharge before recharging because of a presumed memory effect (which I did not believe was supposed to be an issue with Li-ion batteries); that made no difference.  Roughly the same thing happened with the second handle.  Phoning Phillips again, I was told this time that the amount of energy used depended on shaving conditions and that the cutters required more force to move through shaving cream.  Up to then I had been using wet shave with a container of brush-applied shaving cream -- which was quite viscous.  After the cream ran out, I switched to the same brand of shaving soap -- which is less viscous.  Turns out that the battery capacity rose after 1-2 cycles to 41-42 min, which is where it is now.  Other than that I am very happy with the shaves -- much closer that my 10+ year-old Norelco with which I had dry-shaved until the head broke.  So . . . be prepared for the capacity to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your shaving conditions, which will probably mean that you will NOT get a full 60 min of shaving time.  If you can deal with that, it&#x27;s a very nice unit to use.  And realize that not all of the service techs at Norelcto will provide useful answers.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  I have used many different electrics over the years including many different Norelcos, Braun CC-790 and some Remingtons and this is the best by far.  I have thick and dark stubble so if a razor does not give me a close shave it is very obvious later in the day.  The Braun 790 and this razor both give me a very close shave but this one is much faster.  I can shave in under 3 minutes using this razor while the Braun 790 requires about 7 minutes for me.  I usually do not shave over the weekend and my previous electric razors (including Norelco 8240) would not give me a good shave with more than a days worth of stubble therefore I would use a fusion razor on Monday morning but this model mows through my beard with no problems which means I don&#x27;t have to use razor blades at all anymore.    My only complaint is the cleaning station.  I do not want to pay $5.00 for cleaning solution every two months so I do not use the cleaning base I simply rinse after each use and have had no problems.  If you can save money by getting one of the Sensotouch 3D models without the JetClean system then I would definitely do that.  To sum it up this model gives me a very fast and close shave that works just as well with a few days worth of growth which is something I have never been able to say about any other electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I kept. The morning shave in not a little torture for me anymore, I actually enjoy shaving now.   I had the 1280 for a few months now and can say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.   Pros:  - Virtually no irritation (!!!)  - Charges fast (60 minutes of charging will give you roughly 60 minutes of shaving) and holds the charge very well  - Looks great  - Very close and smooth shave  - Quiet  - Easy to clean and maintain  - Shaves with foam or gel (in my case wet shave is less irritating)  Con:  - The trimmer can use some improvement  Overall - 5 stars</li>
            <li> I took a chance getting an electric for my boyfriend: I had NO other good ideas this year! But he hates shaving and it takes him forever. Since he shaves in the shower, it&#x27;s also tough on the water bill. He had a 3- or 4-day beard going Christmas afternoon, and it took him about 3 minutes to shave it all off with the electric, and he was in LOVE. And nice and smooth! Now he shaves just about every day, since it takes two minutes and he can do it any time at all with very little prep or cleanup: just rinses the heads and he&#x27;s done. She shoots, she scores!</li>
            <li> Great razor, but upset about losing the upc label for the $30 rebate. I&#x27;ve got the receipt from the online sale. I&#x27;ve got the whole rest of the box as a reminder of my stupidity. Great Razor though! Best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought for my uncle, he really like it and feel very happy!  And the price is also good!Especially the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li> First some background on me:  I have what I consider to be a moderate beard - the only possible exception being the chin area which is hard to shave with either an electric or a razor.  In the past I have used electric shavers mostly - the most recent before this new Norelco being a Norelco 7825XL which I purchased in 2004.  When I needed a really close shave, I would use my multi-blade razor.  Over Christmas I decided to finally treat myself and upgrade to the 1280X with the cleaning system.  Plus my brother had the 1280X and recommended it highly to me and his beard is heavier than mine.  My thinking on getting the cleaning system was that I wanted some mechanism to clean out the skin oil in addition to the shavings.  Running the heads under the water after each shave (as I do) gets rid of the shavings, but I don&#x27;t think it flushes out all the skin oil.  Overall conclusion:  this electric razor is: (a) the best electric I have ever used, and (b) routinely gives me as close a shave as my razor without the mess and in considerably less time.  The test I use in judging a shaver is how much time has to elapse after the shave to get to the point that when I feel my face, it is clear to me that I need to shave.  With a razor I can easily go 24 hours before I begin to even think about shaving again.  With the old Norelco shaver, 24 hours was the maximum that I could comfortably go in between shavings.  And if it was date night, I would almost always shave again to remove the growth that had occurred since my morning shave.  The 1280X easily lets me go 24 hours in between shaves.  More about the shaver:  Since my old Norelco was a 2004 vintage, I was not terribly surprised that progress had been made in shaver design in the intervening 7 years.  There are 3 big differences:    1.  the shaver head which contains the 3 rotary blade assemblies \\&quot;floats\\&quot; which allows the individual shaver heads to adjust to the contour of my face and clearly is part of the reason I get a better shave.  If you look closely at the head assembly you will notice that (a) the entire assembly flexes, and (b) the individual razor assembly can also flex apart from the larger head assembly. Seems like a much improved design to me.    2.  I do not have to push down as hard as I did with the old Norelco to get a proper shave.  And except for the most difficult chin areas, I do not have go back and forth multiple times in order to get a good close shave there.    3.  Less of a big deal to me but still noticeable - the noise made by the razor is considerably less than my old Norelco.  Disclosure:  the shaver is designed to be used in the shower and/or with shaving creme.  I have not tried that since the dry shaving that I do gives me such great results.  The 1280X has a digital read-out on the body of the shaver telling you how many minutes of charge are remaining on the shaver&#x27;s rechargeable battery.  I have had the 1280X for about a month and a half and for me I am averaging about 2 minutes of battery usage per shave.  When the read-out got down to 4 minutes remaining (after about a month), I got the cleaner system out and did my first cleaning on the shaver.  Turns out it charges the shaver while it is doing the cleaning.  Back to the Jet Clean system - you start of by filling the bowl which is housed in the lower portion of the cleaning assembly with the cleaning solution provided.  Plug in the cleaning system, insert the 1280X shaver head down, and turn it on and walk away.  I had expected the cleaning solution to contain either alcohol or acetone, but not so according to the ingredients listed on the bottle.  Whatever is in the solution it did a great job of cleaning including the skin oil that inevitably gets into the shaver heads.  A hour or so later, the shaver was clean, dry and fully charged.  I then emptied out the solution into a travel bottle I had to hold the solution for re-use next month when I would repeat the entire process.  As I was transferringthe solution out of the cleaning system I purposely did not transfer the \\&quot;dregs\\&quot; if you will at the bottom of the bowl because there was clearly visible particulate matter in the solution.  No surprise there.  The solution is inexpensive and available on Amazon.  Traveling with the 1280X - From my experience so far I think I could travel with the 1280X for 25 days without needing to take the charging stand and cord with me - that&#x27;s assuming it was fully charged when I left (60 minutes of shaving time is the maximum charge).  If I was going to be traveling for 30 days or more - then no question those items would have to come with me.  If I could ask the engineers for one enhancement it would be the trimmer.  I actually like the trimmer on the old 7825XL better. Why ?  Well it extends out further from the body of the shaver and the trimmer is simply bigger.  I primarily use the trimmer for the pesky ear hair and while the trimmer on the 1280X does an OK job, the old trimmer was better.  Conclusion:  Highly recommended without reservation for all except for those few guys who have an exceptionally heavy beard. For those guys I would recommend at least checking the 1280X out if that is at all possible.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1280XCC The razor attention have been here for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the activity price is very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The design is beautiful. The tech is great. I just can&#x27;t get a very close shave without a LOT of extra time and effort that I shouldn&#x27;t need with an expensive shaver like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss my old Braun, but I guess even Braun doesn&#x27;t make them like they used to based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver i have ever encountered. It&#x27;s great. The feature of self cleaning is amazing. The closeness of the shave is just unbelievable. I don&#x27;t think i would ever go to another shaver again.</li>
            <li> this is the best razor ive ever baught, i dont see me buying another razor for awhile and that is amazing</li>
            <li> This is the deal. I purchase this because I have and old Philips Norelco that I was happy, but with this one having the 3D works great, less time of shaving since it only need a couple of passes and you are done</li>
            <li> Just purchased the Norelco 1280X, all the comments that I have read say that it&#x27;s an outstanding razor. I tried it this morning and it is much better  than the Panasonic dry/wet foil that I was using.  The Norelco shaves as close to any razor that I have used in the past.  After applying some pre-shave lotion, it glides on smoothly without any of the irritation that I had with the Panasonic.  And I highly recommend the seller, \\&quot;I need stuff\\&quot;  their items sell at a very good price and the company&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING.  They originally shipped the wrong item, but with ONE quick email the problem was corrected and I received the correct item within two days and they paid for the return shipping of the original item.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Norelco 1280/X and the \\&quot;I need Stuff\\&quot; store.</li>

            <li> this is a good one to use.&lt;br /&gt;my daddy like it very much!!&lt;br /&gt;this is a good one to use.&lt;br /&gt;my daddy like it very much!!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it!  He said it was the best shave he&#x27;s had!</li>
            <li> My husband has had a Brahn shaver for years and years. His was finally dying after probably 8+ years. He has sharper angles where his jaw line is and sometimes the Brahn shaver would miss these spots. So we looked into the rotary shavers. I would definatley recommend this one. He loves it. It gets around his jaw and on his neck really well and I think it gives him a closer shave as well. Better than the Brahn. He also has extremely course facial hair so this does the trick perfectly. It is also really easy to clean. I dont really think you need the cleaning solution very often at all if you just rinse out the blades after each use. It stays charged extremely well when he goes on longer business trips too. And the travel case for it is great too. It charges really fast as well. Super easy. Great shaver. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to say how great this shaver is I love it. It is probibly the most coomfortable shave I have ever had and there is no discomfort at all and it shaves so cloose and so easy.I had previously used Braun shavers for over 2 years and I am so glad I bought this shaver I can&#x27;t say how happy I am with it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a cllose comfortable shave!!</li>
            <li> Great product, my first time trying electric razors and I&#x27;m glad I choose Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Nice grip and good quality materials, the kit for washing the razor is also a great tool to use!</li>
            <li> This Machine Exceeds every Shaver i have ever used...Great feel, easy to handle.Look forward to many years of use. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are pricey</li>
            <li> like the cleaning that I give it daily by pushing a button and it gives an excellent close shave always</li>
            <li> This is really a great razor!  I have probably tried every type of electric razor on the market only to have to quit using them after several weeks due to severe neck skin irritation.  I have now used the Norelco Senso Touch for about 6 months with no similar problems (note that I use it wet with shave cream).  I suspect I would get some irritation if I used the razor dry, but why would I want to do that.  Using it wet with shave cream gives a very close shave with no skin irritation at all.  Razor is a little pricy, but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Extremely close shave that is as good as a Gillette razor blade.  Very comfortable and gets places where most other less expensive electric razors miss, like on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life as well.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this razor. I&#x27;ve had it for a little bit and frankly I don&#x27;t know what it does with the hair, I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet. I&#x27;m still on the first charge so I assume when it charges it gets rid of the hair by using it&#x27;s cleaning station. Very nice shave, not much different than the other Norelco razors I&#x27;ve had, but then again I use the nice ones. Much better than the other type of razors too very close shave. Has a very nice quality feel to it. And sounds neat too.</li>
            <li> Love this razor, best electric razor I have had, and I have had a few..............&lt;br /&gt;Would recomment this razor to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is my second razor. I was pleased with the first one and this is just as nice. The only difference is the upscale look outside. This would have been a 5 star rating except for the fact the Sku number showed it came with the electronic cleaner. It did not, but I was credited with $30.00 off of total price after I sent an email stating such. Very good electric razor though. It is on the pricey side, but for me worth it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, except when the blades(Head) wears out you must through it away.  They quit making the good RQ-12 Heads.  I tried the RQ-12+ heads and they were terrible.  Worst of all three times they elevated my concerns to a higher up supervisor who was to call me back before 48 hrs past and still no calls after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> i very much~~ philips norelco 1280xcc senso touch 3d electric razor  so good, so good so good sogood  so good!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;holds the hair so it doesn&#x27;t get all over the place&lt;br /&gt;wet or dry shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;takes double the time as a regular multi-blade gillette/schick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is well made, but it just takes way too long to get anywhere, and it is not as close as non-electric razors.</li>
            <li> Super wet shave withy new Notelco...by. by to my blade razor... super job with this creation!  Super wet shave, forever!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, with only two weeks of use my skin already accustomed to knife blades.&lt;br /&gt;I do not cause skin irritation, the cut is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just opened the box and pretty excited about this shaver.  The one thing that shaved off a star(zing!) is that they included 1 power cord for the 2 charging stations. What sense does that make??? At this price point, skimping out the extra 25 cents that the cord is probably worth is pretty bad in my opinion. I rather an extra cord versus the traveling pouch that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never use.  Aside from that little bump, I can’t wait to take it for a spin (terrible pun I know).</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on the web and this razor and the Braun reviewed about the same but since I had used rotary&#x27;s only before decided to stick with them and this razor hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. Extremely close shave and I&#x27;m fascinated by the cleaning cycle !</li>
            <li> The best razor I have ever owned, hands down, you can not beat this razor!  Recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great shave!</li>
            <li> Flagship product, has the very high technological content, a lot of new technology, can greatly improve the use experience, exquisite packaging, very suitable as a gift</li>
            <li> This product and all associated with it is for the *******.  I purchased this similar item back in 2011-12 time frame and after about 2-3 re-charges&lt;br /&gt;it would only charge 48min and 2-3 charges later dropped down to 38min where it held. When it was about time to purchase me second replacement head I found a new complete razor for less than the price of the replacement head (which is totally overpriced).  I ordered and received my new razor and the second time I recharged my razor it would only recharge to 38 minutes.  I evaluation is that this is ALL **** ! ! !</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from a similar model that was 2D and about 4 years old (the battery died on me and couldn&#x27;t be brought back to life).  I thought moving from from 2D to 3D would be amazing, but I&#x27;ve gotten so used to shaving with the old 2D model that I think I preferred that one.  Even with that being said, this model is very quiet and does a great job.  I usually do a wet shave, but I have dry shaved a few times with it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating (though a wet shave will always get closer than a dry one).</li>
            <li> This razor is &amp;#34;badass&amp;#34;, my guy loves this thing so much. Probably the best gift I ever got him cause he gets so much use out of it. Still works like new too.</li>
            <li> This is electric shaver 3 over a several year period. Best one so far. The cleaning fluid lasts a long time, and the other features are great (LED display for charge time left, ease of use with the 3 heads, locking capability for travel, etc). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband figured it was too expensive.  I wanted to get it for him.  He finally gave in.  He loves it.  Says every time he uses it, that it is so smooth,  he can hardly feel  it.  I said, as the ad said, &amp;#34;Like robot kisses!&amp;#34;  I plan to gift my sons with one each.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant, as I tried an electric razor when I was younger (18, now 33). The ability to use shaving cream has helped greatly with the transition from a manual razor. There has been a lot less irritation than with a manual razor, actually. The automatic cleaning system is wonderful. If you register online, you get an additional 6 month warranty (for a total of 2 1/2 years). If you are on the fence, get it! You will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> My [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Nanotech Blades for Men]]was much cheaper at around $75.  But it was getting a bit long in the tooth.  What really annoyed me was that if I rinsed the Panasonic and left it together it would have a musty smell later.  So this time I looked at the Braun 7-Series, the Panasonic ARC IV, and this Philips Norelco 1280x/42 AKA Series 8900 Shaver and settled on this based on reviews.    I first ordered this from Amazon in Frustration Free Packaging and it arrived used -- hair on the inside carton.  I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with while on its way to me or not.  So I returned it and went for the normal packaging (Blister pack in a box) which arrived nice and new with no hair.    I was originally very happy with this shaver -- it was very gentle but I started getting ingrown hairs.   I also noticed that going over my face after using the norelco with my [[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B]]mobile shaver -- the M60 was able to shave closer than the norelco.  I think I paid $7 at the exchange for my AA operated Braun.  6 months after buying the Norelco I am going to go back to shaving with my dual edge safety razor for a few weeks and try the[[ASIN:B00BWRLJ6O BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]and [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc4 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System for Men]]  I will update based on how those electrics work out for me once the ingrowns clear.ving with the double edge is more for the experience and not as convenient at 4AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, super happy with this shaver and sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for myself and could not be more pleased. Opperates as advertised and I get a confortable clean shave. Very easy to clean under hot water or just use the brush. It took a few minutes to figure out how to use the auto cleaning box with the cleaning solution...once I did it also works great. I&#x27;ve had it about a month and I am done with the Bic razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it had such great reviews.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of beard other people have but this razor doesn&#x27;t get it done.  This razor is a money pit in my opinion.  You have to continue to buy cleaning solution, shaving cream, and replacement blades yearly.  If you have a heavy beard I suggest saving your money and stick with blade razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend couple years ago for Christmas and he loves it. The shave is great, the cleaning tray is great and the razor itself is nicel great buy and would definitely stick to this brand</li>
            <li> This razor provides a shave as close as a blade. It is easy to use and has a sleek styling.</li>
            <li> I have not had a good shave in fifty years until i purchased the norelco 1280 xcc.&lt;br /&gt;It took about two weeks for my beard to get used to it but now it shaves great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give the razor 4 start, but the cleaning station broke. I&#x27;ve barely used it since purchasing it, but once I started using it again it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Was a present for my husband. Still work fine he love this Razor.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, wonder why Philips stopped making it. Oh yea, can&#x27;t make $$ if you make them too good.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best for people who hate shaving! It makes it quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;The only one problem that I have is that if I shave too frequently without letting my hair grow out a little bit it can sometimes give me an ingrown hair. Other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a change from the Braun that I&#x27;ve had for years. I liked the Braun but this one does give a much closer shave and does not pull longer hairs if I let me beard go for a few days. Very quiet and efficient in operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only recommendation would be to relocate the charger plug. Current location keeps the unit from being tucked into a corner and unnecessarily takes up more top space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great shaver and I am glad I chose this one from all the competition.</li>
            <li> does  a good fast job</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what it does. I was in a hurry to replace my 10 year old Philips shaver and honestly its only slightly better performance wise. Maybe that speaks to the quality of Philips shavers. There are 3 huge benefits though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting rechargeable battery (fast recharge)&lt;br /&gt;Water Proof (love this)&lt;br /&gt;Close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really need the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm - smooth shave. The self-clean feature is bonus for my husband. He spent his first couple of uses just playing with his new toy!</li>
            <li> Having used a Norelco shaver for years, I&#x27;m familiar with the benefits and limitations of an electric shaver.  Until now.  To me, this was an odd-looking shaver... but since it was to be a gift, with no ceiling on the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have used this shaver now for almost two weeks.  The shave has become more close with each shave.  But the most important thing to me is that this in an incredibly quiet shaver!  Much quieter than any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever used.  The cleaning system has thus-far been great!  I am very satisfied and would recommend this shaver without reservation.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1280XCC SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  is very good,i enjoy it very much,the charging time is short and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> Shaves a full month without a charge! Better than a trac 2. Best I&#x27;ve ever used in 53 years of shaving!</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco 1280X/42 Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000), is just what I needed to get the clean, close shave I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;desired. I&#x27;m more than happy  with my new razor.</li>
            <li> Let me set the background for you: I have been shaving over half a century now. Long ago I became convinced triple-header IS the way to go, and for many years I felt that Norelco produces excellent razors. I believe this review is without prejudice, but I wanted all of the cards out on the table. In addition, besides shaving my face, less the area around my goatee, I also shave the sides and back of my head where the remnants of my scalp attempt, pitiably, to grow&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product is not just a razor, it is a shaving system. Not only to you get a razor, but it also comes with a device that deep cleans the shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the razor:&lt;br /&gt;1. It contains its own battery, so you are not chained to an outlet while you shave. Potentially useful, if not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery will last a month, easy. It shows the charge on a display in the handle, which measures the strength of the battery in remaining minutes, with a cap at 60. Given that my shaving, both face and head, takes less than 2 minutes, there is no issue if you want to use it that long without recharging. And I suspect it will go longer than 60 minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;3. I used to be that in order to clean your razor, you had to:&lt;br /&gt;  a. Remove the head&lt;br /&gt;  b. Remove the bracket that head the razor nodules in&lt;br /&gt;  c. Take the actual razors out of the protective shield that runs across your skin, and clean each piece separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all you have to do is flip up each individual node and brush off the heads and catch basin. After that I rinse it under the water to flush out anything I may have missed. This I do on a daily basis. I then leave the shaving module open, to dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cleaning system:&lt;br /&gt;Once every week or so, I will, after doing the daily cleaning, which takes about 30 seconds, place the razor in the cleaning device, after having filled that with the cleaning solution. I then turn on the cleaning system and it will periodically dunk the heads into the solution and turn the razor on and off several times while the heads are submerged. It then brings the heads out of the solution, lets the solution drip off, then repeat the process. I walk away once I get it started because it will do it for some time and it can take care of itself – it doesn’t need us humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is incredible. My skin is smooth after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have about this system is the price. I’ve never before spent even $100 for a razor, this one, on sale, was over $200. However, the adage “You get what you pay for” comes true in a very positive way. Under the presumption that this system will last many years, it should still be very worthwhile acquisition. The manufacturer recommends that the head assembly be replaced every year, and I’m sure that that will cost a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have nothing but praise for the system. I will update the post in a year to let you know how it is performing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright, for me it&#x27;s Braun. I returned this item. irritation. missed lots of hairs on the neck and chin. The Braun 3 series is better. The 7 series shouldn&#x27;t be compared to this. it&#x27;s like comparing a Fiat to BMW. they are just not the same league. Always hated rotary shavers. the reviews on this are so good, i had to order it and try. For me personally, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you be the judge as to whether it is worth its very high price, but this next generation of shavers can replace a shaving blade.  It is extraordinary how far electric shavers have come.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned!  Wet or dry, clean smooth shave, easy to clean up afterwards.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Do not purchase! They replaced the shaving heads from RQ12 to RQ12+. The RQ12+ heads do not come close to the original and pull hairs. Look at the reviews on Amazon for confirmatio. The original RQ12 replacement heads are still on the market, but sell for $180+ due to high demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor requires a replacement head once a year, so get ready to spend some money just to maintain. That, along with the cleaning fluid that you have to replace every 2 weeks, makes this razor even more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the expense, and buy their new Series 9000 razor. Its only $200 and the replacement heads are much cheaper. Norelco is unfortunately the best rotary razor out there. Even though this product will clean you dry, their new one won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Norelco razor, I at first thought this razor sounded slow.  However, this quietness was only a welcome change as it was quick and very maneuverable.  Best of all, it gave a close smooth shave...with none of the friction of a usual electric shave.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job / like shaving with a razor .</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  Cleaning system does a great job.</li>
            <li> This one is better than any other Razer,&lt;br /&gt;I love it when use it first time :.&lt;br /&gt;quick charge lasts longer</li>
            <li> I have used the Philips Norelco 1280XCC Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor for almost 3 weeks now and have been mostly impressed with its performance. The shaver has lived up to its reputation. I will say that in my opinion it takes longer for me to get as close of a shave as a standard razor provides but has the capabilities to do so. Once you get use to it you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> As advertised, works great, including in the shower.</li>
            <li> Now that I have had this awhile, I feel although this is an expensive Razor it is a great razor. It gives a smooth shave and the battery has 60 minutes of charge. This is a big plus since I travel constantly. I have had many different Razors and this is the best!</li>
            <li> its good for keeping a nice look ,travel a lot ,but nothing beats a razor shave, after one yr. , you have to replace the heads [very expensive] the cover for the head breaks easily, they only warranty the motor , my saving  heads were scratching my face, I called they do not warranty blades . if defective. to me their warranty is worthless.  always find out more about a product before you buy , the replacement  blade are over 100.00   to have a razor for one yr. , and have  the expense to up keep it ,I will go back to the razor there customer relations to me, are a low standing  .</li>
            <li> this is perfect. very easy to use, and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;hope the battery can use for long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing!  Cleans itself too.  Yes, the cleaning solution is not cheap, about $4 per month, according to others....  Seriously, $4 per month?  For something I don&#x27;t have to think about?  Sounds great.  Was using an ancient Norelco that I had put numerous new blades in.  This thing cuts way closer and smoother wit no hassles.  The only very minor issue is the cutting heads are slightly larger than the old models so getting right up under your nose takes a little more effort.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Having exclusively used Norelco (and 1 Remington) shavers over the past 30 years, I can say that this is by far the best shaver I have used yet.  Here&#x27;s what I like:    * Gives a great shave  * Very quiet  * Charges quickly  * Alot less irritation than previous razors.  I think the fact that the heads move to the contour of your face has alot to do with that.  * Alot easier to hold  * Looks stylish, alot slimmer than previous models    My previous top-of-the-line Remington had the cleaning kit (similar to the Norelco setup).  I never really liked having to buy the cleaning fluid, and changing the filters, etc. (kind of messy).  But, it was a gift, so I dealt with it.      While looking at these newer Norelco units, I was already biased into feeling that I \\&quot;needed\\&quot; a unit with the Jet Clean system.  Today, while at Costco (sorry Amazon), my wife bought me the Norelco 1280x (no cleaning kit) as an early Xmas present (it&#x27;s the \\&quot;Premium Edition\\&quot;, $169.99 after Costco&#x27;s current $30 off coupon - a good deal, I thought).  After using the unit, I am very pleased with the shaving performance, as well as the cleaning.      The unit cleans very easily by running hot water on the blades for a few minutes (per the manual), after which you can open up the blades (they flip up) and continue to rinse.  It&#x27;s recommended that you do this after every shave, but who wants to do that every morning, right before work (not me, anyway)?  I can see how doing this at least a few days a week will keep the unit very clean, without the hassle and expense of dealing with the cleaning fluid.  Looking forward to more clean shaves with my new shaver.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used both blade and electric razors.  There has not been a single electric that I had found that would shave as close as a blade.  Wether shaving with electric or blade, I&#x27;ve always gotten fairly irritated because of my skin.  I only have some mild irritation on my lower neck from this unit.    I picked up the 1280xcc off of a display of razors, of which the most expensive should have been $89.99. When rung up she told me it was on sale for 299.99 with a $30 rebate.  I asked her about the display, after confirming it, she did a $210 price adjustment.  Enough about that.    This is one of the quietest electrics I&#x27;ve ever used, being pleasantly suprised by the tone.  It doesn&#x27;t have the high-pitch whine I often would hear from other motors either (I have very sensitive hearing).  My wife didn&#x27;t even realize I was shaving until I came out showing her the razor.    It is a very nice experience using this razor, after being used to the tugs and snags of other electrics, or the general roughness that some of the others had left behind.  In general it was quicker than me using a blade or other electrics.  I attribute that to the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; movement of the blades.</li>
            <li> Got this couple of days ago, and gave it a shot yesterday...  I was amazed and stunned by the output, it gave me the best shave I have experienced...so far, more info below...    Normally, I use a regular Gillette shaver and then I use my Panasonic electric shaver to get a complete shave. Yesterday, I used my new Senso 1280xcc without the gillette and man, what a finish...    It even passed my ultimate test, my 5 yr old little girl who does not like me having \\&quot;pokies\\&quot; on my face...she said, she did not feel any pokies...seriously, even my wife felt it was a smooth pokie free shave.    I use a wet shave process with Edge Shaving Gel (Aloe). This Norelco shaver was flawless and it&#x27;s so quiet that no one knew i was shaving.    Will update again after 2 more weeks...</li>
            <li> I am not one for writing reviews but let me say this....... I will never use any other razor again!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best Electric Razor I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I thought my Philips Norelco 1050CC Arcitec Men&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be topped but this razor is night and day difference better. I always wet shave and you weren&#x27;t suppose to do that with the Arcitec but this magnificent razor lets you shave either dry or wet. The shave is so incredibly comfortable, so incredibly smooth yet so close and left 0 irritation on me. Very easy to clean. I clean manually with water and use the jet cleaner when I recharge the razor, Really this is simply the best. Bravo</li>
            <li> Best Shave I have ever had. Close shave but comfortably, quick &amp; easy. Charge time seems to last many Shaves.  Easy to clean &amp; maintain.  I have always owned Electric Shavers &amp; also used Razor types &amp; no doubt this is easily the very best experience  &amp; totally happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for most of my adult life, I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their ability to give a close shave and their long lives.  My wife bought this one for me and I have to say I am even more impressed than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used it just as I have every electric for the last 20 years, just the shaver and my face.  This worked well, gave me a shave that was markedly better than my previous Norelco but it wasn&#x27;t something that made me say WOW...  So, on a whim I decided to try out the wet shaving method.  Like I said I&#x27;d never done this before and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference...well, was I in for a shock!  Using this and some Gillette shaving gel I get a shave that would rival anything I could get from a manual razor AND no nicks, cuts or bloody shirts!  No joke, I can run my hand UP my face and not feel any stubble...and this is an electric!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, I am really impressed, my wife loves it and I go around rubbing my face all day amazed at the shave and probably looking like an idiot.  Seriously guys, it is that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I really like with this that I&#x27;ve never had before...the cleaning system seems to work really well, I use it about once every 3 days (I rinse it with very hot water after every shave) and that seems to keep it very clean and free of debris.  I think it&#x27;s great that while cleaning the shaver recharges as well, keeping it charged for me.  I love the &#x27;3d&#x27; head, it&#x27;s so much easier getting around my face and feeling like I don&#x27;t miss spots.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have regretted getting the &#x27;2d&#x27; shaving heads as opposed to this &#x27;3d&#x27; model. The shaver has a very unique and svelte design which I love, it fits well in your hand and is lightweight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to give some cons too but all I can come up with is that the cleaning station is a little big and it does take up counterspace...and the plug is kinda big which for me is good since you&#x27;re supposed to unplug it after charging or cleaning and my wife needs all the plugs for her hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be interested over the long term how this shaver holds up, it worries me a little that the lockdown mechanism for the shaver head will stop latching correctly as the pieces for that seem rather fragile.  Also these &#x27;lock&#x27; open for manual rinsing and drying and I wonder if, over time, that will quit working correctly.  I guess that&#x27;ll be something I can update on later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell I am very impressed so far and I hope I still will be in six months or a year, every indication is that I will be!  Thank you Philips Norelco for another great product and thank you Amazon for another GREAT deal on this great shaver!and my wife needs all the plugs for her hair...

            <li> This razor does everything as advertised.  I have been using Norelco electric razors for years and this is the best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This shaver was purchased as a replacement for my Braun 7 series.  I have not tried the wet shave, which other reviewers report is even better than the dry shave, but the dry shave for me was very good.    This is an expensive product and there are a couple of annoying areas which Philips really should have thought about.    The major down side is that the shaver should not be left plugged in to the mains once the battery is charged.  This is very inconvenient particularly if you use the jet clean system.  It is very irritating to have to take the shaver out of the jet clean system once it has finished cleaning or charging.  The clean cycle takes quite some time.  Users are unlikely to be waiting around for the cleaning process to finish so that they are there to take the shaver out of the cradle or unplug the cradle from the wall.  If the user does leave the shaver pugged in, then it is possible to hear a clicking sound as the shaver keeps trying to recharge every second once the shaver is fully charged.  Obviously this is going to shorten the life of the product.    The second disappointment is the quality of the stand (not the jet clean system but the small plastic stand).  It is very flimsy.  If you are travelling with your shaver and you are likely to need to recharge the shaver while you are away, then you have to take the stand with you as there is no direct connection to the shaver other than the stand.  Of course, the stand does not fold or fit into the shaver carrying case.    These are small matters that with a little more attention to detail Philips could have easily addressed.      On balance the quality and quietness of the shave inclines me to rate the product highly.  I would have gone for five star if it had not been for the niggly issues.    Come on Philips you could do better!</li>
            <li> I can say it is durable and made with quality. I use it in the shower and dry, never fails.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor to replace a Norelco \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; model that died after about 3 years of use. I would not consider a razor that could not be used in the shower, as I personally feel that you can get a closer shave by using a wet razor when your skin and hair are saturated with water.    This model had all of the features I was looking for, including a \\&quot;time left\\&quot; display so your razor wont simply just die in the shower mid-shave. The cool skin lotion pump on my last razor was more of a gimmick in my opinion, as I rarely purchased the lotion kits to refill. Needless to say, this feature was not high on my replacement list.    The contraption that this razor charges in is huge, mainly due to the cleaning basin that is below. The razor mechanically gets lowered into the cleaning solution by the catch arm when you initiate a cleaning cycle. I prefer minimalistic, simple designs, for which this razor does not have. The charging / cleaning base seems way over-engineered for what its purpose is. The box does include a more compact travel charger for those who do not wish to put a boat on their bathroom vanity.    The shave quality is good, which I expected from the Norelco brand and this price point. It works well wet, cutting slightly closer than my old Norelco. The retractable groomer blade is a neat addition, so you dont have to search for blades when you want to trim sideburns and such.    Overall, this razor performed to expectations and is made well. Norelco should reengineer the dock to be more compact and simple than the monstrosity that it currently is. If you are like me, you will love the razor but wonder that they were thinking when designing the cleaning / charging dock.</li>
            <li> somehow after 6 months of use or so..lost interest as it was hurting my skin and taking long time compared to razor....</li>
            <li> This shaver is so great! Easily cuts hairs even when you haven&#x27;t shaved in longer than normal. Easy to clean via water (When traveling) or via the included cleaner. The cleaning solution is inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> very nice! My husband likes it very much! We had introduced to our freinds. They also hope to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric razors i have ever owned. It took about a week for my beard to adjust, but now I get an incredibly close shave from this electric razor. It is a bit expensive, but is still cheaper than buying blades each week.</li>
            <li> I was dubious to spend this kind of money on a razor but after using it for a week I fell in love with it. Easy to use and it shaves close. The cleaning system works flawlessly and keeps the razor clean and sanitary for the next shave. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I loved this thing, but I cannot get good replacable blades. The RQ12+ blades are terrible, they barely give me a shave.</li>
            <li> Like shaving with a smooth damp wash cloth. Check other prices for possible better deals, have seen in the one forty range!</li>
            <li> Purchase as a Christmas Gift for my Husband.  He just loves it.  Use wet or dry and the result, is a clean, close shave.  Also want to note, searched before purchase the cost for replacement cleaning fluid and heads, and found all are reasonably price.  This product appears to be designed to last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hesitant to pay this much for a razor.  I have only had it for about a month but it is the closet shave I have had in a while.  My last two, or is it three, razors were also Norelco and they did a pretty good job but I have a thin face with some angles that were difficult to get a close shave.  Just under my chin was one area and this razor does a very good job there as well as the neck.</li>
            <li> love it !! - i use it with shaving cream and it is smooth and gentle to the skin. but prepare to spend money on the the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> It had been many years since I have used an electric razor. Normally my Norelco&#x27;s were around the $40-60 price range and would last (battery/blades) about 2-3 years. I&#x27;d change out the blades if the battery hung on and use the razor a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was getting this as Christmas Gift for myself and we are living in the Motorhome during the snowy cold part of the season in Colorado I decided to return to an electric I could also use in the shower once we move into our house in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;We have to take Navy showers (6 gal water heater). scrinping on hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like not having to set closeness of the razor and still getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- the charge lasted me almost a month before having to recharge the battery. (usually only takes about 2 - 3 minutes to shave).&lt;br /&gt;- Clean up was fairly easy, only issue is one of the heads doesn&#x27;t always stay open when i&#x27;m brushing out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;- it takes up less space on the counter then previously.&lt;br /&gt;- very nice carrying case&lt;br /&gt;- charges up quickly, if needed, but if you leave it on it will charge and (to me) seems to hold the charge better/longer.&lt;br /&gt;- using it with a wet beard was a piece of cake, even if its an all weekend beard on Monday AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used shaving cream with this unit yet and next weekend I plan to use the solution to clean up the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far this has been worth the money spent on it, even if I picked it out  myself for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Wife is happy w/ the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Outstanding shave! Closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had,over 2-3 decades of using various electrics. Comfortable, easy to use and clean and Jet clean system is worth the price of admission! I even use it to shave my head occasionally (I&#x27;m bald...) and it does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> my husband want to change his old one. And he needs a strong one. So I choose this and it is helpful.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend, but was very disappointed with it. It seems to only work when there is a small amount of stubble. When shaving after letting it grow out for a few days (maybe a 1/8 inch), it doesn&#x27;t work at all. He ended up shaving with a plain old razor blade after trying to get this fancy one to work... Just doesn&#x27;t cut a few days growth! This razor might be good for someone who shaves every single day, but for people who shave every few days it just doesn&#x27;t work well. Very disappointed considering the price.</li>
            <li> As a person who used arcitec for several years, this Sensotouch 3D device is giving me a nice time shaving my face either wet or dry. Faster, cleaner and with less irritation. If your have an Arcitec which has a body with a healthy motor you can just change the head and put a Sensotouch 3D head on it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> When used with a pre-shave lotion it shaves more closely on the face and neck than the Braun.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun for several years and thought it was the best.I needed a new shaver and had never used a Norelco so I gave this one a try.Yes it does cost more than most,but after the first time I used it I&#x27;m sold.They tell you to give it 21 days to get used to it and get a good shave I noticed how well it did on day one.It does not sound like a weed wacker very quite and you can just rinse it clean a plus or use the jet clean system.Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  It cuts extremely close (especially when wet), has a neat looking LCD display that tells you the minutes remaining in the battery, and is well built/finished.    My only complaint about the shaver is it does not lay flat or have a hole to thread a string handle.  This makes it difficult to put down within the shower once my shave is completed.  My solution was just to place it within a cup in the shower.    There seems to be no logical reason to get the 1290 vs. 1280.  While I have not used the 1290, I did research both and could not find any reason it was a better \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; other than some \\&quot;touchscreen button\\&quot;.  Since the 1280 includes the cleaning system for the same price as the 1280 I elected to go with the 1280.      Also, I am not sure if it is mentioned but this shaver can not plug-in directly into the wall.  It needs to be plugged into the cleaning system or a small stand, both of which are included.  If you travel for extended periods it would be neccessary to bring the stand with you on travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric razors over the years, especially Norelco, this is by far the best yet. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave, its fast without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun for years to shave my face. One of my pet peeves is how, when shaving my neck, I have to shave six different directions at least a dozen times.     It was totally logical to me that the \\&quot;counter-rotating blades\\&quot; would be able to cut my beard much more quickly. Each rotating blade taking a different angle over the surface with one stroke. Totally logical ... and totally didn&#x27;t work that way.     Kudos to the manufacturer for offering a trial period. I&#x27;ll be returning this item with the knowledge that I&#x27;m not missing out.</li>
            <li> I previously had 2 Norelco 8138 speed XLs. The shave was impressive but it was time to replace the heads. Went on line and saw the Norelco 1280cc. I thought it was a little high priced, but wondered if it cold be worth twice as much as the 8138. First time I used it I decided it was. I went back and purchased heads for the 8138 just so I would have a fair comparison and I will have a hard time using the 8138 again. Shaving time is only about 2 minutes now and this razor gets all the wiskers. I have always had problems in the past with 1 or two whiskers that would get missed and grow long. With the 1280 I don&#x27;t have to worry about missing one even after three days of not shaving. I hope the head last as long as the speed XL because I see it cost 1/2 what the razor does. The only thing I would do different is get one without the jet clean system. Just oppening the heads and rinsing it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for one month now, and it is the best electric shaver I have ever used. The shave I get is comparible to blades and shaving cream! Shaves my face beautifully, but my true test is my neck which gave all electric shavers I have tried problems. This shaver does my neck equally as well as my face. The charge lasts about 25 days and it is easy to clean under warm water. Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> In my 10+ years of shaving with an e-shaver, I&#x27;ve owned the following two brands Braun + Panasonic.   I almost bought another Panasonic since I was completely satisfied with the last 6 years of its performance, but I instead opted to try the Philips Norelco 1280Xcc---WOW, I am so happy with the Norelco.  I&#x27;ve experienced great results with a new shaver head on my Panasonic, but even with a new shaver head the Panasonic does not compare to the Norelco&#x27;s close shave performance.  It is well worth the money and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great shave, smooth and close without irritation to the skin.  I am on the go and this works out great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and easy to clean!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and gives me a close share.  Very happy with my razor!</li>
            <li> first electric shaver I have ever used more than once or twice. this one is a keeper. the charge holds up very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and good to use! I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving foam where to buy.I think i need one.&lt;br /&gt;OK thanks</li>
            <li> After buying an expensive Braun shaver, with the expensive cleaning cartridge, I was leery on spending a lot of money for the 1280X/42. I have sensitive skin, and i&#x27;m very happy with this shaver. I use the wet option with any shaving cream and it works great. My only complaint is you have to unplug the unit after it recharges or damage the batteries. Also you can&#x27;t charge the shaver without the cleaning base, a problem if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> Summary:  What I like:   - Easy to use / fits well in my hand   - Easy to clean   - Can be used wet   - Can be used more than once with limited skin irritation  What could be better:   - Neck area still not as close as a blade without having to press / redo area multiple times.   - A limit on charging the razor from the cleaner (there should be an option to clean / charge or just clean).  The recharging on this shaver is confusing and it seems like you can ruin if if you leave it plugged in.   - A better way to shave corners (it is rotary).  Review:  This razor is almost perfect (is there a really perfect shaver, even if you use a blade?).    Background:  I researched high and low for electric razors as I was tired of paying for blades (they need to be sharp to get close and do not last long).  If you use blades, my recommendation is to use at least a 3 blade razor with Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream - it is, by far, the best shaving cream I have used with a blade (I have not used a safety razor and soap).  I receive VERY close shaves with a blade and Kiehl&#x27;s.  I wanted to move from nicks and cuts to easy and and no cuts, even though Kiehl&#x27;s works well in this area.  Enter my history with electric razors.  My first was a braun many years ago, which was not close so I did not use electric razors for many year afters.  Wanting to experiment again, I went to a cheaper Remington about 8 years ago - the MS-280.  It was a lower cost brand, BUT I could get a close shave with this foil shaver. It took more than 10 minutes each time and was DRY only (use remington face saver with this - it works well).  Neck is not as close as a blade, but is near blade status, if you spend the time.  I had to go over the same areas in different directions (up/down, side to side and diagonal).  It did work well but was cheap (on / off button wore off and foils had to be replaced often).  It was also very noisy.  Now, enter the 3D.  It works as it says, wet or dry, which I love.  I have used both and will shave wet most of the time after a shower with little risk of cuts.  It is quiet and comes with a cleaning machine, which I thought was a gimmick but it works well (I have the 3 mode model, but I assume the next level down shaver, which only has 1 cleaning cycle, does the same cleaning).  I can receive as close a shave as a blade except for the neck area.  It comes close but I am resigned to the fact that only a blade will remove it as well as it removes it from my face.  All electric razors I have used, sans the early Braun (they did not have the brauns they have today so please place it in perspective), have shaved my face well and as close as a blade (but not as fast as a blade).    Why I am sticking with the Philips 3D - the shave is very close to a blade.  It does not cut me and I can shave more than once in a day if I had to (try that with a blade without tearing your skin up).  I can use it wet or dry.  Using it wet is very easy and useful.  And it is easy to clean.  I also reviewed the Panasonic, which I was very close in trying / buying because I did like the Remington foil shaver (3D is rotary).  The Braun was out for me since I wanted something I could use in the shower / wet although they receive very good reviews.    The charging on this unit could be better.  It is confusing to leave it in the cleaner when it will recharge it every time, which I do not think the manufacturers prefer (the instructions are contradictory - why use the cleaning machine when you cannot run the battery level down if you use it?).  The unit should have a clean and clean/charge option.  This was a miss by Philips.  I do have a work around - by a Belkin Conserve power plug.  It has a shut-off of 30 mins, 3 or 6 hours.  I use the 30 minutes with the Auto / Eco mode (which cuts the drying cycle short) and the 3 hour with the intensive clean.  This type of technology, again, should be built into the razor outfit - definitely a design flaw, but it does not impact the shaving.  Bottomline: A very good razor that comes very close to a blade.  It does what it does well and you do not have to spend time maintaining it.  There are some items that could have been designed better for the overall experience, but they do not influence the shaving.  This is a nice product for an everyday task that needs to get done (in my world it does).</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco. The last one lasted almost ten years. Hope this one holds up just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are expensive though.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and was a little skeptical about how close of a shave i could get. It works great and with shaving cream I think it gets just as close as a razor.  Great product!</li>
            <li> If you have a goatee, get this shaver!  Heck, even if you don&#x27;t, this is the best on the market.  This is my third Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to the SensoTouch 3D 1280X.  I still have the first one and keep it in my car for when I&#x27;m really in a rush to get out of the house - after 15 years it still runs strong and does a good job.  My second one was the SmartTouch XL (9160) and frankly it was worse than my old one (I keep it around for the trimmer).  Last year I found the SensoTouch 2D 1150 on sale and tried it ... I was very disappointed, not only with the shave, but also because it didn&#x27;t have a trimmer.  I returned it to Macy&#x27;s.  The 3D is a whole different animal.  The way it cuts the longer hairs ... you know, the ones electric razors usually miss, or like when you haven&#x27;t shaved for 2-3 days ... is amazing.  But what I really love is how it will glide around a goatee (or beard or mustache) and get all the little hairs without pulling and catching on the longer hairs nearby.  I&#x27;ve never had an electric that could do that.  And, like they advertise, it is the closest shave this side of a blade and doesn&#x27;t rough up your skin.  I got the model with the cleaner and I really like that too.  Sure you can rinse it out yourself and get it pretty clean, but the automatic cleaner really does an excellent job and leaves a very pleasing fresh scent.  I use it about every 5 or 6 shaves.  There are a few negatives though, which is why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but they are fairly minor.  First, the trimmer is sub-standard and just barely does the job.  It&#x27;s better than not having one, but it doesn&#x27;t measure up to what Norelco used to put on their shavers.  It&#x27;s a mystery to me why.  Second, pulling each individual head out to manually clean the unit under the faucet is kind of a pain.  I preferred the older models that could be opened with just the flip of your thumb, but maybe the intricate design of the heads prevents that.  Maybe they could add a push-button on the next model.  And lastly, the travel pouch is just ridiculous.  It&#x27;s this huge triangular thing that is not form-fitting and way too big.  The time I used it on vacation, it would barely fit in my shaving kit and when I got to my hotel the razor head assembly had fallen out of the body.  It looks pretty I guess, but it&#x27;s very impractical.  All in all, I highly recommend the 1280X.  I actually look forward to shaving with it.</li>
            <li> I love the setup, it works great and gives a very close shave, it is not blade but that&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve seen in 25 years; since I started shaving.  The 3D help with covering some spot on the edge of the face that was hard to get otherwise on a first pass or even 10 with my other ones.  The cleaning machine is awesome, seeing the razor automatically go down to get clean in the solution by the press of a button is just as sophisticated as it sounds, the razor come on and off by itself to ensure the cleaning is done properly and gives you the best smelling and clean shave.  I would recommend this to anyone with a bit of extra money to get the good and fun stuff.  My older daugther was in AH! and my wife had to experiment with it just because it looked so cool.  Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> So far so good. What a terrific shaver. Light weight, great design, easy to clean. The cleaning unit is fully automated and is neat to watch. I look forward to many years of trouble-free shaving.</li>
            <li> I did so much research on what my next electric razor would be and was really hoping this razor would meet my expectations.  Well it definitely did, this razor is such a great piece of ingenuity!  I have sensitive skin so can&#x27;t use a razor blade all the time and wanted something as close to a shave as I could get and shaving with this thing dry is so flawless! Though, when used wet with shaving gel... WOW!  It&#x27;s really really hard to tell which shaves closer between an actually razor blade or this Norelco.  I highly recommend it, I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my purchase.  The razor is very easy to clean by itself so those who don&#x27;t want to pay extra for the cleaning station, don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s solely for luxury.  The 1250x and 1290x will do just fine without the cleaning station, and can be cleaned just as well under the sink in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> Improved greatly from 10 years ago--easy to clean--seems fragile but I will adjust. Norelco has been with me since.....Bruce(customer) is 69.</li>
            <li> Product got here quick but am disappointed that there is no way to replace the battery. If the battery dies, you are to throw it in the trash as stated in the literature!! I was told that it would run with the cord or with the battery by someone at Norelco. NOT TRUE! It is battery operated only and for what it costs, I am not sure that the shave is worth it.  Still getting used to it but for now, it does not give a good shave. Also, the replacement heads are really expensive! Without the ability to replace the battery or use it plugged in, it seems it would be better to buy a new one rather than buy a new head.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor long enough to replace the head a couple of times. Best razor I have ever owned. I use it in the shower and the Jet Clean system makes cleaning the razor super easy.</li>
            <li> Works very well - easy to clean - definitely a daily time saver for me.  Gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  But the time I save is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li> As a regular Norelco user, this is the best yet. Cuts my shaving and cleaning time in half.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I am not pleased with is the trimmer, I wish it was much wider so as I could use just one full trim cut</li>
            <li> It really works well dry or wet, it shaves close. I really like the cleanser tray. It&#x27;s a great improvement from the older model.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have owned.  Previously I have used Braun, Remington, &amp; a Norelco.  It is a bit pricy, but the quality and results are worth it.  The triple head swivels &amp; adjusts to every contour of your face and gives you a very close shave.  The razor is extremely quiet and perfectly contoured to hold in every position.  The Jet Clean unit that comes with this shaver is also made well.  It cleans the shaver well and is simple to use.  The unit also can be used as a stand &amp; charges the razor.  The only fault to it is that when you plug it in &amp; clean the shaver, it also charges it after the cleaning cycle.  I was told the type of battery used in the shaver should be run down &amp; then re-charged, not charged again after every cleaning.  The switch on the cleaner should be Clean On, Charge On, Clean/Charge On, but that&#x27;s a minor fault.  I give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Just perfect! Perfect for everyday. Easy to clean, battery last long. Philips got the perfection. No more allergies and choose a dry or wet shave, I forgot you don&#x27;t need de jet clean.</li>
            <li> Philips 1280 X / 42 SensoTouch force 3 d electric razor with jet cleaning system, black good razor&lt;br /&gt;Very is great</li>
            <li> This razor is great! The price is a little steep, but well worth it. I love that it can go wet/dry, and wet shaving gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even closer than a safety blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face, apply a few drops of [[ASIN:B0000C0XL8 Desert Essence Organic Jojoba Oil, 4-Ounce Bottle]], massage it in, and start shaving. The razor glides smoothly over my face causing absolutely NO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret was not buying the 1290. I have very little need for the cleaning station. The razor is very easy to clean with warm water. In fact, the jojoba oil is a very light oil and keeps the blades well lubricated.</li>
            <li> This electric razor was a Easter gift after more then three weeks ( noreclo recommends at lest 3 weeks minimum to condition your skin) After dealing with razor burn,bad shave.I am giving up. Wanted my money back for sticking with it getting hassled. Don&#x27;t buy this item! I have received a refund from amazon, another reason to use this site.</li>
            <li> Close shave, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Bought this thing in August of 2011. Really like the shaver with the wet/dry ability and it does conform to the face rather well. The trimmer is pretty useless as it doesn&#x27;t  get close enough and I find myself resorting back to the razor blade to keep my sideburns short and even and also a few swipes around my mustache. After a year of use the blasted thing went completely dead. Absolutely nothing when pressing the on/off button and absolutely nothing when placing it on the charging stand. Contacted Philips and they are sending me a replacement handle at no charge (original warranty of 2 years that Philips extended by an additional 6 months when registering the thing).  I like the product but if I have to spend $250 for it, $50 every year for a replacement head and $4-5 for each bottle of cleaning solution it needs to last a damn site longer than a year. Would I recommend it? Uhh........ I&#x27;ll get back to you in another year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later and the battery died AGAIN. A lithium ion battery should be better than this. Still under the extended warranty from registering it on-line so another handle was sent free of charge. When it dies again (one more year at this rate), doubt I will replace with another unless the faulty battery issue is solved.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco razor for years.  I bought this because my old Spectra model was dropped and the retaining ring broke.  This looked like it would work very well but I found that that the blades are further apart than the previous models I had used.  This makes the head very large and it does not follow the contours of my face and neck well.  I liked the Jet Clean option.  Unfortunately it stopped working after only a few months.  It will work in the Jet Cleaner but will not turn on even after a full charge.  Fortunately be the time it broke  I had replace the broken retaining ring so I resumed using the Spectra and this just reinforced how uncomfortable the larger head on the Senso Touch is.  In addition I found that the blade type used on the older Spectra gives a closer shave than the new style on the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product because:&lt;br /&gt;1)It does not shave as well as the older model&lt;br /&gt;2)It is unreliable and failed to operate after only a few months&lt;br /&gt;Although this is under Julie&#x27;s name, this reviewer is her husband.</li>
            <li> The razor was great but finding replacement heads a year later was nearly impossible. Norelco had changed the replacements &amp; reviews on the new replacement heads were terrible. The old style heads (when you could find them) were going for almost as much as the razor sold for originally. So we bought a different razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quit used this razor for a month yet.  Philips recommends that you use it for 21 days so your face gets use to the razor; I think I&#x27;m still getting use to it.  My biggest question with this razor is how will it work on my neck.  Compared to my old Braun better and I think it will get even better once my skin adjusts to the new style cutting heads (never used the 3 cutting heads before).&lt;br /&gt;People have said don&#x27;t bother with this model and get the one without the cleaning base, I disagree.  It&#x27;s nice to set the razor in the cleaning station every couple of uses to deep clean and lubricate the cutting heads (I still rinse the razor after each use).  When I bought this razor there was a $30 off coupon bringing the total to $219.  Considering at the time I&#x27;m writing this review the model without the cleaning station is $250 and this one is $220 I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> I find that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave that I have ever had.  There is virtually no afterburn on my face and neck, and I receive a better shave without \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; lotions.  I can&#x27;t add anything to the other positive reviews at this site.     However, I do have a negative comment about the battery charging results.  I bought the razor in April 2011 and have been recharging it after each use.  Initially it charged up to 60 seconds, but now, 4 months later, the battery will only charge up to 50 seconds.  If a linear extrapolation is warranted, I expect that the battery will die in April 2013, after 24 months of use.  Unfortunately the battery for this model (1280X/42) can NOT be replaced.  The user manual states that the entire shaver unit: body, battery, motor and cutting heads must be discarded when the battery dies.  In spite of this disappointing battery life, I will probably buy another Norelco 1280/42 or equivalent when this one expires.</li>
            <li> After about 5 years with a Braun, I decided the commercials for Norelco&#x27;s 3D shavers couldn&#x27;t be ignored anymore.  I am not disappointed.  Far less pull on a few day&#x27;s growth.  Nobody&#x27;s perfect, so when I need to go over my neck quite a bit and then use a (dry) razor to finish up, it&#x27;s still a better experience that I had before.  The extra surface area covered by the three heads just gets the job done faster.  As a bonus, the $30 coupon available when I ordered covered a Xbox 360 game I wanted, so all is good...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because strait razors were giving the right side of my neck back irritation. I went with the assumption that more expensive has to be better and with how bad my neck was getting, it would have been worth every penny if my assumption would hold to be true. The product of course didn&#x27;t cut as close as a strait razor, but that is to be expected. It worked decent at first, helping a little with the neck irritation, but I gave it more time since the first few weeks is supposed to be the roughest (until your face gets used to it). After about a month the razor started irritating my neck just as bad, then started to get WORSE from then on. Now (5 weeks later) the razor irritates my upper lip, side of my mouth, and all of my neck where before it was only the right side of the neck. I use the cleaning system that it came with after every shave and change out the liquid regularly. I also have tried wet and dry shave, using a variety of different lotions and soaps, etc. Now I have to go back to strait razors after wasting a lot of money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electri razors exclusively for years, and have had just about every model Norelco has.  Long ago, I found that Norelco razors were best for me, and I never looked at any other.  This razor does everything it says and more.  The cleaning system works great and you get a dry razor when the cleaning/drying cycle is complete, unlike older Norelco models with the automatic cleaning system.  It works by far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had or used.  One of its best features is the smooth, quick comfortable shave even after a 4-5 day growth.  It cuts just as smoothly as it does the second day even after a week of growth!  All other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, including previous Norelco models, all pulled and botched up trying to shave with a few days growth, and had to be trimmed with clippers before.  Not this one...clean shave just as comfortable and quick.  It also give a very comfortable wet shave with shaving creme....unlike all others I&#x27;ve had or tried.  It is extremely quiet and smooth running--the quietest I&#x27;ve experienced on any electric razor.  I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with the sideburn trimmer, though it pops out quickly.  I&#x27;ve never liked, nor used, electric razor trimmers, and have always used an inexpensive Norelco mustache/beard trimmer, which I&#x27;ve had for years.  The only drawback is it&#x27;s high cost.  But Amazon had by far the best price I found anywhere, and I thoroughly research products like this before purchase.  Most products, especially electronics, come out with a better model after you purchase one.  But, I don&#x27;t see how they can improve on this one.  I also dread the high cost of changing razor heads.  It suggests changing them annually.  You cannot change just the blades, as I have always done on previous razors, you have to pop the head off and install a new one costing from $70 - $100,  That&#x27;s a high annual cost!</li>
            <li> Great! Very nice product! I love it ,it works very well.I&#x27;m is very satisfied with the product, recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> The Philips SensoTouch 3D Shaver does give a surprisingly good and close shave, and it is quiet. Previous rotary shavers I have used did not perform as well as this one, and were a bit more irritating. The shave quality is very similar to the results from the Braun foil shaver I have, but was much faster. I have to take points off for the pop-up trimmer, which I found to be narrow, awkward, easily bogged down, and not particularly useful for all of my grooming needs. The cleaning station functions well, but I would prefer that it use an alcohol based cleaner instead of the water-based soap solution. In all, it is a decent shaver and I do recommend it for those who like rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> Took the leap into the world of using an electric razor. Item took 7 day&#x27;s to arrive from the US to the UK which was excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;I also saved £80 buying from Amazon.com including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the razor three times since it arrived and cannot believe how close a shave it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The closest shave you can get. Well built, amazing quality. The jet clean system is a fantastic add on..keeps your shaver just like brand new. Great Product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  The shave is close but not as close as a razor. A little expensive but battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Nov 25,2011. If you use everyday it is some what fine but it doesn&#x27;t work on long beard. And now it stopped working. It is not getting charged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 11 months to my purchase of the 1280XCC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet compared to other electric razors which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco support is top notch. Razor handle and my Jetstream Cleaning System went haywire. I got my replacement after going to their online support and giving them the serial number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re reading this review, you want to know if the razor is really worth the money. That depends greatly on what you want it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gives a good dry shave and pretty good wet shave. Either just wake up, turn on your razor and just start shaving, or lather up and shave. Works decently either way and the razor is nice and quick. No fuss. Just shave and clean in your Jetclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this razor won&#x27;t give you is a CLOSE shave. Even with the multi-pivoting 3D heads which follow the contours of your face, you simply can&#x27;t get close enough. I&#x27;ve just about tried every way of shaving with this razor and I simply cannot get the same closeness that I get with a disposable razor. After a more thorough wet shave, I can still feel some stubble on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, when you buy this razor, you pay for the convenience of a quick, painless, relatively close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the closest shave, learn the old fashioned way with either a safety razor or a straight edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this razor 4 stars out of 5. I dock one star for the less than close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and fast. Not as close as I would&#x27;ve liked though.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a razor that doesn&#x27;t need much fuss, this razor will probably be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a close shave, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I was using a 30 year old norelco for many years. I could not believe that I didn&#x27;t buy this razor sooner. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It shaves better than my old Panasonic.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this and no any other.&lt;br /&gt;i was used many razor (from panasonic, phillips, hitachi, etc), and blade razor with 2,3,4 and five blades.&lt;br /&gt;but the final cut and sense that gives me the Phillips Norelco sensor touch 3D does not have rival&lt;br /&gt;recomended</li>
            <li> I love the shave with digital readout and especially the cleaning station.  The is also a nice travel case included.</li>
            <li> The positives:  Quietest razor in the world.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheap plastic construction&lt;br /&gt;2. Takes forever to shave,  my old Schick and Remington foil headed shaver was much more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;3. Battery is not replaceable.  I had to send razor to independent technician who had to remove, re-solder and replace battery.&lt;br /&gt;  When it was returned, case never sealed well ever again.  Three months later, battery burned out again while recharging.&lt;br /&gt;4. Not easy to clean heads, and replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> Will not keep a full charge</li>
            <li> So far I haver really enjoyed using this shaver. I have owned many electric shavers over the course of several years and this seems to be the best for my beard type, which would be considered thick. In addition to a thick beard I also have very sensitive skin. In the course of finding a shaver that worked for me I purchased and used a Panasonic Arc 5 and a Braun Series 7. What I found is that for me those have not been the best for my skin and beard type. They both do really good job of getting a close shave but I found that when using the other foil shavers on a daily basis my neck area would always become red and irritated. This would even occur after several weeks of extended shaving with the same shaver. It worried me that I would run into the same issue with the philips but I finally decided to take the plunge, and so far it has been well worth it. The difference between this rotary shaver and the previous foils I have used is night and day. I can now shave daily and only get light to minimal redness if any on my neck. The cleaning solution is not alcohol based and I think that may be another reason on why it helps reduce redness and irritation. The shaver has no problem cutting my beard even after 2-3 days of growth. It is also a very close shave. Still not as good as a standard razor but very close. I am very pleased with my purchase and my skin seems to be also.</li>
            <li> I was using and old model of norelco, and this new technology really like it, better cut quality, easier cleaning, etc.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! A whole lot better than a disposable razor. It glides across your face when I use Electric Shave.</li>
            <li> The razor works great dry, but using it wet with shaving cream in the shower gives me the best shave I have ever had.  It has a nifty self cleaner thing that seems to not be really doing anything.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have never found an electric shaver that would work for me.  I&#x27;d tried Norelco shavers in the past with very poor results.  The 1280X/42 Senso Touch worked very well.  It&#x27;s fast, easy to clean, and no razor burn.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For precision trimming of areas like sideburns, there is a retractable electric razor on the backside that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; aspect and benefit of having razor heads that can move in three different directions is entirely beneficial, although it did make shaving around my chin a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is a bit overkill. It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a carrying case and cleaning kit, but you have to replace the special fluid that the razor uses to clean and lubricate the blades with and that can add up over time. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth it in the long run. Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Actually, i bought it for my daddy&#x27;s birthday gift and it was the cheapest price.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfy with this product:)Like this!</li>
            <li> I wrote a positive review when I got this razor initially.  However, I must update my review.  I now give this razor 1 star.  I have used Norelco electric razors for the past 15 years.  I had the money and got the best razor Norelco offers.  However, this is my 2nd on of the 1280x and the on/off button doesn&#x27;t work.  Same problem happened with the first one I got after 2 months.  It doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  I like the jet clean feature but it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> This razor is an improvement over my past Norelco shavers. Bear in mind that improvements are incremental - it is not like night and day. I switched years ago to a Norelco. I always used a blade before. My problem was that I always tried to get one last shave from the blade before replacing it. I got tired of looking like I needed a transfusion. This is an excellent razor. It is very quiet. Everything is digital, but unobtrusive. I find that I get the best shave by using Gillette Fusion gel and the razor together. It just glides. You can use it in the shower if desired. When I have used it dry, the blades in the head seem to heat and it becomes uncomfortable. Note: The cleaning system for this model offers three options for cleaning. Only one other model of this razor uses a cleaning stand and it has one setting. The difference is how long the unit cleans. I am not sure that it makes a real difference. However, this unit is in the flagship group of Norelco shavers called Senseo Touch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean it using the automatic cleaning device, the razor is placed into a holder. It is easy and only goes in one way. On mine, once the cleaning unit is connected to power, the razor is placed with its protective plastic head cover removed into a plastic type of guide that holds the razor. You select the type of cleaning desired by repetitive pushes on a button (there are only three selections). Then, you push the button above the cleaning cycle selector. A small door opens and the razor is lowered into the cleaning solution. After a few seconds of soaking, it starts. It will run on and off for differing amounts of time. Depending on the cycle chosen, it will be lifted out of the solution and held to drain for a minute. Then, it is lowered again into the solution. When it is finished, like a dishwasher, the light changes on the cleaning unit and the razor is lifted from the solution to air dry. Depending on the cleaning cycle chosen this will take from 1 to 2 hours. Then, it is charged. The display will show the amount of charge. It is a digital number which changes orientation depending on how the razor is held. This razor has a number of cool features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible drawbacks are: The Cleaning solution is $40 for a 6 pack (and drinking it is not recommended); the razor cannot be run with just its charging cable. It must be charged in either the cleaning stand or on its individual stand which have the electrical contacts to charge the razor. The replacement heads must be replaced as a group about once a year and they are expensive (I think they are about $65 - they are listed on Amazon). My old Norelco Spectra, which is about 10 years old, is still going strong on its original heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this razor is quality and it is made in the Netherlands. The icing on the cake is the additional fact that it can be effectively and easily cleaned manually. Norelco has full instructions that are easily understood. Why is this important? Well, while the razor has a two and a half year warranty (when registered), these mechanical cleaning contraptions have been known to last just beyond the warranty. If you think that the replacement heads are expensive, just imagine what a new cleaning base with all of its electronics and motors would cost. So, if the cleaning unit fails, the razor can be just as effectively cleaned manually. My plan is to use the automatic cleaning unit occasionally and otherwise basically clean the razor manually. The reason is that the Fusion gel has to be washed off of the heads before putting the razor into the cleaning unit. So -- it is but another twenty seconds to run hot water over the heads (they life up and tilt open like petals on a flower) to clean them and then set the razor on the stand to manually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an expensive shaver. I bought it because I happened by accident onto Amazon when they had it reduced for only a few hours by a lot and I still got a $50 discount from Norelco. I have bought from Amazon for 15 years and do so whenever possible because they truly stand behind their products and merchants that they have authorized sellers sell from their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is that the head life is maximized when they are not only routinely cleaned, but lubricated. You need to use either this solution or the can of Norelco spray/cleaner, which I also have. I attribute the life of my old Norelco&#x27;s heads to routine cleaning and lubrication of its heads. Also, on this new Norelco if you take care of the heads you may not have to replace them every year. The razor will warn you to change the heads. Norelco describes how to reset this warning and you have another year. The main warnings are to never use the unit if part of the protective cutting guide over the cutters has broken or is now missing, unless you really want to find what razor burn is like. Also, each cutter takes a set in it own cutting guide. Never, never interchange the cutters into another guide. Norelco cautions you on this. The manual is excellent! I hope that this has not been too long and boring. Steveom Norelco.

            <li> nice product, good price</li>
            <li> Excellence performance of the Razor. TOP!</li>
            <li> perfect, fell in love when i first saw it!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve had. I also own a Braun and it does not hold a candle to it.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I have 3 or 4 day growth, it still cuts it as close as a baby&#x27;s butt just as quick as my day to day shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I would get another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Bought this nice electric razor for my boyfriend for Christmas last year. He used it once and hasn&#x27;t used it since because it doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> very close shave as well as their little irritation took a little bit to get used to the razor but now that I&#x27;m used to it I&#x27;m very happy with it is definitely a little bit closer in some places in a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used a razor It&#x27;s almost be roughly the same Gillette shaving effect</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace an older Philips Artilec model.  It is so quiet compared to the older one and the shave is superb.  I have had about 4 other Philps razors, but this one is by far the best.  I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close and gentle shaving experience everyday.</li>
            <li> So its about few weeks since I bought this model and a good time to write a review. I bought this model on thanksgiving and also as a personal birthday present for me. I had been using Philips Philishave (yes the model before they called their shavers Norelco) for about 10 years and it was a dry shaver. Changed the battery twice over the years before the battery finally gave up on me. They don&#x27;t have batteries anymore for that model and I thought it was time to replace it. I wanted the best since I know I will be using it for a long long time. I pretty much shave daily except on weekends. My older Philishave had served me well so I was sold on the brand. After reading features on the latest models of Norelco, It was a choice between 1290 and the 1280 as they have the charge mins remaining instead of bars, looks cooler. The 1290 does not have a travel lock but after I bought the 1280, I think it&#x27;s not that useful of a feature to be a deal breaker. Still I went with the 1280 cause it came with the JetClean+ for the same price. The other sensotouch models are good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about the shaver. Its beautiful. The finish of the product is exquisite. It feels good in the hands and the shaving grip is just perfect. I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week and had a good about half centimeter stubble on me. Good way to inaugurate the new shaver :-) After a full charge, I started dry shaving. It glided effortlessly over my face actually better than I expected. In about couple of mins I was done with a smooth clean shave. Loved it. Cleaning was a breeze, open the blade compartment with quick click and run it under faucet and let it air dry...done. I have used it almost daily since then and it did pretty good even on a day old shadow. It performs better on a decent stubble though and its kinda obvious. I haven&#x27;t used this in wet shaving and will do so one of these days for fun. I like the dry shave cause I can get it done and over with a nice shave quickly. This model has a change blades and a clean indicator. Charging is quick too. The JetClean+ is interesting. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but will when I need to do deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product but a little expensive. Paid $250 and saw it drop by $25 in 2 weeks..ouch!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had an 1180 Norelco Shaver and my new 1280 is miles and miles better.  Gives a much better shave and is much better in terms of crafstmenship.  It is, in a word, BETTER!  Much better built and imuch more effective electric shaving instrument.  Good!!!... for the Netherlanders, they got this one right!!!&lt;br /&gt;Paul R. Gilbert&lt;br /&gt;Studio City, California</li>
            <li> a wonderful gift for my brother.as use it in china,we&#x27;re waiting for a long time.but it&#x27; s really worth.i bought it before.the same,perfect.</li>
            <li> Gift for my friend, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is said that it would do. The down side is that they give you so little cleaning fluid with it. Other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a state-of-the-art razor, the ultimate Philips 3D razor works perfect. Even though you have a very dense beard this 1280XCC will give you a baby-face. If you use to leavy your beard a few days I just recommend to use this wet, for every-day shave you can use this dry without any problem.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> the time to shave got shorter as i used it only at 55 now not 60 as when  i got&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that seames to do a good job</li>
            <li> I may be biased - because I am a HUGE Norelco fan. but the 3D is the BEST YET! I mostly use it as a dry razor, but it works great as a wet razor too!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing!! Best electric razor I have ever used!!! It looks like I used a straight razor. Close shave and no irritation. Very expensive but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Ok this product works pretty well but for the price I had very high expectations of this unit.  Let me start off by saying very well designed Phillips is very good that the overall feel and execution of the design feels good in hand. The application of using works well with my face I will say I did have some slight irritation with my neck at first but that&#x27;s only if you use dry for me. If you use pro glide or any wet solution that solves that. Now my unit came with the Jet clean and I use that function about once or twice a month to really clean the blades as the time it takes to do all the time is not worth it plus I&#x27;ve read that can damage the blades so mainly running warm water over the blades after moderate use does fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the shaving again this works and will remove most hairs but I find it doesn&#x27;t get the close shave as mentioned by others in their review I think you can only find that with a razor period. but when you don&#x27;t have time for that like me some mornings its great to pull out and just use for my face with light neck and moustache cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- looks amazing the lights on the unit will tell you what the battery is if it needs to be cleaned etc&lt;br /&gt;  decent shaver rather wet or dry I feel it works best dry on my face wet for my neck but that&#x27;s just me&lt;br /&gt;  last a very long time between charges I find myself only charging maybe once or twice a month&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Very expensive&lt;br /&gt;  should get more close shave for the money&lt;br /&gt;  precision trimmer seems like it should have more power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Results- again a very clever design from Phillips the Jet clean is an added luxury not needed really gets the job done Wet or Dry again if your looking for a very close shave I would suggest going with a razor or using a combo of both like I do&lt;br /&gt;I will say the price may turn some off in that respect weigh your options I know for me this was an easy buy but for budget conscious or close shave you may want to look else where.e where.</li>
            <li> this shaver has beaten all my expectation, and would suggest others also to buy one. gives a great shave and to clean the same is also is easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and it still works great.  If you are new to electric razors like I was, you should know that there is still a consumable item you need to buy with this.  The cleaning solution is cheap, but you need to buy a bottle every 2 and a half months or so.  For some reason, mine won&#x27;t charge up to 60 minutes, it stops at 57.  Functions great if you keep up with shaving, though I&#x27;ve found that if you wait to shave for a couple of days, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of picking up hair that is laying down.  Sometimes it takes a bit more time to shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor as I got tired of shaving daily basis. This razor does work in the shower and dry. No issues so far. It is expensive for a electric razor but worth the money in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for quite a while now alternating between a previous Philips model and a razor. Usually I favored the razor due to the very close shave it gave. When skimming through the net I came upon the new Philips 3d models they looked really promising and decided to buy one with the jet clean system. The shaver is great and never fails, easy to clean plus the jet system is thorough and needs no additional operations other than to turn it on and select the cleaning program. I wholly recommend this shaver and feel it has definitely moved up a generation.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great!!!!  Very comfortable and close shaves whether shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as I typically do in the shower.  The cleaner does a great job of bringing the blades back to looking brand new...expect that will extend the life of the blades, as clean blades are happy blades!  The shaver is not cheap...but my experience with Norelco razors tells me that this shaver will last many years with only occasional blade replacements needed!  Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I shave my head with it also and it is so smooth, I will have to replace the heads sooner. I love it.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, fast shippingto Australia, the condition was perfect and full functionality. Cost was reasonable in comparison with other advertised.</li>
            <li> After struggling to figure out which would be the best electric razor I decided on purchasing this product.  I had a Braun razor in the past but the charger cord frayed and the cleaning solution needed was ridiculously expensive to buy.  I would say that this product does cut your beard pretty well but I do still need to use an old fashion razor to get the places where the Philips razor missed.  The cleaning solution isn&#x27;t too badly priced vs. my old Braun that I had to fork out $45 for two solution cartridges.  Cleaning the razor is very simple and charge time is fast.  The side burn trimmer is not too great and is very small as compared to my Braun razor.  Overall I give this product an 8/10 but I was lucky to buy it when there was a $200 off coupon so it would be wise to wait till Black Friday to pick this up if your in the market for a razor.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift to my dad. Shipping to China took about 2 weeks (including clearing custom). No imprt tax was paid.&lt;br /&gt;My dad loves it. Perfect for everyday shaving, the cleaning stand has a electric motor in it to help lower the shaver into the cleaning position. Travelling pouch is useful. AC adapter range from 110V to 240V which can be used in China without issue. Great buy from Amazon since a less advance model cost twice as much thanks to the Chinese government&#x27;s &amp;#34;TAX&amp;#34; policy. Just want to say &amp;#34;Thanks Amazon&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is such a solid razor. I am writing this review more than 3 years after purchasing it and it&#x27;s just as wonderful  as the day I got it. I&#x27;d recommend  it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for My housband and he love it!</li>
            <li> First, I have used this shaver about 4 weeks with shaving cream. I am comparing to my Panasonic ES-LV81 for wet shaving which I have owned just over 2 years. Incidentally, the Panasonic began leaking water into the shaver necessitating my replacement. In comparison, the Panasonic replacement heads/cutter are $65.73.    The Norelco requires a different shaving technique than the typical linear foil shavers. Nonetheless, after a few shaves, it was a fairly simple transition. I could shave my face in a minute or two less time with the Norelco. Keys here are a circular motion and on the jaw line using the foils along the jaw line with the Y of the foils straddling the ear lobe to catch those last few whiskers. This shaver is MUCH more comfortable on the neck and Adam&#x27;s apple area than the Panasonic--which still nicks me frequently in this area. I had no issues with razor burn with the Norelco, even during the initial uses. Other problem areas: right under the nose, it just doesn&#x27;t reach those hairs very easily; the sideburn area seems to grow in more quickly.    I have a rather tough beard. I typically shave daily to avoid the hassles of a longer shave time and missed hairs if I skip days. Nonetheless, this Norelco handled a 2-3 day growth very nicely. With a 5-6 minute shave time (avg 7-8 with the Panasonic) it really is quicker to shave by almost 25%. This unit has a very quiet motor--it is hardly audible! And the shaver is VERY light. Compared to the Buzz saw volume of my Panasonic, I love this feature. The LCD is very attractive and the cleaner is nice, although a bit flimsy. Package includes cleaning solution which should last about a month to 6 weeks.    Bottom line: the shaver just does not give me that polished, soft skin after the shave that the Panasonic does. By the end of the day, I feel I need to shave again if I go out with the Norelco (I didn&#x27;t feel this need as much with the Panasonic). But, it is definitely a decent shave. Considering the ES-LV81 can behad for $279.00 Prime, I would opt for that razor in the same price range. 3 stars based upon the quality of shave, overall feel, cleaner, and looks of device.    I had previously reviewed this product with an unfavorable comment about the cost of replacement heads. I have since spoken with Philips-Norelco fully intending to return as an online search returned RQ12+ heads costing $183. I was informed the RQ12/62 is the same as the RQ12+ heads. Based upon that fact, a replacement from Philips costs $64.99. Therefore, I have decided to keep the razor and continue since my Panasonic is effectively unserviceable. I am concerned, however, about the reviews of the RQ12+ on the Amazon site as MANY are extremely negative. I guess I will not know until time to replace my present heads. . .</li>
            <li> I cannot provide specific use details because I bought this as a gift for my Dad.  He is legally blind....he can make things out but cannot see detail....so he had to give up his trusty, old circa 1960&#x27;s double edged razor.  He was using some cheap electric foil razor for a few months that practically left his facial hairs longer rather than shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought this Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Razor for my Dad for Christmas in December 2011 and he has been using it without problem ever since.  He still need help putting the razor back int he base for recharging and cleaning, but other than that, it&#x27;s great to see him get a good shave on his own again!</li>
            <li> Been about a month of regular use and it has worked well for me so far, but only works as a wet shave with regular shave gel applied. Dry shave irritates my skin and doesnt shave properly anyway, takes too long to get the hair out. With a wet shave and shave gel, its a good, smooth shave but requires work in the moustache area.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, buy if you don&#x27;t have a tough beard and/or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It does not stand up every hair as well as I expected for such an expensive shaver but it certainly does a much better job than my old Remington. One of the best features is the charging stand which keeps the shave fully charged at all times while allowing you to shave cord free.</li>
            <li> the razor is the best one i ever had.</li>
            <li> Husband didn&#x27;t want to use this type of shaver.  Purchased it, he battled me, now he uses it every day.  On a scale of 0-10, he&lt;br /&gt;considers it a 8.  But I never see him not using it.  It cleans itself, I think that he wants the blades to cut closer.  Most men like a close shave.  But it does a great job.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re sorry, but now I evaluate the product. Very good product, the long-awaited. Good quality, very suitable for my husband!</li>
            <li> it is perfect.it is a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday.and he loves it.next time i will one for myself.Philips&#x27;s quality is good.</li>
            <li> it does not need me to tell , everyone else in the world knows  Philips Electric Razor is the best. Philips Norelco 1280XCC SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor is the best of the Philips Electric Razor</li>
            <li> this razor was purchased for a man with a lot of indents on his face.staff all agree best razor ever.</li>
            <li> The best I have had so far. I could not agree more with the many reviews I saw on amazon. Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I suffer from razor bumps and this shaver is just amazing. I shave in the shower and I simply love it. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and very easy to maintain. I recommend every man get this shaver...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he said it is the best gift he&#x27;s ever received. It is such a clean shave and it&#x27;s so quick and easy! I no longer have to beg him to shave, he doesn&#x27;t mind it at all now! The digital display is very classy and neat and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I buy a 1280xcc but in box have no cleaning bucket and cleaning water ,only have Neutrogena set！Can you tell me why?or you set the wrong goods?</li>
            <li> I feel like this shaver could do a little bit better job especially if you have a little bit longer hair and you want to completely shave it off it tends to miss some of the longer hairs, but other than that it does a super great job.  I no longer have razor burn on my face!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for about 5 years and this is the best one so far. Close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003V3476G Philips Norelco 1280XCC SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Noreco razors for over 20 years&lt;br /&gt;This is far and away the best shaving electrically I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and rapid and no burning&lt;br /&gt;All the Best&lt;br /&gt;ACW</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1280XCC SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor provides a relatively close shave for an electric razor. It&#x27;s more comfortable than a blade. After charging, one can shave for a cumulative total of 60 minutes before having to re-charge.</li>
            <li> Awesome shave ! Wet shave is the way to go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a handful of electric shavers since I was old enough to shave.  When you pay $40 for a shaver, you shouldn&#x27;t expect a quality shave or a durable shaver.  Several years ago, I spent well over $100 on a Braun foil-type shaver with a cleaner/charger machine.  It&#x27;s been working like a charm all these years, but recently, it started acting funny when sitting in the cleaner/charger (it would randomly start cleaning itself, which isn&#x27;t supposed to happen).  After seeing this Norelco on TV, I decided it might be time to think about getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be the best shaver on the market right now.  It&#x27;s a nice device that feels solid and very substantial in your hand.  There&#x27;s nothing \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; about it -- the shaver and the cleaner machine are both well-constructed.  This is, however, my first water-proof shaver.  I don&#x27;t shave in the shower, but I like having the option of using shaving cream (if I want to) and rinsing the shaver head under running water.  But it works just as well dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a foil-type shaver for the last several years, this was my first rotary shaver.  Like all shavers, a new one takes time to get used to.  I&#x27;ve had this for several weeks, now, and I&#x27;m still getting razor burn on my neck no matter how gentle I use it (but it&#x27;s manageable).  Other than that, my cheeks, upper lip, and chin are smoooooooth.  The self-adjusting heads really do flex around every curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the LCD display showing me time remaining.  The cleaning machine is fantastic, but the cleaning solution is extremely difficult if not impossible to find in stores, so I&#x27;ve had to purchase it from Amazon (which is a better deal, anyway, because I can [[ASIN:B000PJBSSY get a six-pack for cheap]]).</li>
            <li> Very good, cool~I like it very much!</li>
            <li> nice shaver for traveling .and when you don&#x27;t have a blade around</li>
            <li> The battery died after a year :(</li>
            <li> I bought it during Christmas week with low price,I really like it, make you comfortable, Philips product always good quality, if there have any promotion, don&#x27;t miss</li>
            <li> My almost 16 year old began shaving about a year ago and we purchase a wahl shaver.  It just wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.  I bought this and my son says it&#x27;s really easy to use.  Easy is what seems to work for teens these days.  It gives him a nice, close shave and it saves him from me nagging him that he looks scrappy.</li>
            <li> Battery not holding complete charge need to get replacement. Shave is ok not as good as a razor!  Poor quality control</li>
            <li> Expect more. No razor shaves completely around the neck, press hard, causing skin irritation. Battery fast charging 1 hour long keeps charging.</li>
            <li> This was a big, big, BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!  The razor cuts ok, maybe a tiny bit better than my previous Norelco 8894XL.  The problem is, after only owning and using this razor daily for two months, it is not charging completely.  A complete charge is 60 minutes.  I first noticed this about two weeks ago.  It stopped charging at 56 minutes.  Now today, when I charged it, it will only go to 54 minutes!  I have always been careful not to over charge this unit.  I believe there was only one time that it stayed on the charger for 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.  My 8894XL is approximately 10 years old, and guess what?  It still charges completely and lasts a very long time between charges.  It was less than half the price of this razor.  The only reason I bought this one is because the top metal piece that holds the blades in place finally broke.  After I ordered, I found that I could purchase a replacement for about 25.00.  So I thought I may as well just replace the razor since I needed new blades too.  BOY, WHAT A MISTAKE I MADE!  It&#x27;s now past 30 days so I can&#x27;t get a refund or replacement through Amazon.  I guess I will have to battle with the company.  How much do you want to bet that they will try to blame me.  I suggest that you steer clear of this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Is worth every single dollar. I have to shave everyday(Military) so this makes my life easier. The shave is close without damge to the skin. I used to get very bad rash and bumps with regular razors; Now no more bumps or damage to my skin. I use this electric razor every single day. looks amazing and the self cleaning is just out of this world. leaves the razor clean and ready for the next day. I already recommend this razor to all my team members. The battery life is really good, close shave, no damage to skin, looks amazing. I would use this razor forever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> seems to be a very good razor. still evaluating.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco shaver.I still have my first one and still use it after 15 years.I just purchased my Norelco model 1280 X and it is just amazing.Yes it is a bit expensive but have no complaints.Close fast shaves,no irritation,quiet and easy to clean.It shaves as close as a razor blade without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this electric shaver to all,you cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last 2 yrs and I really like it.  I have had many different electric shaver and this is the best so far.  Shaves close without irritation.  Charges and clean very easily.  I just changed the blades and I really felt the difference. If you can offord to change it every year like the manual saids then do it.</li>
            <li> This product feels good in your hand. The floating heads allow you to get to the tough spots on your face.</li>
            <li> Appears to shave closer than previous Philips Norelco razor. Trimmer is outstanding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my face for more than 60 years.  This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s smooth, precise, easy to use and clean.  And it looks good, too.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 8500 series 360 , before this one, and it had a self clean feature also.  This one tops my Braun.  Shaves are closer, the razor makes almost NO noise while shaving , I can still watch the morning news without having to stop shaving!  It is comfortable in the hand and the cleaning station is very easy.  It travels well also.</li>
            <li> appreciated is usage dry and wet and changable head unit, for beard styler e.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one con is: neck hair is not removed properly. therefore extra blade is needed</li>
            <li> Very good quality. had been using for 6 months, didn&#x27;t have any problem, long lasting battery life, more than it say (depends on how much you use everyday, of course).</li>
            <li> The best razor on the market.  Shaves close and easy to use cleaner for after use</li>
            <li> Enjoy being able to use dry or wet shaving. also the quietness of the razor motor let me shave anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for man, who is lazy like me. Very smoothly!</li>
            <li> Looks great, fortunately, the razor is not made in China, although the charger is. It is a great deal. I believe my dad would like it!</li>
            <li> I usually don’t write reviews, but I wanted to take the time to share my great experiences. Let me tell you, this razor shaves close! I have used 3 previous electric razors in the same price range and nothing compares to this. I’m required to have a clean shave for my job and I can tell you I stopped using a blade to shave. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver purchased and it was worth every dollar.  A clean shave every time put to use.  The jet clean system malfunctioned after about 9 months.  Overall very satisfied with the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My spouse has been using an electric razor for about 3 years now. They were all ok but this time I bought him this one.  His face is baby smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Well worth this price. With care it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver. It is as described. I watched the videos on the OEM website to make sure it would work for me. It is equally great for wet shaves as it is for drive. Exceptionally close and leaves the skin very smooth. Happy with it. Charge lasts a long time and the digital minute count down is definitely a great benefit for travel use.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the razor. He also has the AT-830 model. The only drawback on this one is you cannot leave the charger plugged while the razor is on the stand. I suppose it does not have a shut off on charging. Other than that he really likes his new razor.</li>
            <li> I had to use an electric shaver when I broke my right arm. It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;ve never gone back,</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this thing works!  Very nice way to start the day; I thought the auto cleaner was way over the top, but every morning the shaver is clean smelling.  Nice to have a fresh shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, ended up having to change my assessment. Shaves like most other electric shaver. Cleaning unit failed twice; finally threw it out. Was nice while it worked (about six months).  Way too expensive, not worth it.</li>
            <li> It Did just what I Needed.</li>
            <li> Have had and used this razor for over a year now and the razor works great. However the washer/charger quit working properly last week.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers have come a long way. I really like this one. Is it a perfect replacement for a razor? No, but it is a 98% perfect replacement! I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use electric razors due to the speed and ease of shaving every day.  I have owned Norelco and Remington razors before but the design and versatility of this razor surpasses my previous purchases.  The price is a little higher than I would have liked to spend, but the razor shaves very well and does not irritate my skin nearly as much as other electric razors I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head of the razor allows it to get a closer shave than the older style electric razors, and the cleaning station does a very good job of charging and cleaning the heads after use.  I traditionally only run it through the wash 2 times a week to save on the cleaning solution and that day to day use there isn&#x27;t much stubble to plug it up.  The only downfall I have with the razor is the little detailer that pops out of the back.  It is pretty short and gives me trouble when trying to shave around my ears to trim up the sideburn area.  Other than that it is the best razor I have owned and I use it daily and have done so for the passed few months without issue.  Would easily recommend a purchase if the price doesn&#x27;t scare you off.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and have to shave every morning and this does the job amazing. I have thick hair that comes in fast and this tames it well.</li>
            <li> Update February 2017: I have revised the review for 3 stars from 5 stars. The reasons are:  (1) The Jet Clean station that comes with it is simply flawed in its design. It operates fine for a few months, and then the water level sensor becomes dirty or scaled and the unit is unable to properly detect the water/cleaning fluid level, continuously indicating that the fluid reservoir is empty although it is full. Attempts to clean the sensor have inconsistent results. The unit has to be started multiple times until the sensor is eventually able to detect the fluid level and start the cleaning cycle. And eventually the Jet Clean station will cease working altogether, just as my has two weeks ago. Note that my Jet Clean station has been replaced 2 times within the warranty period. The warranty is over and I will absolutely not purchase another one with the same flawed design. The shaver just has to be cleaned manually with similar results.  (2) The replacement heads are preposterously expensive. The original heads, RQ12, are no longer manufactured, and the new RQ12+ have been reviewed as below par here at Amazon. It is way too much money invested in electric razors for no reasonable replacement parts... unfortunately common, disposable razors are not an option for me (they do not shave the beard, they remove the skin and the beard), I have not adapted to Braun&#x27;s shaver system... I might be stuck with Norelco forever.  ---- End of Update ----   This one was a replacement for a Norelco 9160XL. Its head holder was worn out, and the razor heads would pop out intermittently during shaving. I had already replaced the head holder once ($25.00) about two years ago, and I was tired of having to do this for a part that should not have to be replaced, in my opinion.  I pondered over purchasing a new shaver for quite some time, specially an expensive shaver such as the 1280XL, since the old one was otherwise working fine. I have been using Norelco shavers for 25 years, with a brief 2-3 years interlude of Gillette razors (caused, interestingly, by an incompatibility of electrical plugs when I moved from one country to another two decades ago, and not finding an adapter, forcing me to buy an emergency Gillette razor, taking me 2-3 years to go back to Norelco). I finally asked myself, &amp;#34;how much is worth a good, pleasant shave in the morning, every single day?&amp;#34;  I did not think there would be much difference between the 9160XL and this 1280, but I was pleasantly wrong. The shave is smooth, enjoyable, elegantly slides on the face following the natural contours. Only us men know how good of a mood a fine shave can put us into, and this 1280 shaver certainly does it.  It is water-proof.  I tested it under the shower, it does not fear water.  The jet clean system is somewhat bulky. It does, however, perform well and leaves the shaver clean and lubricated. You can of course not purchase the system and clean the shaver under the faucet, but this procedure does waste more water. The system uses the same water with solution for several cleanings.  Important:  the description at Amazon does not say, but this package *does come* with a charging stand, besides the jet clean system. The charging stand is important if you take the shaver on a trip and do not want to carry the bulky jet system (as the shaver can only be charged either in the jet system, or in the stand).</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for almost 20 years and really liked them until recently.  I purchased this unit and was very happy at first until the blades went dull after only a month of use.  I ordered new blades and once again in about a month they were dull.  It seems like Norelco is having some quality control issues with the manufacturer of their blades.  I will be calling them next but until they can figure out what is going on with the blades I would be cautious about purchasing one.</li>
            <li> Great Electric Shaver. Very easy to handle and is lite to hold. My old Norelco was heavy and bulky. The old shaver was at least 20 years old still running the only maintenance that I have done was replace the blades once a year. I purchased this new one because the battery needs replaced and I did not want to spend 70.00 dollars and send it off to a repair shop. I have not used the clean and charge dock yet but it appears that it would take up a lot of counter space which I do not have. I&#x27;m very happy with this new Norelco shaver I hope it last as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned.Shaves very close ,does not pull ,very quite.Would buy again ,and highly recommend.GREATWELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in March 2012. Except for a poor shave on my neck, it was great for the first eight or nine months. It was quiet, shaved very close and quick on the rest of my face, and the Jet Cleaner worked great. Then the razor only charged to 48 minutes, instead of the established sixty minutes. Now it&#x27;s actually charging to 61 minutes. But the thing that&#x27;s really got me frustrated is that the Jet cleaner has completely failed. It just gyrates and makes weird noises. I think keeping the blades properly cleaned and lubricated is crucial to good shaving performance. I have noted that product failure has occurred in other reviews. This should not happen after just one year on a high-priced shaver. I called Philips Norelco and they said they will replace the stand. We shall see, but I am not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE DATED 5/9/2013:  On 4/22/2013 I e-mailed an Amazon.com Amazon proof-of-purchase receipt. The next day I received an e-mail from Norelco stating they could not accept my proof-of-purchase since it was embedded in the e-mail. I had to re-send it as an attachment. My bad, and I re-sent the proof-of-purchase as an attachment. That was 4/23/2013. I have heard nothing since. I call occasionally; they tell me they will contact their service department, their supervisor, whatever. Nothing. It has been 16 days since I sent the proof-of-purchase. This is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Their customer service isn&#x27;t bad: it&#x27;s non-existent. It&#x27;s only conjecture, but I feel they never intended to address the problem. I just bought the new Panasonic Arc 5. I will never use a Philips Norelco again.</li>
            <li> I replaced my aging Braun shaver that would no longer hold a charge with this Norelco 1280X. At the time, it was, and appears to still be, the best razor on the market. I wanted something that would be future-proofed for at least 4 or 5 years and this fit the bill, especially given Amazon&#x27;s online price which was substantially lower than anywhere else including Wal*Mart and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor for the past 6-months I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shave closeness is better than any Braun shaver I have used, although i find it more difficult to get up closer to the nose than I did with the Braun... I attribute that to the drastic design differences, not the razor... going from a Braun style razor to a Norelco takes some getting used to but in the end it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Has a durable feel to it, decent weight where it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The digital screen is nice and tells you exactly how much time you have left before a recharge is required and has been fairly accurately until just recently. Now, instead of it charging up to full and showing 60 minutes available, it sometimes shows, 64 minutes, 68 minutes, and sometimes it shows less, like 55 minutes. So far it hasn&#x27;t affected the use but I thought I&#x27;d mention it and see if anyone else is experiencing anything similar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cleaning attachment/stand is nice and makes it easier to charge although at least on mine, the \\&quot;automatic\\&quot; clean setting does not appear to work. I even let the razor go for a couple months without manually hitting the clean button and it never auto-cleaned. It&#x27;s also a bit annoying getting the fluid into the cleaning chamber as there&#x27;s no marks telling you how far to fill it. What I discovered is, unless I filled it nearly to the top, it was really only cleaning 2 of the 3 heads. Filling it to the top also caused it to make a mess and leak anytime I had to move it on the counter when I was cleaning the bathroom, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The razor charges quickly, and I mean REALLY quickly--way faster than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned and probably twice as fast as the 5-year-old Braun razor I was replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Shave quality is amazing. (It better be for the amount Norelco is charging for the replacement heads!) Speaking of those, I have not seen a price any cheaper than what they sell for here on Amazon so you may want to buy a pack or two when you see the price drop on Amazon that way you don&#x27;t have to buy them from a physical store where you&#x27;ll easily pay $5-$10 more for the same replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The shaving surface rotates nicely to match your facial curves. Compared to previous models, Norelco has made huge strides in improvement in this area. Shaving is comfortable and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Compared to my previous razor, this one is quieter, in fact, it is so quiet that you can actually hear someone talking outside of the bathroom which is nice as I always seem to get interrupted with questions while I&#x27;m trying to shave! At least now I can hear people. Also good for when you need to shave at night and not make a ton of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Cleaning kit: As I mentioned above, I do use the cleaning kit with mine because it came with one when I purchased it, however, I really don&#x27;t think you need it as simply running the blades under warm water removes most of the hair particles. Once you&#x27;ve done that, you can open up the head cover and get an even deeper clean. As long as you do this maybe once a week or so, you shouldn&#x27;t need the cleaning kit. This could save you quite a bit of money if you find one somewhere that&#x27;s sold by itself without the cleaning kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** CONCLUSION ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think you&#x27;ll get quite a few years out of this razor before needing to purchase something new. I&#x27;ll update this review if I notice any problems with it as it gets older and more use. For right now, after 6-months of use, it&#x27;s working as well as the day I bought it and I stillhaven&#x27;t needed to change the heads, although I probably will sometime this month. (I try to do it twice a year so I keep that close, and more importantly, comfortable shave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** If this review helped you in any way, please let me know.

            <li> great works like a top</li>
            <li> The shaver rotary cutters will effectively cut a stubble beard but not the longer whiskers.  The trimmer is required to cut down the extended whiskers, then the rotary cutters will handle the remaining short stuff.  This is particularly a problem in the neck area where the whiskers lie in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;  The trimmer is effective in trimming beards. The wet function is convenient in cleaning the cutter heads.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used.  Its fast, and cuts very close.  Also, the head on this model has extra room for hair clippings to store, whereas the old models were too small and the head would fill up quick with clippings</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I only shave dry so I cant attest to the wet shave, but I can tell you its the best and closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get a bit warm after about 4 minutes of shaving. I would imagine about 6-7 minutes of continuous used would get uncomfortable, but I am usually done in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great in my hand. Very ergonomic!.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my partners expectations. Must quieter than the previous Braun razor and hopefully it will out last the previous razor (Braun)</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun for over 10 years and cannot believe how much better this razor is. It used to take me 8-10 minutes a day to shave with a medium beard, but now I am able to shave in 2-3 minutes. The first two weeks the shave was not as close as I would have liked but as my skin has become use to the razor it has a perfect shave. I have used it for over two weeks and it has not seen the charger once. I am just blown away at how much easier this has made my life and completely worth the money. I was fearful at first to spend so much on an razor but I am so thankful I did!</li>
            <li> Extremely great shaves.  I&#x27;ve tried it with and without shaving cream.  It worked really great either way.  Quiet and fast.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with different electric razors each year and this is by far the best.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two years and then it stopped working</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for over 30 yrs.  I have a course beard and a weathered face. This razor gives me a close shave in 5 min. not 20+ min like my previous razors.</li>
            <li> I have never used the small charging unit not the cleaning system. I have always used the cleaning system to charge this razor and it worked fine. When I plugged the charger in the small charging unit, I heard some noises then the charger started to get bigger. I plugged it out and it was really hot. It does not charge anymore, thanks to the bad quality of the small charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I cannot charge my electric razor!! I need to buy another one. It is really sad because two days ago I recommended this electric razor to my friend!.&lt;br /&gt;the small charging unit should have been labeled \\&quot;use on your own risk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Purchased the shaver in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week took to my local authorized Phillips repair centre for maintenance.  The technician opened up the razor and found all inner parts, motor, gears etc. rusty and failing.&lt;br /&gt;Repair is not possible. Straight to be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposed to be a wet shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I expected longer service than 2 years. What a dissapointment.</li>
