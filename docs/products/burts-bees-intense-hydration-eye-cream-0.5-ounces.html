            <li>I love things that smell, and I love things that smell good.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bee eye cream is very easy to use</li>
            <li>This eye cream is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and am doing my best to take preventative measures to minimize the effects of aging on my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference whether I use it or not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any remarkable changes, or more accurately any visible changes...</li>
            <li>This cream is very smooth...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a trememdous difference, but it does appy very smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Why not use a reasonably-priced product that will produce better results faster than the $100/oz pots?</li>
            <li>Smells great and really hydrates.</li>
            <li>I felt ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying, love burt&#x27;s bees product.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>wife love the product</li>
            <li>I love all of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the package.  </li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin gotso much better since I used Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>This product seems to make the skin more supple around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle, and it has a great price.</li>
            <li>the design of head of this tube is cute.</li>
            <li>I use this in my makeup bag to apply to the under eye area on top of make up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with the whole line .</li>
            <li>It has a tacky consistency that just sits on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>I still want an eye cream but the Aveeno moisturizes much more than this &amp;#34;intense</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with the results experiencing a notable difference in appearance under my eyes and diminished appearance of &#x27;character lines&#x27; around my eyes, mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell as well,</li>
            <li>actually love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Best medicine and helps dry skin under eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, tighter and looser in all the right places, and feels GOOD and CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Paired with the other hydration offerings it is a great set!</li>
            <li>No scent, easy to use; i like this tube design, just put on around eyes.</li>
            <li>The best natural eye cream I have found at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but the texture is great and not oily or greasy at all even in the warm and wet season!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this, light weight, but rich.</li>
            <li>This seems to help the fine skin around my eyes</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering how it&#x27;s dispensed, it&#x27;s like a lip gloss bottle... filled with eye cream.</li>
            <li>This product is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated.</li>
            <li>The ones that worked the best for me are the Clinique repairware laser focus, and a few of the Lanc√¥me ones</li>
            <li>it helps my eye makeup go on smooth.</li>
            <li>The line of eye cream that poured out into my hands was the length of the tube, meaning that I lost a significant amount of the product that I paid for which was disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great ,,,to china ,,it is so long trip,i like it.</li>
            <li>but found greater results with this combo from Burt&#x27;s Bees within the first week.</li>
            <li>best of all - no animal-testing, and as natural as it could possibly be - which is why your body responds so well.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, and I&#x27;ve used far too many.</li>
            <li>It got rid of that severe dry spot and keeps my eyes feeling great, even in winter.</li>
            <li>For the winter dry skin, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll win a contest, eyes wide.</li>
            <li>This stuff even SMELLS good, which is big for me.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet, floral smell that I thought would go away, but it didnt.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizing effect, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams but this one works the best.</li>
            <li>I like this eye cream because it absorbs fairly quickly and does not leave an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the new &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; packaging.</li>
            <li>Good for people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy but light.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbed by my skin immediately.</li>
            <li>It keeps the smile lines away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was several minutes after I applied the eye cream that I began to feel the warm, tingling sensation wherever I had applied it.  </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin like I do.. stay away from it :)</li>
            <li>Most eye creams recommend you don&#x27;t apply to that area due to the sensitivity of the skin, however, this cream is safe and softens that area without any irritation.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s just about as fun as it sounds) and this stuff soothes the stinging skin right away and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>This product is fairly moisturizing but that is all...does nothing to reduce lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
            <li>I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products.</li>
            <li>That truly proves there are people paid to write positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Applied very sparingly (as it should be) it will take about an hour to feel completely absorbed, which I didn&#x27;t like since my routine is mostly right before bed.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and moisturizing for the eye area.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and it seems to be totally fine on me.</li>
            <li>In my opinion is the same as the night cream wich i love but for the amount this is too pricey.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was that it has a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Will keep using Bb priducts more in the future</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems using make up over it though during the day, just let it absorb first.</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft and smooth and this without parabens -</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>Same product at Wal.....sells for a lot more.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying it somewhere else for a higher price.</li>
            <li>Although the scent was pleasant enough, it is not a scent I want to wear on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>It has a tip at the end so that you can easily control how much comes out and not waste it by using too much.  </li>
            <li>This is the first that has reduced the large flake problem that I use to experience.  </li>
            <li>and now I just rub my Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer around my eyes.</li>
            <li>First of all I really don&#x27;t like the way it smells</li>
            <li>I love the subtle clean scent too!  </li>
            <li>Not only do you lose a significant portion of the product just to get it out of the tube the first time, but the product has a scent and makes your skin tingle.  </li>
            <li>But I love their hydration face cream and this eye cream goes on smoothly and immediately goes into the delicate eye area to hydrate.</li>
            <li>I really like the applicator tip.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement after using it every morning for over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>However, my experience with the product has been very</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job at being hydrating very well</li>
            <li>Provides intense hydration like it&#x27;s says  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>This product really does hydrate my under eye area.</li>
            <li>in terms of results, i really have no problems on my eye areas, so cant help you there.</li>
            <li>This really feels luxurious and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li>just a very very very normal eye cream, no supplise,</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No noticeable difference in the area around my eyes, which I&#x27;m not completely shocked about after only one tube, but it is too greasy for me.</li>
            <li>I thought I really liked my Boots No. 7 regimen I had been using for the past year...</li>
            <li>Little thick, so go easy at first...but does the trick nicely!  </li>
            <li>And it works - for me - better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It is more like a heavy face lotion than an intense eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees, as I have raved before, are natural products that your body instinctively feels okay with and drinks it in, instead of leaving that silicone-ish slick that perhaps you spent a bit more for so you feel a little better about.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of thick and sticky but it works for me.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face without leaving it tight and makes my face so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I was particularly drawn to the idea that it is 99% natural.  </li>
            <li>This product reduces under eye puffiness and keeps my super dry skin from flaking.</li>
            <li>And Burt&#x27;s Bees range of products in this area give me more confidence in repair and preservation than any of the hundred-dollar eye caviars or cremes infused with gold that leave a slick feeling on your face and end up on your pillow (or eye-mask)</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first application, especially on my upper eye-lids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old with normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this fall my skin has become so dry for the first time ever!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a little older now; I&#x27;m starting to notice maybe one or two things on my face that weren&#x27;t there a year ago...</li>
            <li>No residue, it is made to join with your body naturally.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful to find a natural product that does what I want.</li>
            <li>so I completely abandoned it</li>
            <li>but my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li>, I can not use it near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I still wouldn&#x27;t use it to rub the product in, though the tip is somewhat soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>It really absorbs fast and makes your eyes have less lines!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and hydrates my delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and now in my 40s and developing a few tiny fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have recently tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products because I was tired of paying the ridiculously high prices of other products and not seeing any results.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too compared to other products offering same results.</li>
            <li>its too thick for my taste, but not bad.</li>
            <li>After a week I have noticed the that the dry wrinkle lines that were starting to show have completely gone away !  </li>
            <li>I put this cream on the extremely dry patches that develop about my eye in the winter time, and it is heavy enough to successfully moisturize the irritating dry-ness, with out being to oily.</li>

            <li> I still want an eye cream but the Aveeno moisturizes much more than this &amp;#34;intense</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with the results experiencing a notable difference in appearance under my eyes and diminished appearance of &#x27;character lines&#x27; around my eyes, mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell as well,</li>
            <li> actually love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Best medicine and helps dry skin under eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, tighter and looser in all the right places, and feels GOOD and CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Paired with the other hydration offerings it is a great set!</li>
            <li> No scent, easy to use; i like this tube design, just put on around eyes.</li>
            <li> The best natural eye cream I have found at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but the texture is great and not oily or greasy at all even in the warm and wet season!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this, light weight, but rich.</li>
            <li> This seems to help the fine skin around my eyes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering how it&#x27;s dispensed, it&#x27;s like a lip gloss bottle... filled with eye cream.</li>
            <li> This product is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated.</li>
            <li> The ones that worked the best for me are the Clinique repairware laser focus, and a few of the Lanc√¥me ones</li>
            <li> it helps my eye makeup go on smooth.</li>
            <li> The line of eye cream that poured out into my hands was the length of the tube, meaning that I lost a significant amount of the product that I paid for which was disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great ,,,to china ,,it is so long trip,i like it.</li>
            <li> but found greater results with this combo from Burt&#x27;s Bees within the first week.</li>
            <li> best of all - no animal-testing, and as natural as it could possibly be - which is why your body responds so well.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, and I&#x27;ve used far too many.</li>
            <li> It got rid of that severe dry spot and keeps my eyes feeling great, even in winter.</li>
            <li> For the winter dry skin, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll win a contest, eyes wide.</li>
            <li> This stuff even SMELLS good, which is big for me.</li>
            <li> It is a sweet, floral smell that I thought would go away, but it didnt.  </li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing effect, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams but this one works the best.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream because it absorbs fairly quickly and does not leave an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the new &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; packaging.</li>
            <li> Good for people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy but light.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbed by my skin immediately.</li>
            <li> It keeps the smile lines away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was several minutes after I applied the eye cream that I began to feel the warm, tingling sensation wherever I had applied it.  </li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin like I do.. stay away from it :)</li>
            <li> Most eye creams recommend you don&#x27;t apply to that area due to the sensitivity of the skin, however, this cream is safe and softens that area without any irritation.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s just about as fun as it sounds) and this stuff soothes the stinging skin right away and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly moisturizing but that is all...does nothing to reduce lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products.</li>
            <li> That truly proves there are people paid to write positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Applied very sparingly (as it should be) it will take about an hour to feel completely absorbed, which I didn&#x27;t like since my routine is mostly right before bed.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and moisturizing for the eye area.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and it seems to be totally fine on me.</li>
            <li> In my opinion is the same as the night cream wich i love but for the amount this is too pricey.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was that it has a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Will keep using Bb priducts more in the future</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems using make up over it though during the day, just let it absorb first.</li>
            <li> but my skin is soft and smooth and this without parabens -</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> Same product at Wal.....sells for a lot more.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying it somewhere else for a higher price.</li>
            <li> Although the scent was pleasant enough, it is not a scent I want to wear on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> It has a tip at the end so that you can easily control how much comes out and not waste it by using too much.  </li>
            <li> This is the first that has reduced the large flake problem that I use to experience.  </li>
            <li> and now I just rub my Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer around my eyes.</li>
            <li> First of all I really don&#x27;t like the way it smells</li>
            <li> I love the subtle clean scent too!  </li>
            <li> Not only do you lose a significant portion of the product just to get it out of the tube the first time, but the product has a scent and makes your skin tingle.  </li>
            <li> But I love their hydration face cream and this eye cream goes on smoothly and immediately goes into the delicate eye area to hydrate.</li>
            <li> I really like the applicator tip.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement after using it every morning for over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> However, my experience with the product has been very</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job at being hydrating very well</li>
            <li> Provides intense hydration like it&#x27;s says  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> This product really does hydrate my under eye area.</li>
            <li> in terms of results, i really have no problems on my eye areas, so cant help you there.</li>
            <li> This really feels luxurious and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li> just a very very very normal eye cream, no supplise,</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference in the area around my eyes, which I&#x27;m not completely shocked about after only one tube, but it is too greasy for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I really liked my Boots No. 7 regimen I had been using for the past year...</li>
            <li> Little thick, so go easy at first...but does the trick nicely!  </li>
            <li> And it works - for me - better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It is more like a heavy face lotion than an intense eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees, as I have raved before, are natural products that your body instinctively feels okay with and drinks it in, instead of leaving that silicone-ish slick that perhaps you spent a bit more for so you feel a little better about.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of thick and sticky but it works for me.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face without leaving it tight and makes my face so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I was particularly drawn to the idea that it is 99% natural.  </li>
            <li> This product reduces under eye puffiness and keeps my super dry skin from flaking.</li>
            <li> And Burt&#x27;s Bees range of products in this area give me more confidence in repair and preservation than any of the hundred-dollar eye caviars or cremes infused with gold that leave a slick feeling on your face and end up on your pillow (or eye-mask)</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first application, especially on my upper eye-lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old with normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this fall my skin has become so dry for the first time ever!  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a little older now; I&#x27;m starting to notice maybe one or two things on my face that weren&#x27;t there a year ago...</li>
            <li> No residue, it is made to join with your body naturally.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful to find a natural product that does what I want.</li>
            <li> so I completely abandoned it</li>
            <li> but my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li> , I can not use it near my eyes.</li>
            <li> I still wouldn&#x27;t use it to rub the product in, though the tip is somewhat soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> It really absorbs fast and makes your eyes have less lines!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and hydrates my delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and now in my 40s and developing a few tiny fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products because I was tired of paying the ridiculously high prices of other products and not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too compared to other products offering same results.</li>
            <li> its too thick for my taste, but not bad.</li>
            <li> After a week I have noticed the that the dry wrinkle lines that were starting to show have completely gone away !  </li>
            <li> I put this cream on the extremely dry patches that develop about my eye in the winter time, and it is heavy enough to successfully moisturize the irritating dry-ness, with out being to oily.</li>
            <li> So when my usual daily eye cream was running out, I decided to give the Intense Hydration Eye Cream a try.  </li>
            <li> very  good,but  so  small</li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  </li>
            <li> and I have used up the entire bottle, but I guess if you have really dry under eyes then I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and 1/4 Japanese and I have never had dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky eyes and have fought the flakiness with multiple creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> The reason for four stars instead of five is that I don&#x27;t find it contagious enough active ingredients, such as peptides, to be my only I cream.</li>
            <li> Seems that some of the cream may migrate and it takes a little while for my eyes to clear this.</li>
            <li> Immediately improves the appearance of the undereye area, making wrinkles or crepeyness much less apparent.</li>
            <li> dry skin</li>
            <li> and my skin in parts felt dry.  </li>
            <li> I can feel that the skin around my eyes feels dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with dry skin around eyes any longer.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, definitely acne prone skin, and this does not affect it negatively at all.</li>
            <li> Small tube, but you only need a tiny dab.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes, ever since I was in my twenties, and have tried a LOT of eye creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eyelid eczema for a few months and needed some cream to hydrate my eyelid without further irritate my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected.</li>
            <li> This was not intensely hydrating as promised.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  </li>
            <li> A little of each goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After using this every night until the tube was gone, sometimes twice a day, and I&#x27;ve decided to try other options.</li>
            <li> So, I Cant tell if it helps with wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is average.</li>
            <li> It seems to help keep my eyes from being as puffy, but I still have some issues with dark circles ocassionally.</li>
            <li> and second it&#x27;s really thick.</li>
            <li> Last year I got a horrible dry pouch of skin on my upper eyelid, right in the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> Very small amount is only needed; does help lines some.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get to waste any cream.  </li>
            <li> I just feel like a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> i feel like i wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Pricier ones are NO better than this one.</li>
            <li> I eventually washed off the eye cream and went out to buy my usual</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure why, either it made them water which caused redness around the outer corners, or it just irritated that delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> It is like applying a thick lotion.</li>
            <li> Why did I ever wasted my time and money for expensive eye treatment when All I needed was this?</li>
            <li> The bad thing about creams with dry flaky skin is that it makes the skin itch or cause break outs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed with the Intense Hydration Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this cream.</li>
            <li> It is non irritating to my eyes even though it has a scent.  </li>
            <li> I pair it with a tinted eye cream to cover that thin skin that shows how tired I am.</li>
            <li> Try it - over those expensive pots and tubes.</li>
            <li> I cant comment on how well it works at reducing wrinkles, unfortunately as I wont use it again.</li>
            <li> my under eye skin looks hydrated and my eyes do not look tired!</li>
            <li> I desperately tried everything, even using olive oil on it at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything:(</li>
            <li> Plus, it became annoying over time because I could still smell it a while after I put the eye cream on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> It caused my eyes and the skin around my eyes to burn horribly and took a week to recover.</li>

            <li> That should be a song. Yes? No? :) I put this cream on the extremely dry patches that develop about my eye in the winter time, and it is heavy enough to successfully moisturize the irritating dry-ness, with out being to oily. I have normal-type skin, so it is perfect for me. This stuff even SMELLS good, which is big for me. I love things that smell, and I love things that smell good. I recommend this! If you&#x27;re wondering how it&#x27;s dispensed, it&#x27;s like a lip gloss bottle... filled with eye cream.</li>
            <li> And Burt&#x27;s Bees range of products in this area give me more confidence in repair and preservation than any of the hundred-dollar eye caviars or cremes infused with gold that leave a slick feeling on your face and end up on your pillow (or eye-mask) the next morning. Burt&#x27;s Bees, as I have raved before, are natural products that your body instinctively feels okay with and drinks it in, instead of leaving that silicone-ish slick that perhaps you spent a bit more for so you feel a little better about. Why not use a reasonably-priced product that will produce better results faster than the $100/oz pots? And make your body feel good in the process. Okay, so I&#x27;m a little older now; I&#x27;m starting to notice maybe one or two things on my face that weren&#x27;t there a year ago...I was using those $100/oz eye caviars and gold-flecked gels then and they didn&#x27;t do anything to stop the advance of time. Then I went back to my Burt&#x27;s Bees, and my skin just went &amp;#34;oooh&amp;#34; and thanked me. Soaked it up. No residue, it is made to join with your body naturally. And it works - for me - better than the more expensive brands. My skin is brighter, tighter and looser in all the right places, and feels GOOD and CLEAN. best of all - no animal-testing, and as natural as it could possibly be - which is why your body responds so well. Try it - over those expensive pots and tubes. It&#x27;ll win a contest, eyes wide.</li>
            <li> I use this under my makeup every day. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I really like the applicator tip.</li>
            <li> This seems to help the fine skin around my eyes but I have found that after applying, when I put my lenses in, I have some eye irritation after about 20 -30 mins. Seems that some of the cream may migrate and it takes a little while for my eyes to clear this. I never noticed this prior to using this cream.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products because I was tired of paying the ridiculously high prices of other products and not seeing any results. This eye cream is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used. I noticed a difference after the first application, especially on my upper eye-lids. Most eye creams recommend you don&#x27;t apply to that area due to the sensitivity of the skin, however, this cream is safe and softens that area without any irritation. I love this product and would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all and I have used up the entire bottle, but I guess if you have really dry under eyes then I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li> Smells great and really hydrates. Good for people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and 1/4 Japanese and I have never had dry skin but this fall my skin has become so dry for the first time ever!  So I was looking for a moisturizing cleanser...  After reading reviews I decided to take a leap and try it!  I am so glad I did!  It cleans my face without leaving it tight and makes my face so soft and smooth!  After a week I have noticed the that the dry wrinkle lines that were starting to show have completely gone away !  I love the subtle clean scent too!  I also decided to buy the night cream and the eye cream and I love them too!  None of these products clog my pores either!</li>
            <li> wonderful on the eyes... dry skin all gone</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, and I&#x27;ve used far too many. This didn&#x27;t do anything:(</li>
            <li> It is very creamy but light. I felt ok but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement after using it every morning for over 3 weeks. I use another eye dream at night.</li>
            <li> Good product. Does it prevent bags under your eyes? Don&#x27;t know, but I think it helps. Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried two days only and no obvious improvement found yet but the texture is great and not oily or greasy at all even in the warm and wet season! The cream absorbed by my skin immediately. I&#x27;ll keep trying, love burt&#x27;s bees product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion is the same as the night cream wich i love but for the amount this is too pricey.</li>
            <li> Very small amount is only needed; does help lines some.  Need&#x27;s a bit creamier texture but that&#x27;s ok, will take it anyday.</li>
            <li> Holy grail day time eye moisturizer. I&#x27;ve purchased this one several times and don&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ll be changing that for now!</li>
            <li> wife love the product</li>
            <li> Not happy with this cream. First of all I really don&#x27;t like the way it smells and second it&#x27;s really thick. Doesn&#x27;t feel right. I only used it for a week and stopped as I can&#x27;t continue using it. So, I Cant tell if it helps with wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
            <li> One of the best I have used and very reasonably priced too.  Pricier ones are NO better than this one.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn around my eyes.  I love all of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and now in my 40s and developing a few tiny fine lines around my eyes. This product is fairly moisturizing but that is all...does nothing to reduce lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Burt&#x27;s Bees Eye Cream for years.  It keeps the smile lines away.  I love the new &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; packaging.</li>
            <li> This cream is very smooth... it was good.  I love the package.  I don&#x27;t get to waste any cream.  I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have always heard good things about Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  So when my usual daily eye cream was running out, I decided to give the Intense Hydration Eye Cream a try.  I was particularly drawn to the idea that it is 99% natural.  However, my experience with the product has been very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, the cream comes in a tube with some sort of plug at the end to keep the cream in the tube.  The only way to get the plug out seems to be to press on the tube.  What then happened was that A LOT of the eye cream came out of the tube.  The line of eye cream that poured out into my hands was the length of the tube, meaning that I lost a significant amount of the product that I paid for which was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the eye cream around my eyes.  The first thing that I noticed was that it has a fragrance.  It is a sweet, floral smell that I thought would go away, but it didnt.  Although the scent was pleasant enough, it is not a scent I want to wear on a daily basis.  Plus, it became annoying over time because I could still smell it a while after I put the eye cream on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was several minutes after I applied the eye cream that I began to feel the warm, tingling sensation wherever I had applied it.  This feeling was not at all pleasant around my eyes.  I eventually washed off the eye cream and went out to buy my usual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of eye cream products and never have the creams had a floral scent.  Nor have they made my skin tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed with the Intense Hydration Eye Cream.  Not only do you lose a significant portion of the product just to get it out of the tube the first time, but the product has a scent and makes your skin tingle.  I cant comment on how well it works at reducing wrinkles, unfortunately as I wont use it again.</li>
            <li> This is just ok. I don&#x27;t feel like I see a difference. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I waited to see some results before reviewing this product, but still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. Would not recommend. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise and I normally don&#x27;t and my skin in parts felt dry.  So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin gotso much better since I used Burt&#x27;s Bees. Will keep using Bb priducts more in the future</li>
            <li> Best medicine and helps dry skin under eyes.</li>
            <li> just a very very very normal eye cream, no supplise, no disapoint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for dayly care, it seems to be enough</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this, light weight, but rich. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing effect, not heavy or greasy. I don&#x27;t notice a trememdous difference, but it does appy very smoothly and evenly.  I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This product is so smooth and creamy. It feels great on your skin. I actually look forward to applying it. I dab it all over my eyelids and underneath the eyes, as well as the crow feet area. It doesn&#x27;t burn or bead up. It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated. I&#x27;m thankful to find a natural product that does what I want. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and am doing my best to take preventative measures to minimize the effects of aging on my skin. This product seems to make the skin more supple around the eye area. I mostly use it at night. I haven&#x27;t had any problems using make up over it though during the day, just let it absorb first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eyelid eczema for a few months and needed some cream to hydrate my eyelid without further irritate my already dry skin. although it hasn&#x27;t resolved my eczema, it definitely helps keep it hydrated</li>
            <li> Good for the price! It&#x27;s for my mum. I will ask the result of using it and feedback soon.&lt;br /&gt;Good!</li>
            <li> Why did I ever wasted my time and money for expensive eye treatment when All I needed was this? Saw the difference in 2 weeks..my under eye skin looks hydrated and my eyes do not look tired!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days but I like how it is delivered.  It has a tip at the end so that you can easily control how much comes out and not waste it by using too much.  It is non irritating to my eyes even though it has a scent.  Only four stars because I do not know yet how it is a dealing with wrinkles.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> A good product. Seems to work as expected. Small tube, but you only need a tiny dab.</li>
            <li> No scent, easy to use; i like this tube design, just put on around eyes.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, definitely acne prone skin, and this does not affect it negatively at all. It does it&#x27;s job at being hydrating very well, it&#x27;s gentle, and it has a great price. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer, I&#x27;ve purchased from higher-end department store brands and I still prefer this cream.</li>
            <li> The eye cream soothes the driest skin around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams but this one works the best. It does not irritate or sting. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference whether I use it or not.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I saw no improvements.  The product name is misleading.  I just feel like a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee eye cream is very easy to use but I would prefer it to be somewhat creamier for application around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Burt bees is very good quality for the price. Works well, I see noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe all the stars I am seeing here. That truly proves there are people paid to write positive reviews. This stuff is like putting on SPF 45. It does not absorb well. In the trash it went.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel hydrated at all. i would not buy this again... i feel like i wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Not enough moisturizing, made me break out around the eyes. So if you have sensitive skin like I do.. stay away from it :)</li>
            <li> This eye cream is average. I don&#x27;t see any remarkable changes, or more accurately any visible changes... but my skin is soft and smooth and this without parabens - which is why I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s anyway.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of thick and sticky but it works for me. the design of head of this tube is cute. it&#x27;s similar to decorating tips of birthday cake.</li>
            <li> After using this every night until the tube was gone, sometimes twice a day, and I&#x27;ve decided to try other options. No noticeable difference in the area around my eyes, which I&#x27;m not completely shocked about after only one tube, but it is too greasy for me. It is like applying a thick lotion. Applied very sparingly (as it should be) it will take about an hour to feel completely absorbed, which I didn&#x27;t like since my routine is mostly right before bed. Still love Burt&#x27;s Bees, though!</li>
            <li> Provides intense hydration like it&#x27;s says  But did not correct the darks circles under my eyes or the wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes, ever since I was in my twenties, and have tried a LOT of eye creams. The ones that worked the best for me are the Clinique repairware laser focus, and a few of the Lanc√¥me ones I honestly can&#x27;t afford, but got to try gift-with-purchase samples. Last year I got a horrible dry pouch of skin on my upper eyelid, right in the corner of my eye. I desperately tried everything, even using olive oil on it at bedtime. I thought I was going to have a droopy eyelid for the rest of my life. I tried this intense hydration cream and it is the best eye cream ever. It got rid of that severe dry spot and keeps my eyes feeling great, even in winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results. it helps my eye makeup go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this in my makeup bag to apply to the under eye area on top of make up throughout the day. Immediately improves the appearance of the undereye area, making wrinkles or crepeyness much less apparent. The reason for four stars instead of five is that I don&#x27;t find it contagious enough active ingredients, such as peptides, to be my only I cream. Very nice product I want to know, I am on my second or third tube of it.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream because it absorbs fairly quickly and does not leave an oily feeling. It seems to help keep my eyes from being as puffy, but I still have some issues with dark circles ocassionally. I had used a different eye cream years back that took care of both issues, but the manufacturer quit making it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Nothing fancy. Good moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t burn.Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This was not intensely hydrating as promised.  It is more like a heavy face lotion than an intense eye cream.  Buy cetaphil cream instead!  Also it irritated my eyes.  Not sure why, either it made them water which caused redness around the outer corners, or it just irritated that delicate skin.  Either way, sent back.</li>
            <li> Very creamy. Highly recommend it if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Product as expected. I use this to hydrate around my eye area at night. It works! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products..  They never irritate me and always do an excellent job of moisutizing.  Extremely happy with the whole line .</li>
            <li> This product really does hydrate my under eye area. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old with normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading good reviews. It has a tacky consistency that just sits on top of the skin. I can feel that the skin around my eyes feels dry so I completely abandoned it and now I just rub my Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer around my eyes. I still want an eye cream but the Aveeno moisturizes much more than this &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this but my skin is too sensitive, I can not use it near my eyes. I&#x27;ve gone back to &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; Soothing Eye Balm.</li>
            <li> great ,,,to china ,,it is so long trip,i like it.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee Intense Hydration Eye Cream is the best.  I have dryness under my eyes and eye lids this works great for me .  been using it for months.</li>
            <li> The best natural eye cream I have found at a reasonable price. Plus it smells really great and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> great eye cream, it helps a bit diminishing the fine lines under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now in conjunction with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless serum, and radiance eye cream. I have been extremely pleased with the results experiencing a notable difference in appearance under my eyes and diminished appearance of &#x27;character lines&#x27; around my eyes, mouth and forehead. I thought I really liked my Boots No. 7 regimen I had been using for the past year... but found greater results with this combo from Burt&#x27;s Bees within the first week. I use this eye cream and the serum at night, and the radiance eye cream and the serum in the morning. Love it. Reasonably priced too compared to other products offering same results. A little of each goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great to use morning and night.  I have found it works great if you wear contact lens.  No problems with irritation.</li>
            <li> its too thick for my taste, but not bad. in terms of results, i really have no problems on my eye areas, so cant help you there. i just use eye creams for wrinkle prevention and hydration</li>
            <li> Very gentle and moisturizing for the eye area. I don&#x27;t wake up with dry skin around eyes any longer. So yes, I approve.</li>
            <li> For the winter dry skin, it&#x27;s great.  Little thick, so go easy at first...but does the trick nicely!  Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> very  good,but  so  small,hope it  can  help  my  eye&#x27;s  problem.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this cream. It caused my eyes and the skin around my eyes to burn horribly and took a week to recover.</li>
            <li> But I love their hydration face cream and this eye cream goes on smoothly and immediately goes into the delicate eye area to hydrate. Same product at Wal.....sells for a lot more. sue</li>
            <li> This really feels luxurious and moisturizing.  No color, no scent, no sting.  I pair it with a tinted eye cream to cover that thin skin that shows how tired I am. The dispenser tip is a bit different than any others I&#x27;ve seen. I still wouldn&#x27;t use it to rub the product in, though the tip is somewhat soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> This product reduces under eye puffiness and keeps my super dry skin from flaking. Love the smell as well,</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream for the price.  It goes on smooth and hydrates my delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky eyes and have fought the flakiness with multiple creams and lotions.  This is the first that has reduced the large flake problem that I use to experience.  The bad thing about creams with dry flaky skin is that it makes the skin itch or cause break outs.  Neither the itching nor break outs have happened!  Paired with the other hydration offerings it is a great set!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying it somewhere else for a higher price. Whoops.&lt;br /&gt;I actually love this stuff. I occasionally have dermatitis under my eyes from allergies to dust (it&#x27;s just about as fun as it sounds) and this stuff soothes the stinging skin right away and soaks right in. I also have sensitive skin and it seems to be totally fine on me. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! It really absorbs fast and makes your eyes have less lines!</li>
            <li> not hydration at all...</li>
