            <li>Great find, great deal.</li>
            <li>Having a great rating from a fashion magazine doesn&#x27;t insure quality.</li>
            <li>Have used this product before when it was on HSN and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and it takes FOR EV ER to get a good coat on.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I did not see anything good about this mascara.</li>
            <li>Awesome, bought for my daughters and they love love love it!</li>
            <li>amazon sent me an email telling me about these great deals and when I looked on the mirenesse web site I saw that one mascara was selling for  more  than the two</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily and your lashes don&#x27;t feel or look crunchy.</li>
            <li>The mascara is nice, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like many do.  </li>
            <li>however no where near the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and am so glad to see it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is not any better than others.</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara...</li>
            <li>I use a drugstore brand that works so much better at lengthening.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Will be buying again!!  :-)</li>
            <li>glad I got it on sale, because I would NEVER buy this item full-price, based on the item itself.</li>
            <li>For the price, I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;ll get better coverage with practice.</li>
            <li>it is the best - it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>I also have skin sensitives and most mascaras burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>they slide off when you wash up for the night.  :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this...</li>
            <li>Mirenesse goes on smooth - NEVER smudges, removes easily, does not burn - and - it LASSSTSSS all day!  </li>
            <li>The main thing I dislike is that it takes so many coats to do any good.  </li>
            <li>the beautiful case, I can find nothing even a little good about this product - it does not look like you used any mascara when finished</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take it goes on easily</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easily removed.  </li>
            <li>and  it comes off easily with just water, so you don&#x27;t get make up remover in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on an never smears or leaves marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this... could never afford to pay full price it was listed at but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to fine this mascara ever since QVC quit carry this brand when I saw this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s in a lovely tube, but it isn&#x27;t worth $14.50 a tube.</li>
            <li>I have used another product that was far superior to this -</li>
            <li>it washes off quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the eseast to clean up.</li>
            <li>I did not think it did anything special for my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for more from this mascara.</li>
            <li>I first got it, it was fabulous -</li>
            <li>This is a great product as are the other items in the Mirenesse line!</li>
            <li>It looks great and is definitely the one I will stick with as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer but it is so worth the wait!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is my second order of this mascara-- the first one was great and lasted 3 months---when I opened this order and used the first mascara--it was flaky, did not go on smooth, and flaked off  within very few hours--I must has gotten &amp;</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high, because I find absolutely nothing special about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It is very light to my eyelashes considering its fibers, and does not irritate my eyes, and it is long wearing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it won any real awards.</li>
            <li>..can&#x27;t get use to it then doesn&#x27;t really show a thicker volume from rest.</li>
            <li>very flaky..kept flaking off into my eyes</li>
            <li>I have stick straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes anymore</li>
            <li>and this mascara really does wash off with water.</li>
            <li>I have had more problems with my eyes being irritated after using this than any other mascara.</li>
            <li>#34;out of date&amp;#34; ones???&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive to NOT be good!</li>
            <li>it becomes dry very quickly in the tube and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes show like the Estee Lauder Mascara</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the great ratings and awards, even though I thought it was pretty expensive compared to what I can buy in stores.  </li>
            <li>I am older w/thinning eyelashes-so I am picky about mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have bought some great mascaras at less than HALF the price.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge, makes my lashes longer without looking overdone (I like a more natural look - but with extra coats you can get even more dramatic looks).  </li>
            <li>I think this looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Arrived dry, maybe because it&#x27;s very hot here?</li>
            <li>This version is the easiest to apply and long lasting and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>I like when I first opened it, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>and once it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>Would not waste your money.</li>
            <li>So far I like the ease of removing the mascara.</li>
            <li>I see no little tubes.</li>
            <li>i will always use this, plus it is true about not making a mess all over your face.</li>
            <li>However, it dried out quick and clumps</li>
            <li>This product made me loose my eye lashes and was very toxic.</li>
            <li>However, it seems like there is barely any in the container...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just purchased the wrong kind</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found with these two qualities, however this particular shipment of mascara seemed old and dried out, hence only 3 stars.</li>

            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found with these two qualities, however this particular shipment of mascara seemed old and dried out, hence only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> long but straight down.</li>
            <li> It takes far too long to apply with having to wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> This really made my short lashes look long and without making them hard and tacky like others i have used.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my personal preference, but I like to see a change in my eyelashes after a single coat.  </li>
            <li> I have even swam with it and as long as I don&#x27;t rub my eyes when I come out, it stays.  </li>
            <li> This mascara does not make your lashes look that long.</li>
            <li> Oh well, the search for long, luscious lashes continues.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eye lashes and thought this would make them thicker.  </li>
            <li> had to go over it with a less expensive brand but much better in mascara quality</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and have not worn mascara (and very little eye makeup) for some time due to irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they sent me half the money back</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t so I really like it for that, but I don&#x27;t feel that the coverage is very thick.  </li>
            <li> have tried at least &amp;#34;1000&amp;#34; in my lifetime...this actually stays on and actually washes off with water!</li>
            <li> this mascara even makes my eyelashes look lush and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying this plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ve only worn it in cold weather, not when I&#x27;m hot and sweaty.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wear any other mascara</li>
            <li> just so dry!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out so quickly, no matter how tight I close</li>
            <li> It does come off in little pieces when you wet them and rub.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price to us at all.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worse mascara I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It makes my long lashes look like fake lashes and my Aunts short lashes look like long lashes!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big disappointment, can&#x27;t see a bit of difference between this mascara and any other plain old dollar store mascara we&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> When you take it off, it&#x27;s little tubules that coated your lashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like little plastic tubes.</li>
            <li> Since it forms little tubes over your eyelashes</li>
            <li> its very dry and hard to put on....</li>
            <li> I mistaken - just a waste of money</li>
            <li> This mascara was a waste.</li>
            <li> Heavy on lash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I have</li>
            <li> i paid 30 bucks on a mascara at sephora that was dried up and didn&#x27;t work, i paid 30 for 2 mirenesse and an eye mask came with it.so</li>
            <li> If you simply want the false eyelash look that it promises then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or time!!  </li>
            <li> Thumbs Down !!</li>
            <li> For the price I wish I would have just gone to Nordstrom and bought my usual brand.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this mascara would elongate my small lashes, but it did not.  </li>

            <li> This mascara from Australia I have used for the last several years is wonderful it doesn&#x27;t take it goes on easily and although it is waterproof comes off with soap and water it makes my lashes look five times longer and thicker than they are</li>
            <li> Great Mascara! No smudges, great length</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and am so glad to see it here at Amazon.  I used to have to order it from Australia &amp; pay a lot for shipping.  I have a problem with &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; from smudging.  Waterproof mascaras don&#x27;t work for me.  This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave any darkness under my eyes.  When you take it off, it&#x27;s little tubules that coated your lashes so it&#x27;s easily removed.  I have even swam with it and as long as I don&#x27;t rub my eyes when I come out, it stays.  This is a great product as are the other items in the Mirenesse line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying this plain and simple. This mascara is not any better than others. I have had more problems with my eyes being irritated after using this than any other mascara. The brush is the best thing about it and it&#x27;s in a lovely tube, but it isn&#x27;t worth $14.50 a tube.</li>
            <li> It clumps and has fibers that cling to 5-6 lashes at a time.  I am very sorry I bought this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Clumps and not at all what it said it was.  Very disappointed!!!!  Not worth the money or time!!  Will never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara...have tried at least &amp;#34;1000&amp;#34; in my lifetime...this actually stays on and actually washes off with water!</li>
            <li> This mascara does not make your lashes look that long. I use a drugstore brand that works so much better at lengthening. However, this mascara is great at not smudging ever! It does come off in little pieces when you wet them and rub. If your looking for a smudge proof and not \\&quot;false eyelashes\\&quot; look (like it advertises)  then I suggest you buy this product. If you simply want the false eyelash look that it promises then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.  I did not think it did anything special for my eye lashes.  Would not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love this product it&#x27;s the best mascara I ever owned.It&#x27;s the eseast to clean up. It looks great all day.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed...it becomes dry very quickly in the tube and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes show like the Estee Lauder Mascara I use. I don&#x27;t know if I just purchased the wrong kind</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like many do.  However, it seems like there is barely any in the container... waiting to see if it lasts longer than a month. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  It makes my long lashes look like fake lashes and my Aunts short lashes look like long lashes!!  We bought this to compare and it definitely made the cut!!  Will be buying again!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this... could never afford to pay full price it was listed at but the sale price I would always buy this!</li>
            <li> This product made me loose my eye lashes and was very toxic. I returned it and will never try it again.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have found that does not end up under my eyes (raccoon eyes). It stays puts until you wash it off. It is very easy to wash off. It looks great and is definitely the one I will stick with as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this mascara-- the first one was great and lasted 3 months---when I opened this order and used the first mascara--it was flaky, did not go on smooth, and flaked off  within very few hours--I must has gotten &amp;#34;out of date&amp;#34; ones???&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive to NOT be good!</li>
            <li> firstly false advertising -shows 2 mascara cases calls them DUO and I received one mascara&lt;br /&gt;but I guess it made no difference because one is bad , two would have been worse&lt;br /&gt;they sent me half the money back&lt;br /&gt;besides the beautiful case, I can find nothing even a little good about this product - it does not look like you used any mascara when finished&lt;br /&gt;I had to go over it with a less expensive brand but much better in mascara quality&lt;br /&gt;why did I buy this product?&lt;br /&gt;because amazon sent me an email telling me about these great deals and when I looked on the mirenesse web site I saw that one mascara was selling for  more  than the two i  thought I was getting and  this was a great opportunity to try something at a great deal according to amazon advertisement  thinking they want to get  product exposure on amazon&lt;br /&gt;was I mistaken - just a waste of money</li>
            <li> This mascara was a waste. After applying several times, it still looked like I had no mascara on. Very disappointing.  I don&#x27;t believe it won any real awards.</li>
            <li> Arrived dry, maybe because it&#x27;s very hot here?</li>
            <li> I like this Mascara because it doesn&#x27;t smudge all over by the end of the day so you look like a raccoon.  Comes off very easily and your lashes don&#x27;t feel or look crunchy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great ratings and awards, even though I thought it was pretty expensive compared to what I can buy in stores.  Maybe my expectations were too high, because I find absolutely nothing special about this mascara.  I do like that it does not give me raccoon eyes from smudging.  However, I have used others that were just as beneficial in that respect, at a much less expensive price.  Plus, I&#x27;ve only worn it in cold weather, not when I&#x27;m hot and sweaty.  Can&#x27;t say how smudge proof it will be then.  The main thing I dislike is that it takes so many coats to do any good.  It seems diluted or something.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my personal preference, but I like to see a change in my eyelashes after a single coat.  Because of that and the expense, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It takes far too long to apply with having to wait for it to dry and once it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t look right.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I see no little tubes. Not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like when I first opened it, but it doesn&#x27;t last. Ends up flaking and clumping on the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the mascara, it does elongate however when you wash it off it&#x27;s like little plastic tubes. Very strange.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out so quickly, no matter how tight I close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours, as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, it was fabulous - however no where near the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got it on sale, because I would NEVER buy this item full-price, based on the item itself.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes feel tubular...each last encapsulated. ..can&#x27;t get use to it then doesn&#x27;t really show a thicker volume from rest. Heavy on lash.Thumbs Down !!</li>
            <li> this mascara even makes my eyelashes look lush and thick</li>
            <li> Have used this product before when it was on HSN and loved it.  I do not have raccoon eyes and  it comes off easily with just water, so you don&#x27;t get make up remover in the eyes.  This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found with these two qualities, however this particular shipment of mascara seemed old and dried out, hence only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome, bought for my daughters and they love love love it! Great find, great deal. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting more.  I am not impressed with the quality of the mascara. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with mascara smudging.  This didn&#x27;t so I really like it for that, but I don&#x27;t feel that the coverage is very thick.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with the application of it so maybe I&#x27;ll get better coverage with practice. It did arrive a lot quicker than it stated.</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed in this product and qualty. For the price I wish I would have just gone to Nordstrom and bought my usual brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to fine this mascara ever since QVC quit carry this brand when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes it is the best - it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> It is the best mascara on the market!!! And I have tried a lot of them.  Easy to put on an never smears or leaves marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Having a great rating from a fashion magazine doesn&#x27;t insure quality. I was really hoping for more from this mascara. I can tell it has the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; for extending lashes as I find them on my face when I wash it off. There&#x27;s just no bulk to this mascara and it takes FOR EV ER to get a good coat on. Oh well, the search for long, luscious lashes continues.</li>
            <li> This Mascara exceeded my expectations.  I am older w/thinning eyelashes-so I am picky about mascara.  I also have skin sensitives and most mascaras burn my eyes.  Mirenesse goes on smooth - NEVER smudges, removes easily, does not burn - and - it LASSSTSSS all day!  I am sold.</li>
            <li> very flaky..kept flaking off into my eyes</li>
            <li> This is by far the worse mascara I have ever purchased. It clumps and bits fa off my lashes. Would like to return? Doubtful. I will stick to Lancomb for the same price. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I have</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and have not worn mascara (and very little eye makeup) for some time due to irritation. I saw this as a daily deal and after reading a bit about it, decided to give it a try. Wonderful, is the best way I can describe it. It does not give racoon eyes even when I rub them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if you want the dark, dark, thick, fake looking lashes-this is probably not for you. I think this looks very natural on me. I don&#x27;t glob it on either though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my current plan is to make this the only mascara in my bag.</li>
            <li> I have used another product that was far superior to this - I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this mascara.  It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I even gave one tube to my daughter to try and she felt the same way.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This really made my short lashes look long and without making them hard and tacky like others i have used. i paid 30 bucks on a mascara at sephora that was dried up and didn&#x27;t work, i paid 30 for 2 mirenesse and an eye mask came with it.so i will always use this, plus it is true about not making a mess all over your face.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge, makes my lashes longer without looking overdone (I like a more natural look - but with extra coats you can get even more dramatic looks).  Very good value.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and the tube mascaras work best.  This version is the easiest to apply and long lasting and easy to remove.  Does not interfere with my contacts.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this mascara would elongate my small lashes, but it did not.  I did like that it washes off quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great concept! I wish my eyelashes would stay curled.I have stick straight eyelashes. ..long but straight down. I always curl them.I prefer the curler with the plastic rubber instead of the silicone.It is very difficult to find the plastic rubber one these days.Tempted to try the heated curler...The price has kept me away.So far I like the ease of removing the mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like, at all. I did not see anything good about this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara on earth!!!!! I have very sensitive eyes and I can&#x27;t wear any other mascara or I constantly have to rub my eyes. I can wear this Mirenesse mascara for 2-3 days at a time!!!!! It&#x27;s truly amazing. It takes a little longer but it is so worth the wait!!!!  Oh it comes off with just soap and water and those aren&#x27;t your eyelashes falling out. Since it forms little tubes over your eyelashes they slide off when you wash up for the night.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I really don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes anymore and this mascara really does wash off with water. I will order this again</li>
            <li> I have bought some great mascaras at less than HALF the price.  This looks clumpy and does not elongate my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> We saw the so-called tube-forming mascara on HSN and looked to see what Amazon might have.  It&#x27;s a big disappointment, can&#x27;t see a bit of difference between this mascara and any other plain old dollar store mascara we&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s not worth the price to us at all.</li>
            <li> It is very light to my eyelashes considering its fibers, and does not irritate my eyes, and it is long wearing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this...its very dry and hard to put on....just so dry!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I have naturally long eye lashes and thought this would make them thicker.  However, it dried out quick and clumps</li>
