            <li>Best buy I can find.</li>
            <li>Best Gel made.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect!</li>
            <li>GREAT HAIR PRODUCT FOR MEN!  </li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>Best gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Awesome product if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent hold.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>Great hold.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Given the quantity (12 oz), it is a great value</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>This gel/pomade is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Works like a heavier gel... very nice feel for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS FILLED WITH CANCER CAUSING INGREDIENTS!!</li>
            <li>but it smells really good.</li>
            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>Dries strong, looks great, keeps hair where it needs to be all day.</li>
            <li>However, it is flake free and has great hold.  </li>
            <li>Even though it costs a bit more, the size of the container makes it a good value.</li>
            <li>This product is water based, so it washes out of my hair very easily.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product with a clean fresh (not perfume) smell.  </li>
            <li>: First of all this is a great value, this 12oz jar lasted me close to a year.</li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>More bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a gel than a pomade, but it does give you a lot of control as soon as you apply it.  </li>
            <li>Most notably DMDM Hydantoin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Look no further to look you best!</li>
            <li>Simply the greatest for maximum hold and a clean look.</li>
            <li>Once it dries however, it has incredible hold and simply does not flake.</li>
            <li>Hair is easily restyled with a damp comb.</li>
            <li>Washes out easy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so strong that I wake up looking like</li>
            <li>When I style it early in the day, it looks amazing, but the more it dries throughout the day, the dryer and more crunchy and curly my hair starts to look.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little cheaper but best</li>
            <li>If you use a very tiny amount and lots of water you can get a really great hold an minimize the sticky.</li>
            <li>No annoying scent.</li>
            <li>I will stick to the original pomade.</li>
            <li>Clean.  </li>
            <li>and I was astonished by how fast it arrived, via Top Shelf Barber Supplies.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff after a long time searching.</li>
            <li>Smells good, lightweight, doesn&#x27;t flake, holds very strongly with very little product, and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch!</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice slick product that is easy to get through the hair.</li>
            <li>It last all day and it very light on the hair.</li>
            <li>Super super toxic and carcinogenic, should never be used in a beauty product or anything that would come in direct contact with anything living.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the slick back look.</li>
            <li>This product took a bit of getting used to, as it is a bit stickier than one would expect, when first applying.</li>
            <li>(I only style the top) and</li>
            <li>great hold, kind like some hair spray, makes your hair hard and not moving at all, not so easy to loose even with a little rain drops on your head</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Better than any other gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Once you set it, it&#x27;s set, try and come back at it with a comb after 30 minutes and you rip your scalp CLEAN OFF.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other pomades and this one is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More of a gel not a strong scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty versatile, if I add it when my hair is wet, I get that slicked look.</li>
            <li>it feels like I&#x27;ve barely dented it.</li>

            <li> Jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have really wavy and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I even blow dry it after styling to save that from happening.</li>
            <li> If I add it when my hair is 100% dry, it adds some volume and lift without the wet look.</li>
            <li> It does not have the hold I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what qualifies this product as a pomade; it seems like regular hair gel.  </li>
            <li> Slightly too stiff of a hold, you have to have your hair trim and tight to make it work properly.</li>
            <li> Need a little touch up?</li>
            <li> just gel don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> Consistency is runny and not as firm.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of gel in this can – I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month</li>
            <li> Not greasy or too stiff.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair STIFF though.</li>
            <li> I usually use wax pomade, but when I need heavy duty hold I use this.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few pomade that holds my thick hair well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> my thick hair n gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like an expensive hard-hold gel.</li>
            <li> Bad: Some people may not like it because it does have the consistency of gel, but that is a non-issue for me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its gel that&#x27;s all it us just gel don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> The product is ok. It does not have the hold I expected but it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Nice slick product that is easy to get through the hair. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> this is like sticky glue. I don&#x27;t really care for it. If you use a very tiny amount and lots of water you can get a really great hold an minimize the sticky. If you don&#x27;t mind the stickiness I imagine you could get your hair to stay in any shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what qualifies this product as a pomade; it seems like regular hair gel.  However, it is flake free and has great hold.  So kudos to that.</li>
            <li> Best buy I can find. More bang for the buck. On time delivery. Holds and styles well. Not too shiny.</li>
            <li> Best Gel made.  Clean.  Not greasy or too stiff.  Have purchased multiple times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a gel than a pomade, but it does give you a lot of control as soon as you apply it.  Even though it costs a bit more, the size of the container makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> It is perfect! Perfect for the slick back look.</li>
            <li> GREAT HAIR PRODUCT FOR MEN!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Better than any other gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells good, lightweight, doesn&#x27;t flake, holds very strongly with very little product, and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Wish it was a little cheaper but best pomade I&#x27;ve tried, therefore, I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Dries strong, looks great, keeps hair where it needs to be all day. I usually use wax pomade, but when I need heavy duty hold I use this.</li>
            <li> The Good: First of all this is a great value, this 12oz jar lasted me close to a year. This is one of the few pomade that holds my thick hair well throughout the day. This product is water based, so it washes out of my hair very easily. Also you can reactive the product with some water if needed. I have tried many other pomades and this one is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Some people may not like it because it does have the consistency of gel, but that is a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product with a clean fresh (not perfume) smell.  Great hold.</li>
            <li> Same jar, same label and same color as the product I purchased at the salon, but not the same result.  Consistency is runny and not as firm.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Jar lasts a long time.  No annoying scent.</li>
            <li> Slightly too stiff of a hold, you have to have your hair trim and tight to make it work properly.</li>
            <li> great hold, kind like some hair spray, makes your hair hard and not moving at all, not so easy to loose even with a little rain drops on your head</li>
            <li> Best gel I have ever used. I was running low and needed to purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This product works great, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS FILLED WITH CANCER CAUSING INGREDIENTS!! Most notably DMDM Hydantoin. Super super toxic and carcinogenic, should never be used in a beauty product or anything that would come in direct contact with anything living.</li>
            <li> I will stick to the original pomade. This leaves your hair like a helmet</li>
            <li> Awesome product if you have curly hair. It last all day and it very light on the hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product took a bit of getting used to, as it is a bit stickier than one would expect, when first applying. Once it dries however, it has incredible hold and simply does not flake. Given the quantity (12 oz), it is a great value and I was astonished by how fast it arrived, via Top Shelf Barber Supplies. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> There is a lot of gel in this can – I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month (I only style the top) and it feels like I&#x27;ve barely dented it. It&#x27;s also pretty versatile, if I add it when my hair is wet, I get that slicked look. If I add it when my hair is 100% dry, it adds some volume and lift without the wet look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like an expensive hard-hold gel. I have really wavy and thick hair. When I style it early in the day, it looks amazing, but the more it dries throughout the day, the dryer and more crunchy and curly my hair starts to look. I even blow dry it after styling to save that from happening. The only reason I&#x27;ll keep using it is because my wife will kill me if I don&#x27;t use up my $20 hair product.</li>
            <li> More of a gel not a strong scent but it holds my thick hair n gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Look no further to look you best! Simply the greatest for maximum hold and a clean look. Hair is easily restyled with a damp comb.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold. Not too shiny (ymmv). Smells great. Washes out easy. Need a little touch up? Run your hands/comb under some water and restyle.</li>
            <li> This gel/pomade is great stuff. It makes your hair STIFF though. If you&#x27;re into a softer feel/look then go for something else. I use this in my hair when I&#x27;m working or out riding my bike. This stuff is so strong that I wake up looking like I just combed my hair. Once you set it, it&#x27;s set, try and come back at it with a comb after 30 minutes and you rip your scalp CLEAN OFF.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff after a long time searching. I bought this and Suavecito both at the same time to try them out. This is an all day hold and keeps a shine. Leo DiCaprio in Gatsby look.</li>
            <li> Works like a heavier gel... very nice feel for shorter hair.</li>
