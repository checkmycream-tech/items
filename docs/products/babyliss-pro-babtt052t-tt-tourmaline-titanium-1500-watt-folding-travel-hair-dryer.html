    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This hair dryer worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and excellent shipping.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m happy!!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent travel dryer both in size and in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This worked great!</li>
            <li>and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>All this and beautiful too!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;high\\&quot; heat/fan setting is very warm, but not TOO aggressive (it doesn&#x27;t blow everything away in my bathroom!).  </li>
            <li>This dryer worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The dual-voltage benefit is great for world travelers, and the directional nozzle is a great addition.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is great,</li>
            <li>I can go on vacation confidant that my hair will look great taking this dryer instead of using those sub par dryers provided in hotel rooms.</li>
            <li>and it worked great in South America.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>and I just love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this brand called BaByliss, which is a new name to me.</li>
            <li>I was living in a 16th century farmhouse, and I was told that it would be very easy to blow a fuse while using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite aspects of this travel dryer?  </li>
            <li>I hoped that I would be as pleased as everyone else seemed to be</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is 1500 watts and worked wonderful for my trip to CA last month &amp; now I just use it every day.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so pleased with it</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be able to tell if it&#x27;s the dryer or the weather until winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with the dryer since then and am so glad that my mistake didn&#x27;t ruin the dryer.</li>
            <li>Not once did it overheat, either, like so many portables I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for the money.  </li>
            <li>it worked perfect for 6 months &amp; then died suddenly.</li>
            <li>Matt finish: a) enables better grip b) hides fingerprints</li>
            <li>However, it is simply the best hair dryer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to pack for travel and its cute too.</li>
            <li>I love the light weight and the size.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is light weight,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, powerful for it&#x27;s size, and very cute.</li>
            <li>It is now my primary hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I think it would make a great Christmas present for her this year.  </li>
            <li>Its compact and light</li>
            <li>It burned my fingers because it ran very hot, and it wasn&#x27;t easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>this product packs more punch than it looks capable of!  </li>
            <li>As the other reviews here attest, it dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li>I bought this blow dryer after reading several good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Dual voltage - a true travel</li>
            <li>This dryer is almost as powerful as my 1850 watt full sized home dryer-</li>
            <li>so it will travel easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the cupboard when I have it at home.  </li>
            <li>The hotel dryer was fairly wimpy, not a new experience for us in Europe.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>This dryer easily out-performs others in the \\&quot;Compact\\&quot; range and most definitely in the Mini-range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually made my hair feel smooth, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s travel size, it works better than my old full-size one did.</li>
            <li>Good rubbery-feeling plastic casing, ceramic heating element (doesn&#x27;t burn your hair or your fingers as you &#x27;scrunch dry&#x27;), has a tight folding handle and good length cord.  </li>
            <li>And it drys my hair really fast!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.</li>
            <li>At first I forgot to switch between the voltage settings and the dryer stopped working.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to worry it works better than my big dryer that I was replacing ever did.</li>
            <li>I read all of the positive reviews on this model, ordered it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li>Very lite weight.</li>
            <li>Very compact...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>It has plenty of heat/air volume, much more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to pack, taking up very little space, and was comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair really fast &amp; makes my hair look better than any other dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li>effective dryer &#x3D; high velocity for its size, and this little dryer delivers.  </li>
            <li>This particular dryer is by far the lightest weight dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, but the fan &amp; heat settings are plenty powerful to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I great little hairdryer so far.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat/fan is still warm enough to dry &#x27;almost-dry&#x27; hair, with a slower fan speed for styling.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new hair dryer, because ours was an older, much heavier model</li>
            <li>If only it came with a tiny diffuser, I would use it ALL the time:)</li>
            <li>The red is a very pretty color as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li>* High velocity (speed of air) for its size&lt;br</li>
            <li>* 2 settings (high heat/speed:low speed/heat)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tossed my large, old dryer within a week of getting this.</li>
            <li>This blowdryer is super little-just four or five inches long and a few wide when folded--and it has pretty good blow power given it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>The wattage wasn&#x27;t too high so that it never blew a fuse, and it worked as good if not better than the standard size 1875 watt hair dryer that I use at home.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this small, light, powerful and fast hair dryer!!  </li>
            <li>even my mother-in-law who has trouble holding her arms up for long can use this one &amp; get a great look for her hair in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soo shiny and smooth compared to other hair dryers I have used.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to blow dry than the full size BabyBliss I also own, but it only a few minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like some.</li>
            <li>I took this dryer on a trip with me to New Zealand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo small and cute it fits into the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>It dried my medium length hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much lighter weight than traditional dryers, and more compact for storage in my small, 1-BR condo bathroom.  </li>
            <li>With this dryer I spend the same amount of time but my hair is much dryer than with my old one.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer was dying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable, quiet, small and very light.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair and it is less likely to burn.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer for international traveling!</li>
            <li>Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>light weight, small</li>
            <li>On a recent trip, my thick curly hair dried quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly simple girl so having only the 2 speeds, low &amp; high, doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>It takes me about 2-3 minutes longer to dry my hair with this small dryer compared to my old, full size dryer did but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  </li>
            <li>Bought this last May to replace a 15 year old travel-sized hairdryer, used daily.  </li>
            <li>but 6 months is not a very long life for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Babyliss&#x27; other Compact Travel [single voltage] dryers deliver a higher air volume for even faster drying.</li>

            <li> Bought this last May to replace a 15 year old travel-sized hairdryer, used daily.  </li>
            <li> but 6 months is not a very long life for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Babyliss&#x27; other Compact Travel [single voltage] dryers deliver a higher air volume for even faster drying.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I got my tiny dryer that it would not be able to dry my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It dried my mop in the same amount of time as my normal size dryer at home.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have short hair, but with only 5-8 minutes&#x27; use my hair is dry &amp; styled.  </li>
            <li> so I needed a new one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> it takes about the same time to dry my hair with either one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small- only about 6 inches by 3 inches when folded, and has made my hair routine much easier when traveling.  </li>
            <li> so for those who like specifics, it is 6.50\\&quot; long with attachment, 3.5\\&quot; wide (folded), and 2.75\\&quot; deep; the fold-out handle is about 3.5\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> Cord is long.  </li>
            <li> Have been careful not to drop it in case the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; might be fragile.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my everyday hairdryer and it&#x27;s quick, even on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> We wanted only carry on bags for our one week trip to France last month, so I bought this little dual voltage dryer.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find something that would dry my hair faster and be lighter to handle.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because it was a great dryer up until then</li>
            <li> This little red hair dryer is everything I ever wanted in a dryer.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> It is also a plus that it is so light and small!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased, last year, an Andis brand travel dryer, and I didn&#x27;t think it was all that small.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for overseas travel and was initially attracted by the small size and weight.</li>
            <li> Thinking about gifting it to other family members.</li>

            <li> Due to some shoulder issues I&#x27;m having now that I&#x27;m &gt;50, I&#x27;ve started using \\&quot;travel\\&quot; blow dryers for my everyday dryer.  They&#x27;re much lighter weight than traditional dryers, and more compact for storage in my small, 1-BR condo bathroom.  This particular dryer is by far the lightest weight dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, but the fan &amp; heat settings are plenty powerful to do the job.  The \\&quot;high\\&quot; heat/fan setting is very warm, but not TOO aggressive (it doesn&#x27;t blow everything away in my bathroom!).  The \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat/fan is still warm enough to dry &#x27;almost-dry&#x27; hair, with a slower fan speed for styling.  Admittedly, I have short hair, but with only 5-8 minutes&#x27; use my hair is dry &amp; styled.  I&#x27;ve used it daily since I bought it, with no problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to take with me to Italy for my 3 month study abroad trip. I was living in a 16th century farmhouse, and I was told that it would be very easy to blow a fuse while using a hair dryer. This hair dryer worked wonderfully. The wattage wasn&#x27;t too high so that it never blew a fuse, and it worked as good if not better than the standard size 1875 watt hair dryer that I use at home. The dual voltage switch worked well. I highly recommend this hair dryer for international traveling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I great little hairdryer so far. It&#x27;s super light, powerful for it&#x27;s size, and very cute. I use it as my everyday hairdryer and it&#x27;s quick, even on my thick hair. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit difficult when shifting between high and low power, but it still earns a five rating in my book.</li>
            <li> It is now my primary hair dryer.  I love the light weight and the size.  Yes, the heat is inconsistent at times but I do not find that to be a problem.  I have a lot of fine hair and it is less likely to burn.  And it drys my hair really fast!  love it!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed!  It&#x27;s very small- only about 6 inches by 3 inches when folded, and has made my hair routine much easier when traveling.  This dryer is almost as powerful as my 1850 watt full sized home dryer- it takes about the same time to dry my hair with either one. The dual-voltage benefit is great for world travelers, and the directional nozzle is a great addition.  It helps aim the flow air, and makes hair less prone to frizz.  One of my favorite aspects of this travel dryer?  I don&#x27;t have to worry about who&#x27;s germs are all over the hotel dryer!</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer after reading several good reviews.  I hoped that I would be as pleased as everyone else seemed to be and I was even happier. This blow dryer is 1500 watts and worked wonderful for my trip to CA last month &amp; now I just use it every day.  I LOVE that it is light weight, even my mother-in-law who has trouble holding her arms up for long can use this one &amp; get a great look for her hair in a short amount of time.  I think it would make a great Christmas present for her this year.  It takes me about 2-3 minutes longer to dry my hair with this small dryer compared to my old, full size dryer did but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  I&#x27;m a fairly simple girl so having only the 2 speeds, low &amp; high, doesn&#x27;t bother me.  This dryer is great, light weight, small so it will travel easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the cupboard when I have it at home.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> This dryer worked beautifully. I bought it for vacation and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I&#x27;ve been using it as my everyday hair dryer ever since. It dried my medium length hair very quickly. It actually made my hair feel smooth, shiny and healthy looking. It&#x27;s sooo small and cute it fits into the palm of your hand. Very lite weight. It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. The red is a very pretty color as well. You will not be disappointed in this dryer. I can go on vacation confidant that my hair will look great taking this dryer instead of using those sub par dryers provided in hotel rooms. Highly recommend this dryer. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent shipping. After looking all over for a compact, efficient travel hair dryer with attachment (retail and online), I decided on this one even though I couldn&#x27;t find dimensions anywhere. Very compact...so for those who like specifics, it is 6.50\\&quot; long with attachment, 3.5\\&quot; wide (folded), and 2.75\\&quot; deep; the fold-out handle is about 3.5\\&quot; long. The detachable concentrator attachment slips over the front end snugly and stays on.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer was dying so I needed a new one for everyday use. After reading the reviews on this one I decided to buy it. Even though it&#x27;s travel size, it works better than my old full-size one did. It also makes my hair soo shiny and smooth compared to other hair dryers I have used. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We wanted only carry on bags for our one week trip to France last month, so I bought this little dual voltage dryer. The hotel dryer was fairly wimpy, not a new experience for us in Europe. This 1000-watt gem dried my wife&#x27;s long thick hair in no time. It&#x27;s durable, quiet, small and very light. Just the ticket for a carry-on adventure.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this small, light, powerful and fast hair dryer!!  I&#x27;m a petite person with petite arms who always had problems with other heavier, longer dryers and hated doing my hair for years.  This little red hair dryer is everything I ever wanted in a dryer.  I just wish it had a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button but I&#x27;m so pleased with it I&#x27;ll just rave about it for now!</li>
            <li> I tossed my large, old dryer within a week of getting this. For me, it&#x27;s not just for traveling, it&#x27;s now my daily dryer. I&#x27;m lazy and hate spending a long time drying my curly, prone to frizz, hair. With this dryer I spend the same amount of time but my hair is much dryer than with my old one. My frizziness is also much less these days but I won&#x27;t be able to tell if it&#x27;s the dryer or the weather until winter. Either way, I&#x27;m happy!!!!</li>
            <li> This product met all my needs. It works well in the U.S. and it worked great in South America. Its compact and light so it&#x27;s easy to pack for travel and its cute too. At first I forgot to switch between the voltage settings and the dryer stopped working. I switched to the correct voltage then waited a minute or two until it worked again. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the dryer since then and am so glad that my mistake didn&#x27;t ruin the dryer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Looks can be deceiving...this product packs more punch than it looks capable of!  On a recent trip, my thick curly hair dried quickly and smoothly. It was easy to pack, taking up very little space, and was comfortable to use.  Not once did it overheat, either, like so many portables I&#x27;ve owned. I give this little number a 4 star review!</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is super little-just four or five inches long and a few wide when folded--and it has pretty good blow power given it&#x27;s size. It takes longer to blow dry than the full size BabyBliss I also own, but it only a few minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like some. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Now THIS is a travel dryer!  I purchased, last year, an Andis brand travel dryer, and I didn&#x27;t think it was all that small. It burned my fingers because it ran very hot, and it wasn&#x27;t easy to travel with. Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a smaller travel dryer, as I travel a lot.  I found this when searching here on Amazon for a folding hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-made small hair dryer.  Good rubbery-feeling plastic casing, ceramic heating element (doesn&#x27;t burn your hair or your fingers as you &#x27;scrunch dry&#x27;), has a tight folding handle and good length cord.  Doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for the money.  I&#x27;m impressed with this brand called BaByliss, which is a new name to me.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I got my tiny dryer that it would not be able to dry my thick hair. I didn&#x27;t have to worry it works better than my big dryer that I was replacing ever did. It dries my hair really fast &amp; makes my hair look better than any other dryer I have owned. I highly recommend it.    ****update on this dryer it worked perfect for 6 months &amp; then died suddenly. I am very disappointed because it was a great dryer up until then but 6 months is not a very long life for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent travel dryer both in size and in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length thick hair and using the hotel dryer would take me 20+ mins just to get my hair to semi-dry (&amp; this was using a super-absorbent hair towel prior to drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An effective dryer &#x3D; high velocity for its size, and this little dryer delivers.  This dryer easily out-performs others in the \\&quot;Compact\\&quot; range and most definitely in the Mini-range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* High velocity (speed of air) for its size&lt;br /&gt;* 2 settings (high heat/speed:low speed/heat)&lt;br /&gt;* Matt finish: a) enables better grip b) hides fingerprints&lt;br /&gt;* Removable back-grate enabling filter cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;* 6-ft cord&lt;br /&gt;* Small size - *almost* falls into \\&quot;mini\\&quot; category.&lt;br /&gt;* Does not sound like a lawnmwer - quiet.&lt;br /&gt;* Dual voltage - a true travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need the dual voltage, can spare a few grams and another inch or two in the suitcase, Babyliss&#x27; other Compact Travel [single voltage] dryers deliver a higher air volume for even faster drying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for overseas travel and was initially attracted by the small size and weight. However, it is simply the best hair dryer that I have ever used. As the other reviews here attest, it dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful sheen. I have used several others that claim to use ionic or tourmaline technology, but this one lives up to its promise. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I took this dryer on a trip with me to New Zealand. I have very thick, curly hair and have had trouble finding a hair dryer that will work well in other countries. This worked great! It dried my mop in the same amount of time as my normal size dryer at home. It is also a plus that it is so light and small!!!! If only it came with a tiny diffuser, I would use it ALL the time:)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new hair dryer, because ours was an older, much heavier model and I wanted to find something that would dry my hair faster and be lighter to handle.  I read all of the positive reviews on this model, ordered it and I just love it!  I know they said it&#x27;s a travel dryer, but I&#x27;ve been using it every day and it is awesome!  Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Bought this last May to replace a 15 year old travel-sized hairdryer, used daily.  It has plenty of heat/air volume, much more than I expected.  Cord is long.  It folds into a compact size.  All this and beautiful too! Have been careful not to drop it in case the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; might be fragile.  Thinking about gifting it to other family members.</li>
