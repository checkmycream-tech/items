            <li>received this product free of charge for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil because it has so many uses, not just cooking.</li>
            <li>this oil!&lt;br /&gt;the oil make food more delicious&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

            <li>I did not agree to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.ut oil has been very positive.</li>

            <li>applies easily to your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is super versatile!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a coconut oil connoisseur nor a snob by any means, and I noticed a huge difference with the PalmTree Organic Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left our hair shiny, smooth, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I recently learned that coconut oil is great for doggies.  </li>
            <li>For the hair - I recommend using it 2 inches away from the scalp through the ends, it is great for shine and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I was provided with a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tastes fantastic-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s certified organic and GMO free.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>enjoy using it every day.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping thanks...</li>
            <li>if you have never used coconut oil you might be pleasantly surprised at how versatile and good it is.</li>
            <li>Palmtree coconut oil product is &amp;#34;extra virgin.&amp;#34; Since it hasn&#x27;t been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t like it, the company is very honest, they will give you the money back without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>very fresh oil&lt;</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to be sure whatever coconut oil you purchase is USDA Organic and pure, with no additives of any sort.</li>
            <li>and I really would love if they would carry it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not only is this good for your body, but also for your pets, it will help with their hair and skin also.  </li>
            <li>I am a true believer in Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>Smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong smell that may not suit everyone, but we like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have one jar to cook with and the other for my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
            <li>My family and I go through this stuff so quickly - we use it for cooking, a great alternative to butter and other oils that can be harmful upon heating.</li>
            <li>the Taste is mild but I like the fact I am not using a petroleum product for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>: From my experience, pregnant women might find the smell repulsive.</li>
            <li>Good quality coconut oil is basically a commodity as far as I am concerned so it probably doesn&#x27;t make much difference</li>
            <li>Being a real fan of Palmtree Products&#x27; competitor, Viva Labs, and their organic extra virgin coconut oil, I was really curious to see how this brand of premium organic coconut oil compares to my favorite and was happy to be given the opportunity to review it in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: the flavor of Palmtree&#x27;s OEVCO is superb, and I really do love it (hence the five stars).</li>
            <li>My sister is pregnant with twins</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Using while pregnant to moisturize my skin and help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>A really high quality coconut oil, and I am really fussy when it comes to this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>I have never purchase a more natural coconut oil ever!</li>
            <li>I loved the product, but the packaging to secure that this product arrived without spilling all over in the box was not, the cap was not placed on tight.</li>
            <li>I have tried and tested so many coconut oil products by now and this is BY FAR my favourite one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had a lot of success replacing butter and olive oil in some of my recipes.  </li>
            <li>, I received this specific coconut oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Licks it right off the spoon.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great raw too just on a teaspoon out of the tub or in smoothies, and even as a moisturiser on the skin.</li>
            <li>Never go wrong with coconut oil and this product was perfect, I use it on my elbow and heels also I have super curly hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Palmtree organic coconut oil has been very positive.</li>
            <li>Works great, but came with a large chunk missing.</li>
            <li>have to say that the quality of the Palmtree Products&#x27; OEVCO vs. Viva Labs&#x27; is very, very close.</li>
            <li>Premium coconut oil is exactly what it claims, it is Premium.  </li>
            <li>The melting temperature of unrefined coconut oil is about 76° F, so at most normal room temperatures, the oil has a soft creamy texture.</li>
            <li>i got exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a function of the fact that my huge Viva Labs jar is about a year old or what, but the Palmtree Products brand smelled fresher and a little more strongly of coconuts.</li>
            <li>I do believe  it is good for you because over a period of 6 months my cholesterol has come down to normal and my stomach fat is leaving my body!  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to my friends and family with total confidence that they&#x27;re getting top quality.</li>
            <li>many of which are much more fanatic about their health than I am.  </li>
            <li>Also I use it in smoothies and salads and for cooking certain foods.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impatiently waiting for more!  </li>
            <li>We were using a different brand first that he wouldn&#x27;t get as excited about.  </li>
            <li>(not put it in after, like stay-in conditioner), that&#x27;s when it really works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please and have recommended it to my friends -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually tried coconut oil before and love it but for those who haven&#x27;t, a few of my favorite uses will be below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so we can compare the two brands to see if the differences in composition and ratios of the fatty acids make it worth spending more for Palmtree&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>The coconut oil has a great aroma when it&#x27;s heated up, and it imparts a very subtle hint of coconut to whatever is fried in it.</li>
            <li>My only comment is that it would be great to have this available in other sizes - smaller tubs as a travel moisturizer, and bigger tubs to keep in the fridge for cooking if you think you are going to use a lot of it!</li>
            <li>The spreadable, easily meltable consistency and color of both products is darned near the same.</li>
            <li>I was also amazed at how quickly it arrived with just standard shipping.</li>
            <li>In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka &amp;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this CO for your CO needs.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>This one is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut</li>
            <li>It is extra white and creamy and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am also 6 months pregnant and have been using PalmTree Coconut Oil to avoid stretch marks and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>health conscious but not a fanatic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Healthwise, because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid, coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required.</li>
            <li>Miricle product, only the jar was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>By now I have developed the knowledge to differentiate the bad oils from the very good ones.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is 100% unrefined and cold pressed is super important as lots of other coconut oils are actually filled with junk!</li>
            <li>We were just about ready to change kibble to a different brand because my dog was not eating it with any enthusiasm.</li>
            <li>The use of coconut oil has many different benefits from using it, such as boast to your metabolism, bring down your cholesterol, and support your body inside and out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat content.</li>
            <li>particular coconut oil tastes and performs just as well as other high quality coconut oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li>You can totally tell this oil is 100% natural!</li>
            <li>what brand you buy as long as it meets the basic requirements to ensure it is pure, USDA Organic and has no additives.&lt;br</li>
            <li>#34;healthy fats&amp;#34;), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair everyday and put it on my entire body  fresh out of the shower morning and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth upgrading from the stuff I usually grab at the store.  </li>
            <li>I do really think coconut oil has also helped me to cut my insulin dosage in half.</li>
            <li>It helped my 3 year old child with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have used coconut oil in our cooking, and it works very well, although coconut oil is a little pricy compared to the olive oil and canola oil we regularly use.</li>

            <li> I love coconut oil because it has so many uses, not just cooking.</li>
            <li> this oil!&lt;br /&gt;the oil make food more delicious&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I put it on my hair, and my body.  </li>
            <li> I did not agree to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.ut oil has been very positive.</li>
            <li> have bought many different coconut oils, and not all have been so great.</li>
            <li> applies easily to your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is super versatile!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a coconut oil connoisseur nor a snob by any means, and I noticed a huge difference with the PalmTree Organic Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left our hair shiny, smooth, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I recently learned that coconut oil is great for doggies.  </li>
            <li> For the hair - I recommend using it 2 inches away from the scalp through the ends, it is great for shine and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I was provided with a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tastes fantastic-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s certified organic and GMO free.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> enjoy using it every day.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping thanks...</li>
            <li> if you have never used coconut oil you might be pleasantly surprised at how versatile and good it is.</li>
            <li> Palmtree coconut oil product is &amp;#34;extra virgin.&amp;#34; Since it hasn&#x27;t been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t like it, the company is very honest, they will give you the money back without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> very fresh oil&lt;</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to be sure whatever coconut oil you purchase is USDA Organic and pure, with no additives of any sort.</li>
            <li> and I really would love if they would carry it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only is this good for your body, but also for your pets, it will help with their hair and skin also.  </li>
            <li> I am a true believer in Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> Smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong smell that may not suit everyone, but we like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have one jar to cook with and the other for my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
            <li> My family and I go through this stuff so quickly - we use it for cooking, a great alternative to butter and other oils that can be harmful upon heating.</li>
            <li> the Taste is mild but I like the fact I am not using a petroleum product for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> : From my experience, pregnant women might find the smell repulsive.</li>
            <li> Good quality coconut oil is basically a commodity as far as I am concerned so it probably doesn&#x27;t make much difference</li>
            <li> Being a real fan of Palmtree Products&#x27; competitor, Viva Labs, and their organic extra virgin coconut oil, I was really curious to see how this brand of premium organic coconut oil compares to my favorite and was happy to be given the opportunity to review it in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong: the flavor of Palmtree&#x27;s OEVCO is superb, and I really do love it (hence the five stars).</li>
            <li> My sister is pregnant with twins</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Using while pregnant to moisturize my skin and help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> A really high quality coconut oil, and I am really fussy when it comes to this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> I have never purchase a more natural coconut oil ever!</li>
            <li> I loved the product, but the packaging to secure that this product arrived without spilling all over in the box was not, the cap was not placed on tight.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tested so many coconut oil products by now and this is BY FAR my favourite one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had a lot of success replacing butter and olive oil in some of my recipes.  </li>
            <li> , I received this specific coconut oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Licks it right off the spoon.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great raw too just on a teaspoon out of the tub or in smoothies, and even as a moisturiser on the skin.</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with coconut oil and this product was perfect, I use it on my elbow and heels also I have super curly hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Palmtree organic coconut oil has been very positive.</li>
            <li> Works great, but came with a large chunk missing.</li>
            <li> have to say that the quality of the Palmtree Products&#x27; OEVCO vs. Viva Labs&#x27; is very, very close.</li>
            <li> Premium coconut oil is exactly what it claims, it is Premium.  </li>
            <li> The melting temperature of unrefined coconut oil is about 76° F, so at most normal room temperatures, the oil has a soft creamy texture.</li>
            <li> i got exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a function of the fact that my huge Viva Labs jar is about a year old or what, but the Palmtree Products brand smelled fresher and a little more strongly of coconuts.</li>
            <li> I do believe  it is good for you because over a period of 6 months my cholesterol has come down to normal and my stomach fat is leaving my body!  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to my friends and family with total confidence that they&#x27;re getting top quality.</li>
            <li> many of which are much more fanatic about their health than I am.  </li>
            <li> Also I use it in smoothies and salads and for cooking certain foods.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impatiently waiting for more!  </li>
            <li> We were using a different brand first that he wouldn&#x27;t get as excited about.  </li>
            <li> (not put it in after, like stay-in conditioner), that&#x27;s when it really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please and have recommended it to my friends -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried coconut oil before and love it but for those who haven&#x27;t, a few of my favorite uses will be below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we can compare the two brands to see if the differences in composition and ratios of the fatty acids make it worth spending more for Palmtree&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil has a great aroma when it&#x27;s heated up, and it imparts a very subtle hint of coconut to whatever is fried in it.</li>
            <li> My only comment is that it would be great to have this available in other sizes - smaller tubs as a travel moisturizer, and bigger tubs to keep in the fridge for cooking if you think you are going to use a lot of it!</li>
            <li> The spreadable, easily meltable consistency and color of both products is darned near the same.</li>
            <li> I was also amazed at how quickly it arrived with just standard shipping.</li>
            <li> In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka &amp;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this CO for your CO needs.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This one is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut</li>
            <li> It is extra white and creamy and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am also 6 months pregnant and have been using PalmTree Coconut Oil to avoid stretch marks and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> health conscious but not a fanatic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Healthwise, because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid, coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required.</li>
            <li> Miricle product, only the jar was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> By now I have developed the knowledge to differentiate the bad oils from the very good ones.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is 100% unrefined and cold pressed is super important as lots of other coconut oils are actually filled with junk!</li>
            <li> We were just about ready to change kibble to a different brand because my dog was not eating it with any enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> The use of coconut oil has many different benefits from using it, such as boast to your metabolism, bring down your cholesterol, and support your body inside and out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat content.</li>
            <li> particular coconut oil tastes and performs just as well as other high quality coconut oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> You can totally tell this oil is 100% natural!</li>
            <li> what brand you buy as long as it meets the basic requirements to ensure it is pure, USDA Organic and has no additives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;healthy fats&amp;#34;), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair everyday and put it on my entire body  fresh out of the shower morning and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth upgrading from the stuff I usually grab at the store.  </li>
            <li> I do really think coconut oil has also helped me to cut my insulin dosage in half.</li>
            <li> It helped my 3 year old child with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have used coconut oil in our cooking, and it works very well, although coconut oil is a little pricy compared to the olive oil and canola oil we regularly use.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been taking a daily spoonful of coconut oil in the expectation that it may have positive health</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been taking a daily spoonful of coconut oil in the expectation that it may have positive health</li>
            <li> oil is very moisturizing to the skin, so if anyone has dry patches I would recommend massaging a little to that area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only a couple of days and my hair is shiny, scalp is flake-free, and my skin feels soft and is noticeably less dry.</li>
            <li> She is half way through her pregnancy and so far has no stretch marks and says her skin is softer than it has ever been</li>
            <li> A very considerate and health conscious company that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much healthier for your hair than hairspray or other similar products, when trying to tame frizz.</li>
            <li> Every day since getting the oil i&#x27;ve been given my little pup and tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected.</li>
            <li> container is a bit shorter and fatter than other jars I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve used it for other things</li>
            <li> This will make it easier to access the oil even when the container is half empty or lower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one he sees me pick up the jar and he jumps up and down like a madman.  </li>
            <li> :) I use it as a face wash and moisturizer, I will never go back to those evil chemical face washes again!</li>
            <li> Between the frigid air and the dry radiator heat my skin and hair get super dry.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit of time for me to get used to this property of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I am new to coconut oil and so far have been using it to cure my chapped lips and keep my cuticles moisturized during these brutal winter months.</li>
            <li> I use a combination of oat flour, egg, cinnamon and usually bananas.</li>
            <li> I prefer this as I find it hard to reach the bottom of the tall/skinny jars.  </li>
            <li> Subtle coconut smell.</li>
            <li> seriously...</li>
            <li> jar, however, is considerably less expensive than the Palmtree brand.</li>
            <li> For example the one I got from Whole Foods was one of the worst Organic Coconut Oils I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s out of stock</li>
            <li> For cold sores and canker sores I put about 1/4 tsp on it and let it melt.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product.  Subtle coconut smell. Greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I use for cooking to facial scrubs</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star quality product! This is the kind of CO you can use for everything. I used it on my Face, cooking and oil pulling. I was also amazed at how quickly it arrived with just standard shipping. I highly recommend this CO for your CO needs.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s the answer to all my moisturizing problems ever, hair, skin, nails, etc. It never leaves a too greasy feeling on my hands, and smells pleasant, but never strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: when using for hair - make sure you let it sit before you shower (not put it in after, like stay-in conditioner), that&#x27;s when it really works it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> Lovely coconut oil! I cook with coconut oil, eat it by the spoonful,  use it for oil pulling, and as my daily body moisturizer. This coconut oil has a delicious and fresh flavor and it is silky to the touch. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tested so many coconut oil products by now and this is BY FAR my favourite one.

A really high quality coconut oil, and I am really fussy when it comes to this kind of thing.  I&#x27;ve even used it for rubbing into my cat&#x27;s fur to keep his skin healthy and his coat glossy! I would absolutely recommend this product to my friends and family with total confidence that they&#x27;re getting top quality. My only comment is that it would be great to have this available in other sizes - smaller tubs as a travel moisturizer, and bigger tubs to keep in the fridge for cooking if you think you are going to use a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Works great, but came with a large chunk missing.</li>
            <li> Good to use as an oil for soap making!</li>
            <li> Premium coconut oil is exactly what it claims, it is Premium.  I have been looking all over for this product and I finally found what I have been looking for.  For those who need a multi purpose product such as this coconut oil it is a must buy.</li>
            <li> This is great coconut oil!  I recently learned that coconut oil is great for doggies.  Every day since getting the oil i&#x27;ve been given my little pup and tiny bit.  He LOVES it!  Licks it right off the spoon.  We were using a different brand first that he wouldn&#x27;t get as excited about.  I had to hide it in his food.  This one he sees me pick up the jar and he jumps up and down like a madman.  His fur is the softest its ever been, and his digestive track is in great shape.  I&#x27;ve also had a lot of success replacing butter and olive oil in some of my recipes.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this one from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping thanks...</li>
            <li> This product is super versatile! I just recieved it and have already used it to make shrimp curry and as a hair mask.  The fact that it is 100% unrefined and cold pressed is super important as lots of other coconut oils are actually filled with junk! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> best product on the market I use it on my face my body for cooking for facials just wonderful the best massage oil as well</li>
            <li> Strong coconut flavor! Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Once you turn to Coconut Oil, you will never turn back...seriously...its amazing...</li>
            <li> When I searched for &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34; on Amazon, I got more than 103,000 hits in products and books. It&#x27;s definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat content. Fast forward a few decades, and the tide has turned, with coconut oil being praised for its benefits, both internal and external.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Palmtree coconut oil product is &amp;#34;extra virgin.&amp;#34; Since it hasn&#x27;t been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose.

The coconut oil has a great aroma when it&#x27;s heated up, and it imparts a very subtle hint of coconut to whatever is fried in it. We&#x27;ve learned by trial and error that the best temperature for frying is around 340-350 degrees.

In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka &amp;#34;healthy fats&amp;#34;), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats. I&#x27;ve read about recent findings that indicate that daily consumption of coconut oil may boost brain performance and could even help to prevent Alzheimer&#x27;s. At my age, that would be a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Palmtree organic coconut oil has been very positive.

            <li> love this stuff - my husband likes it too!</li>
            <li> Great my dogs love it</li>
            <li> It is just a great product.  I have used it for cooking, on my face and body, and also for a personal Lubricant.  the Taste is mild but I like the fact I am not using a petroleum product for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I give this stuff a respectful 5 star . I have never purchase a more natural coconut oil ever! I highly recommend this product to everyone. You can totally tell this oil is 100% natural! I also enjoy the awesome fact that it goes on smooth and smells just like fresh cut coconuts. I use it on my hair everyday and put it on my entire body  fresh out of the shower morning and night. I would buy this oil again and again.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for masks for my face and hair. Also I use it in smoothies and salads and for cooking certain foods. And for baking. The Palmtree Products Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is from excellent quality. By now I have developed the knowledge to differentiate the bad oils from the very good ones. This one is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is very moisturizing to the skin, so if anyone has dry patches I would recommend massaging a little to that area. For the hair - I recommend using it 2 inches away from the scalp through the ends, it is great for shine and deep conditioning. If you have calluses, massage the oil on the bottom of your feet, put some socks on and they will soften up after a week of using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many different coconut oils, and not all have been so great. For example the one I got from Whole Foods was one of the worst Organic Coconut Oils I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and if you don&#x27;t like it, the company is very honest, they will give you the money back without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received this specific coconut oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

            <li> nice item, nice seller</li>
            <li> very good !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seller feedback, thank you !</li>
            <li> Reviewed by wife: The oil is great for all kinds of things. I use it for cooking, skin, and hair. It is also great in homemade deodorant! It has a pretty strong smell that may not suit everyone, but we like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: From my experience, pregnant women might find the smell repulsive.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this coconut oil! I use for everything, hair, cooking, skin, etc.  It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
            <li> great quality, but there is some packing problem that is leaking during delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected.</li>
            <li> i got exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> So awesome I was very pleased with quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a coconut oil connoisseur nor a snob by any means, and I noticed a huge difference with the PalmTree Organic Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids love it too.  They haven&#x27;t asked for seconds in years and have been since I started cooking with PalmTree Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m health conscious but not a fanatic.  It&#x27;s worth upgrading from the stuff I usually grab at the store.  I&#x27;m very please and have recommended it to my friends - many of which are much more fanatic about their health than I am.  They&#x27;ve given it the thumbs up when they&#x27;ve come over for dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on my hair too!</li>
            <li> This is a review of Palmtree Products, Organic Coconut Oil. I was provided with a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil for many purposes around my house. I will use it for cooking, I have used it as a lip moisturizer, I will sometimes add it to smoothies and I also read that it can be beneficial to dogs and have been adding a couple tablespoons to my dog&#x27;s food. I might mention that my dog LOVES this on her food. We were just about ready to change kibble to a different brand because my dog was not eating it with any enthusiasm. But since adding the coconut oil, she gobbles it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular coconut oil tastes and performs just as well as other high quality coconut oils I have purchased. I think it&#x27;s important to be sure whatever coconut oil you purchase is USDA Organic and pure, with no additives of any sort. This meets all those requirements I have. Good quality coconut oil is basically a commodity as far as I am concerned so it probably doesn&#x27;t make much difference what brand you buy as long as it meets the basic requirements to ensure it is pure, USDA Organic and has no additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is quite nice and if you have never used coconut oil you might be pleasantly surprised at how versatile and good it is. You do need to know that it is not always in a liquid state. Below about 70 degrees it becomes white and solidifies. From about 72-75 it is a cloudy liquid and at 75 and over it becomes liquid. Took a little bit of time for me to get used to this property of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Edited to add:  I have been using this on my skin and love love love it.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s out of stock and I&#x27;m impatiently waiting for more!  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you all of the uses I&#x27;ve found for this and I really would love if they would carry it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to do things to help my family get healthy.  I found the perfect oil for cooking and baking all the way to using it on your pets for or on your body.  With Palm Tree Extra Virgin Coconut Oil it is the perfect oil to either using in your smoothies, sauteing meats, or putting in your baking.  This Coconut oil does have a coconut taste so if you are cooking with it or using it for eating the coconut flavor will come through.  The use of coconut oil has many different benefits from using it, such as boast to your metabolism, bring down your cholesterol, and support your body inside and out.  Not only is this good for your body, but also for your pets, it will help with their hair and skin also.  I like the effect that it has given to my body and how it makes me feel better inside and out the more that I use it. I received this product for the purpose of my unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product is a god send in NYC during winter. Between the frigid air and the dry radiator heat my skin and hair get super dry. I&#x27;ve been using this only a couple of days and my hair is shiny, scalp is flake-free, and my skin feels soft and is noticeably less dry. I love that it is organic too! Definitely a great product and a great price too. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Being a real fan of Palmtree Products&#x27; competitor, Viva Labs, and their organic extra virgin coconut oil, I was really curious to see how this brand of premium organic coconut oil compares to my favorite and was happy to be given the opportunity to review it in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the quality of the Palmtree Products&#x27; OEVCO vs. Viva Labs&#x27; is very, very close. This coconut oil is definitely premium-quality, and it smells wonderfully of coconuts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a function of the fact that my huge Viva Labs jar is about a year old or what, but the Palmtree Products brand smelled fresher and a little more strongly of coconuts. The spreadable, easily meltable consistency and color of both products is darned near the same. Viva Labs&#x27; equivalent 16-oz. jar, however, is considerably less expensive than the Palmtree brand. For about the same price, I can get 54 oz. of the Viva Labs OEVCO. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: the flavor of Palmtree&#x27;s OEVCO is superb, and I really do love it (hence the five stars). But if they want to compete, they are going to have to put up an ingredients list so we can compare the two brands to see if the differences in composition and ratios of the fatty acids make it worth spending more for Palmtree&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in Coconut Oil. My sister is pregnant with twins so I sent her this and she has been using it on her belly after every shower. She is half way through her pregnancy and so far has no stretch marks and says her skin is softer than it has ever been :) I use it as a face wash and moisturizer, I will never go back to those evil chemical face washes again! This gets the job done perfectly and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I like the sell of coconut!  I love the flavor it gives my baked goods!  I even use this on my neck and face before I go to sleep at night.  I do believe  it is good for you because over a period of 6 months my cholesterol has come down to normal and my stomach fat is leaving my body!  I do really think coconut oil has also helped me to cut my insulin dosage in half.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I am new to coconut oil and so far have been using it to cure my chapped lips and keep my cuticles moisturized during these brutal winter months. Can&#x27;t wait to try it in my cooking! Would definitely recommend....</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly.  The product is great!  Smooth and fresh.  It tastes fantastic- I have used it for cooking.  I am also 6 months pregnant and have been using PalmTree Coconut Oil to avoid stretch marks and dry skin.  It does a great job keeping my skin hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is a bit shorter and fatter than other jars I have bought.  I prefer this as I find it hard to reach the bottom of the tall/skinny jars.  This will make it easier to access the oil even when the container is half empty or lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certified organic and GMO free.  Totally love this product and will order again when I run out.  Which may not be for a while- there&#x27;s plenty in the container!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried coconut oil before and love it but for those who haven&#x27;t, a few of my favorite uses will be below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eggs cooked in coconut oil are so much better than cooked in butter. I don&#x27;t even know how to explain it but that&#x27;s my number one use. I also use it to make mug cakes in the microwave. I start by putting about a tablespoon in the mug and heat in the microwave for :15-:20. Roll the oil around the edges to coat the sides and pour excess into a separate bowl with your ingredients. I use a combination of oat flour, egg, cinnamon and usually bananas. I&#x27;ve also used this for dandruff, but switched to fractions coconut oil. Also for any kind of cuts or sores in the mouth, I use coconut oil. For cold sores and canker sores I put about 1/4 tsp on it and let it melt. You don&#x27;t have to spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge for my honest review. I love coconut oil because it has so many uses, not just cooking. I know I&#x27;ve used it for other things but none that I can think of at the moment. I&#x27;ll update if I remember.</li>
            <li> very fresh oil&lt;br /&gt;when you make pasta, curry, use this oil!&lt;br /&gt;the oil make food more delicious&lt;br /&gt;and well-sealed package!&lt;br /&gt;so don&#x27;t worry about the leaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank YOU!</li>

            <li> Love, love, love this.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love it, I put it on my hair, and my body.  It helped my 3 year old child with dry skin.  And my hair its looking better after a hairstylist fry it!</li>
            <li> A very considerate and health conscious company that stands behind their products. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I loved the product, but the packaging to secure that this product arrived without spilling all over in the box was not, the cap was not placed on tight.</li>
            <li> Miricle product, only the jar was only 3/4 full. Expect the same as with a potato chip bag.</li>
            <li> This Coconut Oil is very smooth and light.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using it every day. I have one jar to cook with and the other for my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
            <li> Using while pregnant to moisturize my skin and help prevent stretch marks. 7 months and still no stretch marks!!!&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great and mealt/applies easily to your skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with coconut oil and this product was perfect, I use it on my elbow and heels also I have super curly hair and I use it for that also, this is an all purpose beauty fix</li>
            <li> it is nice! it is what I want and look for</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s and on my hair. It left our hair shiny, smooth, and it smells great. It&#x27;s so much healthier for your hair than hairspray or other similar products, when trying to tame frizz. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really good product...</li>
