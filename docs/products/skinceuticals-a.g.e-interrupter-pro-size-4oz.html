    <ol>
            <li>This is the very best product I have found to moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li>this product does an excellent job of keeping my skin hydrated, it also makes it a breeze to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product ever!</li>
            <li>The Skin Ceuticals line is an excellent line of product, just overpriced.</li>
            <li>This product works great!  </li>
            <li>The 4 ounce size perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent product feels good and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product with very nice texture.</li>
            <li>product and this is a good vendor.</li>
            <li>The BEST product available over the counter.</li>
            <li>If you have never used before you would want to see a Dermatologist and try out and get the ones for you, they are very potent and with Skin Ceuticals you don&#x27;t need alot of products, just cleanse,repair, moisturize and protect.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, in great, authentic condition.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who is in their 30- and beyond this is a miracle product and will keep your skin in beautiful smooth condition, but ALWAYS wear sunscreen 365 days a year</li>
            <li>but after I learned about the products and had been using for a while I started shopping around on the internet and by far Amazon has the best prices and I can quarantee that the quality is authinic.  </li>
            <li>After using so many products, I can honestly say, I will stay with Skinceuticals, per my Dermatologist recommendations.  </li>
            <li>Well, when you spend two beans...what&#x27;s not to love???</li>
            <li>But the best facial cream that I&#x27;ve used - and I&#x27;ve used plenty.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use better than glass jar.</li>
            <li>I was just very pleased to be able to now get it in the professional size .</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin feel like velvet so smooth .</li>
            <li>and I know the prices and have purchased full price from the spas and doctors offices</li>
            <li>I wish it were priced more reasonably.</li>
            <li>My wife thinks this is the golden cream.</li>
            <li>A.G.E. Interruptor is pricey, but worth every penny...</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this outstanding product for several years but could not buy it in a tube and in 4ozs.</li>
            <li>Love having the pro larger size of SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering it!</li>
            <li>I just love it and the vendor shipped quickly and it was just as expected, This is a must but</li>
            <li>I find it works very well for a daytime moisturizer, but also at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the whole line of their products in my routine.  </li>
            <li>People are always telling me they can&#x27;t believe my real age.</li>
            <li>I prefer Prime because it is procted by Amazon and when you spend this much on skincare you want a product that is real and not years old.  </li>
            <li>I always look at the packaging because somethimes I do see an older product and buy from another seller on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>live without it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my 62 year old skin!</li>
            <li>I have dry, (sometimes sensitive)</li>

            <li> My wife thinks this is the golden cream. She loves what it does for face, and well I do too!</li>
            <li> This is the very best product I have found to moisturize my face.  I used to have to use a prescription, no more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals for a very long time... I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but ultimately come back to this line. A.G.E. Interruptor is pricey, but worth every penny... it&#x27;s emollient, but not greasy and a little goes a long way. I have dry, (sometimes sensitive) skin and this product does an excellent job of keeping my skin hydrated, it also makes it a breeze to apply foundation. My skin is so dry (sounds like an opening line to a joke), that I will mix it with aquaphor. I find it works very well for a daytime moisturizer, but also at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this outstanding product for several years but could not buy it in a tube and in 4ozs. size.I will order it again!</li>
            <li> My go to skin care for years and I know the prices and have purchased full price from the spas and doctors offices but after I learned about the products and had been using for a while I started shopping around on the internet and by far Amazon has the best prices and I can quarantee that the quality is authinic.

            <li> I use daily and it seems to be helping moisturize my aging skin.</li>
            <li> Love having the pro larger size of SkinCeuticals! Thanks for offering it! Product arrived on time, in great, authentic condition.  Wonderful! Recommend seller!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product ever! I just love it and the vendor shipped quickly and it was just as expected, This is a must but product and this is a good vendor. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Well, when you spend two beans...what&#x27;s not to love???</li>

            <li> Wonderful product with very nice texture. It lasts a long time because you only need a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for a few years now and really like it . It also makes your skin feel like velvet so smooth . I was just very pleased to be able to now get it in the professional size . I have not used this one yet I am still using the one I already had . The smaller size comes in a glass jar I am anxious to use the tube I think it will be easier to dispense . With the jar you get a small scoop .</li>
            <li> Pricey, yes.  But the best facial cream that I&#x27;ve used - and I&#x27;ve used plenty.  Leaves your skin looking younder, but is not oily and greasy.  Well worth the price.  People are always telling me they can&#x27;t believe my real age.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my 62 year old skin!</li>
            <li> After using so many products, I can honestly say, I will stay with Skinceuticals, per my Dermatologist recommendations.  The BEST product available over the counter.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, but love the product. How don&#x27;t see how a product could go up $20 in 1 month time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product feels good and smells wonderful. I like all the skin eutical products. The 4 ounce size perfect. Easy to use better than glass jar.</li>
