            <li> However, this comes in a small jar rather than the normal size candles</li>
            <li> I burn this scent all Christmas long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a classic bayberry-scented candle,</li>
            <li> i wish they made this scent for year round use!..apparently its only for the holidays...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the smaller candle for the same (or close to same) cost as the normal candles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please consider listing all ingredients if scents other than pine are included.  </li>
            <li> I only have one complaint...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I dislike the smell of cloves, which was unpleasant and ruined the fresh pine</li>
            <li> No more black soot in the air.</li>
            <li> not much smell, wire centered wick, not great for your home</li>
            <li> This brand is the closest you can come to actual pine smell without it smelling fake.</li>
            <li> And very expensive for such a small candle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get any of that nasty black smoke and the candles last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> My Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Soy Candle arrived with 2 out of the 3 candles broken.  </li>
            <li> The thin cardboard covering of the candle did not protect the glass that the candle was molded in.  </li>
            <li> I had broken glass all over the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> prefer soy candles, which  burn cleaner, but I was very disappointed and after lighting could not return.</li>

            <li> I just love these candles. The scent smells clean and they really do get rid of odors. My only wish is that they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> not much smell, wire centered wick, not great for your home</li>
            <li> This is the cleanest most refreshingly Christmasy smell ever - I almost don&#x27;t need my live tree - well, that going too far but it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This Christmas I could not have a tree so I lit this, and it smelled like there was one in the room with us!</li>
            <li> I love pine scents even though it may not be the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I dislike the smell of cloves, which was unpleasant and ruined the fresh pine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider listing all ingredients if scents other than pine are included.

            <li> This is a wonderful fresh and clean scent. It reminds me of growing up in the adirondack mountains. I love this product. I was looking for something that was naturally scented. Mrs. Meyers cleaning product line has really nicely scented products as well, so if you like the candle, check out the cleaning product line.</li>
            <li> Great smell, burns clean!</li>
            <li> Smelled like a insect repelling candle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent!  Keep the holidays around a little longer with the smell of a fresh Christmas tree, not strong, but a light scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and its made with soy. No more black soot in the air. I will definitely buy this candle again</li>
            <li> makes my room smell like a forest but it&#x27;s peaceful not too overwhelming. one of my favorites and I burn it sparingly</li>
            <li> This is the best scent currently available for the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s soy candles. I only have one complaint...why can&#x27;t they be bigger!?</li>
            <li> Christmas in a can. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love all the Mrs Meyers items and the &amp;#34;Iowa Pine&amp;#34; is lovely.  However, this comes in a small jar rather than the normal size candles and I didn&#x27;t realize it.  I was disappointed by the smaller candle for the same (or close to same) cost as the normal candles.  Smells great though.</li>

I had broken glass all over the inside of the box. The candles were replaced and the second shipment came &#x27;very well&#x27; packaged.  The candles themselves did not fragrance the house the way I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing!!!!!  I am a huge fan of Mrs. Meyers candle because they burn and smell so clean and fresh.  You don&#x27;t get any of that nasty black smoke and the candles last quite a while.  This pine scent is heaven to me!  It really does smell like a wonderful Christmas tree.  I burn this scent all Christmas long!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of a real Christmas Tree you will love this candle.  Purchased it once at Target, but do not see it anymore except online.</li>
            <li> This brand is the closest you can come to actual pine smell without it smelling fake.</li>
