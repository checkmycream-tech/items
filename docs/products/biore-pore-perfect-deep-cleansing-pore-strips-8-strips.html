            <li>, what can you say it works and is good</li>
            <li>Works just like it says , I love it!</li>
            <li>it was pretty awesome</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very very effective.</li>
            <li>Does was it says, do do do do more words.</li>
            <li>It is also virtually painless. :)</li>
            <li>They are not holding for more than 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>Though I had to use many strips</li>
            <li>This hurt and didn&#x27;t even pull many blackheads out.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your blackheads, this is the best blackhead removing  product I have ever found, I really do recommend it to anyone who wants to free themselves from blackheads.</li>
            <li>, they were easy to apply and remove and didn&#x27;t break me out or anything.</li>
            <li>They work amazing and the service of getting the product to me was fast and efficient!</li>
            <li>I chose it for the popularity of the brand and for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>I followed their insturctions and watched their video to makes sure I was doing it right - doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad everyone is having success with it, so it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Other than this, the first time use is always the best, but I&#x27;d advise waiting a while before using another one.</li>
            <li>But they are worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I was excited to clean my nose pore, but it did nothing.</li>
            <li>I thought if I use the strip, it might help clean the pores and prevent acne.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>I actually really like this product!!</li>
            <li>I think we both really get about the same results because he&#x27;s able to use these more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets some stuff out - and of course, it&#x27;s yucky fun to look at it -</li>
            <li>Its a great product, it really does help with getting rid of blackheads, alot quicker than other products.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get everything right away and was expect more of a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 8 strips ,not clean so well.</li>
            <li>(I was more concerned with my constant breakouts).</li>
            <li>i try these strips on my butt and it really took out the pores, now i can go to the beach without covering my butt, swag!</li>
            <li>I can see my nose clean and clear.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get literally everything from your pores but they do a good enough job getting those tiny blackheads you didn&#x27;t even know were there.</li>
            <li>So I bought these just to get rid of some pesky blackheads, and they&#x27;ve largely done the job.</li>
            <li>Tried the rite aid store brand first as I was waiting for these to show up in the mail, it&#x27;s about the same as far as quality but these ones have more &amp;#34;contours&amp;#34; and are a bit longer.</li>
            <li>It also felt very soothing and I liked the feel of doing a little treatment on myself</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and after I took it off, I didnt really see anything on the strip.</li>
            <li>So I guess this is really for people with blackheads, not me.</li>
            <li>These dont really work that well.</li>
            <li>but they really dont do anything for me at all.</li>
            <li>These strips work very well</li>
            <li>Following all directions two times, and trying variants two more, this product didn&#x27;t clean out a single pore from my nose.</li>
            <li>its not tht good as a expected because when i first used it, all my black pore didnt go away</li>
            <li>I thought that my skin was pretty clean, but even after my facial last week I still had so much junk in those pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleased with this product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought these for fun because I haven&#x27;t used them since middle school.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t hurt, I suppose, but not a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Biore strips for years and recommended these for my son; I use the Ultra version and those tend to be a little too strong for him.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have rather sensitive skin, so this is a product that I use pretty infrequently.</li>
            <li>and so far this has been the bast solution.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m not sure what, but it will make whatever acne I have on my nose become more red and irratated.</li>
            <li>Just kind of got the surface and very little black heads</li>
            <li>Not only does it work it makes your nose silky soft too!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t lie, they are pretty neat little face stickers.</li>
            <li>It got nearly every single blackhead in just one strip (I didn&#x27;t had a lotta water on my nose, and it still worked).</li>
            <li>These are perfect for getting those nasty black heads out, if you have a large enough nose...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years sporadically - Its normally when my horrible oily skin gets clogged up in the nasal area. Personally, I have rather sensitive skin, so this is a product that I use pretty infrequently. The reason is that I can use this product and it works unbelievable the first time (you can see all the crap it pulls out of your pores on the sticky when you take it off). What I have noticed though is that if you use it again too often (within a couple weeks), my skin (might just be me) will tend to get irratated from either the adhesive or I&#x27;m not sure what, but it will make whatever acne I have on my nose become more red and irratated. Other than this, the first time use is always the best, but I&#x27;d advise waiting a while before using another one. Either way, only a couple strips will last you a while. good luck!</li>
            <li> Tried the rite aid store brand first as I was waiting for these to show up in the mail, it&#x27;s about the same as far as quality but these ones have more &amp;#34;contours&amp;#34; and are a bit longer. They don&#x27;t get literally everything from your pores but they do a good enough job getting those tiny blackheads you didn&#x27;t even know were there. Of course we know why everyone buys these, they want to see what comes out of their pores. Won&#x27;t lie, they are pretty neat little face stickers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biore strips for years and recommended these for my son; I use the Ultra version and those tend to be a little too strong for him. We both can see a big difference in his pores when he uses these. I think we both really get about the same results because he&#x27;s able to use these more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with this product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for getting those nasty black heads out, if you have a large enough nose... my nose is smaller than average and i had some difficulty applying the adhesive. But other than that, this product is amazingly easy to use and there is no way you can mess up (unless you have a small nose).</li>
            <li> These hurt your pores. Would not recommend for butt cheeks anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the amount of, well, for lack of a better phrase, gunk Biore cleaned out of my nose pores.  I&#x27;m going to go check out the other Biore products now.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product. Does was it says, do do do do more words. It will clean your nasty nose up.</li>
            <li> So I bought these just to get rid of some pesky blackheads, and they&#x27;ve largely done the job. Its a great product, it really does help with getting rid of blackheads, alot quicker than other products. Although it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your blackheads, this is the best blackhead removing  product I have ever found, I really do recommend it to anyone who wants to free themselves from blackheads.</li>
            <li> The strips work as described, although the actual benefit in the long term is unknown.  A dollar per strip is painful.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast! Got it like a week before expected shipping date. Works just like it says , I love it!</li>
            <li> I followed their insturctions and watched their video to makes sure I was doing it right - doesn&#x27;t work. Either removes my skin - but not blackheads! - or leaves behind sticky glue all over my nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have blackheads but my skin is acne prone so I decided to try this out. I thought if I use the strip, it might help clean the pores and prevent acne. I followed the instructions and after I took it off, I didnt really see anything on the strip. So I guess this is really for people with blackheads, not me.</li>
            <li> I had never tried these pore strips and couldn&#x27;t find them at my local grocery store. So I found this store and bought them online to test them out. They work amazing and the service of getting the product to me was fast and efficient! A great shopping experience!</li>
            <li> For some reason, these strips only grab the dirt and remove it from the pores at the sides of my nose (where my nose meets my face). I follow the directions exactly every time; not sure why. Not sure I would re-order this item.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product!! Not only does it work it makes your nose silky soft too!</li>
            <li> Just remember to use it only 3 or 4 days.  Otherwise you start to lose skin.  I&#x27;ve always had blackhead problems in my nose and so far this has been the bast solution.</li>
            <li> I have always used biore. It is the best thing out there for blackheads. It is also virtually painless. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried a nose strip before, I&#x27;ve had small, but very deep blackheads for years (I was more concerned with my constant breakouts). These things are AMAZING!! It got nearly every single blackhead in just one strip (I didn&#x27;t had a lotta water on my nose, and it still worked). Now my nose is sooo clear, soo soft, and as nasty as that strip was after I took it off it was pretty awesome lol</li>
            <li> work just exspensive, what can you say it works and is good, work just exspensive, what can you say it works and is good</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved them! Came in a timely fashion as well</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very very effective. I chose it for the popularity of the brand and for the cheap price. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> The strips are not working. They are not holding for more than 3 seconds. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These strips literally pull the gunk out of your pores. Only down side is the cost, but definitely worth it if you have a little extra money in your beauty budget</li>
            <li> I exfoliate often, so I don&#x27;t have anything for the strip to latch on to. In return it removed no sebum plugs when I peeled it off. I was disappoint, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad experience. It also felt very soothing and I liked the feel of doing a little treatment on myself lol. I will just stick to the oil cleansing method, to remove everything deep inside of my pores. I&#x27;m glad everyone is having success with it, so it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Its really awesome...I can see my nose clean and clear. Though I had to use many strips but I can ho for it.</li>
            <li> i try these strips on my butt and it really took out the pores, now i can go to the beach without covering my butt, swag!</li>
            <li> Following all directions two times, and trying variants two more, this product didn&#x27;t clean out a single pore from my nose. From what I&#x27;ve read they had to change the formula (As it used to be much stronger) because dumb people would ignore the instructions and leave it on so long it would hurt their skin.</li>
            <li> Never used any product like this before. I am shocked to see how much blackhead was pulled out. I hope it will not make my pore bigger.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get everything right away and was expect more of a deep clean. Just kind of got the surface and very little black heads but it still works.</li>
            <li> its not tht good as a expected because when i first used it, all my black pore didnt go away n there was still alot so only takes away a few pores.</li>
            <li> These dont really work that well. maybe its just my skin or something but they really dont do anything for me at all. i wouldnt recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> These things did not seem to work for me. All it seemed to do was make my nose really red. But they are worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this. I was excited to clean my nose pore, but it did nothing. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 8 strips ,not clean so well. a a a a a a .</li>
            <li> All I can say is OUCH. This hurt and didn&#x27;t even pull many blackheads out. I used one strip and threw the rest out!</li>
            <li> I bought these for fun because I haven&#x27;t used them since middle school. They still work just about the same. It gets some stuff out - and of course, it&#x27;s yucky fun to look at it - but it doesn&#x27;t get everything. Can&#x27;t hurt, I suppose, but not a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I used one of these last night and was appalled at what it pulled out of my pores! I thought that my skin was pretty clean, but even after my facial last week I still had so much junk in those pores. These strips work very well, they were easy to apply and remove and didn&#x27;t break me out or anything. Great product!</li>
