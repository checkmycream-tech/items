            <li>This perfume is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>flowery, but still light scent...</li>
            <li>Great service with personalized message and prompt service was what I really appreciated, but in terms of the product itself, it wasn&#x27;t really my taste in perfumes..</li>
            <li>TRUE to it&#x27;s scent, the realest PLUMERIA scent to date.</li>
            <li>I was so hoping I could find a perfume that was true to their fragrance and</li>
            <li>I think my mother will enjoy it because it smells like a fragrance for a more mature women..</li>
            <li>I love the smell of plumerias on my wife, unfortunately so many &amp;#34;plumeria&amp;#34; fragrances don&#x27;t actually smell like the flower.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to those who like authentic plumeria scents!</li>
            <li>Packaged well and the personal note that came with it was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It definitely lasts a long time and has the beautiful plumeria smell.</li>
            <li>so you do not need very much.</li>

            <li>My late wife loved this.</li>
            <li>It comes as a \\&quot;roll on\\&quot; instead of a spray which is more convienient for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>Normally with any perfume you will find someone that doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It resembles more the scent of some very inexpensive hair oils sold in the past decades.  </li>
            <li>Beings I live on the east coast of the mainland....</li>
            <li>this is exact same, the plumeria orchid...</li>

            <li> I purchased this oil and it doesn&#x27;t go with my own PH. I think my mother will enjoy it because it smells like a fragrance for a more mature women..</li>

            <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite! It comes as a \\&quot;roll on\\&quot; instead of a spray which is more convienient for a few reasons. 1) the perfume lasts longer than any other purfume I have had (except the BIG bottle) 2) Is a strong plumeria smell so you do not need very much. Normally with any perfume you will find someone that doesn&#x27;t like it. With this perfume, everyone wanted to know where I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at a hospital and cannot wear overwhelming fragrences. This perfume has been accepted by the hospital (I do not have direct patient care) as an acceptable perfume to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever been to Hawaii and smelled plumeria, when you smell this perfume it will take you back.</li>
            <li> Smells like very nice (and strong!) floral perfume, but nothing like the plumeria outside the condo where I stayed in Kihei, HI.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a very dear friend. She was thrilled and so was I with how happy she was to get it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery. Packaged well and the personal note that came with it was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  It smells heavenly! It arrived safely and quickly!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> TRUE to it&#x27;s scent, the realest PLUMERIA scent to date. Will last about 1-2 hours, then you need to reapply</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> It smells really good.  I like the roll on application.  Very easy to appy and won&#x27;t spill.  Bottle is not as pictured.  There are no flowers on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This barely resembles Plumeria.  It resembles more the scent of some very inexpensive hair oils sold in the past decades.  This item is NOT returnable.  This is the second time I have lost money in my quest for Plumeria fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered this perfume.  It smells so good and it last all day!  I am so pleased with.  I&#x27;ve been to Hawaii twice and just love the Plumeria flower! I was so hoping I could find a perfume that was true to their fragrance and this is it!!! I will definitely order this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Smells like a bar of soap... and, NOT plumeria scented soap. More like Dove... Darn.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and easy application!</li>
            <li> Great service with personalized message and prompt service was what I really appreciated, but in terms of the product itself, it wasn&#x27;t really my taste in perfumes.. It definitely lasts a long time and has the beautiful plumeria smell. I definitely recommend it to those who like authentic plumeria scents!</li>
            <li> It was sent in a timely manner with a lovely personal note.  It&#x27;s smells like the Orchard I remember on Kauai.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the smell of Plumerias.</li>
            <li> A wonderful bit of Hawaii.  A unique, captivating scent.  I adore it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance. ..doesn&#x27;t last on me though</li>
            <li> Felt like I was back in Hawaii with the lei around my neck-really captures the essence!! Truly recommend buying this perfume if you love the smell of Plumeria flowers</li>
            <li> Beings I live on the east coast of the mainland....it&#x27;s a LONG way to the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;br /&gt;But anytime I use Island Body Plumeria Perfume...I&#x27;m back on the Islands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having goosebumps right now, because this perfume smells absolutely wonderful. As much as I like Hawaii and Plumeria, I can&#x27;t wait to wear this tomorrow out and around. This perfume smells of delight and happiness! The only thing is that when I purchased it, I didn&#x27;t realized it was a really small bottle until I received it.</li>
            <li> A really stone perfume, just a little goes a long way.  My late wife loved this.</li>
            <li> first bought this while in Hawaii and SO excited to find it again...rationed the original purchase bc smells delightful..this is exact same, the plumeria orchid...LOVELY.. flowery, but still light scent... a must for flower lovers</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance it spot on.  Smells just like the plumeria flower.&lt;br /&gt;Will do business again.</li>
