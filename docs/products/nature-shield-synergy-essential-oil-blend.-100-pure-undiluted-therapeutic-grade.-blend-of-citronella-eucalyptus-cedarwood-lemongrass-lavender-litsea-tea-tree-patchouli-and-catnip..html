            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>For some reason Mosquitos love me...</li>
            <li>so I gave this a shot and glad it did.</li>
            <li>WAY better than the stuff with DEET</li>
            <li>nothing :)))</li>
            <li>Just to be safe in terms of making sure it works I put 20 drops into 2.5 Ounce spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be scared to add more drops....</li>
            <li>Mosquitos love it</li>
            <li>and I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>, cats seem to love the stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it very promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It has a strong lemony scent.</li>
            <li>Bought this product...smells great and it actually works.  </li>
            <li>This product offers me just that, no harsh chemicals, a great smell, and it works!</li>
            <li>This product has an excellent combination of essential oils, many of which I use individually.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all who are responsible for good service.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and this is natural!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and SAFE!</li>
            <li>and although I do have to apply it in the morning and also in the evening to get full effect</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say.  </li>
            <li>, it works for me 90% success rate ...</li>
            <li>Most stand quietly for this spray compared to scooting for toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I would much rather do this than walk around fearing the bugs or poisoning myself with deet!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you cover yourself entirely with the mixture though, otherwise the mosquito will get itself in and bite you.  </li>
            <li>There are many less bites on them, they&#x27;re coming in clean from turnout as opposed to rolling in mud to escape the bites.</li>
            <li>although there are people saying that it didn&#x27;t work for them, I bet it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t make it strong enough.</li>
            <li>i have extremely sensitive skin and allergic pretty much to anything....</li>
            <li>I mixed alcohol and witch hazel with a few drops of this and my walk in the dog park is pleasant again.</li>
            <li>My daughter is highly allergic to mosquito bites, and of course they find her every time.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s worked very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;people compliment on my new perfume lololol...</li>
            <li>it keeps that fresh lemon smell, not harsh if mixed with my coconut oil....</li>
            <li>and i put pure oil extra on my exposed skin...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i founded feeling like burning my skin if put directly</li>
            <li>Took it to a wedding near a woodsy lake and it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Not a single bite but the pesky mosquitoes went through my clothes to take a bite in areas that were not lathered with Bug Off.</li>

            <li> you have a great bug repellent!</li>
            <li> but it is gone now few weeks later...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> bit at least 3 times every time I go outside</li>
            <li> went down to 20 percent, i still get bites...</li>
            <li> Mix a little of this with with witch-hazel and spray it on my dogs and myself before going out for runs in the woods.  </li>

            <li> Bought this product...smells great and it actually works.  For some reason Mosquitos love me...in a crowed I&#x27;ll be the only one that gets bit.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell of Off, etc so I gave this a shot and glad it did.</li>
            <li> I am a mosquito magnet living in Northern Virginia where we seem to have a bit of a mosquito issue!  This stuff works!  I dilute it in witch hazel and spray myself with it when ever I am outside.  WAY better than the stuff with DEET (that stuff eats off the nail polish...cant be good for my skin!!!)  I will buy this stuff by the gallon!</li>
            <li> I used this with coconut oil as a bug repellant and it works great! All it takes is a few drops of the mixture and the mosquitoes are gone for good!</li>
            <li> I use in on myself and my horses. I use water instead of alcohol and spray the horses, their stalls and bedding (without hay on it). There are many less bites on them, they&#x27;re coming in clean from turnout as opposed to rolling in mud to escape the bites. Most stand quietly for this spray compared to scooting for toxic chemicals. It&#x27;s also really nice on their coats. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bug Off Synergy works well with diluted in witch hazel and water (proportions can be researched online).  Re-application is needed every few hours but I prefer this to chemical repellants.</li>
            <li> i just broke whole bottle today :((( as it is glass and i carry it anywhere...oh well...otherwise it will last me for 5 months i guess...&lt;br /&gt;i put some in my coconut organic oil as my body lotion after shower each time...&lt;br /&gt;bites from mosquitoes  went down to 20 percent, i still get bites...and i put pure oil extra on my exposed skin...especially feet and shoulders... just keep in mind i would get bitten always and everywhere...even with deet sprays so this product is great, it works for me 90% success rate ...happy days&lt;br /&gt;people compliment on my new perfume lololol...it keeps that fresh lemon smell, not harsh if mixed with my coconut oil....&lt;br /&gt;i founded feeling like burning my skin if put directly but it is gone now few weeks later...i have extremely sensitive skin and allergic pretty much to anything....therefore so happy i can use this and no rushes...nothing :)))&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery, great company</li>
            <li> This WORKS! It WORKS! It&#x27;s natural and SAFE! I usually get bit at least 3 times every time I go outside so I put this to the test. Just to be safe in terms of making sure it works I put 20 drops into 2.5 Ounce spray bottle. After spraying it all over me I went outside to work on the garden for about an hour in shorts and a t-shirt! I was amazed....zero bites....none...So if you&#x27;re on the fence about ordering this, don&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, although there are people saying that it didn&#x27;t work for them, I bet it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t make it strong enough. Don&#x27;t be scared to add more drops....It smells amazing and this is natural! No chemicals here so no need to worry!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Add to witch hazel &amp; you have a great bug repellent! I mix it with my homemade sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> Package arrive in tack and on time.  Mixed with a carrier oil and found bugs don&#x27;t like this blend.  They will still fly around, but won&#x27;t land on you.  It smells better than bug repellent too.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this as part of a &amp;#34;wearer-friendly&amp;#34; bug repellant. Just hate the synthetic ones that smell like plastic!  This one works great, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I currently live in Nicaragua and as someone who has always been the first in a crowd to be eaten alive by bugs, I was desperate to not have to use anything with harsh chemicals on my skin daily (which unfortunately is a necessary evil for me here!). This product offers me just that, no harsh chemicals, a great smell, and it works! I mixed it with my lotion and although I do have to apply it in the morning and also in the evening to get full effect I would much rather do this than walk around fearing the bugs or poisoning myself with deet!</li>
            <li> I use it while camping at Lake Mead, the mosquitoes stung me as always, and the smell attracted towards me all the bees of the area.</li>
            <li> This product has an excellent combination of essential oils, many of which I use individually. I had a customer service concern and they provided a prompt response with good suggestions to how to resolve my concern. I comment the company Plant Therapy as one you can trust.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Mosquitos love it I guess since you still get bitten. Nothing replaces Off</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say.  It works great, smells great and I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this one, and the bugs bug off!  Smells good.</li>
            <li> Does not work for expelling insect from your skin/body! Very expensive too</li>
            <li> My daughter is highly allergic to mosquito bites, and of course they find her every time. Use of these essential oils in a cream base has kept the mosquitos off, even when we go to the outdoor movies on the riverfront during the summer.</li>
            <li> Mix with some water, spray in corners every couple of months and you&#x27;ll keep those icky spiders away.</li>
            <li> I mix several drops of this oil in a spray bottle with alcohol and distilled water. I spray it all over myself, the dogs, and the furniture on the patio late in the afternoon because that&#x27;s when the mosquitoes start bothering us. It must work because I haven&#x27;t had any bites since I started using it, although I still see them flying around, but not biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it very promptly and in good condition. Thanks to all who are responsible for good service.</li>
            <li> good just like the brand Bug Off</li>
            <li> Love It. I experimented on it. Covered my exposed skin with a home made lotion with Bug Off. Not a single bite but the pesky mosquitoes went through my clothes to take a bite in areas that were not lathered with Bug Off. My husband and I went on a hike - he was covered with at least 10 bites, ( he was my experiment ), I walked away with 2 bites, which is unheard of!  This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Mix a little of this with with witch-hazel and spray it on my dogs and myself before going out for runs in the woods.  It&#x27;s not peek summer yet, but it seems to be keeping the bugs off.  It has a strong lemony scent.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s worked very well.  Took it to a wedding near a woodsy lake and it worked like a charm.  Just make sure you cover yourself entirely with the mixture though, otherwise the mosquito will get itself in and bite you.  I&#x27;m using grape seed oil as the carrying agent.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, cats seem to love the stuff and they come and lick me when I have it on.</li>
            <li> I mixed alcohol and witch hazel with a few drops of this and my walk in the dog park is pleasant again. It works and smells great. I recommend and will buy again.</li>
