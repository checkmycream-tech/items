            <li>Every bit as good as the name brand ones, but for a price that makes it a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>One of the good things about these strips are you can still drink something while they are on.</li>

            <li>All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li>I received in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Whitening strips are hugely popular right now- and for good reason!</li>
            <li>I put them in just before I was going to watch some evening TV and took them out once it was over with very easy.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions were very easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>love.. love this product!</li>
            <li>Also, his sensitive gums feel great!</li>
            <li>Love..</li>
            <li>I think they whiten better than the bleaching gel I use on my teeth from the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>My son and I was talking about them and he told me that he uses them all the time and there are some that are safe to use.</li>
            <li>Some of my teeth are positioned more forward than others, which leaves gaps in the whitening strip coverage.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s stay in the teeth and not the gums.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to leave it on for more than 1 hr..</li>
            <li>They seem to work okay.</li>
            <li>Took it off and seen even more of an improvement.</li>
            <li>Also, these are great for sensitive teeth, and the sticky gel washes off with ease afterwards.</li>
            <li>The strips were easy to peel off and then apply to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My biggest fear was that they would not come off easily</li>
            <li>They have a whitening gel on the strips that is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>These whiten my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>The kit came with the strips, detailed instructions and a shade chart.  </li>
            <li>so we can all enjoy whiter teeth without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has tried for two days now and we saw the difference right away!</li>
            <li>Applying the strips on the teeth is pretty easy and as soon as I put it on I can feel the bubbling and tingling.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick rinse with some water and swished it around my mouth to get the residue off my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>after the very first hour of using the strips.  </li>
            <li>No stinging and after one hour I pulled them off, brushed my teeth, and was thrilled to see almost 2 full shades of improvement.  </li>
            <li>I use them everyday and I have seen tremendous results!!!!</li>
            <li>The gel backing is very sticky, like I said earlier, the more time the better.</li>
            <li>so I figured these were worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, they do a nice job,</li>
            <li>I received this kit complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
            <li>For the price, this brand is a valuable product to anyone wanting a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to remove them pretty easily as well and left some of the whitening gel residue on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>these ones do not say which strip is the top and which one is the bottom, most other ones that I have tried do say this</li>
            <li>I tried the strips right away.</li>
            <li>They stay on my teeth well without slipping and have a nice mild mint taste to them.</li>
            <li>After reading several of the many positive reviews, I was excited to buy these strips.</li>
            <li>The box recommend using them for at least 30 minutes, but I find they are more effective after 2 hours.</li>
            <li>These strips are easy to use and so far have not given me any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Once I was able to get a grip on a small edge of the strip, I was able to peel it right off.  </li>
            <li>They work really well!</li>
            <li>The strips themselves are pretty discreet, and taste okay-minty flavor.</li>
            <li>BE AWARE.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first couple off days that my teeth were getting whiter.</li>
            <li>Also, one tip is to apply the lower teeth strip first then uppers.  </li>
            <li>My teeth on the bottom are not as white as on top.</li>
            <li>Could tell a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>They work very well the first go.</li>
            <li>International offers a whitening strip which works great and is simple to use.</li>
            <li>Refund was given right away and they even shipped a new one overnight.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package, they each come with two strips in their own little package to keep them from drying out as well as instructions on how to apply them onto your teeth.</li>
            <li>and they are very sticky when it comes to applying to you teeth.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying these before the overly priced ones!</li>
            <li>and I was really scared to use these not knowing what to expect.  </li>
            <li>These strips really worked well for me and will continue using them.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dental hygenist, and I was skeptical, but they really do work, and I have loved the results!</li>
            <li>The strips are easy to apply and they don&#x27;t make your teeth super sensitive like other strips do.</li>
            <li>Unlike other drugstore options the Bright White strips stayed fixed and snug onto my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a super drastic change after just one use, but it&#x27;s definitely a noticeable change.</li>
            <li>For really bright white teeth must use a few times.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using them my teeth look better then they have in years.</li>
            <li>There was excess gel in my mouth but that is normal.</li>
            <li>The long one is for the top and the smaller one is for the bottom.</li>
            <li>These are good (not great).  </li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive gums, his dentist even told him to hold off on bleaching.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using  white strips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive with continued use that I will see a difference in the shade of white</li>
            <li>I would smile less because of the embarrassment; my smile is back and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>They did not bother my sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>are way better priced than Crest strips, and I&#x27;m guessing work just as well if not better!</li>
            <li>so I originally reported as missing.</li>
            <li>Definitely after multiple uses there are consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t stay on very well and seemed to take too long.</li>
            <li>This really helps those of us that might have some aversions to strange things/tastes in our mouths.  </li>
            <li>68 years old, lot of staining, no bright white but a shade or 2 better.</li>
            <li>I ended up with splotchy results (whitening on center of certain teeth but not on the edges).</li>
            <li>It is apparent that after just one application that these do</li>
            <li>I also saw that some of my teeth were whiter in certain areas, probably due to a shifted tooth that I have and the gel didn&#x27;t hit it too well when I applied them.  </li>
            <li>I believe to see more dramatic results you probably have to wear them once a day for maybe a week.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super thin, simple to use and work really well.</li>
            <li>Once both strips were off, I couldn&#x27;t believe that after the first use I could see a little bit of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I will try it few more times but not sure about this one...</li>
            <li>My teeth normally are very white, but they had dulled due to a health issues for 5 years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If your looking for the whitest teeth possible then use this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygenist, and I was skeptical, but they really do work, and I have loved the results!</li>
            <li> Love.. love.. love this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with both the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use them everyday and I have seen tremendous results!!!!</li>
            <li> So I did a lot of research on whitening strips and bleaching gels. My husband has very sensitive gums, his dentist even told him to hold off on bleaching. However, he has a very bad coffee habit so I hate his browned teeth in pictures! So I came across these and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance. I had tried the Crest white strips but they didn&#x27;t stay on very well and seemed to take too long. My husband has tried for two days now and we saw the difference right away! Also, his sensitive gums feel great! I think they whiten better than the bleaching gel I use on my teeth from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also had an issue with delivery, it was dropped off on our porch but we think some neighborhood kids played a joke so I originally reported as missing. Refund was given right away and they even shipped a new one overnight. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Does not whiten. Too sticky.</li>
            <li> These are good (not great).  I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product it comes with a lot of strips for lots of uses. The strips are easy to apply and they don&#x27;t make your teeth super sensitive like other strips do. They don&#x27;t really have a weird taste to them but some gel does remain on your teeth after you use them. The one thing I wasn&#x27;t a fan of is they are hard to get evenly over all your teeth. I had weird white spots on my teeth because they weren&#x27;t as flexible of a strip as I was hoping for. It does whiten your teeth after just using one their is a noticeable difference. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple teeth whitening kit.  You simply attach the strips to your teeth for 1-2 hours and you are done.  I was a little worried when I saw you had to wear them for 1-2 hours. That seemed like a very long time not to have to talk or do anything but I did not even notice I was wearing them after a few minutes.  There is a slight toothpaste taste in your mouth when you have them on nothing bad or overpowering.  I put them in just before I was going to watch some evening TV and took them out once it was over with very easy. They did not bother my sensitive teeth or gums.  It was very easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER â€“ I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and review. No compensation was received for this review it is based off my use of the product.</li>
            <li> Product works great, good buy</li>
            <li> Was not as described. It was some off brand that wasn&#x27;t even in the box.</li>
            <li> Slight difference after one month of use</li>
            <li> These strips are adorable and have been working for me!</li>
            <li> Wife and I both tried it without any results.  The instructions contradict themselves a few times.  It&#x27;s from China with no ingredients... On the bright side, we did get a $25 gift card for our troubles.</li>
            <li> They work really well! It&#x27;s not like a super drastic change after just one use, but it&#x27;s definitely a noticeable change. For really bright white teeth must use a few times.</li>
            <li> These are very interesting. They work very well the first go. The box recommend using them for at least 30 minutes, but I find they are more effective after 2 hours. Usually I watch a 2 hour movie or something. Also, these are great for sensitive teeth, and the sticky gel washes off with ease afterwards. The strips themselves are pretty discreet, and taste okay-minty flavor. The mint flavor isn&#x27;t too strong. These are very good for when your on the go or just at home. The gel backing is very sticky, like I said earlier, the more time the better. Also, the plastic on the strips is durable-I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it breaking.</li>
            <li> Did not whiten teeth evenly, had streaks after every application.</li>
            <li> I have used teeth strips in the past so I figured these were worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH HOW WRONG I WAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first these ones do not say which strip is the top and which one is the bottom, most other ones that I have tried do say this so I knew what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put them on I started to gag and ended up puking, the gel oozes out of the strips and just makes a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband even tried them and they just slip all around while the gel was oozing out of the stip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not compensated in any way for this review.</li>
            <li> After reading several of the many positive reviews, I was excited to buy these strips. However, when I got them and tried them, I was not completely happy. I had trouble sticking them evenly on my teeth and they are very sticky when it comes to applying to you teeth. They made my gums tingle a bit after I first put them on, which didn&#x27;t hurt, but felt odd and a bit uncomfortable. I left them on for about an hour and my teeth seemed to be a very slight shade whiter but it was a hard to tell. I believe to see more dramatic results you probably have to wear them once a day for maybe a week. They do work, but not exceedingly well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the name brand ones, but for a price that makes it a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes to avoid an expensive ZOOM treatment.  My teeth normally are very white, but they had dulled due to a health issues for 5 years.  I must say that I was amazed how incredible my results were.. after the very first hour of using the strips.  Unlike other drugstore options the Bright White strips stayed fixed and snug onto my teeth.  The adhesive did not get all over my fingers.  No stinging and after one hour I pulled them off, brushed my teeth, and was thrilled to see almost 2 full shades of improvement.  I highly recommend this product.  I plan on gifting my kids with one box each.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well compared to other brands. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> teeth are not even white</li>
            <li> These are from CHINA, the country that is well known for putting all kinds of harmful ingredients in products. Will not use these.  BE AWARE.</li>
            <li> I have always been kind of leery about using teeth whitening products because I heard it was bad for your teeth. My son and I was talking about them and he told me that he uses them all the time and there are some that are safe to use. The Belachi teeth whitening kit has a 14 day supply of strips, that&#x27;s 28 strips. I use mine in the evening before I go to bed and leave them on for about an hour. They stay on my teeth well without slipping and have a nice mild mint taste to them. One of the good things about these strips are you can still drink something while they are on. I noticed after the first couple off days that my teeth were getting whiter. After a few weeks of using them my teeth look better then they have in years. I  received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information provided is what I experienced.</li>
            <li> I am on day three of my treatment and see a great difference already.  I drink a lot of coffee and tea and my teeth did not look good at all.  I would smile less because of the embarrassment; my smile is back and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for the price in comparison to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; on the market and I am so impressed with how well it does! I went in for a dental check up and even my dentist asked what I have been using because my teeth look so white! I would highly recommend trying these before the overly priced ones!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works? I drink coffe once a day, and it seems to work as soon as I take them off, but the next day I feel my teeth are back to the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; color...</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work well on crooked teeth. Some of my teeth are positioned more forward than others, which leaves gaps in the whitening strip coverage. I ended up with splotchy results (whitening on center of certain teeth but not on the edges).</li>
            <li> These whiten my teeth just fine. Just make sure it&#x27;s stay in the teeth and not the gums.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t whitening even after five uses.</li>
            <li> I want to start this off with a disclaimer.  I have never used anything for whitening teeth and I was really scared to use these not knowing what to expect.  So with that said.... I was very glad these came with great instructions.  The instructions were very easy to follow.  The kit came with the strips, detailed instructions and a shade chart.  I included a couple of pictures of what comes in the kit.  The strips were easy to peel off and then apply to my teeth.  The strips have a minty taste to them.  This really helps those of us that might have some aversions to strange things/tastes in our mouths.  They were a little awkward to have on my teeth but not bad.  Once I applied the strips, they did not come off until I pulled them off an hour later.  My biggest fear was that they would not come off easily and I would have small pieces left behind, but that did not happen.  Once I was able to get a grip on a small edge of the strip, I was able to peel it right off.  It did feel like it left a small amount of the whitening gel behind.  Once both strips were off, I couldn&#x27;t believe that after the first use I could see a little bit of a difference.  They weren&#x27;t tons whiter after just one use but a definite difference.  Some spots were whiter than others and I figure that&#x27;s due to uneven enamel.  Definitely after multiple uses there are consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These whitening strips were provided as a sample to evaluate and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> These strips are easy to use and so far have not given me any sensitivity.  You leave them on for an hour and peel off.  However, read the directions carefully because you are not supposed to apply them after brushing.  For me it is easier to do them an hour at night, brush teeth, then head to bed.  They do a great job at whitening.  I have been doing it every night for about 10 days now, and have definitely noticed improvements!  Also, one tip is to apply the lower teeth strip first then uppers.  Overall, they do a nice job, are way better priced than Crest strips, and I&#x27;m guessing work just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay too well on your teeth, have to keep shifting them but I did see a whiter result so they product works.</li>
            <li> 68 years old, lot of staining, no bright white but a shade or 2 better.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using  white strips so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to however after using it about 5 times I&#x27;m still not sure.  Applying the strips on the teeth is pretty easy and as soon as I put it on I can feel the bubbling and tingling.  Box says to leave it on for 1-2 hrs but I can&#x27;t seem to leave it on for more than 1 hr..if that, it starts to peel off so it becomes uncomfortable to leave it in any longer and after I peel it off there are some white spots left on the teeth not white overall.  I will try it few more times but not sure about this one...</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product!!!!! Order it you want be disappointed!!! Better than crest!!!! Way better!!!!</li>
            <li> Whitening strips are hugely popular right now- and for good reason! They&#x27;re super thin, simple to use and work really well. Have no time to sit for treatments at the dentist? Lacking a few thousand dollars to pay for it? Well, give these a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GJP International offers a whitening strip which works great and is simple to use. Additionally, it&#x27;s at a great price point so we can all enjoy whiter teeth without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewing this product was great. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> They seem to work okay.</li>
            <li> I received my 14 Day Supply of Strips a few days ago. I tried the strips right away. My teeth on the bottom are not as white as on top. I left it on approximately for 1 hour. Took if off my bottom teeth rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth. There was excess gel in my mouth but that is normal. I showed my husband my teeth before I put the strip on. When I showed him my bottom teeth afterwards he did see a difference and that was with only 1 use !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even seen a slight difference. The second day I used another strip on my bottom teeth again. Left it on for almost 1 1/2 hours. It is a little hard to keep it on for a long period of time. Took it off and seen even more of an improvement. I recommend these whitening strips because I see a difference in only a few days. I received this kit complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried other whitening brand strips and my teeth are little bit sensitive at times with the high strength ones. I was curious to see if i I could have the same results with theses.  Upon opening the package, they each come with two strips in their own little package to keep them from drying out as well as instructions on how to apply them onto your teeth. The long one is for the top and the smaller one is for the bottom. They have a whitening gel on the strips that is easy to apply.  I left them on for a couple of hours to achieve a whiter smile, they have a mild, mint, toothpaste taste to the, nothing awful or disgusting.  They stayed in place, which in comparison to the national brands, would slide around and felt weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove them pretty easily as well and left some of the whitening gel residue on my teeth.  I did a quick rinse with some water and swished it around my mouth to get the residue off my teeth.  I noticed a slight whitening to mt teeth but nothing drastic.  I also saw that some of my teeth were whiter in certain areas, probably due to a shifted tooth that I have and the gel didn&#x27;t hit it too well when I applied them.  I&#x27;m positive with continued use that I will see a difference in the shade of white my teeth will become.  It is apparent that after just one application that these do in fact work and my teeth felt no sensitivity afterwards as they did with the national brand ones.  These strips really worked well for me and will continue using them.  I received in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Even after using a single strip I notice a brighter difference. For the price, this brand is a valuable product to anyone wanting a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> it works excellent I would definitely buy the  item again</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Could tell a difference after the first use. Definitely whitened my teeth and will order again.</li>
