            <li>The hair is still smooth after many shashampoos</li>
            <li>But the hair is beautiful, clean and natural.  </li>
            <li>Easy to style, cut, and color.  </li>

            <li>I bought it for school and its been very useful</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>The head was the same one in the picture, the hair was nice and my daughter loves it!</li>

            <li>Will differently buy more for future projects, excellent buy!</li>
            <li>:) Now I have my own red keep.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Debra Doll while in cosmetology school and loved it more than my other (5) brand name doll heads.</li>
            <li>More accurate cuts, better lifting in color processing, washes and styles as though dealing with actual clients.</li>
            <li>Good overall coverage of hair on head.  </li>
            <li>Just like real hair and is even better than the manniquins that are sold in my school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was her dream come true gift.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement doll for consmetology school as I got scissor happy on my other one.</li>
            <li>Love her, her hair is thick and soft and its awesome for braiding and rollers</li>
            <li>Manikin didn&#x27;t have much hair and it falls out really easily.</li>
            <li>I chose this item due to the positive feedback and am extremely happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very manageable and I&#x27;m able to do many different hairstyles on her.</li>
            <li>that cost far more and hair got matted and tangled.</li>
            <li>Thanks, the doll was perfect for my test ,the hair was not to thick</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>No that she is working in a salon, she uses it less but still says it is a good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not 100% Human Hair</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist &amp; my baby girl wants to follow in my footsteps!</li>
            <li>Was the exact doll as we were using.</li>
            <li>I was able to do 9 different hair cuts before running out of hair.</li>
            <li>I needed a doll head fast a week before my test and it got here within two days!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I have tried various doll head brands even leading name brands but these Debra  or &amp;#34;Debby&amp;#34; doll heads are perfect for everything.</li>
            <li>I did splatter some red paint on them so they look more realistic.</li>
            <li>Easy maintenance the same as what I use in my school.</li>
            <li>Her hair was much thicker than the ones I used in school, and had more of a realistic &amp;#34;growth pattern&amp;#34; (closer to the way human hair grows from head).</li>
            <li>real hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easyto use.</li>
            <li>Thanks GRRM for the idea</li>
            <li>This was perfect for my daughters use at school for all uses of cutting to curling and this meets the standards</li>
            <li>I receive this Debra Mannequin and I really wonder why it deserve a 5 stars review.</li>
            <li>You cannot do much with this mannequin.</li>
            <li>So much easier than doing hairstyles on a moving child.</li>
            <li>and when i receive the manniquenn it was better than i expected...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It fast shipment and on time.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>She wants to do hair when shes older</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>decent head for the price and for learning.</li>
            <li>It is much sturdier and my 11 year old niece loves it!</li>
            <li>The hair did not melt when a high temp iron was used on it</li>
            <li>She started cosmotology classes in mid-&lt;br /&gt;February and goes to high school and then goes to cosmotology 22 hours a week.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s mixed with some other kind of hair in it.</li>
            <li>Bought to learn new hair do&#x27;s for my eight year old</li>
            <li>Hair feels like natural hair and not yak.  </li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item as a birthday gift for my 12 year old who loves to practice the hairstyles she watches on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my nine yr old grandaughter.</li>
            <li>Was surprised to see these on amazon, ordered 2 to practice for my state board exam.</li>
            <li>I will say I had to shampoo Her a LOT because She was full of lint and some dead lice</li>
            <li>This is human hair and so far she loves it!</li>
            <li>It keeps her busy for several hours.  </li>
            <li>It also took color very well with minimal to no breakage when lifting it to the lightest blonde color.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my little sister, to practice on, since she enjoy doing hair,  the hair was really dry and rough</li>

            <li> It also took color very well with minimal to no breakage when lifting it to the lightest blonde color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister, to practice on, since she enjoy doing hair,  the hair was really dry and rough</li>
            <li> The hair on the bottom is very thin and many layer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitly not 17&amp;#34; - 19&amp;#34; long.. it&#x27;s only 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i just have her sit flat in the table.  </li>
            <li> She has been practicing braiding, cornrolls and using the curling and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Has worked so far, but my HOA is a little grumpy with me.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit bigger</li>
            <li> The hair are dry</li>
            <li> Hair is a bit thinner than I expected</li>
            <li> and I am ordering it for my other niece.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any odd smell like I&#x27;ve read about for some the other mannequin heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish the hair were longer, it&#x27;s hard to style with such little hair.</li>
            <li> Long enough for practicing cutting, color, blow dry and iron sets.</li>
            <li> only negative is that the nose is so small.</li>
            <li> They look too tame.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she is not sure why, since I also ordered her Celebrity Sam, and she loves that head.</li>

            <li> I tend to order this 2 to 3 heads at a time and have several times. They have ALWAYS been sent in a timely manner and packaged well. The hair quality is good. Long enough for practicing cutting, color, blow dry and iron sets. The hair did not melt when a high temp iron was used on it so it is as advertised....real hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this manikin for my state board test last year in NY. I had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;Typically this manikin would run closer to 50 bucks in NY so this was a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is enjoying working on this mannequin for cosmotology.  She started cosmotology classes in mid-&lt;br /&gt;February and goes to high school and then goes to cosmotology 22 hours a week.</li>
            <li> Love her, her hair is thick and soft and its awesome for braiding and rollers it&#x27;s very easyto use. The hair is still smooth after many shashampoos</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this doll head! I may have the next beautician here lol</li>
            <li> Good overall coverage of hair on head.  Hair feels like natural hair and not yak.  Easy to style, cut, and color.  Haven&#x27;t tried to perm it yet.  Thanks for a good product at a reasonable price!  I will be ordering more heads from this manufacturer and company.  Will be using this head for state board testing.</li>
            <li> The manikin arrived safely, was wrapped well. It looks real, and is great for my displays. I am not a cosmetologist, but I design and create 1940&#x27;s style fascinators and this is perfect for my displays. Also you can easily style the hair which is a plus. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have bought about 40 of these lovely heads. They all sit on spikes outside my house to ward off evil children and invading armies. Has worked so far, but my HOA is a little grumpy with me. I wish they made them with angry or scary faces. They look too tame. I did splatter some red paint on them so they look more realistic. Thanks GRRM for the idea :) Now I have my own red keep.</li>
            <li> Great for school. Easy to work with.. Just like real hair and is even better than the manniquins that are sold in my school.</li>
            <li> I use this head as well as the Whitney head to practice lighting patterns for photography.  I can&#x27;t provide any feedback on using it for styling hair, but it does the job for lighting exercises.  It didn&#x27;t have any odd smell like I&#x27;ve read about for some the other mannequin heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that the nose is so small. A slightly bigger nose would help with casting shadows for lighting (I know that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for, but it&#x27;s how I use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with both of the heads.</li>
            <li> I was looking at the dolls with the hair you can fix and thought why not this instead. It is much sturdier and my 11 year old niece loves it! 4 of her friends are now getting one for Christmas and I am ordering it for my other niece. It has become her go to &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; and she sends pictures of all her creations.  Just make sure you order the holding clamp.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel human, sheds terribly, and is not 17-19 inches long! I wanted to return it but didn&#x27;t get around to it by the deadline.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the hair. It&#x27;s perfect for practicing any hairstyles. I bought it for school and its been very useful</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to practice hair design with it. She&#x27;s just added some more accessories to make it even better.</li>
            <li> Manikin didn&#x27;t have much hair and it falls out really easily. Wish the hair were longer, it&#x27;s hard to style with such little hair.</li>
            <li> The hair feels really nasty and fake but her hair curls and braids really well.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my daughters use at school for all uses of cutting to curling and this meets the standards</li>
            <li> decent head for the price and for learning.</li>
            <li> Short Short Short... the hair are so short on this mannequin. It&#x27;s definitly not 17&amp;#34; - 19&amp;#34; long.. it&#x27;s only 12&amp;#34; long.I receive this Debra Mannequin and I really wonder why it deserve a 5 stars review. The hair on the mannequin is really short. You cannot do much with this mannequin. The hair on the bottom is very thin and many layer. After you cut off the layer it&#x27;s above shoulder length. The hair are dry and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not 100% Human Hair, It&#x27;s mixed with some other kind of hair in it.</li>
            <li> the hair manikin came in three days!  it is amazing!  i didnt purchase the clamp.  i just have her sit flat in the table.  her hair is clean and perfect for different hair styles.  i would recomend he for ages 11 and up.  you should get her.  she is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist &amp; my baby girl wants to follow in my footsteps! SHe wanted her own &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; as we in my business call them, &amp; for the great price I was really surprised of the quality. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loves loves loves working with hair.&lt;br /&gt;She loves braiding, curling, teasing it...you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her ninth birthday she received this gift.&lt;br /&gt;It was a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also got her a book about hair styling and braiding.&lt;br /&gt;Then we tossed in some makeup, hair rollers and doo dads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was her dream come true gift.</li>
            <li> Pretty good hair for the price!</li>
            <li> The hair is very manageable and I&#x27;m able to do many different hairstyles on her. I enjoy it. So much easier than doing hairstyles on a moving child.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter who is attending cosmetology school.  She found this &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; to be just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  The hair is difficult to work and&lt;br /&gt;she is not sure why, since I also ordered her Celebrity Sam, and she loves that head.</li>
            <li> I got it for my sister for christmas and she loved it. She wants to do hair when shes older so this was perfect for her</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this item to practice cosmetology....in fact....l thought the human hair might be creepy. But the hair is beautiful, clean and natural.  I won&#x27;t send it back, but will use it to display the hats I intend to make.  This item was shipped on the same day I ordered it....a Saturday night .... and delivered on Monday which was a holiday. WOW.  Great product and exceptional service from the vendor.</li>
            <li> U can feel it so soft not hard , the hair perfect doesn&#x27;t fell so easy my daughter loveeee it&lt;br /&gt;And u will love it too</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a birthday gift for my 12 year old who loves to practice the hairstyles she watches on Youtube.  I chose this item due to the positive feedback and am extremely happy with my purchase.  The head was the same one in the picture, the hair was nice and my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Great head. Needed a replacement doll for consmetology school as I got scissor happy on my other one. Was the exact doll as we were using.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my daughter who wanted one to practice on at a fraction of what Sally&#x27;s wanted for the same one.  It was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> where should i begin! Thank you!!! Im in cosmetology school and need these heads quite often, they are just so expensive everywhere!!!!! These heads are great quality and do what i need it to do in cosm school from, perms to hair coloring and braiding etc.. you get the point. They can take a beating. they came in just two days which is just in time for me to take them into school tomorrow which is when i need them for, also, great packaging not that its needed, they are just heads. I recommend this greatly and told all my friends at school about this great quality and cost.</li>
            <li> The hair length was perfect while in cosmetology school. I was able to do 9 different hair cuts before running out of hair. It also took color very well with minimal to no breakage when lifting it to the lightest blonde color. I must have used at least 5 of these dolls already! Love them and love the price!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nine yr old grandaughter. She has had toy ones before..that cost far more and hair got matted and tangled. This is human hair and so far she loves it! Bought her the stand as well! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, hair texture and length is good for most styles. Will differently buy more for future projects, excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality for cosmopolitan school.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in Cosmetology School.  She likes it quite well and used it every day in school.  No that she is working in a salon, she uses it less but still says it is a good product.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my niece for Christmas cause she like to do hair and when i receive the manniquenn it was better than i expected... thanks</li>
            <li> Its 100% human hair. Easy maintenance the same as what I use in my school. Excellent quality and the best price so far.</li>
            <li> Manikin as described.  My 9 year old daughter received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it!  She especially loves that the manikin is wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and the quality is good. I expected it to be a bit bigger but it is still usable.</li>
            <li> Bought to learn new hair do&#x27;s for my eight year old she does not want me &amp;#34;practicing&amp;#34; on her This was the next best thing!</li>
            <li> Hair is a bit thinner than I expected but It will work great to cut for my barber testing.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Debra Doll while in cosmetology school and loved it more than my other (5) brand name doll heads. Was surprised to see these on amazon, ordered 2 to practice for my state board exam. Product is true to description, 100% human hair and fairly priced! Received both doll heads within a day or 2 after ordering. Seriously, I have tried various doll head brands even leading name brands but these Debra  or &amp;#34;Debby&amp;#34; doll heads are perfect for everything. More accurate cuts, better lifting in color processing, washes and styles as though dealing with actual clients. GREAT for students, try it!</li>
            <li> Thanks, the doll was perfect for my test ,the hair was not to thick and i passed with no problems</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister, to practice on, since she enjoy doing hair,  the hair was really dry and rough that&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 star</li>
            <li> It fast shipment and on time. I would recommend it for next customer. Great deal for great value added. Thanks.</li>
            <li> such a great doll head and perfect for state board</li>
            <li> I will say I had to shampoo Her a LOT because She was full of lint and some dead lice (but thats very common with these Heads no matter where You purchase them). The Hair was nice quality and She doesnt look as creepy as some of those other heads.</li>
            <li> Bought this mannequin for my state board, and liked it so much I plan on buying another one or two. Her hair was much thicker than the ones I used in school, and had more of a realistic &amp;#34;growth pattern&amp;#34; (closer to the way human hair grows from head). Good quality, very reasonable price, and arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my daughter&#x27;s 11th birthday and she loves it.  She has been practicing braiding, cornrolls and using the curling and flat iron.  It keeps her busy for several hours.  It did not come with a stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great doll head! Loved it! Took my state board test and passed...all Glory to God! I needed a doll head fast a week before my test and it got here within two days! It&#x27;s also a great length I did two or three practice cuts before my state board.. Awesome...!</li>
