            <li> I love this shampoo! After always buying shampoo from Walmart and other cheaper brands, my hair never seemed to get clean and would get oily fast. After doing some research, I decided on the Matrix Total Results Sleek Shampoo Unisex. I purchased it 3 months ago and definitely won&#x27;t go back to anything else. I also use it on my 3 year old&#x27;s hair and her hair is awesome!! Also, I have about 1/4 bottle left after 3 months and I have really long hair too. I wash my hair twice a week, in case anyone is curious how long it lasts. The price on Amazon is a great price although when I purchased it last, it was cheaper, but prices on here do fluctuate. I keep it in my &amp;#34;saved items&amp;#34; so that I can see it often and notice if the price goes down and can quickly buy it.</li>

            <li> I think it is good to change different shampoos.  This one is great for my hair.  I will use it for awhile, then change.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I still like the Matrix hydrating shampoo better.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo and how good it makes our hair feel.  We haven&#x27;t been able to use any other shampoo since beginning to use Matrix.</li>
