            <li>Not as potent as others I have tried but decent product.</li>
            <li>The Whole Foods brand Eucalyptus Essential Oil, for some reason, doesn&#x27;t smell as good or strong as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Received my bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quite quickly too.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This totally undiluted and very potent.</li>
            <li>This one is longer lasting and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>The smell was wonderful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Shipped straight from Plant Therapy and arrived very, very quickly</li>
            <li>This product has a strong smell and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>this, like the other Plant Therapy stuff is very strong and smells authentic.  </li>
            <li>The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li>I hold some water in my mouth, put a drop in, swallow, then drink more to flush completely.</li>
            <li>Solid product, nicely made and packaged.  </li>
            <li>It can be diluted in water and sprayed around the house in order to create a fresh environment.</li>
            <li>:) This eucalyptus smells great, the dropper isn&#x27;t too fast or slow, and the quality has held up as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this essential oil because I am mixing my own cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>Boyfriend uses the oils on his clients &amp; making his own essential oils and he likes it.  </li>
            <li>is worth</li>
            <li>To be fair we have never used any other brand of Eucalyptus Oil.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is the perfect size - It&#x27;s enough oil to lightly coat every surface inside a small to medium sized</li>
            <li>but this clears it right</li>
            <li>just the right product i was looking for A+++</li>
            <li>It is very strong and you only need a couple of drops to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more when this one runs out, so i&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle</li>
            <li>Its also great for using in vacuum bag; just add enough to a cotton ball and drop in bag to freshen the rooms while vacuuming.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is great!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Just put it in a hot shower or on the night</li>
            <li>it really seems to work well!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>They have higher quality oil.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much to make things smell like a spa!</li>
            <li>I think I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus is one of my favorite essential oils</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.  </li>
            <li>Works great combine with other products !!!!</li>
            <li>Great price for an intense, smaller than expected but just right after I opened it, eucalyptus experience.</li>
            <li>These are the only two I&#x27;ve compared, but don&#x27;t plan on comparing any more since this one seems very high quality to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a bigger bottle for a better price at Whole Foods after this one ran out.  </li>
            <li>I add a few drops of this into my mop water, it makes the house smell nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with all the essential oils that I have ordered from Plant Therapy Essential oils.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]].  </li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li>the whole house can also be in fogging or furnace aromatherapy, works both ways.</li>
            <li>I hope I don&#x27;t need it much this winter but have it on hand</li>
            <li>This is totally worth it especially for a natural and medication free solution for baby.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment &amp; packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really found much use for it aside from that.</li>
            <li>I agree with a previous reviewer that it is even better than Whole Foods eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>It increases it&#x27;s effectiveness and even with my sensitive skin, hasn&#x27;t been too strong as to leave any red marks or anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been learning a little bit about essential oils and thought this one would be a good try...</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fast delivery, since stuffy noses came early this year.</li>
            <li>This is the product I was hoping for when I bought a different brand that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>not as strong as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I have to have high quality product because my product is home made high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am reordering to continue a restful sleep during high pollen and mole season.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having this available before a serious sinus headache sets in.</li>
            <li>10 minutes after opening the Eucalyptus oil and Peppermint oil, my eyes see more clearly, my sinuses are less stuffy and my brain feels sharper.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses it to clean hard floors leave a sweet smell in the house for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I since then got my new door, but that is an idea if ants come around.</li>
            <li>Im new to oils</li>
            <li>This a very good product, highly recommend it, I tried on insect bites and is really good, only one application and no more itch, I am very allergic to mosquitoes bites, I live in South Florida where mosquitoes bloom in Summer time, this product smells completely natural, I haven&#x27;t try it for cold or flu, but I believe it could be a good product to relief the symptoms caused by cold or flu, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this stuff!</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I really like adding touches of the oil to certain things, but after a while, the oil in the bottle appears to have slightly changed its smell</li>
            <li>This arrived securely packaged and had a slight aroma as I opened it, creating excitement to smell it full-on; it didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I bought this to enhance the effectiveness of an All Natural Chemical FREE Flea Spray that I use on my two little monsters, as I affectionally call my two Chihuahua&#x27;s, Bacon and Rascal.</li>
            <li>Used the oil in my steamer and it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped compared to other commercial steamers I&#x27;ve been in at resorts - maybe they use oil by the pint in those.</li>

            <li> Not as potent as others I have tried but decent product.</li>
            <li> The Whole Foods brand Eucalyptus Essential Oil, for some reason, doesn&#x27;t smell as good or strong as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Received my bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quite quickly too.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This totally undiluted and very potent.</li>
            <li> This one is longer lasting and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The smell was wonderful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Shipped straight from Plant Therapy and arrived very, very quickly</li>
            <li> This product has a strong smell and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> this, like the other Plant Therapy stuff is very strong and smells authentic.  </li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li> I hold some water in my mouth, put a drop in, swallow, then drink more to flush completely.</li>
            <li> Solid product, nicely made and packaged.  </li>
            <li> It can be diluted in water and sprayed around the house in order to create a fresh environment.</li>
            <li> :) This eucalyptus smells great, the dropper isn&#x27;t too fast or slow, and the quality has held up as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil because I am mixing my own cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> Boyfriend uses the oils on his clients &amp; making his own essential oils and he likes it.  </li>
            <li> is worth</li>
            <li> To be fair we have never used any other brand of Eucalyptus Oil.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is the perfect size - It&#x27;s enough oil to lightly coat every surface inside a small to medium sized</li>
            <li> but this clears it right</li>
            <li> just the right product i was looking for A+++</li>
            <li> It is very strong and you only need a couple of drops to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more when this one runs out, so i&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle</li>
            <li> Its also great for using in vacuum bag; just add enough to a cotton ball and drop in bag to freshen the rooms while vacuuming.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which is great!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Just put it in a hot shower or on the night</li>
            <li> it really seems to work well!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> They have higher quality oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much to make things smell like a spa!</li>
            <li> I think I will order more in the future.</li>

            <li> Works great combine with other products !!!!</li>
            <li> Great price for an intense, smaller than expected but just right after I opened it, eucalyptus experience.</li>
            <li> These are the only two I&#x27;ve compared, but don&#x27;t plan on comparing any more since this one seems very high quality to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a bigger bottle for a better price at Whole Foods after this one ran out.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this into my mop water, it makes the house smell nice and fresh.</li>

            <li> the whole house can also be in fogging or furnace aromatherapy, works both ways.</li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t need it much this winter but have it on hand</li>

            <li> Fast shipment &amp; packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really found much use for it aside from that.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer that it is even better than Whole Foods eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> It increases it&#x27;s effectiveness and even with my sensitive skin, hasn&#x27;t been too strong as to leave any red marks or anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been learning a little bit about essential oils and thought this one would be a good try...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the fast delivery, since stuffy noses came early this year.</li>
            <li> This is the product I was hoping for when I bought a different brand that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> not as strong as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I have to have high quality product because my product is home made high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am reordering to continue a restful sleep during high pollen and mole season.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having this available before a serious sinus headache sets in.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes after opening the Eucalyptus oil and Peppermint oil, my eyes see more clearly, my sinuses are less stuffy and my brain feels sharper.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it to clean hard floors leave a sweet smell in the house for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I since then got my new door, but that is an idea if ants come around.</li>
            <li> Im new to oils</li>
            <li> This a very good product, highly recommend it, I tried on insect bites and is really good, only one application and no more itch, I am very allergic to mosquitoes bites, I live in South Florida where mosquitoes bloom in Summer time, this product smells completely natural, I haven&#x27;t try it for cold or flu, but I believe it could be a good product to relief the symptoms caused by cold or flu, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this stuff!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I really like adding touches of the oil to certain things, but after a while, the oil in the bottle appears to have slightly changed its smell</li>
            <li> This arrived securely packaged and had a slight aroma as I opened it, creating excitement to smell it full-on; it didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I bought this to enhance the effectiveness of an All Natural Chemical FREE Flea Spray that I use on my two little monsters, as I affectionally call my two Chihuahua&#x27;s, Bacon and Rascal.</li>
            <li> Used the oil in my steamer and it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped compared to other commercial steamers I&#x27;ve been in at resorts - maybe they use oil by the pint in those.</li>
            <li> I also put it under my nose when congested, and it helps clear my airways.</li>
            <li> Combined with herbs it helps clear my nasal passages, and hopefully helps to stop infections.</li>
            <li> This will clear your sinus.</li>
            <li> I never put any directly on him besides his feet at night.</li>
            <li> It Eucalyptus Oil arrived early.</li>
            <li> so helpful to stick in the vaporizer, rub directly on the feet, take some wiffs of it to clear the nasal passages, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used it in my humidifer as well as used it directly on my skin</li>
            <li> Developed allergies this year.</li>
            <li> its very effective for cold...</li>
            <li> Vicks Vapo Rub is not longer \\&quot;Vixie!\\&quot;  A few years ago it seems they changed the formula to one that is far less effective.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops wherever it is that he is going to be sitting pretty much.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not a slight on the product.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li> High quality essential oil in a user-friendly bottle.</li>
            <li> Seems to be what it claims to be, a high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what i expected haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a cloth near his crib and it really helped clear his nose</li>
            <li> As far as any health benefits such as opening up nasal passages, I cannot comment.</li>
            <li> I have it on hand for allergy, cold, and flu seasons because it is so good for clearing</li>
            <li> My 6 month old had minor seasonal allergies and this helped a her breathe easier at night.</li>
            <li> Great for helping to cut off those pesky cold symptoms and help you breath a little easier</li>
            <li> They are not diluted and last a very long time....</li>
            <li> Much better than the crap they sell at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> We mix this with other essential oils, add water and spray it on our dogs before they go outside in flea season.</li>
            <li> will consider buying other products like this in the future.</li>
            <li> Mixing this with water created my own natural flea repellent.</li>
            <li> Clears the airways enough that many times I have avoided the sick sinus headache.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to add.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> so I only needed to use a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> I use it on a wet towel above their beds or put a few drops on the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> so he could sleep better which, as any parent of a sick child will tell you,</li>
            <li> and she likes it, she says its just like the other oils brands she buys from other site.</li>
            <li> I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t seem stuffy when I put her down.</li>
            <li> I use this in my diffuser to keep allergies and colds down.</li>
            <li> It is small but a little but dies go a long way.</li>
            <li> looking forward to using it, it was delivered in about a week or less.</li>
            <li> Making a smelly mess</li>
            <li> i use this on my little kid...</li>
            <li> Not very potent.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this oil again very soon; we just ran out after a bout of the cold ran through our house.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Lavender oil, I had bought this in Europe a few years ago, but now we have it in the U.S.</li>
            <li> put a few drops on the bumper in his crib at night.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on his feet in his pajamas.</li>
            <li> Aroma disappears after a few moments.</li>
            <li> The lid was also broken when I received, like it had been used prior.</li>
            <li> I like to tip a few drops into my shower or bath, and let the steam relieve me of all my winter ailments.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of it in the shower, and I rub some on my temples when I feel a headache coming on.  </li>
            <li> Put a few drops in the shower, vaporizer or a pan of water on the stove during the winter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to soothe my baby from the coughing and congestion of a cold he picked up from his older brother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small but, it has a flow stopper</li>
            <li> Shortly after the third application her little girl began having very bad seizures that her vet said was caused by Liver Disease.</li>
            <li> It is very weak and does not last.</li>
            <li> not totally authentic eucalyptus smell... smells like patchouli-ish</li>
            <li> using ~10 drops a week for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I used a small drop in some baby Vicks rub</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried because the bottle is so small.</li>
            <li> From the research that we both did, we discovered that small breeds, Chihuahua&#x27;s being specifically mentioned, are particularily seceptible to side effects of the Pesticide based Flea Control.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my 6 month old baby had a cold.  </li>
            <li> believe that the Pesticide based Flea Control products likeAdvantage, Advantix and Frontline that I used for years on my two now deceased companions were the cause of the Liver Disease in one, and the Cancerous Tumor in the other and the seizures that my Bestest Friends Chihuahua now suffers from.</li>
            <li> He was having a hard time nursing because he was so congested</li>
            <li> I burned a few drops uncut to help with my breathing and sinuses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still mad at Vicks, but at least this fixes it.  </li>
            <li> This thing is very weak to be &amp;</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the vaporizer does not diffuse the oils all that well as it should.</li>
            <li> Having a bit of ice cream, milk, or anything cold helps to stop any stinging sensations.</li>
            <li> I run this in my sons room when he has a cold</li>
            <li> so I can have one at home and take on on the go in case my daughter&#x27;s nose get stuffy as she suffers from allergies.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for use during cold and flu seasoning.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help when my family had a cold</li>
            <li> I use a couple of drops in my tub when I have a bad cold or aches.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t a cure or anything but does relieve symptoms and alleviates painful coughing.</li>
            <li> disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Stinks and smells like the bottom of the barrel Eucalyptus!</li>
            <li> If you have a congested nose... and hate the stinky vapor...</li>
            <li> Bad Eucalyptus!  </li>
            <li> Did not have opportunity to try for mosquito repellent</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this because I was getting bitten by fleas. Mixing this with water created my own natural flea repellent.</li>
            <li> strong and nice i use it in my cream the one i use for massage it is really good</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a recipe on pinterest to make your own floor cleaner. I love it. Makes the whole house smell great and the cleaner was cheap to make and works well.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I was expecting, so i&#x27;m pleased. will consider buying other products like this in the future.</li>
            <li> I use the eucalyptus essential oil a lot for myself and my children when we&#x27;ve running noise. This is a product I need to have all the time at home.</li>
            <li> Best quality essential oil I have ever purchased.  The smell was wonderful and long lasting. I will definitely buy from here again.</li>
            <li> We mix this with other essential oils, add water and spray it on our dogs before they go outside in flea season. It seems to do the job!&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Morse</li>
            <li> this, like the other Plant Therapy stuff is very strong and smells authentic.  Much better than the crap they sell at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Not as potent as others I have tried but decent product. Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the purchase experience and the product.</li>
            <li> the sister-in-law has chest congestion as a write.  we have made a chest rub with this and cconut oil in a dilution of 1:1.  it has really helped her breathe alot better</li>
            <li> In addition to its pleasant aroma, this product helped me heal a lot of strong respiratory problem ..&lt;br /&gt;perfume the whole house can also be in fogging or furnace aromatherapy, works both ways.</li>
            <li> Used the oil in my steamer and it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped compared to other commercial steamers I&#x27;ve been in at resorts - maybe they use oil by the pint in those.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great for clearing sinus congestion</li>
            <li> I use it for a variety of reasons and this particular one has a nice scent not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product. This Eucalyptus is one of the strongest scents I have found. You can tell it is a great quality product. I have used it for all kinds of things such as oil refill for my reed diffuser in the bathroom (please find instructions don&#x27;t just dump it in there), as well as my homemade bath products that I sell. I have to have high quality product because my product is home made high quality. (https://www.etsy.com/shop/DesignedByJessi) Having happy customers I need high quality ingredients. This stuff is fantastic and definitely one of my most popular Scents.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I have been very pleased with all the essential oils that I have ordered from Plant Therapy Essential oils.  They also have the speediest shipping and delivery of any of the products I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality essential oil.  I have used it for my stuffy nose and I am very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I love it, Eucalyptus for me; its like catnip fot a i cat. I absolutely love it. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> After looking at the many options available, we are very happy with the aroma and grade of this oil; very versatile.  This was a great choice for adding to baths, to refreshing our household in a variety of ways.</li>
            <li> the scent is really great..</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! The best oil I&#x27;ve ever used for my sinuses and headaches.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com. They got to me in fairly quick time, were wrapped well, and the oils themselves are of very good quality. I did grapefruit, citronella and eucalyptus. All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> This totally undiluted and very potent. We use to to ward off, or lessen the severity of colds in the winter and also it helped with allergies in the spring. It takes away an itchy throat almost instantly. I hold some water in my mouth, put a drop in, swallow, then drink more to flush completely. Having a bit of ice cream, milk, or anything cold helps to stop any stinging sensations.</li>
            <li> Vicks Vapo Rub is not longer \\&quot;Vixie!\\&quot;  A few years ago it seems they changed the formula to one that is far less effective.  I bought this Eucalyptus oil and now add a drop or two to on top of my schmear of Vicks.  It increases it&#x27;s effectiveness and even with my sensitive skin, hasn&#x27;t been too strong as to leave any red marks or anything.  I&#x27;m still mad at Vicks, but at least this fixes it.  ;)</li>
            <li> I will order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> fast service on a great product.</li>
            <li> We use this when we get any kind of head or chest cold.  Just put it in a hot shower or on the night stand an it really seems to work well!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the product. I have used it several times as a steam mist for sinus issues and been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My family and I have allergies and asthma.  I&#x27;ve read that eucalyptus can ease upper respiratory symptoms.  My girls love the smell of eucalyptus.  When they have a stuffy nose, they open it and smell it.  I use it on a wet towel above their beds or put a few drops on the shower floor.  It really works!</li>
            <li> Great for colds to help the nose.  I hope I don&#x27;t need it much this winter but have it on hand should the need arise.</li>
            <li> Nicely, strong scent which adds a great aromatherapy aspect to our sauna time.  We really enjoy it and I think it&#x27;s helping my sinuses, too!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I really like adding touches of the oil to certain things, but after a while, the oil in the bottle appears to have slightly changed its smell</li>
            <li> I bought a bigger bottle for a better price at Whole Foods after this one ran out.  The Whole Foods brand Eucalyptus Essential Oil, for some reason, doesn&#x27;t smell as good or strong as [[ASIN:B005V2UHIW Eucalyptus Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]].  These are the only two I&#x27;ve compared, but don&#x27;t plan on comparing any more since this one seems very high quality to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click &#x27;yes&#x27; if helpful!</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I use it in my bath as aromatherapy. It&#x27;s so stress relieving and it even helped my eczema!</li>
            <li> Solid product, nicely made and packaged.  Great for helping to cut off those pesky cold symptoms and help you breath a little easier</li>
            <li> Happy with quality.  Would recommend and will buy more.  Did not have opportunity to try for mosquito repellent&lt;br /&gt;Would prefer different way to dispense oil.</li>
            <li> Prefer Eden&#x27;s Garden. They have higher quality oil.</li>
            <li> Great product! I put a few drops on my pillows and it worked as \\&quot;aroma therapy\\&quot; beautifully! It can be diluted in water and sprayed around the house in order to create a fresh environment. I also ordered the Lavender oil, I had bought this in Europe a few years ago, but now we have it in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Impressive quality at a good price.  Excellent customer service policies - I did not need to contact the seller, but it&#x27;s nice to know they will take care of any concerns.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Was looking for the purest form I could get for my needs and this was it.</li>
            <li> So, I must say that Plant Therapy has exceeded my expectations. I am used to using doTERRA oils and this is just as good, for a fraction of the cost. I will use Plant Therapy going forward for almost all of my oil needs. :) This eucalyptus smells great, the dropper isn&#x27;t too fast or slow, and the quality has held up as well.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, I use it when I soak in the tub along with epsom salts, it wakes me up and gets me going!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased two fragrances &amp; love them - mix in spray bottle with water. Works great &amp; no chemicals. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love it! Happy with the service!! Delivered as described.... I have encouraged others to try it as it is all they said and more!!</li>
            <li> love the smell of this oil and has many great usage. You can use it for relaxing and burn it. love it and i will order again</li>
            <li> This oil seems to do the trick. It has been great so far. Works well. Not much else to add.</li>
            <li> I wife is into oils, this lavender oil and she likes it, she says its just like the other oils brands she buys from other site.</li>
            <li> It seems to smell as it should. But the lid broke during shipping and about 1 oz leaked in the package. Making a smelly mess and I couldn&#x27;t  reseal it. I did a band aid fix so I wouldn&#x27;t have to throw away the bottle.</li>
            <li> Well packed and perfect size. Delicious eucalyptus scent. Used for papier mache paste. Great smell compared to wet newspapers. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good product. Shipped straight from Plant Therapy and arrived very, very quickly</li>
            <li> A wonderful Eucalyptus scent. Smells wonderful through a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much to make things smell like a spa! (Also use it for my dog&#x27;s collar to repel fleas).</li>
            <li> not totally authentic eucalyptus smell... smells like patchouli-ish also&lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt buy this again if i had the choice however maybe you like the musky eucalyptus smell</li>
            <li> I use this in my difuser and it makes my sinuses feel so much better when I have a sinus infection. It&#x27;s also great in my home made vapor rub.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with this company. Plant Therapy is the only oils I use and they are promptly delivered. Quality product as always!</li>
            <li> High quality essential oil in a user-friendly bottle. Company has a great product selection and I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> To be fair we have never used any other brand of Eucalyptus Oil.  I have been using it in our infants humidifier and in his bath water to combat stuffiness.  It is very strong and you only need a couple of drops to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected.  We used it as a home remedy for tick prevention and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> Invigorating and stimulating, perfect for morning routine or studying. Does not gunk up nebulizer. Will purchase more when this one runs out, so i&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle using ~10 drops a week for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> Love this product I used it to make soap and candles and it smells so good also my husband&#x27;s foot was bothering him so he put some on it and he said that helped a lot!!</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray. It worked great!</li>
            <li> This thing is very weak to be &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; or mine was defective.  The problem is that it  *CANNOT* be returned,i.e.,  &amp;#34;&amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this product line for its quality and cost. I run this in my sons room when he has a cold and he sleeps and breaths just fine. Love the way this smells and makes the room relaxing. Great product line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small but, it has a flow stopper so you don&#x27;t accidentally pour it all out. I think I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Another great essential oil from this company ! Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> My 6 month old had minor seasonal allergies and this helped a her breathe easier at night. I used a small drop in some baby Vicks rub and she didn&#x27;t seem stuffy when I put her down. She didn&#x27;t seem stuffy through the night either. The product arrived on time, sealed and no leaks. I was a bit worried because the bottle is so small. The oil smelled great! I took one whiff and it reminded me of the original Vicks that used to have this in it. This is totally worth it especially for a natural and medication free solution for baby. By the way my pediatrician actually recommended this!</li>
            <li> I absoultely love this product! I put Eucalyptus Essential oil on our family&#x27;s feet when we have allergies &amp; stuffy noses. I really appreciate the fast delivery, since stuffy noses came early this year. I put about 3-4 drops of oil on each foot &amp; massage in. Put the footies on and viola! Breathe easier!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to soothe my baby from the coughing and congestion of a cold he picked up from his older brother. This was just the thing I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops on the bumper in his crib at night. I put a few drops on his feet in his pajamas. I put a few drops wherever it is that he is going to be sitting pretty much. I never put any directly on him besides his feet at night. This stuff works! It clears him out and he is able to breathe. He was having a hard time nursing because he was so congested but this clears it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it isn&#x27;t a cure or anything but does relieve symptoms and alleviates painful coughing.</li>
            <li> I had a sore on my leg and this has worked well to keep it at bay and towards removing the infection all together. It smells great and fresh and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> If you have a congested nose... and hate the stinky vapor... this is THE BEST CHIOCE!!!  I put it on my handkerchief... delicious... feel every breath con in!!!</li>
            <li> Love this. I ordered two so I can have one at home and take on on the go in case my daughter&#x27;s nose get stuffy as she suffers from allergies. It works great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, works great for clearing up stuffed sinuses. The dispenser could be better, but it&#x27;s manageable.  Update: ordered this a second time. Consistently good quality; we are still very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> just the right product i was looking for A+++, I am enjoying the flavor and utility of the product is just the same as it is described in the bottle...i use this on my little kid...its very effective for cold...</li>
            <li> Great for a stuffy nose. It is small but a little but dies go a long way. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong.  I burned a few drops uncut to help with my breathing and sinuses.  It worked great!  I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be very potent and I would be able to cut it with water. It is very weak and does not last. I bought the 6 oz bottle earlier for same price...it was just as potent and 10 times more volume. Do not waste your money on this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not very potent. Aroma disappears after a few moments. Not impressed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone looking for sinus therapy at bed time.</li>
            <li> We love it. My wife uses it to clean hard floors leave a sweet smell in the house for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Oils are good, and very useful. Plant Therapy makes the best! They are not diluted and last a very long time....</li>
            <li> I use this in my diffuser to keep allergies and colds down. Its also great for using in vacuum bag; just add enough to a cotton ball and drop in bag to freshen the rooms while vacuuming. I add in my front of my door way in spring time from ants trying to get in. I since then got my new door, but that is an idea if ants come around.</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil because I am mixing my own cleaning products.  This oil is great and I have used it in a number of cleaning recipes with great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been learning a little bit about essential oils and thought this one would be a good try... looking forward to using it, it was delivered in about a week or less.</li>
            <li> This is the product I was hoping for when I bought a different brand that dissipated quickly. This one is longer lasting and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great smell, super concentrated. I use it in a water and candle style diffusser and it works great, fills the home quick with its wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes after opening the Eucalyptus oil and Peppermint oil, my eyes see more clearly, my sinuses are less stuffy and my brain feels sharper.  All I did was dab some on cotton wipes and set them on the window sill.  Cool.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus is one of my favorite essential oils and I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. I was also excited to find out this company is located in Twin Falls, Idaho! Being from Meridian, Idaho, I am happy to support a local business. I plan to make additional purchases in the future.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. As described. I plan to put a drop or two in the humidifier. Hope that works.</li>
            <li> Seems to be what it claims to be, a high quality essential oil. I bought this to enhance the effectiveness of an All Natural Chemical FREE Flea Spray that I use on my two little monsters, as I affectionally call my two Chihuahua&#x27;s, Bacon and Rascal. I also add it to the Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth, which I use on my carpets and my lawn for flea control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the Pesticide based Flea Control products likeAdvantage, Advantix and Frontline that I used for years on my two now deceased companions were the cause of the Liver Disease in one, and the Cancerous Tumor in the other and the seizures that my Bestest Friends Chihuahua now suffers from. Her Chihuahua was completely healthy. Then she used one of the Pesticide based Flea Control products for three month. Shortly after the third application her little girl began having very bad seizures that her vet said was caused by Liver Disease. From the research that we both did, we discovered that small breeds, Chihuahua&#x27;s being specifically mentioned, are particularily seceptible to side effects of the Pesticide based Flea Control. Pesticides tend to get in the body , never leave, and continue to build upin the organs and tissues and are a significant cause of diseases like cancer and liver disease, and many others. I will never use them again, and I wish that my vet had told me how they worked or what they were made from or anything to warn me of the possible side effects of using them. Instead, my vet touted them as the be-all end-all in Flea Control. I know much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again soon to use again this summer.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this into my mop water, it makes the house smell nice and fresh. I also put it under my nose when congested, and it helps clear my airways.</li>
            <li> It Eucalyptus Oil arrived early. It also seems to work great with the Pennyroyal Oil. The smell not too strong.</li>
            <li> Potent and smells wonderful.  A little goes a long way, which is great!  The packaging is great and it arrived without a leak.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great and helps a lot with my congestion. Received my bottle rather quickly. Very satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> I use this in my humidifier and it makes my house smell amazing and helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> This arrived securely packaged and had a slight aroma as I opened it, creating excitement to smell it full-on; it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Great price for an intense, smaller than expected but just right after I opened it, eucalyptus experience. For a personal spa, I add the oil to steaming water and take a relaxation break, opening up my lungs and my mind.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!!</li>
            <li> Great oil, we used it in our humidifier and it helped clear our sinuses.</li>
            <li> I love the potency of this oil.  Already I have used several drops in a load of Laundry and it truly made a difference.  So many uses for Eucalyptus and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It arrived quite quickly too.[[ASIN:B005V2UHIW Eucalyptus Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> I use this on my sinuses and it helps to relieve congestion. Plus the smell calms me and helps me fall asleep</li>
            <li> This is a very nice oil and truly met my expectations I buy many oils from them and they are all excellent!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for use during cold and flu seasoning.  It is helpful in clearing up sinus congestion.</li>
            <li> Winter is upon us, and this Eucalyptus is going to be a key EO in my diffusers throughout the season to combat those pesky head colds that inevitably come with the season.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment &amp; packaged well.  Boyfriend uses the oils on his clients &amp; making his own essential oils and he likes it.  It smells good too.  No complaints</li>
            <li> This product came as it was advertised and arrived in a timely fashion. Who could ask for anything else. Tea tree is an amazing antiseptic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works great when you use it in your humidifier. It also shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my 6 month old baby had a cold.  I put a few drops on a cloth near his crib and it really helped clear his nose so he could sleep better which, as any parent of a sick child will tell you, is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold :)  Also, it&#x27;s very strong so I only needed to use a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> This a very good product, highly recommend it, I tried on insect bites and is really good, only one application and no more itch, I am very allergic to mosquitoes bites, I live in South Florida where mosquitoes bloom in Summer time, this product smells completely natural, I haven&#x27;t try it for cold or flu, but I believe it could be a good product to relief the symptoms caused by cold or flu, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Allergies - difficulty breathing - sinus infections.  This is not my favorite time of year.  A bit of oil in water to steam sinuses keeps everything moving and not sitting and getting infected.  Simple, yet it works.</li>
            <li> I use this with a mixture of tea tree, and lavendar to make a wonderful smelling all purpose cleaner.  It smells so good and the antibacterial, antiviral properties help me keep my house free of germs!</li>
            <li> Very good oil. Very strong, pleasant smell. Great to add to your humidifier to help clear sinuses.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I bought this for bug bite relief, applied it and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this oil again very soon; we just ran out after a bout of the cold ran through our house. can&#x27;t live without it! so helpful to stick in the vaporizer, rub directly on the feet, take some wiffs of it to clear the nasal passages, etc.</li>
            <li> Smells just like it says - eucalyptus and such. Makes a great mix with anything in the bath. Haven&#x27;t really found much use for it aside from that.</li>
            <li> High quality, great smelling Eucalyptus oil. I have it on hand for allergy, cold, and flu seasons because it is so good for clearing congestion.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a Eucalyptus bubble bath that doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I would like, so I add this oil to it and it works great.  She has eczema, and it doesn&#x27;t bother her skin at all.</li>
            <li> I got this and the Peppermint. I use them to steam my sinus. Combined with herbs it helps clear my nasal passages, and hopefully helps to stop infections. Eucalyptus has anti-infective properties, I think I read.</li>
            <li> Good price and so useful around the house.  Also helpful when congested!  Very glad I purchased to add to my oils collection</li>
            <li> I dropped this into a bowl of warm water to help with my congested nose and it cleared up in no time!</li>
            <li> This product is 100% pure all right - 100%  rip-off! You can buy 16 oz. (1 pint) of 100% Eucalyptus Oil for $16.99 from another vendor on the web. This vendor only gives you 1/3 of an oz. for $6.00. Just do a search of Eucalyptus Oil and you&#x27;ll find it. Eucalyptus Oil is great but not at this price. I do not recommend this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MusicMan</li>
            <li> not as strong as I had expected.  The smell does not fill up the room when I use in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Bad Eucalyptus!  Stinks and smells like the bottom of the barrel Eucalyptus! The lid was also broken when I received, like it had been used prior.</li>
            <li> I use this in an evaporator in my office.  It not only smells nice, but it helps me breath better.  Also discourages flies.  This product is exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what i expected haven&#x27;t used it yet but im sure it will work just fine would buy more when needed</li>
            <li> Very nice, crisp clean Eucalyptus sent just as advertised.  I have been using this with all my homemade cleaning products and it leaves a lovely, clean scent for the day.</li>
            <li> I put the oil in my Vicks vaporizer. Unfortunately, the vaporizer does not diffuse the oils all that well as it should. However, that&#x27;s not a slight on the product. The product has a nice smell. As far as any health benefits such as opening up nasal passages, I cannot comment. I probably would get this product again and others from this company.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and was shipped very quickly! Free shipping too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help when my family had a cold and it was amazing. I love it. It is perfect for using in the Vicks machine.</li>
            <li> Whew! This will clear your sinus. I enjoy having this available before a serious sinus headache sets in. Clears the airways enough that many times I have avoided the sick sinus headache.  Just sniff from the bottle or placed on a tissue or cottonball to keep with you.</li>
            <li> I like to tip a few drops into my shower or bath, and let the steam relieve me of all my winter ailments. It&#x27;s great for stuffy noses and sore muscles.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is just as described.  I have used it in my humidifer as well as used it directly on my skin and I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> sniff it, drop it in your tea or humidifier... You will love the smell and its effect in your nasal. Guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Im new to oils but this has worked well for me as a vaporizing eucalyptus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five more words required here</li>
            <li> Breathe restfully  with this product in Humidifier. relieve stuffiness~~w/ saline rinse. I am reordering to continue a restful sleep during high pollen and mole season.</li>
            <li> We bought this together with an air humidifier and the smell it releases in the room is relaxing and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Developed allergies this year. Never had them before. A dab of this under the nostrils once a day and I don&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> A GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR OIL TO BURN IN A BURNER.  GREAT SCENT TO HAVE IF YOU SUFFER FROM  COLDS OR  THE FLU.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with pregnancy headaches.  I use a few drops of it in the shower, and I rub some on my temples when I feel a headache coming on.  A little goes a long way! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product. so glad I found this product on Amazon.  The quailty of the oil is excellent. I ordered several different oils and will definitely be ordering some of the others as well!</li>
            <li> This was a great investment.This product has a strong smell and it does the job very well.I would purchase this again in the future because it works.</li>
            <li> The stuff is awesome - great for headaches too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I use a couple of drops in my tub when I have a bad cold or aches.  A drop on a cotton ball pad in my hand-held steamer works wonderfully too.  I personally think that the essence of eucalyptus is spa-like.  I really love it.  And this particular brand is THE BEST I have ever tried or smelled.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it is even better than Whole Foods eucalyptus.  I only ordered one to try.  I will definitely order more.  Packing and shipping were good and fast.</li>
            <li> It smells good. You can put it on things. Anything you put it on will also smell good. The bottle is the perfect size - It&#x27;s enough oil to lightly coat every surface inside a small to medium sized house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Put it on stuff it will smell good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Some people will get angry if you put it on too many things.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love the smell and it is so soothing.Great for my yoga practice.  I would purchase more.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in the shower, vaporizer or a pan of water on the stove during the winter. Will help your alleviate some sinus pressure and congestion! A little bit goes a long way!</li>
