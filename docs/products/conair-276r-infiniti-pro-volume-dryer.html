            <li>One of the best dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li>in all, I believe that Conair is the best name in portable hair dryers, and the 276R Infiniti is one of the best Conair models I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The motor on it doesn&#x27;t screech, which is wonderful.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Dryer is great however and works fine.</li>
            <li>Words cannot express how amazing this Volume dryer is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a removable filter  which is a great idea, an \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology for smooth, frizz-free, static-free results\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>And it creates amazing lift at the crown.</li>
            <li>Trust me, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The accessories are nice if you use them</li>
            <li>Will be using this puppy a good many times.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a medium power setting as well though.</li>
            <li>I went to visit a girlfriend over the weekend and forgot my own blowdryer...</li>
            <li>It has two attachments to help your styling needs, which is nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Planning on many good hair days.  </li>
            <li>FRIZZ - adds nice volume to crown.  </li>
            <li>The heat setting are &amp;#34;hot, warm, cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooler than the warm air setting, but not truly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The heat setting are &amp;#34;hot, warm, cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooler than the warm air setting, but not truly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>though - websites claimed that ceramic was the best for volume and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because of the good reviews and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it folded up.</li>
            <li>the color is nice, the volumizer attachment is nice, and it&#x27;s a Conair--good brand.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and honestly I saw a difference in her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer, it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li>The color is nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice balance and the switches stay where positioned.  </li>
            <li>Comes with two nice attachments, a Volumizer and a Concentrator.</li>
            <li>This dryer has a nice 4 year guarantee.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the power is good.  </li>
            <li>She could go buy her own dryer anywhere at any time, but she specifically asked for a repeat on this one.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it when I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I was never motivated to buy my own and get stuck with that burden.</li>
            <li>The dryer works great, the temperature adjusts are very useful.  </li>
            <li>This is a great blow dryer that is really powerful without damaging or drying out my hair!</li>
            <li>Cool air works great for setting my hair before I turn the dryer off.  </li>
            <li>Cool air works great for setting my hair before I turn the dryer off.  </li>
            <li>The Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Boost Hair Dryer is a good dryer with some features, most notably the volume boost attachment.  </li>
            <li>love it, it is a wonderful product would recommend it to every one who wants this product to get buying</li>
            <li>very easy to switch the attachments from the Ionizer to the concentrated Blower attachement.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are very easy to take on and off and when you attach them, they snap into place and won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>Very easy on the hair.</li>
            <li>First off, this dryer is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Happens to be my favorite color, so I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best blowdryer that I have ever used and purchased!!!</li>
            <li>The best so far that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect balance for a hairdryer that feels and performs like a professional one.</li>
            <li>Bought it together with BC178 and both of the 2 are satisfying and amazing</li>
            <li>It is good for being so cheap.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My hubby has always liked my hair better curly</li>
            <li>and then the volumnizor, which is the attachment I use because of my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It also dries hair very quickly!</li>
            <li>I have to add that I have very fine hair, shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is longer than my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for daily-use hair dryer, I strongly recommend this one, fully functional!</li>
            <li>...somethings never change lol ;)</li>
            <li>This is my first really great hair dryer in years.  </li>
            <li>After styling, my hair feels very smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice length cord which makes styling easy.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment easily snaps on and off using buttons which is a nice perk as they can sometimes be a pain to put on and remove otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a great hair dryer for fast drying, no frizz, and no damage to my very fine, permed hair.  </li>
            <li>Also very light and many settings for adjusting heat level.</li>
            <li>So far a very good hair dryer, but I have not found a use for the extending part for volume.  </li>
            <li>This is a top of the line hair dryer with everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this choice of all the hair dryer&#x27;s that are out there.</li>
            <li>However, it worked better for family members.</li>
            <li>Curls are so much more defined</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>OK, all hair driers probably have that...</li>
            <li>I love the ionizing attachment that runs thru my hair like a comb drying and fluffing it from the roots outwards.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with it and it does a lovely job.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments on my hair from strangers...</li>
            <li>The amazon price is much better than the one I got</li>
            <li>and I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The loop at the end of the dryer handle allows you the option of safely hanging up the dryer without risk of it dropping to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And in all the time I&#x27;ve been using them, the brand I have come to trust most is Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Solution for me was to buy a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying one again.y a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  </li>
            <li>I love the dryer.  </li>
            <li>hairdryer has so many features, it must be \\&quot;the Lady Gaga of hairdryers!\\</li>
            <li>I want a more bouffant look with \\&quot;volume, volume, volume,\\</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love the pick attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, has a nice variety of heat and speed settings, and hangs on a hook.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This one is just a better version of what I had before.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with this hair dryer</li>
            <li>The quality of the item for the price you pay is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>love having heat and speed settings separate.  </li>
            <li>I love having heat and speed settings separate.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Conair Infiniti Pro Dryer 4x now and each time my hair looks better and better, as I am getting more skilled at using it.  </li>
            <li>I am not the type to leave comments or feedback, but I had to inform anyone who is in search of a excellent styling tool to LOOK NO FURTHER</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love that it has adjustable heat/power settings, so it keeps me from having to fry or blast my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer, the diffuser and wing tip piece snap into place so they never fall off while using.  </li>
            <li>Oh one more thing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price either! :)</li>
            <li>It needed to lock in place since many of them fall off.</li>
            <li>After awhile, I believe most hair dryers need replacing.</li>
            <li>This one lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li>Not all hair dryers do this, but this one sure did.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Also the longer prongs help lift the hair better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be okay intact.</li>
            <li>I do love the speed and temperature options</li>
            <li>I love that the attachments snap on.</li>
            <li>My hair looked luxuriously healthy and not at all crispy.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer..</li>
            <li>This product does not give more volume than most hairdryers.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a diffuser for curly haired folks but love love love it for the volume it provides at the roots.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The plastic lip keeps the fly-aways form flying away and creating more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This gives my curly hair better volume and a more polished look.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not too sure what to do with them or how to use them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the attachments, truthfully I couldn&#x27;t figure out how (I don&#x27;t know if that is saying something about me or the dryer)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my wife and box banged up was ok.  </li>
            <li>Its so much better than what I was used</li>
            <li>I love Conair and they prove again they are the leader in hair appliances.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed ok.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>and I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>my hair always looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I love Conair products, so I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I promptly purchased it and have never owned a better hair drying system.</li>
            <li>Gives more volume to my permed hair</li>
            <li>and I love the attachment.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if the dryer was lighter.</li>
            <li>amazing, very powerful</li>
            <li>is another great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I loved this blow dryer at first.</li>
            <li>volumizing attachment works pretty good, but is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li>find that the temperature settings are good - not scorching hot.  </li>
            <li>She was excited to get it!</li>
            <li>and I wanted a new one in case the spare (which works great) is no longer operable at some point.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Most hairdryers the attachments just click in place but can fall off easily, this one does not.</li>
            <li>power on this hair dryer is amazing and quick.  </li>
            <li>I love it with the diffuser - it is easy to maneuver and gives my hair a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>Quick, easy to use, and my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li>very nice and unique feature I found was the removable filter, which can be a real safety issue for fire hazard.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, this attachment is incredible.</li>
            <li>My curls come out perfect every time, with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really happy with this.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>but this is a good hair dryer for those with naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>She loved how much smoother and shinier it made her hair.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is very bulky and between that and the humongous diffuser I struggle to find a good way to store this when not in use.</li>
            <li>Conair really did a good job designing this dryer.</li>
            <li>I bought this styling tool after hours of searching the internet for the best hair dryer and looked at endless reviews.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a Conair with heat AND good air flow!  </li>
            <li>And it has a cool name: Infiniti!</li>
            <li>Imagine, it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll leave the original material below, but include this update, which might bump this to 5-stars if you consider re-purchase a meaningful indicator of perceived quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and services are excellent  than the other products that&#x27;s the reason i choose this one.</li>
            <li>I love the big attachment, it is great for separating out my hair while drying, speeding up the process.  </li>
            <li>It has a sleek design and fits easily into my suitcase for easy portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so, I was not quite ready for the exceptional quality of the 276R Infiniti Pro-Volume Dryer.  </li>
            <li>The speed and temperature are easily changed while using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use the controls while holding the dryer, too.  </li>
            <li>and it was easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Accessories come a bit to easily, but they work.  </li>
            <li>The settings are easy to use, the attachment are easy to apply and remove with the two buttons on either side of the device.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than what I&#x27;m used to and the teeth for the volumizer don&#x27;t pick up hair that easy</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can take the filter off and clean.  </li>
            <li>this makes it look fuller and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is lightweight and easy to handle, and has three heat settings along with three blower options.  </li>
            <li>It provides a strong air flow to help keep the curls and waves to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Wanted a strong blowdryer --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong it ties my hair in knots.</li>
            <li>The high heat is nice and hot and the cool shot works great too.  </li>
            <li>Good hair dryer but VERY loud!</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser and the price is right!</li>
            <li>In other words, get a precision cut and use this Conair \\&quot;infinitipro\\&quot; precisely for hair that looks glamorous and sets your face off to its best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent choice for personal  use, and perhaps good for simple tasks at salons.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and controls are easy to use and switch between during use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is reasonably light, and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>The attachments snap on easily and feel secure.  </li>
            <li>, it works fine.</li>
            <li>This one has really strong power and has a nice quiet sound, not too bulky, fits nice in your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slso light weight so that it won&#x27;t feel like your working out with dumbells</li>
            <li>enjoy styling with mine</li>
            <li>importantly, however, is the power.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, basic hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fabulous.</li>
            <li>&quot;  Sure, she is smaller, but when she tried this one beside the one I got her for Christmas a year ago, also made by Conair, she liked that one better because it was lighter and easier for her to</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with how it performs</li>
            <li>It makes blow drying your hair faster and leaves hair feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this a few months ago and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light weight without the attachment and still light with it on.</li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t believe what a great buy this is.</li>
            <li>If anyone needs a free blow dryer, hit me up for my address...</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And my curls are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the description claims it is light weight and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>Best part is, I didn&#x27;t have to use a round brush,or any brush for that matter.</li>
            <li>Which I will when I want a smooth, polished look.</li>
            <li>I have had the travel version for probably 2 years now and it is fantastic</li>
            <li>I tried using the attachment and couldn&#x27;t decide if I liked it better with or without, so I&#x27;ll have to experiment more with that later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good with this dryer, but I will update if any issues arise.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t to loud either when I am holding it up to my head, which is good.</li>
            <li>Really gives great volume without much effort.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and light.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly on the medium and hot settings and leaves it nice and curly.</li>
            <li>my own and my wife&#x27;s experience with this hair dryer, we&#x27;ve found that the design and the performance is what sets this apart from other good mid-range hair dryers ($30 - $50).</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product that Conair has obviously invested a lot of design technology</li>
            <li>Very powerful &amp; not too noisy.</li>
            <li>(Of course I&#x27;ll need to use the flat iron for 1 min of baby hair fly</li>
            <li>I have spent some real money on dryers but this one stands strong with all its the best one I have ever owned</li>
            <li>Now I apply Biolage Gelee and Rusk Mud and pop on the diffuser and in abt 5 minutes my hair is beautiful natural curl and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I use high speed warm heat.  </li>
            <li>I use high speed warm heat.  </li>
            <li>Granted, it does not get as hot, but my hair feels better for it.  </li>
            <li>TOTALLY worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, within two minutes of using the dryer and attachment on freshly washed damp hair I was blown away (not literally!)</li>
            <li>However, considering the savings in time, it&#x27;s worth building your biceps for volumized, va-voom hair!</li>
            <li>,it is really unique indeed.</li>
            <li>But I like this hairdryer and it seems pretty durable :)</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length hair that is not thin, but it&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a little over 2 years, and it still works great :)</li>
            <li>I use the warm setting on low and its perfect - doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other dryers have.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price with such great looks and performance.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy that this hair dryer dries my hair really quickly.</li>
            <li>I can dry my curly hair in five minutes and it looks great all day.  </li>
            <li>Also the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; attachment is great to dry underneath your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful and dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So, for me, there&#x27;s nothing special about this, and I&#x27;d opt for something simpler, lighter and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box!  </li>
            <li>So many to choose to from, but this is what I was looking for, 1875 watts of fast drying performance that uses ionic ceramic technology which gives you frizz-free hair.</li>
            <li>every full size dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; a full spectrum infrared heat that works on molecules inside the hair shaft, drying it inside and out to minimize heat damage.</li>
            <li>I really liked the old one</li>
            <li>Loved the different heat settings as well -</li>
            <li>The cool setting and the diffuser works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it is any better at adding curl, but certainly is no worse.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cool purple color.</li>
            <li>Overall really good dryer.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a good unit.</li>
            <li>I ordered this dryer based on good reviews, and the idea that finally a dryer was specifically designed for those of us with curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the volumizing attachment - it really works.  </li>
            <li>I also like the cool shot button that sets my hair once it dries.  </li>
            <li>I am an amateur when it comes to blow dryers and honestly I had no idea what to look for except for something with good reviews.</li>
            <li>I really wish this worked better on my fine naturally curly hair, but I believe it is more for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>While the volumnizing pic takes a little practice to get used to, it does a great job adding body to my fine hair and without frizz.  </li>
            <li>Still, it works fine and doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around, making nicely defined waves possible.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and this blow dryer does a great job.</li>
            <li>It has a removable filter on the end for quick cleaning of lint and hair which helps&lt;br /&gt;extend</li>
            <li>My old blow dryer went straight to good will.</li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment works better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried and gives me soft, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>It tames my frizzy hair and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for personal use if you&#x27;re looking for some extra \\&quot;oomph,\\&quot; as well as the option to keep your curls and preserve silky hair with the ceramic attachment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a very well designed hair dryer that offers reliable and good performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: AFTER LIGHT USE SINCE THE DRYER WAS FIRST REVIEWED, THE MOTOR BURNED OUT IN APRIL 2013.</li>
            <li>former hairdryer is also a Conair that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with for years.</li>
            <li>I noticed a screeching sound upon first turning it on</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; are pretty smooth and long, which is good for grabbing and volumizing longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, powerful little dryer, comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful &amp; dries hair fast!</li>
            <li>the diffuser locks in place, which is very cool because most diffusers snap on and my last one would continually fall off when I used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way it does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to put on and take off, but I haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li>It works really well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, but isn&#x27;t the super fast drying dryer I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair but not the pretty kind.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference between &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;warm&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have only had the hair dryer for a week, but I love it!</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t like the first hair dryer I got her, but loves this one!</li>
            <li>So, finally a hair dryer to love!</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair</li>
            <li>Pretty sure all the stuff I wrote before is still true, but now taken with the grain of salt that whatever it&#x27;s minor shortcomings, my wife is more willing to live with them than she is to take a chance of finding something better...</li>
            <li>The outside filter turns right off, and the coatings on both filters allow them to wipe clean very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very efficient and the diffuser won&#x27;t ever fall off during its use as it is securely attached unlike others.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is too powerful.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I would use a diffuser to get a nice spirally curl.</li>
            <li>Also she says the clear sheld is more in the way than it is useful.  </li>
            <li>Because I am very picky about how my hair looks, I once actually tossed away a perfectly good dryer because I didn&#x27;t like the way it styled my hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is definitely powerful, which is a must for me, and a bit noisy.  </li>
            <li>smaller than the one I currently own, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I had one for years that I liked well enough, but it had a weaker motor</li>
            <li>: Hair pulling issue with the &amp;#34;Volumizing tool&amp;#34;; cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really shoot cool air.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair pulling issue with the &amp;#34;Volumizing tool&amp;#34;; cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really shoot cool air.  </li>
            <li>One nice feature my last dryer had</li>
            <li>No more frizz, my curls are bouncy and full of body, and it even has a great tool for straightening your hair,  </li>
            <li>The dryer does work better compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>My Mom, who has short hair, said she&#x27;d take it and if she liked it, would buy it from me.</li>
            <li>I use this dryer on the lowest setting, it is that powerful.  </li>
            <li>However, I am going to keep it because I feel the drier is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>it worth 39.99?</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>,it doesn&#x27;t worth a penny at all.</li>
            <li>And I love the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting when I&#x27;m drying my 2 yr old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>I really liked it while it worked, and it was only $20</li>
            <li>I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have to say I rarely did this</li>
            <li>It has multiple setting, and the attachments come in handy.</li>
            <li>but I could rarely wear it that way.</li>
            <li>An pitfall to a better motor, and one I&#x27;m willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer is very useful with the diffuser on, but I found it to blow my hair around too much without it on.  </li>
            <li>It is also nice to have the cool setting to &#x27;set&#x27; my curls after they are mostly dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair and this is the first hairdryer I&#x27;ve used that can handle styling it either curly or straight.</li>
            <li>Most people will find the low setting to be strong enough to suit most hair drying needs.  </li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>I would say this is probably one of the nicest dryers out there right now</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re supposed to put it right up onto your head as seen in the video.  </li>
            <li>love the cool shot feature, which is used by holding the blue trigger button in.</li>
            <li>I had to get a different hair dryer which is NOT as good but has the normal style of diffuser.  </li>
            <li>There is a big difference between the hot and the warm air programs, so sometimes you need to mix.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very clear in the product info that this diffuser head you see in the picture does easily come off.  </li>
            <li>My current hair dryer that I have owned for many years still works, but I wanted a diffuser to see if I could give my straight, fine hair some umph.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, easy to maneuver  and quieter than my last one.</li>
            <li>It has three heat settings-Hot, Warm, Cool and two levels of High and Low.</li>
            <li>For fun the first time I used it I pushed my hair up...</li>
            <li>My hair turns out really curly and full.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer and a paddly brush and my hair is straight and full.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the added weight DOES equate to quality and better performance.  </li>
            <li>i MAYBE could have figured out how to make this unit work better for me, but it would have been more trouble than I felt it was worth.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot belive that I have been using this dryer for as long as I have.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and curly with even some parts kind of straight, very multi-textured.</li>
            <li>The fancy attachment doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine straight hair</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple heat and speed settings are great for my very fine frizz-prone hair and the cold shot is great for when I&#x27;m starting to get too hot and need a cool blast.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to change up my routine and start using it more in the near future, so if I learn anything significant in the process I will update my review!</li>
            <li>but I want it dried NOW and the 2 different speed settings were awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have found that ionic/ceramic technology is a great method for drying my hair faster while using less heat, particularly if the dryer has a stronger motor.  </li>
            <li>The volume dryer straightens my hair a whole lot better than these salons near my house that charge $50 $60.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer thinking it would be good quality and it died in less than a year.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my new Conair Infiniti Pro hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Cool button easy to reach and dryer doesn&#x27;t cause frizz, so definitely buy it if everyone is awake by the time of day you use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just turn the heat setting to cool and cool all the hair down from the roots before turning the dryer off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just turn the heat setting to cool and cool all the hair down from the roots before turning the dryer off.  </li>
            <li>It is also very gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li>I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>For reference - I have fine hair with natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on the various blow dryers available on Amazon before I chose this one, and of course price was a significant factor in my decision.</li>
            <li>Right away they liked the design and color of it, and also thought that it was a tad quieter than other hairdryers they have used.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a non-Chi blow-dryer at home - when traveling, I am stuck with those cheap hotel blow dryers but anyway - and the Conair surprised me.</li>
            <li>But even with a shorter brown mop on top, I can see that this thing actually works!</li>
            <li>I love the deep metallic purple color.</li>
            <li>The concentrator works great with a styling brush for a long lasting style.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to it, I now have again what I thought I&#x27;d lost forever: no tangles!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews at Amazon.com before I made the purchase, which made me aware of some cons of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that the filter got a bit hot</li>
            <li>The heating element was still working, but the fan was not, so it would get EXTREMELY hot and smell like it was burning.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>- exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Great lift for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The girls in the videos all had big bouncy supermodel hair, reviewers were proclaiming love.</li>
            <li>I love all the different heat and speed settings as well.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the difference the first time I used this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough--not even on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I plugged this in to use it, it started sputtering, lost power and started to smell.  </li>
            <li>and when i use this blow dryer I first wash my hair then throw my hair up in a bun with out towel drying it then</li>
            <li>Medium heat is exactly that.  </li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s all real!</li>
            <li>and already my coworkers are commenting about how  shiny and pretty my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best for big people with big hair and really big bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Box was pretty banged up.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy 5 more to last a lifetime!</li>
            <li>it gets hot and blows.  </li>
            <li>and I love the two extra attachments.  </li>
            <li>first off it didn&#x27;t come with the attachments that were stated in the description.  </li>
            <li>it has 2 different casings, so I could make more hair</li>
            <li>but this product is stellar and</li>
            <li>goes pretty hot though.</li>
            <li>Even when I used a lower setting it still did not give me the smooth sleek hair that my old hair dryer achieved.  </li>
            <li>so its kind of difficult to find things that work and was very pleased that this did</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I first purchased just the diffuser portion of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer exactly once since I purchased it in April</li>
            <li>And the color of this appliance is pretty too.</li>
            <li>This dryer is also not too terribly heavy, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Generally my hair is nice and smooth once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>My mom and I now share it and she loves using it to blow dry her hair straight, she says she almost doesn&#x27;t have to flat iron her hair, its just that good!</li>
            <li>When I saw this hair dryer offered, I recalled how much I once loved the detangling aspect of a previous dryer with volumizing attachment and knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>If I leave my hair hot, it goes flat and starts to lose it&#x27;s style before it cools off, wasting my precious time and effort.</li>
            <li>If I leave my hair hot, it goes flat and starts to lose it&#x27;s style before it cools off, wasting my precious time and effort.</li>
            <li>but this does diffuse nicely with very minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>Because the hair dryyer was so quick, i was able to actually give myself a complete blow out.  </li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly, so I occasionally use the diffuser on my own hair.  </li>
            <li>The volumizing tines made me feel as if I had a talented stylist drying my hair rather than my usual approach of giving up and allowing the dryer to blow my hair helter-skelter in a hot gust.</li>
            <li>but overall I was pleased with how gentle the air flow was with the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>Delivers consistent heat and smart accessories.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality dryer, easily comparable to the dryers that professional hair stylists use.  </li>
            <li>When I want to blow-dry it straight, the concentrator plus the high power of the highest speed setting blow it out quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li>Ok.. first off this hairdryer is quieter and way more powerful (fan wise.. not heat wise), this is due to the fact that the fan motor is  AC, not the usual DC motors that are usually in dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has enough settings to get your desired style - Hot, warm and cool for heat and low &amp; high power flow.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has a ton of settings, I really like the color as well.  </li>
            <li>I can only speak to my fine hair that is partly straight and partly curly (a maddening hair type!).</li>
            <li>I can only speak to my fine hair that is partly straight and partly curly (a maddening hair type!).</li>
            <li>Love the low, med, high.</li>
            <li>As far as drying ability goes, I use it on medium heat and speed and it seems to work quickly.</li>
            <li>trial was easy because my salt &amp; pepper hair is kept fairly short,</li>
            <li>It dries my hair pretty fast and give my curls so much volume.</li>
            <li>It did not have a strong enough blower with the attachment</li>
            <li>I had large areas of breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li>It also has a concentrator attachment to pinpoint airflow to a certain spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hairdryer looks well made and it certainly has a feel of quality to it.</li>
            <li>So people with fine, delicate hair like mine can put it on a very light setting and not feel like I&#x27;m singing my hair or face.</li>
            <li>She is still getting used to it, but is simple, easy to use and really tightens her curls after her showers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my hair will appreciate not being overheated, but it takes soo much longer to dry my hair than it used to.  </li>
            <li>This dryer only made my hair more frizzy and it was deafeningly loud!</li>
            <li>Even without the concentrator attachment the air feels pretty well contained for drying one particular area (like my bangs).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also get decent body at first but within 30 min it seems like that body just drops on me.</li>
            <li>Blows a large volume of hot air on high heat.  </li>
            <li>My wife saw this in a store last week for $49.99, luckily i was right there and did an amazon search and saw it under $30...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer ;-))</li>
            <li>I was able to wear it natural with only adding a few curls on the top to even the pattern, not create volume - the hair dryer did that!  </li>
            <li>The mid-level heat is the same temperature as hot on my old dryer, and high heat is even better.  </li>
            <li>The handle, the feel of the dryer is fluid, comfortable, and very intuitive.</li>
            <li>so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer worked very well.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use as much heat.</li>
            <li>So it was really for my health, not beauty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very well made.</li>
            <li>It really drys to the scalp and gives lots of lift and volume.  </li>
            <li>But this dryer blows with too much force.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it will make my hair snarly while I am blow drying it straight with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much simpler version of this one -- it doesn&#x27;t have the volumizing pik</li>
            <li>so I will have another ready.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m almost ready, I just have to put my makeup on....\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but I do really like it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m waking up the whole neighborhood when I turn it</li>
            <li>It drys my curls so fast and NO</li>
            <li>The weight is reasonable considering the power and features so if you have to hold it for a longer time than I do, my hope is that you find this one easier than some of the comparable dryers that are much heavier and bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dropped it on the floor and noticed it wasn&#x27;t drying as fast, so I went out and bought another.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>loves this, dries curly hair fast</li>
            <li>The drier works very well.</li>
            <li>I was ready to spend about $70 and found this one.</li>
            <li>I can massage my scalp with it while drying my hair and even style it by gently pulling my hair in the direction</li>
            <li>The attachment really does help to make your hair fuller and thicker looking.</li>
            <li>Not so much with the accessories.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute piece of genius.</li>
            <li>It is a two-in-one styling tool and hair dryer, volume boost, fast and frizz-free styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our daughter is very picky about what she will and won&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the defuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>It does all the things a blow dryer does and much more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the add-ons</li>
            <li>There isnt much i can say as im not</li>
            <li>(I went straight to</li>
            <li>With the attachment, it really does enhance the look of my hair.</li>
            <li>Very well-made dryer and works well too.  </li>
            <li>I has all the features I wanted, works very well and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>The attachments work really well.</li>
            <li>I had a feeling the diffuser would work really well, so I went on a mission to find the hairdryer that went with it.</li>
            <li>I watched the video and for once it works like they say ... really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She likes this model as far as quality goes, and she likes the various settings and attachments, but she still likes the lighter one better for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Solidly built and low price - recommended as an effective hair solution.</li>
            <li>I am so glad now, that my old hair dryer finally quit and I bought this one-</li>
            <li>Nice dryer with a heavy feel.  </li>
            <li>They like the attachment which combs hair as it dries which they felt made their hair  more controllable and certainly not as</li>
            <li>Power is large, dry hair quickly, fly in the ointment is the sound a little bit big</li>
            <li>Gets hot very soon,dries your hair and makes very loud noise.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old hair dryer with this one and made the right choice.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is great and is really fast,  I have long hair to the middle of my back</li>
            <li>Would be great if it didn&#x27;t have that ridiculous clear plastic &#x27;shield&#x27; over the prongs.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to be powerful and dry quickly, however based on the product description I had anticipated that it would have a quieter operation.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser for volume, and other head for straightening.</li>
            <li>Love the 3 settings for cold, warm and hot, and the 3 speeds.</li>
            <li>From what I could tell, the diffuser produced a gentle and consistent breeze of warm air instead of the column of forced air it generates without it.  </li>
            <li>From what I could tell, the diffuser produced a gentle and consistent breeze of warm air instead of the column of forced air it generates without it.  </li>
            <li>Very good for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li>However, the blue &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t shoot out cool air very well.  </li>
            <li>However, the blue &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t shoot out cool air very well.  </li>
            <li>It dries my very porous (usually long drying) hair super fast!</li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews, I see that most people like the extra power and special features of this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The dryer does a decent job smoothing hair, but if you have frizzy hair, like me, you will still need to use your flat iron to smooth away the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast drying, high powered...</li>
            <li>Low heat, low speed is great for curls and waves because it gets your hair dry without pulling out your curls (which causes frizz!).</li>
            <li>Able to thoroughly dry my natural hair and keep the curls.</li>
            <li>However, if I still had my long hair, this blows my hair out so smoothly that I think I could get away with just drying</li>
            <li>The lower setting works fine, but who has the time to dry their hair on the lower setting?</li>
            <li>Not overly hot like my old school dryer.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is pretty loud.</li>
            <li>Most products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>Better than blow drying upside down.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it faster or better than average full-sized dryers, and it is considerably heavier and more complicated, with a price that is higher than most (although not in the high-end bracket).</li>
            <li>It is also nice to use on your face for a few seconds to cool down if you&#x27;re getting hot while blow</li>
            <li>It is in the ballpark of other dryers, but I think the AC motor really pushes this model near the top of the pack to consider.</li>
            <li>This device has brought my beauty regimen to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>I am using it with the pick attachment (new to me) and it really does make a difference with hair volume.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s more than what I had with my previous blow-dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although most people believe that all blow-dryers are essentially the same, they are not.  </li>
            <li>The volumizing pick attachment seems to work good even though I&#x27;ve only used a few times.</li>
            <li>I had a older conair that was hotter than this one.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have would be that the ends of the root-drying / volumizing attachment don&#x27;t feel great on your head</li>
            <li>; (diffuser) is decent and I use it sometimes, but it has an issue.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it on the low heat, low air setting but in a pinch it turns into a high-volume dryer and the styling attachments give lift to my thinning hair as well.</li>
            <li>also may want to consider the older model of the infiniti pro:</li>
            <li>This is a fairly decent blowdryer for the price.</li>
            <li>and maybe it looks decent.</li>
            <li>I went to a high end clothing store to get some pants I needed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this dryer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also, when used on high it looks like I have wind whipped hair.</li>
            <li>This one performs like High end Salons use.</li>
            <li>high speed)--it sounded like metal on metal.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty excited that she was ready a little faster...</li>
            <li>so glad i could still find this on amazon since i blow dry my hair straight daily.</li>
            <li>The cool shot is nice because I can use that for a few short minutes and cool my head down and get rid of that dampness and set in my style.</li>
            <li>With so many hairdryers out in the market right now, it is difficult to decide between so many different models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked for several weeks and purchased this dryer because the old Conair which was 7 years old was slowing down, this new one has more power, drys hair super fast and doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I would say is that it is heavier than most dryers, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have fine medium long hair, and it is naturally curly and wavy.</li>
            <li>Finally I realized my hair dryer was getting so hot on the front that the hair was literally singeing off in large areas, and even looked like the hair was being sucked into the heating elements.</li>
            <li>It seems to get the job done but wish someone had warned me in a review how loud it really is</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, but I can blow it out straight.  </li>
            <li>Dried my hair using this lovely thing this morning.</li>
            <li>That attachment seems to come standard with pretty much</li>
            <li>and my hair looks a lot better than air dried.</li>
            <li>she says it took 15 mins off her normal drying time.</li>
            <li>Most hair dryers suck my hair into the motor, which is why I have had my current one for so long, because it doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, but 8 oz more than the cheaper DC models.  </li>
            <li>5 stars if they would design the accessories to stay on a bit more firmly.</li>
            <li>so I love that I can get out the door those few minutes faster.</li>
            <li>So, I found it good, but not great.</li>
            <li>My hair ended up softer and more manageable than I thought it would, especially since blow drying is supposed to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair which requires the magic of a hair dryer to make it smooth with touch-up by a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I changed right back to this one.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that generates a cloud of negative ions that can neutralize the generally positive charge of flyaway hair, eliminate static electricity and contribute to shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a medical condition, my once silky, baby fine, long locks had become a thinning, tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quieter than many hair dryers, it&#x27;s small and light yet and dries faster than conventional hair dryers--about as fast as my ceramic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It makes a fairly high pitched sound--too high for my sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li>and once you do, the teeth pull at your locks when you bring the dryer out of your hair to go to a new section.  </li>
            <li>but I think I like this new design because it focuses the heat and therefore works faster.</li>
            <li>I will have to buy a new dryer for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m retiring the fairly new dryer for fear</li>
            <li>So now I have a basically brand new dryer in my drawer that isn&#x27;t being used...</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny, not burned, not frizzy, It is fairly quiet as blow dryers go, definitely powerful, and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>The weight is reasonable considering the power and features so if you have to hold it for a longer time than I do, my hope is that you find this one easier than some of the comparable dryers that are much heavier and bigger.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Wow, love this dryer, it takes half the time my old dryer took.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not using the diffuser attachment and need to dry my hair quickly to put it up for work</li>
            <li>It also has 2 lower settings if I&#x27;m just doing a quick dry.  </li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Ok, so let me just say I am not one to get excited about blow dryers, since I have naturally curly hair and usually air dry.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried straightening my hair yet with the new dryer, but for my naturally curly hair nothing beats this!</li>
            <li>It is incredibly loud and so high pitched</li>
            <li>The long fingers on the diffuser are amazing because they let you dry your hair without drying it out as much and you aren&#x27;t blowing hot hair directly on your scalp like with other diffusers I have used.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!</li>
            <li>I have been using a blow-dryer type hair dryer since the early 1970&#x27;s, since I pretty much have always worn my hair fairly long, in a style that I feel flatters my face.  </li>
            <li>: Hair look and health; price (very competitive!); separate heat/speed settings; size; overall quality;</li>
            <li>price (very competitive!); separate heat/speed settings; size; overall quality; warranty.  </li>
            <li>Oddly enough, neither my nor my wife&#x27;s hair feels burned or hot.</li>
            <li>After, trying out the Conair 178Xr Ionic Pro Style (not ever hot enough) and the Conair 121PR Ionic Ceramic (hot enough but NO</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all for me!  </li>
            <li>I noticed when I got a tiny burn on my finger and my forehead from the hot plastic while I was using it.</li>
            <li>It is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>It is hot enough for me to blow out my hair.  </li>
            <li>The dryer offers a High and Low power setting with Hot, Warm, and Cool settings and a Cold Shot button.</li>
            <li>I usually skip that and just blow dry from underneath and have the same great results.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and baby fine - think Marsha Brady - very little natural volume.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ll be opting for this new dryer (over my old one), and I&#x27;ll be using the volumizing pik attachment.</li>
            <li>the recipient was trying to use an old taped together volume hair dryer because they couldn&#x27;t find a new one.</li>
            <li>This may seem odd to point out, but each heat setting is accurate.</li>
            <li>It was OK when I used the diffuser to keep my curls, but it was not good for blowing my hair our straight.  </li>
            <li>It started making an odd sound</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of loud, but not unbearably, and the fact that it takes less time to dry my hair makes up for the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy again except that it died so quickly, so planning to look at other options before buying a new one.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to cut my drying time down even more, but I still go back to my Infiniti Pro.</li>
            <li>The plastic shield feels very hot, but your hair will probably dry fast enough so that it won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use (with a slight bit of &#x27;getting the feel of it&#x27;!).</li>
            <li>Very important when you&#x27;re running late for work as I do in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is larger than it appears online, and it is certainly heavier than the one I already have</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is far more powerful that other hand dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>my hair normally takes 30 minutes or more to dry and now takes 15 or less.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as loud as my last one and has a lower pitch that is a little more agreeable to me.  </li>
            <li>Although, if I did have to say something negative, it would be that I would prefer the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting to be a little more hot.</li>
            <li>The cold shot button is great for locking in waves and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This thing is huge and heavy.</li>
            <li>It did dry my hair very quickly which is a plus for people who just need to dry their hair and get going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but no where near the level a woman would have)</li>
            <li>By the time I am about done drying my hair, my roots and scalp are getting hot and somewhat sweatty/damp since it takes so long for me.</li>
            <li>It was soft looking and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>I have waist length naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My old one did not have that option, and the attachments would fall off while in use.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive hearing and sometimes hairdryers can make you feel like you are going deaf.  </li>
            <li>It had been taking 10-15 minutes with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>No issues with it so far....</li>
            <li>My old Conair hairdryer died after six plus years</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but it was fast and left my hair so polished.</li>
            <li>I was in search for a blow dryer with a diffuser for my natural curly hair, and this tool gives LIFE to my overly heated curls.  </li>
            <li>Replaced her old one of fifteen years.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for the diffuser function because I decided to embrace my natural texture rather than straightening every day.</li>
            <li>decided to stick with my old hair dryer and not bother with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>it would take with my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised it got the rating it did with the noise factor.</li>
            <li>This dryer has completely stopped working</li>
            <li>newer dryers have so much technology (ionic ceramic tourmaline etc etc etc etc) but only succeed in longer drying time and flatter hair.</li>
            <li>i completely prefer this model.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>On my old one they were always falling off.  </li>
            <li>B000E8O8UQ Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it was the same price at a store I went into, so if you are shopping for a bargain it really isn&#x27;t, except for the tax on the sale.  </li>
            <li>but it is too loud for me.</li>
            <li>Professionals who are accustomed to waggling one of these around all day would probably have no trouble.  </li>
            <li>Professionals who are accustomed to waggling one of these around all day would probably have no trouble.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>A present for Christmas that was very well received.  </li>
            <li>I do not find it loud, as others have</li>
            <li>My old hairdryer is quieter.  </li>
            <li>It is now about 9 months old and turning it on it is reeeaaaalllllyyy sllllooooowwww to rev up.  </li>
            <li>We called Conair because our old dryer had been taken off the market.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My old dryer was going</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>But this really does dry hair faster with the higher power fan than my last one did</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and like to straighten it with volume, and it has exactly that.</li>
            <li>Even though the handle doesn&#x27;t fold up like some I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s relatively small and lightweight which makes it easy to pack and take along when</li>
            <li>First of all, it takes forever for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love that it has so many different settings on it - low, med, and high plus warm, warmer, and hot, and even a cold setting if you need just cold air!</li>
            <li>I have really really really flat hair and using the volumizing tool really gave a boost to my hair.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I will wear it curly and wavy and finish it up with a flat iron to produce more tame beach</li>
            <li>The following day I still had more body than usual.  </li>
            <li>It is of lighter weight than many others like it, but still a bit heavy if you have to hold it for a really long time.  </li>
            <li>There are three heat settings: hot, warm, cold.</li>
            <li>I am actually tempted to get another one for a backup as it is NOT easy to find a dryer that is hot enough without frying hair AND with a powerful air flow to boot!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blow dryer and especially if you have curly hair and like to do your hair that way.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it despite the fact it is heavier and the buttons are smaller.</li>
            <li>Use with a round brush and you get really volumized straight hair, as good as with an expensive dryer.</li>
            <li>I have dry naturally curly hair and finding the right dryer/defuser combination is always such a hassle.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter than my old hair dryer and worked much faster to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I typically use it on low because of the sound frequency.  </li>
            <li>so I started turning it on low first, giving it a sec, then high</li>
            <li>I would like to really get in with those long fingers and you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My only commentary is that with its heavy motor and attachments it is a bit more hefty than a standard dryer.</li>
            <li>This was a good hair dryer until literally after 9 months of use it started to smell like it was burning and started slowing down and 5 minutes later it was completely dead!</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and this dryer really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>had to find this online after trying 3 new dryers from the local big-box stores that didn&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It still runs but is a big safety issue so stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Called Conair and the representative said I could get a new one once I ship the existing one to them.</li>
            <li>Might as well buy a new different make.</li>
            <li>Bought an \\&quot;open box\\&quot; deal through Amazon (WAREHOUSE DEALS, Inc.) because it was cheaper than new.  </li>
            <li>This type of hairdryer is impossible to find in stores anymore, so it was really a welcome surprise--</li>
            <li>and I really needed to dry my hair before going out into the tundra.</li>
            <li>I used the root drying attachment and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair dry so evenly and fast.</li>
            <li>When I dry it curly it ends up getting frizzy and losing curly someone fast.</li>
            <li>I want to dry my hair straight -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why this hair dryer costs as much as it does, especially for this tiny diffuser they give you.  </li>
            <li>Even though the Revlon was powerful and hot, that thing was actually dangerous throwing out sparks from time to time and the hood/motor area getting dangerously hot!  </li>
            <li>Spent more on this one thinking it would last a long time and dry faster than my old cheaper one that lasted years and years.</li>
            <li>My other dryer gets so hot and leaves my hair frizzy and damp.</li>
            <li>*Apparently, using a diffuser takes a bit more than casual training and practice, because she said it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be less quiet but theclip attachments were cool.</li>
            <li>I combed my hair wet in the shower, towel dried, applied a couple products, then scrunched away with fingers and diffuser on low speed (very fine hair), and I was literally stunned at the waves and how lifted/volumized my roots were.</li>
            <li>reasons I chose this one in the store were that it was about middle of the pack price-wise, powerful (1875W), had different heat settings with cold shot, and I liked the look of it.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there are only 3 heat settings,  the highest heat setting is too hot and the one below it is too cool.</li>
            <li>No more trying to get some sort of brush in there to clean out the dust build-up.  </li>
            <li>For half my life I rocked a long pony tail, but I lopped it off last year, sent it to Locks of Love, and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I have fine long 3b-4b curly hair and used to have so much trouble bringing out my curls with out</li>
            <li>The 276R Infiniti needs only the medium setting to out-power most other dryers, and I can save the maximum setting for times when I am in a real hurry, like if I&#x27;m late for work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>though it did a great job of drying my hair and to my ears was not as annoying as those cheapie models that have a high pitched sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Raise it to my scalp barely moving for just a little lift and a cool burst and on to the next clump of curls.</li>
            <li>generally, she would try something else and give it away if it weren&#x27;t up to snuff.  </li>
            <li>For me, it would be an improvement if the clear plastic shield came off entirely.  </li>
            <li>All the buttons work, and overall is completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Does not give the same volume and fullness as my 17-year old dryer.  </li>
            <li>She has an old hairdryer of a different brand with a volumizing attachment just like this only with out the clear shield on it.  </li>
            <li>I mainly air dry my hair overnight</li>
            <li>this dryer is apparently the one model that works for my thick/coarse wavy-curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has straight hair and the concentrated nozzle also worked as expected.  </li>
            <li>So, a solid, solid 4 stars on this one, with the added endorsement of re-purchase at normal price...  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more thin</li>
            <li>All in all it was ok, but never great.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up with a nice, casual, beachy, wavy look that was not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is fantastic and helps me dry my curls with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>It has not overheated and shut off on me at all yet, even though it takes me a pretty long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry over night.</li>
            <li>Then it started to spit black hot melted plastic.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have complained that it does not get hot enough, I have found that the lower speed with high heat gives plenty of HEAT without burning the scalp and frying the hair the way my Revlon RV484 did!</li>
            <li>I also like that this dryer is smaller than my old one and weighs about the same.  </li>
            <li>I have actually gone back to my old cup style diffuser combo.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair fast, Not too heavy or loud ..</li>
            <li>A big colossal waste of my time to repackage, print labels, drive to the UPS place, drop it off, etc. etc.</li>
            <li>The fingers part doesn&#x27;t really work for me, but the base blow dryer is good.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one for my daughter since her dryer was getting a little too hot.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t pretend to know or appreciate what \\&quot;ionic ceramic\\&quot; technology brings to this particular product, but the results speak for themselves and I suspect that as various other households in our family come to the point that a new hair dryer is necessary, this will be the solid choice!</li>
            <li>The blow dryer is not heavy like some people said in their reviews or too long either like another reviewer.</li>
            <li>Its not too loud and not too heavy and does seem to give extra shine to my hair when I blow it straight.</li>
            <li>The dryer is also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>It does not fit in the large basket that stored my old dryer, flat iron, AND curling iron.</li>
            <li>It took a while to start getting my hair dry while using it, so I really recommend using the high/hot setting when using the volumizer so it will help dry your hair as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin, curly/wavy, prone to frizz and dryness, and generally a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>I long ago stopped fighting to curl it or tease it because by mid-morning it&#x27;ll be back to doing what it does naturally - hang straight down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, extremely satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You put this right up to your hair and lift it slightly upward as you blow dry</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, and this blow dryer takes care of the job quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>It dries my hair in under 10 minutes, normally will take close to 30-45 mins on any other dryer.  </li>
            <li>(for reference my hair can take several hours to air dry completely).</li>
            <li>This diffuser is very compact and the teeth are way too close together -less than a quarter inch between them in the middle and spaced out a bit further around the ends.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin, yet curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a big plus because I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and my hair is very frizz prone, so anything that zaps frizz is a huge hit with me.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my wife, she uses it daily and says it works very well, but that it is a little heavier than she would like.</li>
            <li>The concentrator attachment is like any other and does what it should to dry your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>also, i have super wavy thick hair and always need to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend looking for one elsewhere as this one was one huge disappointment and has been the source of much irritation.</li>
            <li>On the pro side: it puts out less noise than my cheap drugstore replacement I was using until this arrives; it does seem to dry my hair faster; and it&#x27;s much smaller than my previous Conair (also an Ionic dryer).</li>

            <li> I have never been happy with conair products.  </li>
            <li> but it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for 4 months, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a great hair dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bargain for the price, as are all of Conair&#x27;s styling tools.  </li>

            <li> The settings are good.</li>
            <li> My hair looks as good as it does when I leave the salon....</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Dryer is great however and works fine.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how amazing this Volume dryer is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a removable filter  which is a great idea, an \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology for smooth, frizz-free, static-free results\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> And it creates amazing lift at the crown.</li>
            <li> Trust me, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The accessories are nice if you use them</li>
            <li> Will be using this puppy a good many times.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a medium power setting as well though.</li>
            <li> I went to visit a girlfriend over the weekend and forgot my own blowdryer...</li>
            <li> It has two attachments to help your styling needs, which is nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Planning on many good hair days.  </li>
            <li> FRIZZ - adds nice volume to crown.  </li>
            <li> The heat setting are &amp;#34;hot, warm, cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooler than the warm air setting, but not truly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The heat setting are &amp;#34;hot, warm, cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooler than the warm air setting, but not truly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> though - websites claimed that ceramic was the best for volume and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because of the good reviews and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it folded up.</li>
            <li> the color is nice, the volumizer attachment is nice, and it&#x27;s a Conair--good brand.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and honestly I saw a difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer, it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li> The color is nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice balance and the switches stay where positioned.  </li>
            <li> Comes with two nice attachments, a Volumizer and a Concentrator.</li>
            <li> This dryer has a nice 4 year guarantee.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the power is good.  </li>
            <li> She could go buy her own dryer anywhere at any time, but she specifically asked for a repeat on this one.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it when I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I was never motivated to buy my own and get stuck with that burden.</li>
            <li> The dryer works great, the temperature adjusts are very useful.  </li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer that is really powerful without damaging or drying out my hair!</li>
            <li> Cool air works great for setting my hair before I turn the dryer off.  </li>
            <li> Cool air works great for setting my hair before I turn the dryer off.  </li>
            <li> The Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Boost Hair Dryer is a good dryer with some features, most notably the volume boost attachment.  </li>
            <li> love it, it is a wonderful product would recommend it to every one who wants this product to get buying</li>
            <li> very easy to switch the attachments from the Ionizer to the concentrated Blower attachement.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are very easy to take on and off and when you attach them, they snap into place and won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Very easy on the hair.</li>
            <li> First off, this dryer is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Happens to be my favorite color, so I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best blowdryer that I have ever used and purchased!!!</li>
            <li> The best so far that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect balance for a hairdryer that feels and performs like a professional one.</li>
            <li> Bought it together with BC178 and both of the 2 are satisfying and amazing</li>
            <li> It is good for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My hubby has always liked my hair better curly</li>
            <li> and then the volumnizor, which is the attachment I use because of my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> It also dries hair very quickly!</li>
            <li> I have to add that I have very fine hair, shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is longer than my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for daily-use hair dryer, I strongly recommend this one, fully functional!</li>
            <li> ...somethings never change lol ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first really great hair dryer in years.  </li>
            <li> After styling, my hair feels very smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice length cord which makes styling easy.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment easily snaps on and off using buttons which is a nice perk as they can sometimes be a pain to put on and remove otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a great hair dryer for fast drying, no frizz, and no damage to my very fine, permed hair.  </li>
            <li> Also very light and many settings for adjusting heat level.</li>
            <li> So far a very good hair dryer, but I have not found a use for the extending part for volume.  </li>
            <li> This is a top of the line hair dryer with everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this choice of all the hair dryer&#x27;s that are out there.</li>
            <li> However, it worked better for family members.</li>
            <li> Curls are so much more defined</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> OK, all hair driers probably have that...</li>
            <li> I love the ionizing attachment that runs thru my hair like a comb drying and fluffing it from the roots outwards.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with it and it does a lovely job.  </li>
            <li> I received many compliments on my hair from strangers...</li>
            <li> The amazon price is much better than the one I got</li>
            <li> and I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The loop at the end of the dryer handle allows you the option of safely hanging up the dryer without risk of it dropping to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And in all the time I&#x27;ve been using them, the brand I have come to trust most is Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Solution for me was to buy a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying one again.y a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  </li>
            <li> I love the dryer.  </li>
            <li> hairdryer has so many features, it must be \\&quot;the Lady Gaga of hairdryers!\\</li>
            <li> I want a more bouffant look with \\&quot;volume, volume, volume,\\</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love the pick attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, has a nice variety of heat and speed settings, and hangs on a hook.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This one is just a better version of what I had before.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with this hair dryer</li>
            <li> The quality of the item for the price you pay is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> love having heat and speed settings separate.  </li>
            <li> I love having heat and speed settings separate.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Conair Infiniti Pro Dryer 4x now and each time my hair looks better and better, as I am getting more skilled at using it.  </li>
            <li> I am not the type to leave comments or feedback, but I had to inform anyone who is in search of a excellent styling tool to LOOK NO FURTHER</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love that it has adjustable heat/power settings, so it keeps me from having to fry or blast my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, the diffuser and wing tip piece snap into place so they never fall off while using.  </li>
            <li> Oh one more thing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price either! :)</li>
            <li> It needed to lock in place since many of them fall off.</li>
            <li> After awhile, I believe most hair dryers need replacing.</li>
            <li> This one lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> Not all hair dryers do this, but this one sure did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Also the longer prongs help lift the hair better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be okay intact.</li>
            <li> I do love the speed and temperature options</li>
            <li> I love that the attachments snap on.</li>
            <li> My hair looked luxuriously healthy and not at all crispy.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer..</li>
            <li> This product does not give more volume than most hairdryers.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a diffuser for curly haired folks but love love love it for the volume it provides at the roots.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The plastic lip keeps the fly-aways form flying away and creating more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This gives my curly hair better volume and a more polished look.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not too sure what to do with them or how to use them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the attachments, truthfully I couldn&#x27;t figure out how (I don&#x27;t know if that is saying something about me or the dryer)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife and box banged up was ok.  </li>
            <li> Its so much better than what I was used</li>
            <li> I love Conair and they prove again they are the leader in hair appliances.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed ok.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> and I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> my hair always looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I love Conair products, so I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite ok.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I promptly purchased it and have never owned a better hair drying system.</li>
            <li> Gives more volume to my permed hair</li>
            <li> and I love the attachment.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if the dryer was lighter.</li>
            <li> amazing, very powerful</li>
            <li> is another great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer at first.</li>
            <li> volumizing attachment works pretty good, but is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li> find that the temperature settings are good - not scorching hot.  </li>
            <li> She was excited to get it!</li>
            <li> and I wanted a new one in case the spare (which works great) is no longer operable at some point.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Most hairdryers the attachments just click in place but can fall off easily, this one does not.</li>
            <li> power on this hair dryer is amazing and quick.  </li>
            <li> I love it with the diffuser - it is easy to maneuver and gives my hair a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> Quick, easy to use, and my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li> very nice and unique feature I found was the removable filter, which can be a real safety issue for fire hazard.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, this attachment is incredible.</li>
            <li> My curls come out perfect every time, with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really happy with this.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> but this is a good hair dryer for those with naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> She loved how much smoother and shinier it made her hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself is very bulky and between that and the humongous diffuser I struggle to find a good way to store this when not in use.</li>
            <li> Conair really did a good job designing this dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this styling tool after hours of searching the internet for the best hair dryer and looked at endless reviews.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a Conair with heat AND good air flow!  </li>
            <li> And it has a cool name: Infiniti!</li>
            <li> Imagine, it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave the original material below, but include this update, which might bump this to 5-stars if you consider re-purchase a meaningful indicator of perceived quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and services are excellent  than the other products that&#x27;s the reason i choose this one.</li>
            <li> I love the big attachment, it is great for separating out my hair while drying, speeding up the process.  </li>
            <li> It has a sleek design and fits easily into my suitcase for easy portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so, I was not quite ready for the exceptional quality of the 276R Infiniti Pro-Volume Dryer.  </li>
            <li> The speed and temperature are easily changed while using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use the controls while holding the dryer, too.  </li>
            <li> and it was easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Accessories come a bit to easily, but they work.  </li>
            <li> The settings are easy to use, the attachment are easy to apply and remove with the two buttons on either side of the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than what I&#x27;m used to and the teeth for the volumizer don&#x27;t pick up hair that easy</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can take the filter off and clean.  </li>
            <li> this makes it look fuller and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight and easy to handle, and has three heat settings along with three blower options.  </li>
            <li> It provides a strong air flow to help keep the curls and waves to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Wanted a strong blowdryer --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong it ties my hair in knots.</li>
            <li> The high heat is nice and hot and the cool shot works great too.  </li>
            <li> Good hair dryer but VERY loud!</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser and the price is right!</li>
            <li> In other words, get a precision cut and use this Conair \\&quot;infinitipro\\&quot; precisely for hair that looks glamorous and sets your face off to its best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for personal  use, and perhaps good for simple tasks at salons.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and controls are easy to use and switch between during use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is reasonably light, and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> The attachments snap on easily and feel secure.  </li>
            <li> , it works fine.</li>
            <li> This one has really strong power and has a nice quiet sound, not too bulky, fits nice in your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slso light weight so that it won&#x27;t feel like your working out with dumbells</li>
            <li> enjoy styling with mine</li>
            <li> importantly, however, is the power.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, basic hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fabulous.</li>
            <li> &quot;  Sure, she is smaller, but when she tried this one beside the one I got her for Christmas a year ago, also made by Conair, she liked that one better because it was lighter and easier for her to</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with how it performs</li>
            <li> It makes blow drying your hair faster and leaves hair feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> It is extremely light weight without the attachment and still light with it on.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t believe what a great buy this is.</li>
            <li> If anyone needs a free blow dryer, hit me up for my address...</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And my curls are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the description claims it is light weight and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> Best part is, I didn&#x27;t have to use a round brush,or any brush for that matter.</li>
            <li> Which I will when I want a smooth, polished look.</li>
            <li> I have had the travel version for probably 2 years now and it is fantastic</li>
            <li> I tried using the attachment and couldn&#x27;t decide if I liked it better with or without, so I&#x27;ll have to experiment more with that later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good with this dryer, but I will update if any issues arise.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t to loud either when I am holding it up to my head, which is good.</li>
            <li> Really gives great volume without much effort.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and light.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly on the medium and hot settings and leaves it nice and curly.</li>
            <li> my own and my wife&#x27;s experience with this hair dryer, we&#x27;ve found that the design and the performance is what sets this apart from other good mid-range hair dryers ($30 - $50).</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product that Conair has obviously invested a lot of design technology</li>
            <li> Very powerful &amp; not too noisy.</li>
            <li> (Of course I&#x27;ll need to use the flat iron for 1 min of baby hair fly</li>
            <li> I have spent some real money on dryers but this one stands strong with all its the best one I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Now I apply Biolage Gelee and Rusk Mud and pop on the diffuser and in abt 5 minutes my hair is beautiful natural curl and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I use high speed warm heat.  </li>
            <li> I use high speed warm heat.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it does not get as hot, but my hair feels better for it.  </li>
            <li> TOTALLY worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, within two minutes of using the dryer and attachment on freshly washed damp hair I was blown away (not literally!)</li>
            <li> However, considering the savings in time, it&#x27;s worth building your biceps for volumized, va-voom hair!</li>
            <li> ,it is really unique indeed.</li>
            <li> But I like this hairdryer and it seems pretty durable :)</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair that is not thin, but it&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a little over 2 years, and it still works great :)</li>
            <li> I use the warm setting on low and its perfect - doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other dryers have.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price with such great looks and performance.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy that this hair dryer dries my hair really quickly.</li>
            <li> I can dry my curly hair in five minutes and it looks great all day.  </li>
            <li> Also the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; attachment is great to dry underneath your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful and dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So, for me, there&#x27;s nothing special about this, and I&#x27;d opt for something simpler, lighter and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box!  </li>
            <li> So many to choose to from, but this is what I was looking for, 1875 watts of fast drying performance that uses ionic ceramic technology which gives you frizz-free hair.</li>
            <li> every full size dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; a full spectrum infrared heat that works on molecules inside the hair shaft, drying it inside and out to minimize heat damage.</li>
            <li> I really liked the old one</li>
            <li> Loved the different heat settings as well -</li>
            <li> The cool setting and the diffuser works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it is any better at adding curl, but certainly is no worse.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cool purple color.</li>
            <li> Overall really good dryer.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a good unit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer based on good reviews, and the idea that finally a dryer was specifically designed for those of us with curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the volumizing attachment - it really works.  </li>
            <li> I also like the cool shot button that sets my hair once it dries.  </li>
            <li> I am an amateur when it comes to blow dryers and honestly I had no idea what to look for except for something with good reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wish this worked better on my fine naturally curly hair, but I believe it is more for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> While the volumnizing pic takes a little practice to get used to, it does a great job adding body to my fine hair and without frizz.  </li>
            <li> Still, it works fine and doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around, making nicely defined waves possible.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this blow dryer does a great job.</li>
            <li> It has a removable filter on the end for quick cleaning of lint and hair which helps&lt;br /&gt;extend</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer went straight to good will.</li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment works better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried and gives me soft, smooth curls.</li>
            <li> It tames my frizzy hair and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for personal use if you&#x27;re looking for some extra \\&quot;oomph,\\&quot; as well as the option to keep your curls and preserve silky hair with the ceramic attachment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a very well designed hair dryer that offers reliable and good performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER LIGHT USE SINCE THE DRYER WAS FIRST REVIEWED, THE MOTOR BURNED OUT IN APRIL 2013.</li>
            <li> former hairdryer is also a Conair that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with for years.</li>
            <li> I noticed a screeching sound upon first turning it on</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; are pretty smooth and long, which is good for grabbing and volumizing longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, powerful little dryer, comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful &amp; dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> the diffuser locks in place, which is very cool because most diffusers snap on and my last one would continually fall off when I used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way it does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to put on and take off, but I haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li> It works really well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, but isn&#x27;t the super fast drying dryer I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair but not the pretty kind.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference between &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;warm&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have only had the hair dryer for a week, but I love it!</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like the first hair dryer I got her, but loves this one!</li>
            <li> So, finally a hair dryer to love!</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair</li>
            <li> Pretty sure all the stuff I wrote before is still true, but now taken with the grain of salt that whatever it&#x27;s minor shortcomings, my wife is more willing to live with them than she is to take a chance of finding something better...</li>
            <li> The outside filter turns right off, and the coatings on both filters allow them to wipe clean very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very efficient and the diffuser won&#x27;t ever fall off during its use as it is securely attached unlike others.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is too powerful.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I would use a diffuser to get a nice spirally curl.</li>
            <li> Also she says the clear sheld is more in the way than it is useful.  </li>
            <li> Because I am very picky about how my hair looks, I once actually tossed away a perfectly good dryer because I didn&#x27;t like the way it styled my hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is definitely powerful, which is a must for me, and a bit noisy.  </li>
            <li> smaller than the one I currently own, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I had one for years that I liked well enough, but it had a weaker motor</li>
            <li> : Hair pulling issue with the &amp;#34;Volumizing tool&amp;#34;; cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really shoot cool air.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair pulling issue with the &amp;#34;Volumizing tool&amp;#34;; cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really shoot cool air.  </li>
            <li> One nice feature my last dryer had</li>
            <li> No more frizz, my curls are bouncy and full of body, and it even has a great tool for straightening your hair,  </li>
            <li> The dryer does work better compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> My Mom, who has short hair, said she&#x27;d take it and if she liked it, would buy it from me.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer on the lowest setting, it is that powerful.  </li>
            <li> However, I am going to keep it because I feel the drier is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> it worth 39.99?</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> ,it doesn&#x27;t worth a penny at all.</li>
            <li> And I love the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting when I&#x27;m drying my 2 yr old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I really liked it while it worked, and it was only $20</li>
            <li> I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have to say I rarely did this</li>
            <li> It has multiple setting, and the attachments come in handy.</li>
            <li> but I could rarely wear it that way.</li>
            <li> An pitfall to a better motor, and one I&#x27;m willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer is very useful with the diffuser on, but I found it to blow my hair around too much without it on.  </li>
            <li> It is also nice to have the cool setting to &#x27;set&#x27; my curls after they are mostly dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair and this is the first hairdryer I&#x27;ve used that can handle styling it either curly or straight.</li>
            <li> Most people will find the low setting to be strong enough to suit most hair drying needs.  </li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> I would say this is probably one of the nicest dryers out there right now</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re supposed to put it right up onto your head as seen in the video.  </li>
            <li> love the cool shot feature, which is used by holding the blue trigger button in.</li>
            <li> I had to get a different hair dryer which is NOT as good but has the normal style of diffuser.  </li>
            <li> There is a big difference between the hot and the warm air programs, so sometimes you need to mix.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very clear in the product info that this diffuser head you see in the picture does easily come off.  </li>
            <li> My current hair dryer that I have owned for many years still works, but I wanted a diffuser to see if I could give my straight, fine hair some umph.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, easy to maneuver  and quieter than my last one.</li>
            <li> It has three heat settings-Hot, Warm, Cool and two levels of High and Low.</li>
            <li> For fun the first time I used it I pushed my hair up...</li>
            <li> My hair turns out really curly and full.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer and a paddly brush and my hair is straight and full.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the added weight DOES equate to quality and better performance.  </li>
            <li> i MAYBE could have figured out how to make this unit work better for me, but it would have been more trouble than I felt it was worth.  </li>
            <li> I honestly cannot belive that I have been using this dryer for as long as I have.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and curly with even some parts kind of straight, very multi-textured.</li>
            <li> The fancy attachment doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine straight hair</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple heat and speed settings are great for my very fine frizz-prone hair and the cold shot is great for when I&#x27;m starting to get too hot and need a cool blast.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to change up my routine and start using it more in the near future, so if I learn anything significant in the process I will update my review!</li>
            <li> but I want it dried NOW and the 2 different speed settings were awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have found that ionic/ceramic technology is a great method for drying my hair faster while using less heat, particularly if the dryer has a stronger motor.  </li>
            <li> The volume dryer straightens my hair a whole lot better than these salons near my house that charge $50 $60.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer thinking it would be good quality and it died in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my new Conair Infiniti Pro hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Cool button easy to reach and dryer doesn&#x27;t cause frizz, so definitely buy it if everyone is awake by the time of day you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just turn the heat setting to cool and cool all the hair down from the roots before turning the dryer off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just turn the heat setting to cool and cool all the hair down from the roots before turning the dryer off.  </li>
            <li> It is also very gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li> I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> For reference - I have fine hair with natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on the various blow dryers available on Amazon before I chose this one, and of course price was a significant factor in my decision.</li>
            <li> Right away they liked the design and color of it, and also thought that it was a tad quieter than other hairdryers they have used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a non-Chi blow-dryer at home - when traveling, I am stuck with those cheap hotel blow dryers but anyway - and the Conair surprised me.</li>
            <li> But even with a shorter brown mop on top, I can see that this thing actually works!</li>
            <li> I love the deep metallic purple color.</li>
            <li> The concentrator works great with a styling brush for a long lasting style.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to it, I now have again what I thought I&#x27;d lost forever: no tangles!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews at Amazon.com before I made the purchase, which made me aware of some cons of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice that the filter got a bit hot</li>
            <li> The heating element was still working, but the fan was not, so it would get EXTREMELY hot and smell like it was burning.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great lift for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The girls in the videos all had big bouncy supermodel hair, reviewers were proclaiming love.</li>
            <li> I love all the different heat and speed settings as well.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference the first time I used this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough--not even on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I plugged this in to use it, it started sputtering, lost power and started to smell.  </li>
            <li> and when i use this blow dryer I first wash my hair then throw my hair up in a bun with out towel drying it then</li>
            <li> Medium heat is exactly that.  </li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s all real!</li>
            <li> and already my coworkers are commenting about how  shiny and pretty my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably best for big people with big hair and really big bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Box was pretty banged up.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy 5 more to last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> it gets hot and blows.  </li>
            <li> and I love the two extra attachments.  </li>
            <li> first off it didn&#x27;t come with the attachments that were stated in the description.  </li>
            <li> it has 2 different casings, so I could make more hair</li>
            <li> but this product is stellar and</li>
            <li> goes pretty hot though.</li>
            <li> Even when I used a lower setting it still did not give me the smooth sleek hair that my old hair dryer achieved.  </li>
            <li> so its kind of difficult to find things that work and was very pleased that this did</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I first purchased just the diffuser portion of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer exactly once since I purchased it in April</li>
            <li> And the color of this appliance is pretty too.</li>
            <li> This dryer is also not too terribly heavy, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Generally my hair is nice and smooth once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My mom and I now share it and she loves using it to blow dry her hair straight, she says she almost doesn&#x27;t have to flat iron her hair, its just that good!</li>
            <li> When I saw this hair dryer offered, I recalled how much I once loved the detangling aspect of a previous dryer with volumizing attachment and knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li> If I leave my hair hot, it goes flat and starts to lose it&#x27;s style before it cools off, wasting my precious time and effort.</li>
            <li> If I leave my hair hot, it goes flat and starts to lose it&#x27;s style before it cools off, wasting my precious time and effort.</li>
            <li> but this does diffuse nicely with very minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> Because the hair dryyer was so quick, i was able to actually give myself a complete blow out.  </li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly, so I occasionally use the diffuser on my own hair.  </li>
            <li> The volumizing tines made me feel as if I had a talented stylist drying my hair rather than my usual approach of giving up and allowing the dryer to blow my hair helter-skelter in a hot gust.</li>
            <li> but overall I was pleased with how gentle the air flow was with the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li> Delivers consistent heat and smart accessories.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality dryer, easily comparable to the dryers that professional hair stylists use.  </li>
            <li> When I want to blow-dry it straight, the concentrator plus the high power of the highest speed setting blow it out quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li> Ok.. first off this hairdryer is quieter and way more powerful (fan wise.. not heat wise), this is due to the fact that the fan motor is  AC, not the usual DC motors that are usually in dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has enough settings to get your desired style - Hot, warm and cool for heat and low &amp; high power flow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has a ton of settings, I really like the color as well.  </li>
            <li> I can only speak to my fine hair that is partly straight and partly curly (a maddening hair type!).</li>
            <li> I can only speak to my fine hair that is partly straight and partly curly (a maddening hair type!).</li>
            <li> Love the low, med, high.</li>
            <li> As far as drying ability goes, I use it on medium heat and speed and it seems to work quickly.</li>
            <li> trial was easy because my salt &amp; pepper hair is kept fairly short,</li>
            <li> It dries my hair pretty fast and give my curls so much volume.</li>
            <li> It did not have a strong enough blower with the attachment</li>
            <li> I had large areas of breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> It also has a concentrator attachment to pinpoint airflow to a certain spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hairdryer looks well made and it certainly has a feel of quality to it.</li>
            <li> So people with fine, delicate hair like mine can put it on a very light setting and not feel like I&#x27;m singing my hair or face.</li>
            <li> She is still getting used to it, but is simple, easy to use and really tightens her curls after her showers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my hair will appreciate not being overheated, but it takes soo much longer to dry my hair than it used to.  </li>
            <li> This dryer only made my hair more frizzy and it was deafeningly loud!</li>
            <li> Even without the concentrator attachment the air feels pretty well contained for drying one particular area (like my bangs).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also get decent body at first but within 30 min it seems like that body just drops on me.</li>
            <li> Blows a large volume of hot air on high heat.  </li>
            <li> My wife saw this in a store last week for $49.99, luckily i was right there and did an amazon search and saw it under $30...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer ;-))</li>
            <li> I was able to wear it natural with only adding a few curls on the top to even the pattern, not create volume - the hair dryer did that!  </li>
            <li> The mid-level heat is the same temperature as hot on my old dryer, and high heat is even better.  </li>
            <li> The handle, the feel of the dryer is fluid, comfortable, and very intuitive.</li>
            <li> so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked very well.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use as much heat.</li>
            <li> So it was really for my health, not beauty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very well made.</li>
            <li> It really drys to the scalp and gives lots of lift and volume.  </li>
            <li> But this dryer blows with too much force.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it will make my hair snarly while I am blow drying it straight with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much simpler version of this one -- it doesn&#x27;t have the volumizing pik</li>
            <li> so I will have another ready.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m almost ready, I just have to put my makeup on....\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I do really like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m waking up the whole neighborhood when I turn it</li>
            <li> It drys my curls so fast and NO</li>
            <li> The weight is reasonable considering the power and features so if you have to hold it for a longer time than I do, my hope is that you find this one easier than some of the comparable dryers that are much heavier and bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dropped it on the floor and noticed it wasn&#x27;t drying as fast, so I went out and bought another.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> loves this, dries curly hair fast</li>
            <li> The drier works very well.</li>
            <li> I was ready to spend about $70 and found this one.</li>
            <li> I can massage my scalp with it while drying my hair and even style it by gently pulling my hair in the direction</li>
            <li> The attachment really does help to make your hair fuller and thicker looking.</li>
            <li> Not so much with the accessories.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute piece of genius.</li>
            <li> It is a two-in-one styling tool and hair dryer, volume boost, fast and frizz-free styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our daughter is very picky about what she will and won&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the defuser attachment.  </li>
            <li> It does all the things a blow dryer does and much more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the add-ons</li>
            <li> There isnt much i can say as im not</li>
            <li> (I went straight to</li>
            <li> With the attachment, it really does enhance the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very well-made dryer and works well too.  </li>
            <li> I has all the features I wanted, works very well and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The attachments work really well.</li>
            <li> I had a feeling the diffuser would work really well, so I went on a mission to find the hairdryer that went with it.</li>
            <li> I watched the video and for once it works like they say ... really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes this model as far as quality goes, and she likes the various settings and attachments, but she still likes the lighter one better for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Solidly built and low price - recommended as an effective hair solution.</li>
            <li> I am so glad now, that my old hair dryer finally quit and I bought this one-</li>
            <li> Nice dryer with a heavy feel.  </li>
            <li> They like the attachment which combs hair as it dries which they felt made their hair  more controllable and certainly not as</li>
            <li> Power is large, dry hair quickly, fly in the ointment is the sound a little bit big</li>
            <li> Gets hot very soon,dries your hair and makes very loud noise.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old hair dryer with this one and made the right choice.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great and is really fast,  I have long hair to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> Would be great if it didn&#x27;t have that ridiculous clear plastic &#x27;shield&#x27; over the prongs.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be powerful and dry quickly, however based on the product description I had anticipated that it would have a quieter operation.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser for volume, and other head for straightening.</li>
            <li> Love the 3 settings for cold, warm and hot, and the 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> From what I could tell, the diffuser produced a gentle and consistent breeze of warm air instead of the column of forced air it generates without it.  </li>
            <li> From what I could tell, the diffuser produced a gentle and consistent breeze of warm air instead of the column of forced air it generates without it.  </li>
            <li> Very good for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> However, the blue &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t shoot out cool air very well.  </li>
            <li> However, the blue &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t shoot out cool air very well.  </li>
            <li> It dries my very porous (usually long drying) hair super fast!</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I see that most people like the extra power and special features of this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer does a decent job smoothing hair, but if you have frizzy hair, like me, you will still need to use your flat iron to smooth away the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast drying, high powered...</li>
            <li> Low heat, low speed is great for curls and waves because it gets your hair dry without pulling out your curls (which causes frizz!).</li>
            <li> Able to thoroughly dry my natural hair and keep the curls.</li>
            <li> However, if I still had my long hair, this blows my hair out so smoothly that I think I could get away with just drying</li>
            <li> The lower setting works fine, but who has the time to dry their hair on the lower setting?</li>
            <li> Not overly hot like my old school dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is pretty loud.</li>
            <li> Most products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Better than blow drying upside down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it faster or better than average full-sized dryers, and it is considerably heavier and more complicated, with a price that is higher than most (although not in the high-end bracket).</li>
            <li> It is also nice to use on your face for a few seconds to cool down if you&#x27;re getting hot while blow</li>
            <li> It is in the ballpark of other dryers, but I think the AC motor really pushes this model near the top of the pack to consider.</li>
            <li> This device has brought my beauty regimen to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> I am using it with the pick attachment (new to me) and it really does make a difference with hair volume.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s more than what I had with my previous blow-dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although most people believe that all blow-dryers are essentially the same, they are not.  </li>
            <li> The volumizing pick attachment seems to work good even though I&#x27;ve only used a few times.</li>
            <li> I had a older conair that was hotter than this one.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have would be that the ends of the root-drying / volumizing attachment don&#x27;t feel great on your head</li>
            <li> ; (diffuser) is decent and I use it sometimes, but it has an issue.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it on the low heat, low air setting but in a pinch it turns into a high-volume dryer and the styling attachments give lift to my thinning hair as well.</li>
            <li> also may want to consider the older model of the infiniti pro:</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent blowdryer for the price.</li>
            <li> and maybe it looks decent.</li>
            <li> I went to a high end clothing store to get some pants I needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Also, when used on high it looks like I have wind whipped hair.</li>
            <li> This one performs like High end Salons use.</li>
            <li> high speed)--it sounded like metal on metal.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty excited that she was ready a little faster...</li>
            <li> so glad i could still find this on amazon since i blow dry my hair straight daily.</li>
            <li> The cool shot is nice because I can use that for a few short minutes and cool my head down and get rid of that dampness and set in my style.</li>
            <li> With so many hairdryers out in the market right now, it is difficult to decide between so many different models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked for several weeks and purchased this dryer because the old Conair which was 7 years old was slowing down, this new one has more power, drys hair super fast and doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I would say is that it is heavier than most dryers, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have fine medium long hair, and it is naturally curly and wavy.</li>
            <li> Finally I realized my hair dryer was getting so hot on the front that the hair was literally singeing off in large areas, and even looked like the hair was being sucked into the heating elements.</li>
            <li> It seems to get the job done but wish someone had warned me in a review how loud it really is</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but I can blow it out straight.  </li>
            <li> Dried my hair using this lovely thing this morning.</li>
            <li> That attachment seems to come standard with pretty much</li>
            <li> and my hair looks a lot better than air dried.</li>
            <li> she says it took 15 mins off her normal drying time.</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers suck my hair into the motor, which is why I have had my current one for so long, because it doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, but 8 oz more than the cheaper DC models.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars if they would design the accessories to stay on a bit more firmly.</li>
            <li> so I love that I can get out the door those few minutes faster.</li>
            <li> So, I found it good, but not great.</li>
            <li> My hair ended up softer and more manageable than I thought it would, especially since blow drying is supposed to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair which requires the magic of a hair dryer to make it smooth with touch-up by a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I changed right back to this one.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that generates a cloud of negative ions that can neutralize the generally positive charge of flyaway hair, eliminate static electricity and contribute to shine.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a medical condition, my once silky, baby fine, long locks had become a thinning, tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quieter than many hair dryers, it&#x27;s small and light yet and dries faster than conventional hair dryers--about as fast as my ceramic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It makes a fairly high pitched sound--too high for my sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li> and once you do, the teeth pull at your locks when you bring the dryer out of your hair to go to a new section.  </li>
            <li> but I think I like this new design because it focuses the heat and therefore works faster.</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a new dryer for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retiring the fairly new dryer for fear</li>
            <li> So now I have a basically brand new dryer in my drawer that isn&#x27;t being used...</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny, not burned, not frizzy, It is fairly quiet as blow dryers go, definitely powerful, and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> The weight is reasonable considering the power and features so if you have to hold it for a longer time than I do, my hope is that you find this one easier than some of the comparable dryers that are much heavier and bigger.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Wow, love this dryer, it takes half the time my old dryer took.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not using the diffuser attachment and need to dry my hair quickly to put it up for work</li>
            <li> It also has 2 lower settings if I&#x27;m just doing a quick dry.  </li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me just say I am not one to get excited about blow dryers, since I have naturally curly hair and usually air dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried straightening my hair yet with the new dryer, but for my naturally curly hair nothing beats this!</li>
            <li> It is incredibly loud and so high pitched</li>
            <li> The long fingers on the diffuser are amazing because they let you dry your hair without drying it out as much and you aren&#x27;t blowing hot hair directly on your scalp like with other diffusers I have used.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> I have been using a blow-dryer type hair dryer since the early 1970&#x27;s, since I pretty much have always worn my hair fairly long, in a style that I feel flatters my face.  </li>
            <li> : Hair look and health; price (very competitive!); separate heat/speed settings; size; overall quality;</li>
            <li> price (very competitive!); separate heat/speed settings; size; overall quality; warranty.  </li>
            <li> Oddly enough, neither my nor my wife&#x27;s hair feels burned or hot.</li>
            <li> After, trying out the Conair 178Xr Ionic Pro Style (not ever hot enough) and the Conair 121PR Ionic Ceramic (hot enough but NO</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all for me!  </li>
            <li> I noticed when I got a tiny burn on my finger and my forehead from the hot plastic while I was using it.</li>
            <li> It is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> It is hot enough for me to blow out my hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer offers a High and Low power setting with Hot, Warm, and Cool settings and a Cold Shot button.</li>
            <li> I usually skip that and just blow dry from underneath and have the same great results.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and baby fine - think Marsha Brady - very little natural volume.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ll be opting for this new dryer (over my old one), and I&#x27;ll be using the volumizing pik attachment.</li>
            <li> the recipient was trying to use an old taped together volume hair dryer because they couldn&#x27;t find a new one.</li>
            <li> This may seem odd to point out, but each heat setting is accurate.</li>
            <li> It was OK when I used the diffuser to keep my curls, but it was not good for blowing my hair our straight.  </li>
            <li> It started making an odd sound</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of loud, but not unbearably, and the fact that it takes less time to dry my hair makes up for the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would buy again except that it died so quickly, so planning to look at other options before buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to cut my drying time down even more, but I still go back to my Infiniti Pro.</li>
            <li> The plastic shield feels very hot, but your hair will probably dry fast enough so that it won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use (with a slight bit of &#x27;getting the feel of it&#x27;!).</li>
            <li> Very important when you&#x27;re running late for work as I do in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is larger than it appears online, and it is certainly heavier than the one I already have</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is far more powerful that other hand dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> my hair normally takes 30 minutes or more to dry and now takes 15 or less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as loud as my last one and has a lower pitch that is a little more agreeable to me.  </li>
            <li> Although, if I did have to say something negative, it would be that I would prefer the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting to be a little more hot.</li>
            <li> The cold shot button is great for locking in waves and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This thing is huge and heavy.</li>
            <li> It did dry my hair very quickly which is a plus for people who just need to dry their hair and get going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no where near the level a woman would have)</li>
            <li> By the time I am about done drying my hair, my roots and scalp are getting hot and somewhat sweatty/damp since it takes so long for me.</li>
            <li> It was soft looking and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I have waist length naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My old one did not have that option, and the attachments would fall off while in use.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive hearing and sometimes hairdryers can make you feel like you are going deaf.  </li>
            <li> It had been taking 10-15 minutes with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> No issues with it so far....</li>
            <li> My old Conair hairdryer died after six plus years</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but it was fast and left my hair so polished.</li>
            <li> I was in search for a blow dryer with a diffuser for my natural curly hair, and this tool gives LIFE to my overly heated curls.  </li>
            <li> Replaced her old one of fifteen years.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for the diffuser function because I decided to embrace my natural texture rather than straightening every day.</li>
            <li> decided to stick with my old hair dryer and not bother with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> it would take with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised it got the rating it did with the noise factor.</li>
            <li> This dryer has completely stopped working</li>
            <li> newer dryers have so much technology (ionic ceramic tourmaline etc etc etc etc) but only succeed in longer drying time and flatter hair.</li>
            <li> i completely prefer this model.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> On my old one they were always falling off.  </li>
            <li> B000E8O8UQ Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it was the same price at a store I went into, so if you are shopping for a bargain it really isn&#x27;t, except for the tax on the sale.  </li>
            <li> but it is too loud for me.</li>
            <li> Professionals who are accustomed to waggling one of these around all day would probably have no trouble.  </li>
            <li> Professionals who are accustomed to waggling one of these around all day would probably have no trouble.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> A present for Christmas that was very well received.  </li>
            <li> I do not find it loud, as others have</li>
            <li> My old hairdryer is quieter.  </li>
            <li> It is now about 9 months old and turning it on it is reeeaaaalllllyyy sllllooooowwww to rev up.  </li>
            <li> We called Conair because our old dryer had been taken off the market.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My old dryer was going</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> But this really does dry hair faster with the higher power fan than my last one did</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and like to straighten it with volume, and it has exactly that.</li>
            <li> Even though the handle doesn&#x27;t fold up like some I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s relatively small and lightweight which makes it easy to pack and take along when</li>
            <li> First of all, it takes forever for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love that it has so many different settings on it - low, med, and high plus warm, warmer, and hot, and even a cold setting if you need just cold air!</li>
            <li> I have really really really flat hair and using the volumizing tool really gave a boost to my hair.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will wear it curly and wavy and finish it up with a flat iron to produce more tame beach</li>
            <li> The following day I still had more body than usual.  </li>
            <li> It is of lighter weight than many others like it, but still a bit heavy if you have to hold it for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> There are three heat settings: hot, warm, cold.</li>
            <li> I am actually tempted to get another one for a backup as it is NOT easy to find a dryer that is hot enough without frying hair AND with a powerful air flow to boot!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blow dryer and especially if you have curly hair and like to do your hair that way.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it despite the fact it is heavier and the buttons are smaller.</li>
            <li> Use with a round brush and you get really volumized straight hair, as good as with an expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> I have dry naturally curly hair and finding the right dryer/defuser combination is always such a hassle.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter than my old hair dryer and worked much faster to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I typically use it on low because of the sound frequency.  </li>
            <li> so I started turning it on low first, giving it a sec, then high</li>
            <li> I would like to really get in with those long fingers and you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My only commentary is that with its heavy motor and attachments it is a bit more hefty than a standard dryer.</li>
            <li> This was a good hair dryer until literally after 9 months of use it started to smell like it was burning and started slowing down and 5 minutes later it was completely dead!</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and this dryer really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> had to find this online after trying 3 new dryers from the local big-box stores that didn&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still runs but is a big safety issue so stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Called Conair and the representative said I could get a new one once I ship the existing one to them.</li>
            <li> Might as well buy a new different make.</li>
            <li> Bought an \\&quot;open box\\&quot; deal through Amazon (WAREHOUSE DEALS, Inc.) because it was cheaper than new.  </li>
            <li> This type of hairdryer is impossible to find in stores anymore, so it was really a welcome surprise--</li>
            <li> and I really needed to dry my hair before going out into the tundra.</li>
            <li> I used the root drying attachment and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair dry so evenly and fast.</li>
            <li> When I dry it curly it ends up getting frizzy and losing curly someone fast.</li>
            <li> I want to dry my hair straight -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why this hair dryer costs as much as it does, especially for this tiny diffuser they give you.  </li>
            <li> Even though the Revlon was powerful and hot, that thing was actually dangerous throwing out sparks from time to time and the hood/motor area getting dangerously hot!  </li>
            <li> Spent more on this one thinking it would last a long time and dry faster than my old cheaper one that lasted years and years.</li>
            <li> My other dryer gets so hot and leaves my hair frizzy and damp.</li>
            <li> *Apparently, using a diffuser takes a bit more than casual training and practice, because she said it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be less quiet but theclip attachments were cool.</li>
            <li> I combed my hair wet in the shower, towel dried, applied a couple products, then scrunched away with fingers and diffuser on low speed (very fine hair), and I was literally stunned at the waves and how lifted/volumized my roots were.</li>
            <li> reasons I chose this one in the store were that it was about middle of the pack price-wise, powerful (1875W), had different heat settings with cold shot, and I liked the look of it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there are only 3 heat settings,  the highest heat setting is too hot and the one below it is too cool.</li>
            <li> No more trying to get some sort of brush in there to clean out the dust build-up.  </li>
            <li> For half my life I rocked a long pony tail, but I lopped it off last year, sent it to Locks of Love, and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I have fine long 3b-4b curly hair and used to have so much trouble bringing out my curls with out</li>
            <li> The 276R Infiniti needs only the medium setting to out-power most other dryers, and I can save the maximum setting for times when I am in a real hurry, like if I&#x27;m late for work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though it did a great job of drying my hair and to my ears was not as annoying as those cheapie models that have a high pitched sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Raise it to my scalp barely moving for just a little lift and a cool burst and on to the next clump of curls.</li>
            <li> generally, she would try something else and give it away if it weren&#x27;t up to snuff.  </li>
            <li> For me, it would be an improvement if the clear plastic shield came off entirely.  </li>
            <li> All the buttons work, and overall is completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Does not give the same volume and fullness as my 17-year old dryer.  </li>
            <li> She has an old hairdryer of a different brand with a volumizing attachment just like this only with out the clear shield on it.  </li>
            <li> I mainly air dry my hair overnight</li>
            <li> this dryer is apparently the one model that works for my thick/coarse wavy-curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has straight hair and the concentrated nozzle also worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> So, a solid, solid 4 stars on this one, with the added endorsement of re-purchase at normal price...  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more thin</li>
            <li> All in all it was ok, but never great.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with a nice, casual, beachy, wavy look that was not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is fantastic and helps me dry my curls with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> It has not overheated and shut off on me at all yet, even though it takes me a pretty long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry over night.</li>
            <li> Then it started to spit black hot melted plastic.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have complained that it does not get hot enough, I have found that the lower speed with high heat gives plenty of HEAT without burning the scalp and frying the hair the way my Revlon RV484 did!</li>
            <li> I also like that this dryer is smaller than my old one and weighs about the same.  </li>
            <li> I have actually gone back to my old cup style diffuser combo.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair fast, Not too heavy or loud ..</li>
            <li> A big colossal waste of my time to repackage, print labels, drive to the UPS place, drop it off, etc. etc.</li>
            <li> The fingers part doesn&#x27;t really work for me, but the base blow dryer is good.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one for my daughter since her dryer was getting a little too hot.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t pretend to know or appreciate what \\&quot;ionic ceramic\\&quot; technology brings to this particular product, but the results speak for themselves and I suspect that as various other households in our family come to the point that a new hair dryer is necessary, this will be the solid choice!</li>
            <li> The blow dryer is not heavy like some people said in their reviews or too long either like another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Its not too loud and not too heavy and does seem to give extra shine to my hair when I blow it straight.</li>
            <li> The dryer is also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It does not fit in the large basket that stored my old dryer, flat iron, AND curling iron.</li>
            <li> It took a while to start getting my hair dry while using it, so I really recommend using the high/hot setting when using the volumizer so it will help dry your hair as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, curly/wavy, prone to frizz and dryness, and generally a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> I long ago stopped fighting to curl it or tease it because by mid-morning it&#x27;ll be back to doing what it does naturally - hang straight down.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, extremely satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You put this right up to your hair and lift it slightly upward as you blow dry</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and this blow dryer takes care of the job quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> It dries my hair in under 10 minutes, normally will take close to 30-45 mins on any other dryer.  </li>
            <li> (for reference my hair can take several hours to air dry completely).</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very compact and the teeth are way too close together -less than a quarter inch between them in the middle and spaced out a bit further around the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin, yet curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a big plus because I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and my hair is very frizz prone, so anything that zaps frizz is a huge hit with me.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, she uses it daily and says it works very well, but that it is a little heavier than she would like.</li>
            <li> The concentrator attachment is like any other and does what it should to dry your hair straight.  </li>
            <li> also, i have super wavy thick hair and always need to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend looking for one elsewhere as this one was one huge disappointment and has been the source of much irritation.</li>
            <li> On the pro side: it puts out less noise than my cheap drugstore replacement I was using until this arrives; it does seem to dry my hair faster; and it&#x27;s much smaller than my previous Conair (also an Ionic dryer).</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughters hair (which is soooo thick) and I&#x27;m absolutely sure it cut the time in half!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a Volume attachment that works great if you have thick hair or long hair that you want to boost he volume of it, but if you have thin hair or short hair you may not really care about that.</li>
            <li> Luckily it dries hair quickly because it is uncomfortable to hold for longer than a few minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium (between fine and thick) texture, straight, and usually a nightmare to dry, due to my impatience, generalized ineptitude with using a round styling brush and dryer simultaneously, and tendency to sweat profusely from a hot Sahara blast of wind, and the way a dryer makes my hair feel and look- fried.</li>
            <li> I have med/short thick wavy hair that i like to dry straight and used the Revlon RV484 for a few years, not realizing that it was so darn hot that my hair was getting fried &amp; breaking off!  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for four months and use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It is a tad heavier than I was expecting, but certainly not as heavy as a lot of other blowdryers can be.</li>
            <li> I finally decided I should have one for the rare occasion when I have time to attempt to style my long, thick unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> It has a long (about 6 feet) thick cord and a very large plug that occupies enough of the outlet that you probably can&#x27;t plug anything else in next to it.  </li>
            <li> :) Other reviews have said the buttons are a little small</li>
            <li> I can barely use it long enough to dry my bangs.</li>
            <li> So now I have to wear the front of my hair (long bangs) back in bobby pins, otherwise you&#x27;ll see about 2 or 3 CHUNKS of short hair sticking up.</li>
            <li> Too much heat, or the wrong kind of appliance (uneven heat, harsh metals)</li>
            <li> Or, I use my fingers to grab hair from above and then blow dry from underneath..also getting the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember the \\&quot;bubble cut?\\&quot; Picture dark haired Barbie from the early 60s.</li>
            <li> This model leaves my hair flat and so tangled that I have had to cut the knots out of my hair.</li>
            <li> (thus the need for follow-up with the flat iron).  </li>
            <li> plus I just bought the infinity flat iron.</li>
            <li> When I air-dry it, it just looks flat and greasy with no bounce.  </li>
            <li> Flat curls are the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The air- directed flow dried my hair in 1/3 the normal time.</li>
            <li> I try to blow dry no more than 3 times a week and let it air dry for awhile first whenever possible.</li>
            <li> I have since gone from very long hair to shoulder length, to ear length and short now.</li>
            <li> With this dryer I can quickly dry the hair I have and then head out without wasting a lot of time towel drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: it definitely adds a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> (her old one is about the size of a can of soda) and remove the clear shield from the volume attachment or at least make it removable.  </li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly and all it succeeded in doing was frizzing it out in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; and diffusers really make my curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; but this diffuser doesn&#x27;t really work for me, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> My old one was half the price.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s health, shine, and dry time is reduced over standard hair dryers that do not use the tourmaline technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s health, shine, and dry time is reduced over standard hair dryers that do not use the tourmaline technology.  </li>
            <li> But with this dryer, I can literally get my hair dry root to tip, only scrunching my hair into the diffuser and using circular motions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my hair was dried in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single sweat gland activated since the dryer directed the flow to the hair, not my upper body.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it either, and it is quieter than most comparable products.</li>
            <li> More expensive on other websites and stores.</li>
            <li> The AC motor on this dryer does make a big difference in air flow compared to the other dryers of the same 1875 watt!  </li>
            <li> I got the impression that it would have a regular AC plug, but the connector is just as big as any other dryer plug.)  </li>
            <li> It was happening on a smaller scale without me knowing it for years, then suddenly got worse and my hair is probably about 20% less full at the bottom because of the breakage.</li>
            <li> few things to note: the nozzle gets really hot; it&#x27;s a little bulky to hold with the volume attachment; and the volume attachment takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t wind up using it very often, but I like the concentrator attachment, and that you can call up shots of cold air at the push of a button if it gets two hot.</li>
            <li> I had tried in the past with my old hair dryer, but it took quite a bit of time and still had quite a bit of frizz left and would look as it I just walked through a wind tunnel</li>
            <li> She feels she must have this type of attachment for her limp hair and her old dryer</li>
            <li> I have found a wide variety of results with various brands.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wished i would have purchased this long ago.</li>
            <li> not extremely loud-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is \\&quot;loud\\&quot; but I never really expect a hair dryer to be quiet.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I was missing a coupe attachment pieces, and the box that the product was in not the shipping box, was completely trashed.</li>
            <li> However, when I got the package and opened it, the dryer inside the box was not at ALL the same hairdryer shown or purchased (so I can&#x27;t comment on unknown hairdryer).  </li>
            <li> it gives body without frizz and concentrates the forced air to make drying time so much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Wife noticed the difference right away, it dried her hair in WAY less than her other dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Contrary to the product description, this one is definitely not a lightweight dryer, very bulky and hard to maneuver!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I opened the unit with more skepticism; it was somewhat heavy and it had an attachment that looked like a number of scary plastic sticks on a base that attached to  a fairly standard-looking hair dryer.</li>
            <li> In fact with other dryers, I usually have had to use the maximum setting to dry my hair in any reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not for the weak ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cord is a little short for me to have it plugged in behind my dressing table and still be able to stand in front of it.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to really dry</li>
            <li> It takes me about 20 minutes to dry my hair, so I prefer something that doesn&#x27;t weigh a ton.</li>
            <li> -dry my hair out</li>
            <li> I can usually dry my hair on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting, and the cold-shot works well to finish off my blow-out.</li>
            <li> It took me 5 minutes to dry my hair this morning.  </li>
            <li> so it took longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea; however, a hair tends to get trapped between the plastic shield and the base of the attachment and rip the hair out of my head or break it off.</li>
            <li> I had been using  a Panasonic ionic blow dryer for the longest time and it took me forever to dry my hair and the cone</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to dry my kids&#x27; hair after showers.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer to air dry my hair</li>
            <li> I dry my hair maybe once a week...</li>
            <li> which I air dry 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> The diffuser does NOTHING to my hair; it takes forever just to dry it, and it doesn&#x27;t even enhance my curls nor does it give volume.</li>
            <li> It allows me to get close to my scalp to dry the roots with out damaging the rest of my curls.  </li>
            <li> Now I am damp dry in minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, when I let my hair air dry, it is a frizz-fest.</li>
            <li> so it takes FOREVER to dry my hair</li>
            <li> When I get my hair cut they blow dry it and it takes forever, so</li>
            <li> It takes awhile for it to heat up as it runs and then it does dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I normally dry my hair then straighten it with a 2-1/2&amp;#34; curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought it in-store because the selection was limited</li>
            <li> I have to load it down with several products and let it dry by itself</li>
            <li> Her complaint was that the unit was quite a bit heavier than the dryer she already has, and to make things worse, the handle is narrower, thus making supporting the additional weight harder on her hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked it out, and it was indistunguishable from any other hair dryer to me in it&#x27;s normal function, and the diffuser served no purpose on my short hair.  </li>
            <li> A few months later, on a whim, I ordered a fabulously reviewed and expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> so yes, the bad reviews on the Revlon RV484 are TRUE!!  </li>
            <li> I could hear that something was loose inside.  </li>
            <li> I later regretted it because nothing I could do would get it to go down.</li>
            <li> got this right after cutting my hair into a short inverted bob, so my current style demands that I still flat-iron after drying.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it makes much sense spending half the money I spent on the dryer on shipping.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed as the hair dryer itself is much superior to the dryer I have to use with the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It is built very sturdy, and blows really hard!</li>
            <li> and I can blow dry it now without having to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> Replaced an old hairdryer that was probably getting a bit dangerous as the plug was all messed up and would get hot.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair-dryer for less than a year, and used it only for about 4 months before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> i had this model previously for years that i finally had to stop using.</li>
            <li> I usually blow-dry it straight with round barrel brushes.</li>
            <li> Then the black tiny pieces of plastic in the drawer that dryer was stored made sense.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little easier to change between the volumizer and the isolating attachments during blow drying, but only because I dry my hair in sections.  </li>
            <li> It takes little time to dry my hair, and my hair is long(down to the end of my back).  </li>
            <li> I thought it was due to blond highlights breaking off, but it was still happening after they&#x27;d long grown in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize how slow my old hair dryer was!  </li>
            <li> The switches for speed and heat are small and sometimes when I turn it on I have to be careful to stop the lever at the low setting and not skip past it to high.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old blow dryer and it dried in half the time.  </li>
            <li> ALWAYS GET COMPLEMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERY SINGLE TIME!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that both videos showing women actually using the dryer had curly haired women featured.</li>
            <li> (In humid weather I can get my hair to be a little extra wavy.)  </li>
            <li> The only draw back to me is that it is a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> Feels solid in your hand, but is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My stylist tried to get me to buy one from her for fifty to sixty bucks - no thanks.</li>
            <li> I took the one I bought back and got this one in the mail a few days</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to pick up a power strip to get a few extra inches.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair soaking wet with product in it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful when it comes to styling.  </li>
            <li> It gets used roughly 9 to 12 times a week for over a year now and works as well as the day we got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> big and heavy but drys my hair.</li>
            <li> really not much.</li>
            <li> can capture the bottom of my wet curl clump into the diffuser and let them fall into it.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair faster than a regular dryer with a diffuser and isn&#x27;t as heavy as that combination.  </li>
            <li> I have used this only a few times, but I wanted to give a review.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair faster than I expected and it had different heat settings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new, so it performs well, but it&#x27;s hard to find a convenient place to put this along with the bulky attachment and long heavy cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible about doing my hair, this made it so easy and fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this, since on my other hair dyer they are larger and easier to see.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair upside down for a bit without the attachment and then add it on and create circular motions at my roots.</li>
            <li> Instead I flip my hair over and dry my hair upside down.  </li>
            <li> This dryer cuts my dry time in half.</li>
            <li> The attachment is awkward, but helps make my naturally stick straight hair slightly wavy-think beachy waves, not curling iron curly.</li>
            <li> The little finger things on the diffuser are too long and it makes my hair frizzy with them going into my hair like a comb.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick and it only takes me 10 - 15 minutes to dry my hair verses 20-30 minutes</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after my other Conair dryer broke after a year of use.</li>
            <li> It seemed too small and that small section of my hair didn&#x27;t look any different than it does with a regular hair dryer without an attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a \\&quot;True cold shot\\&quot; button to lock in hair</li>
            <li> Other hair dryers I&#x27;ve tried had heat settings there were off and inaccurate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other attachment, either.  </li>
            <li> Also, i am a tiny petite person with no muscles and can&#x27;t understand why others are complaining about this thing feeling heavy!??  </li>
            <li> (When it was said that unlike other hair dryers it was AC</li>
            <li> Looks like I styled it, do not need curling iron or other gadgets,</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had been wondering where those came from even though I was cleaning the drawer every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight compared to other hair-dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li> and two attachments, one for precision drying, the other (as in the picture) for lifting and volume.  </li>
            <li> Now, mind you, if I brush it at that point, it will frizz unless I use a straightening iron, but I can never let my hair air dry without the frizz, and I hate having to dry my hair straight with a brush then use a curling iron just to try to regain some of the natural wave.</li>
            <li> However, especially when the volumizer attachment is installed, the unit is a little heavy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside I could find would be that it does get a little heavy when styling longer lengths of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get it 95% dry in a few minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually frustrated with the extended dry time ionic hair dryers require but on its highest settings, this one gives my traditional one a run for its money, yet it leaves my hair much smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time of other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is that I have a hard time getting any extra volume from this for some reason.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird is the clear plastic shield on the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It has 1875 watts, so it delivers a powerful blast of air (3 heat settings, plus a \\&quot;cold blast!\\&quot;) and two speed settings.</li>
            <li> only negative thing we found was that it is advertized as lightweight, and my wife, who is the one in the house that uses a hair dryer for herself and our daughter, didn&#x27;t think it was that \\&quot;lightweight.\\</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be quieter, but that is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> a caucasian female with medium - thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair and dries it in  3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I also like the cold-shot because it cools down the dryer, and I don&#x27;t have to put it away hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I bend down with out bending my knees and hair spray my hair</li>
            <li> I take off the scrunchie and bend down again</li>
            <li> What happens is that the air blows down on the lower side and dries the roots below, so you don&#x27;t get the volume.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little heavier than my other hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The diffuser seems to dry faster though than with my past dryers.</li>
            <li> and I usually use the attached diffuser to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I can&#x27;t believe I ever used the other one.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavy compared to all my other ones.</li>
            <li> I can be done with styling my hair to my satiesfaction in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am used to having that on my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> The tool has a plastic shield around it; the idea being that with the plastic shield less air escapes.</li>
            <li> so I find myself using it less and less.</li>
            <li> This took me half the time, no frizz.  </li>
            <li> I do like this diffuser a lot, though I haven&#x27;t noticed any less frizz than with another dryer.  </li>
            <li> part my hair in half and comb out the tangles after that i put gel and mousse in my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this item less then a year ago.</li>
            <li> and it dryed my hair in less than 15 min.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that it would have any impact on the feel of my hair, but my hair seems less frizzy when I have used this dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This dries my hair in less than five minutes</li>
            <li> Also after about a month of use it started shutting off half way through me drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for me, but I don&#x27;t need to use it as long as others I have tried in the past so it balances out in the end.</li>
            <li> I have used diffusers in the past of the typical wide variety</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this drier dries it quicker than any I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> it be coming frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> my hair is not full</li>
            <li> wife travels a lot for work, so after a couple years now, TSA or just general wear and tear has finally broken or worn out her lighter traveling hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I can not use it without the diffuser unless I want tangles and knots in the bottom half of my hair (which is a little longer than shoulder length.)</li>
            <li> I bought this on 6/30/14 and it died today, so lasted a little less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to hold an object in my hand for very long or use my arms for a length of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the dryer&#x27;s performance, it feels well-made, isn&#x27;t too heavy (and I&#x27;m a wimp when it comes to holding up a hair dryer), and it has little rubber nubs on each side that prevent it from sliding off the counter when I put it down.</li>
            <li> hair is really thick, and it could let my hair dry quickly!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the little shield on the diffuser because it does&#x27;t allow you to get the most hair on the diffuser itself and not to mention the diffuser is way too small anyways.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and there were little to NO complaints about hair getting tangled in the process.  </li>
            <li> I did find myself get a little bit of hope</li>
            <li> I use it with the diffuser, drop my curls in, twist a little, and push it to my head and wait.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> So I saved a little money by purchasing online.</li>
            <li> I would buy another but really no need,probably for a life time!!!</li>
            <li> as I expected!!!~~ Haven&#x27;t tried the curl-styling attachment</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mention the button placement to be awkward but they are in the same spot as my last Conair</li>
            <li> The attachment was awkward to handle during the drying process, and you really have no control or manipulation over the style of your curls.  </li>
            <li> Have not got the hang of the round attachment.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not the round brush and blowdryer type (too uncoordinated)</li>
            <li> but even when I use this for a few minutes, my hair doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few downsides.</li>
            <li> Within 15 seconds of turning it on, it pulled a few strands of hair in</li>
            <li> fan speeds and 3 temp settings round out the features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did seem an ounce or two on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> Wish the warranty was longer than a few months.  </li>
            <li> Kinda heavy too.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin, wavy-to-curly blonde hair and this dryer</li>
            <li> It is on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> Even though this dryer is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d had this thing back when, as my hair has always been a bit thin and limp.</li>
            <li> The volumizing attachment is a little crazy looking, and I&#x27;m still not sure if I use it totally correctly, but it definitely adds volume.  </li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon fir $14 less than any store in my area!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used blow dryers in the past when it was cold outside</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the concentrator, I would not need to use the other attachment (remember, thick wavy hair).  </li>
            <li> I usually have to tease my hair a little and then spray it to hold the style...</li>
            <li> A little bit of volume maybe - but not sure if that&#x27;s the product or the dryer -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take the time to fluff my hair up because I do lazy and usually running late.</li>
            <li> and I am usually in a hurry and do not have time to waste drying my hair.</li>
            <li> However she has short arms and found this very difficult to use as it was too long and felt too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I got it in Feb, and it is already broken now for less than 3 months use which is extremely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> There is also an air concentrator attachment, and a wide range of temperature/speed settings including a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; setting that locks in your final hairstyle.</li>
            <li> However, the dryer is heavy and difficult to hold above my head.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment, although it looks incredibly useful, is very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> but I get very little or no frizz when I use this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I hate spending the required time to wear my hair down in the mornings only to have it lay flat against my head by the time I get to work.  </li>
            <li> In the past 40 years, I have owned a lot of portable hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s usually the setting that I use</li>
            <li> But the buttons are small.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s past my chest and is color treated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small gap and doesn&#x27;t trap chunks of hair, but it traps one or two hairs at a time repeatedly every time I use it</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t gush about products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to lazy to return it, and I tossed the box.</li>
            <li> Usually a mark of quality...  </li>
            <li> No more plopping a mass of curls dripping product.</li>
            <li> My five yr ol like that its small.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy and clumsy, though.</li>
            <li> It is like it just sucks out the mousse and leaves my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after my Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer suddenly died after only one year :(</li>
            <li> This dryer is very heavy.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference in the force behind the maximum drying temperature and power setting from other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have heard worse, but this one is no better than average.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the broken hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have those long barrel shaped spirals, the diffuser is very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> What this does is make it hard to get  your curls into the  contraption</li>
            <li> have a hard time using the attachment</li>
            <li> Varying lengths and styles of hair have been treated to it and no one had a negative thing to say.  </li>
            <li> If they would do this she would buy at least 3 dryers just so she would never have to worry about being without it.</li>
            <li> I was using this dryer for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> Fluff attachment is useless - like running rocks across your head.</li>
            <li> so I cannot judge how it would work on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and wear clip-ons</li>
            <li> I have never dropped it and put it away under my cabinet each day, so I can&#x27;t imagine what failed so quickly :(</li>
            <li> Not sure whether they sent me broken one.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> she says the end is especially heavy makeing it hard to style her hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not fit the hair dryer I already owned.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, the button to lock/unlock the fused plug just broke and the hair dryer now randomly changes power and heat on its own.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed about the cheap material and thus quality of this product.</li>
            <li> If you do have thick hair, or medium hair, or anything there is a setting for you!</li>
            <li> AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE THICK CURLY HAIR DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!</li>
            <li> Not only did it stop working, but it became a very dangerous hazard.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has very thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> My arm does get tired.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> this one is by far the worst one I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Even a combination of an expensive conditioner and leave-in detangler failed to improve this ongoing problem.</li>
            <li> I bought a different one and it was horrible</li>
            <li> and you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Having always been hair dryer- challenged, I was quite skeptical of this unit from Conair that promised \\&quot;Volume</li>
            <li> Just some random brown box.</li>
            <li> Weird</li>
            <li> With three heat settings, two speed settings, and a cold shot feature, it allows a variety of uses, depending on a person&#x27;s styling needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i know it sounds crazy but just trust me on this</li>
            <li> This blowdryer has two speeds and two heat settings plus a cold shot.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stand by the claim that it&#x27;s going to produce insane amounts of volume, maybe if you have naturally thick curly hair but not if your hair is like mine.going to produce insane amounts of volume, maybe if you have naturally thick curly hair but not if your hair is like mine.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is bad, bad and bad...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sick puppy :</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but I was SO disappointed with this item that I just had to.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> made me look crazy!  </li>
            <li> I can smell something is burned inside which means it is very dangerous.</li>
            <li> Hate the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I got a haircut that requires some blow drying and wanted an upgrade from the travel size piece of crap I had before.</li>
            <li> I used to hate blow drying my hair but with this thing its a breeze</li>
            <li> The loop on the base of the handle allows me to hang it from my wall shelf</li>
            <li> and I hate hairspray.</li>
            <li> I hated that I was sweating by the time my hair was dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I may consider packing this one for work trips - hotel dryers are miserable.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> A little heavier than I thought it would be. Have not got the hang of the round attachment.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is too powerful.  I can not use it without the diffuser unless I want tangles and knots in the bottom half of my hair (which is a little longer than shoulder length.)</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for a &amp;#34;volume boost dryer&amp;#34; and I looked to Amazon and found what I needed.This is a top of the line hair dryer with everything&lt;br /&gt;you need with 2 attachments, one being a concentrator, for pin point air&lt;br /&gt;flow and then the volumnizor, which is the attachment I use because of my very fine hair. I&#x27;m glad I made this choice of all the hair dryer&#x27;s that are out there. So many to choose to from, but this is what I was looking for, 1875 watts of fast drying performance that uses ionic ceramic technology which gives you frizz-free hair. This unit has 3 heat settings with 2 speed&lt;br /&gt;air flow and a blue button that give you a &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; of air. It has a removable filter on the end for quick cleaning of lint and hair which helps&lt;br /&gt;extend the motor life. I like this unit so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I have really really really flat hair and using the volumizing tool really gave a boost to my hair. It took a while to start getting my hair dry while using it, so I really recommend using the high/hot setting when using the volumizer so it will help dry your hair as well. All the buttons work, and overall is completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (with a slight bit of &#x27;getting the feel of it&#x27;!).</li>
            <li> The volume dryer works fairly well. While I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to really dry (I have some but no where near the level a woman would have) I constantly will pop out of the shower in the morning and see it&#x27;s below zero outside. The last thing I want to do is head out and try to pick the icicles out of my hair (which happens occasionally). With this dryer I can quickly dry the hair I have and then head out without wasting a lot of time towel drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: it definitely adds a lot of volume. For fun the first time I used it I pushed my hair up... I later regretted it because nothing I could do would get it to go down. The fro effect on me definitely was interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way it does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good retail hair dryer. My issue is that I do not need a volumizing hair dryer with all my hair. So, I found it good, but not great. However, it worked better for family members. I did like that it was lighter than my current blow dryer.</li>
            <li> After passing it around amongst various family members for a while now, the Conair 276R Infinity Pro has earned universal praise.  Varying lengths and styles of hair have been treated to it and no one had a negative thing to say.  I won&#x27;t pretend to know or appreciate what \\&quot;ionic ceramic\\&quot; technology brings to this particular product, but the results speak for themselves and I suspect that as various other households in our family come to the point that a new hair dryer is necessary, this will be the solid choice!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked very well.  It is lighter than my old hair dryer and worked much faster to dry my hair.  I love the big attachment, it is great for separating out my hair while drying, speeding up the process.  All the speeds and heat levels work well.  No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!  Curls are so much more defined and I don&#x27;t need to use as much heat.</li>
            <li> this is a good  dryer. would have preferred 3 speeds in both power and speed tho. The accessories are nice if you use them</li>
            <li> Dried my hair using this lovely thing this morning. I haven&#x27;t used a non-Chi blow-dryer at home - when traveling, I am stuck with those cheap hotel blow dryers but anyway - and the Conair surprised me. I also was never a big fan of these big attachments but it worked. I have very long hair and like to straighten it with volume, and it has exactly that. Straightening WITH volume. I love it. Also very light and many settings for adjusting heat level. Will be using this puppy a good many times.</li>
            <li> For half my life I rocked a long pony tail, but I lopped it off last year, sent it to Locks of Love, and never looked back. I wish I&#x27;d had this thing back when, as my hair has always been a bit thin and limp. But even with a shorter brown mop on top, I can see that this thing actually works! I probably won&#x27;t wind up using it very often, but I like the concentrator attachment, and that you can call up shots of cold air at the push of a button if it gets two hot. Plus two speeds--TWO! OK, all hair driers probably have that... But I still dig it! Maybe I&#x27;ll grow my hair back out...</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me just say I am not one to get excited about blow dryers, since I have naturally curly hair and usually air dry. I&#x27;ve only used blow dryers in the past when it was cold outside and I really needed to dry my hair before going out into the tundra. So it was really for my health, not beauty. Occasionally, I would use a diffuser to get a nice spirally curl. This device has brought my beauty regimen to a whole new level. First of all, I love that it has so many different settings on it - low, med, and high plus warm, warmer, and hot, and even a cold setting if you need just cold air! So people with fine, delicate hair like mine can put it on a very light setting and not feel like I&#x27;m singing my hair or face. If you do have thick hair, or medium hair, or anything there is a setting for you! Secondly, this attachment is incredible. I had no idea what it was about so I watched a video. You put this right up to your hair and lift it slightly upward as you blow dry and it gives your hair incredible body without the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing! My old blow dryer went straight to good will. Finally, I have a hair dryer for the 21st Century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - this product has a four year warranty!</li>
            <li> The Conair 276 is like bringing the Salon home with you.  I love the ionizing attachment that runs thru my hair like a comb drying and fluffing it from the roots outwards.  It has a sleek design and fits easily into my suitcase for easy portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is far more powerful that other hand dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I can be done with styling my hair to my satiesfaction in less than 10 minutes.  Very important when you&#x27;re running late for work as I do in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to switch the attachments from the Ionizer to the concentrated Blower attachement.  There are three heat and two speed settings that meet any hair emergency you might have.  There is a convenient filter that can be removed that help keeps hair and lint out of the motor insuring a longer life.  It&#x27;s slso light weight so that it won&#x27;t feel like your working out with dumbells like you do with bigger dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy styling with mine and I know you will too!</li>
            <li> Replaced an old hairdryer that was probably getting a bit dangerous as the plug was all messed up and would get hot. This dryer is supercharged, so good if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer at first. This would have been a 5 stare review, BUT this product did not even last me a year. And when I wanted to exchange it. They messaged me and said it&#x27;s not eligible for return. I didn&#x27;t want to return it I just wanted to exchange it. What happen to customer satisfaction!!!???</li>
            <li> This is a high quality dryer, easily comparable to the dryers that professional hair stylists use.  Overall, I am very happy with it and it does a lovely job.  However, especially when the volumizer attachment is installed, the unit is a little heavy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER LIGHT USE SINCE THE DRYER WAS FIRST REVIEWED, THE MOTOR BURNED OUT IN APRIL 2013.</li>
            <li> First off, this dryer is beautiful. I love the deep metallic purple color. Happens to be my favorite color, so I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very well made. Feels solid in your hand, but is not too heavy. You won&#x27;t end up with a sore arm or shoulder after using it for extended periods of time. It takes me about 20 minutes to dry my hair, so I prefer something that doesn&#x27;t weigh a ton. It is comfortable to hold and controls are easy to use and switch between during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has enough settings to get your desired style - Hot, warm and cool for heat and low &amp; high power flow. I would have liked to have a medium power setting as well though. I am used to having that on my previous dryer. It has not overheated and shut off on me at all yet, even though it takes me a pretty long time to dry my hair. That is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cool shot feature, which is used by holding the blue trigger button in. That is a must have feature for me. By the time I am about done drying my hair, my roots and scalp are getting hot and somewhat sweatty/damp since it takes so long for me. The cool shot is nice because I can use that for a few short minutes and cool my head down and get rid of that dampness and set in my style. It is also nice to use on your face for a few seconds to cool down if you&#x27;re getting hot while blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volumizing attachment works pretty good, but is somewhat bulky. I usually skip that and just blow dry from underneath and have the same great results. Or, I use my fingers to grab hair from above and then blow dry from underneath..also getting the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the concentrator attachment and never have with any dryer. That attachment seems to come standard with pretty much every full size dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good with this dryer, but I will update if any issues arise. It is well worth the price with such great looks and performance.</li>
            <li> I went to visit a girlfriend over the weekend and forgot my own blowdryer...She had this one. I didn&#x27;t have a choice in the matter, so I used it..WOW WOW WOW!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe what it did to my hair.It was soft looking and shiny.I usually have to tease my hair a little and then spray it to hold the style...With this one I did not. After I left my friends house I went to a high end clothing store to get some pants I needed. I received many compliments on my hair from strangers...I went out to Bed,Bath and Beyond and found it and bought it!!!! The amazon price is much better than the one I got but this is by far the best blowdryer that I have ever used and purchased!!! All I can say is get it!!!!</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer but VERY loud!</li>
            <li> Contrary to the product description, this one is definitely not a lightweight dryer, very bulky and hard to maneuver!  Does not give the same volume and fullness as my 17-year old dryer.  Thinking of returning it already.</li>
            <li> It is for my daughter with all of her curls. She is still getting used to it, but is simple, easy to use and really tightens her curls after her showers. This product does what it says. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She has an old hairdryer of a different brand with a volumizing attachment just like this only with out the clear shield on it.  She feels she must have this type of attachment for her limp hair and her old dryer is starting to go out on her so she was very happy to find this hairdryer.  However she has short arms and found this very difficult to use as it was too long and felt too heavy.  she says the end is especially heavy makeing it hard to style her hair.  Also she says the clear sheld is more in the way than it is useful.  If conair reads these reviews,  she begs and pleades, please redesign this hairdryer.  Make it shorter (her old one is about the size of a can of soda) and remove the clear shield from the volume attachment or at least make it removable.  If they would do this she would buy at least 3 dryers just so she would never have to worry about being without it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter. She was excited to get it!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and I love this dryer.  the volumerizer/difuser attachment works great.  It really drys to the scalp and gives lots of lift and volume.  My hair turns out really curly and full.  One of the best dryers I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has a ton of settings, I really like the color as well.  Great quality.  I would highly recommend this blow dryer and especially if you have curly hair and like to do your hair that way.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hairdryer. I prefer hairdryers with combs at the end as it makes it easier for me to blow-dry my hair out but I guess that is not the purpose of this hairdryer. It did dry my hair very quickly which is a plus for people who just need to dry their hair and get going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly and all it succeeded in doing was frizzing it out in less than 5 minutes. Not a plus for me but this is a good hair dryer for those with naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very nice, powerful little dryer, comfortable to hold.  Has a nice length cord which makes styling easy.  While the volumnizing pic takes a little practice to get used to, it does a great job adding body to my fine hair and without frizz.  The following day I still had more body than usual.  The concentrator works great with a styling brush for a long lasting style.  The cold shot button is great for locking in waves and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very nice and unique feature I found was the removable filter, which can be a real safety issue for fire hazard.  The outside filter turns right off, and the coatings on both filters allow them to wipe clean very easily.  No more trying to get some sort of brush in there to clean out the dust build-up.  The loop at the end of the dryer handle allows you the option of safely hanging up the dryer without risk of it dropping to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I could find would be that it does get a little heavy when styling longer lengths of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair has always been a trusted name and the InFiniti Pro Volume Boost Dryer is another great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using a blow-dryer type hair dryer since the early 1970&#x27;s, since I pretty much have always worn my hair fairly long, in a style that I feel flatters my face.  In order to get my hair to fall the way I like it, a blow-dryer is essential.  In the past 40 years, I have owned a lot of portable hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although most people believe that all blow-dryers are essentially the same, they are not.  I have found a wide variety of results with various brands.  Because I am very picky about how my hair looks, I once actually tossed away a perfectly good dryer because I didn&#x27;t like the way it styled my hair.  And in all the time I&#x27;ve been using them, the brand I have come to trust most is Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I was not quite ready for the exceptional quality of the 276R Infiniti Pro-Volume Dryer.  The dryer feels quite sturdy and I don&#x27;t expect it would break if I were to drop it on the floor (which happened to me once with another brand).  The 276R also has several safety features (now quite standard) which I definitely appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, however, is the power.  You can feel the difference in the force behind the maximum drying temperature and power setting from other brands.  In fact with other dryers, I usually have had to use the maximum setting to dry my hair in any reasonable amount of time.  The 276R Infiniti needs only the medium setting to out-power most other dryers, and I can save the maximum setting for times when I am in a real hurry, like if I&#x27;m late for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I believe that Conair is the best name in portable hair dryers, and the 276R Infiniti is one of the best Conair models I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser attachment.  Dries my hair quickly on the medium and hot settings and leaves it nice and curly.</li>
            <li> The concentrator attachment is like any other and does what it should to dry your hair straight.  The dryer does a decent job smoothing hair, but if you have frizzy hair, like me, you will still need to use your flat iron to smooth away the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the temperature settings are good - not scorching hot.  But this dryer blows with too much force.  I have to use it on low otherwise it will make my hair snarly while I am blow drying it straight with a paddle brush.  So, all in all, this is a good dryer for straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have those long barrel shaped spirals, the diffuser is very poorly designed.  I don&#x27;t see why this hair dryer costs as much as it does, especially for this tiny diffuser they give you.  All girls with curly hair know that you need a larger diffuser with evenly and wider spaced teeth.  This diffuser is very compact and the teeth are way too close together -less than a quarter inch between them in the middle and spaced out a bit further around the ends.  Also, there are these rubber tips on some of the teeth (they do pull off) that serve no helpful purpose for curls.  What this does is make it hard to get  your curls into the  contraption and once you do, the teeth pull at your locks when you bring the dryer out of your hair to go to a new section.  This constant pulling of my hair was like combing it while trying to curl it.  It just doesn&#x27;t work that way unless I want to go for the Jane from Tarzan look like my husband said I had.  And it adds to the amount of frizz I have because it is separating my curls continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you need for curls is shorter teeth that are set on a wider diffuser and further spaced.  Oh and the heat shield eliminated any volume you ever dreamed of achieving or keeping.  My husband had to unscrew the diffuser to take that out.  And we bent the teeth to space them further, but to no avail, it still doesn&#x27;t work right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution for me was to buy a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  I have never been happy with conair products.  I won&#x27;t be buying one again.y a $10 cheaper and better hair dryer from revelon.  I have never been happy with conair products.  I won&#x27;t be buying one again.</li>
            <li> So far a very good hair dryer, but I have not found a use for the extending part for volume.  It did not have a strong enough blower with the attachment and I am usually in a hurry and do not have time to waste drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the dryer.  Hate the diffuser.  I am a &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; and diffusers really make my curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; but this diffuser doesn&#x27;t really work for me, unfortunately.  I had to get a different hair dryer which is NOT as good but has the normal style of diffuser.  A little disappointed as the hair dryer itself is much superior to the dryer I have to use with the diffuser.  If someone can tell me how to USE this diffuser, I would appreciate it.  Perhaps I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Remember the \\&quot;bubble cut?\\&quot; Picture dark haired Barbie from the early 60s. That&#x27;s what I was thinking after I used the \\&quot;infinitipro\\&quot; with the volumizing pik attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer has so many features, it must be \\&quot;the Lady Gaga of hairdryers!\\&quot; It has 1875 watts, so it delivers a powerful blast of air (3 heat settings, plus a \\&quot;cold blast!\\&quot;) and two speed settings. It has \\&quot;ionic technology\\&quot; that generates a cloud of negative ions that can neutralize the generally positive charge of flyaway hair, eliminate static electricity and contribute to shine. It has \\&quot;ceramic heat technology,\\&quot; a full spectrum infrared heat that works on molecules inside the hair shaft, drying it inside and out to minimize heat damage. It comes with two attachments: \\&quot;concentrator\\&quot; and \\&quot;volumizing pik.\\&quot; And for safety, it has an Appliance Leakage Circuit Interrupter (ALCI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, although the directions were printed in both English and Spanish, the directions for how to use the volumizing pik were only printed in Spanish so I had to go to the Conair website and hope that I could learn how to use the pik there. (I did.) In addition to learning how to use the volumizing pik, the website directions also informed me on \\&quot;body and volume,\\&quot; \\&quot;straightening,\\&quot; and \\&quot;making waves.\\&quot; I also learned that my best looks \\&quot;begin with a good haircut that&#x27;s well maintained.\\&quot; In other words, get a precision cut and use this Conair \\&quot;infinitipro\\&quot; precisely for hair that looks glamorous and sets your face off to its best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former hairdryer is also a Conair that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with for years. It&#x27;s a much simpler version of this one -- it doesn&#x27;t have the volumizing pik and it does not have a removable filter as does this \\&quot;infinitipro\\&quot; (model 276).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want a more bouffant look with \\&quot;volume, volume, volume,\\&quot; I&#x27;ll be opting for this new dryer (over my old one), and I&#x27;ll be using the volumizing pik attachment. This is a very nice product that Conair has obviously invested a lot of design technology in!n technology in!</li>
            <li> This is a great, basic hairdryer.  The speed and temperature are easily changed while using it, it&#x27;s quieter than many hair dryers, it&#x27;s small and light yet and dries faster than conventional hair dryers--about as fast as my ceramic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have fine long 3b-4b curly hair and used to have so much trouble bringing out my curls with out it be coming frizzy mess. This helps define my curls and add body without all the frizz. I&#x27;ve had my dryer for over two years without any problems but I bought a second one so I will have another ready. Fantastic bargain!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fabulous! It sounds like you are using a blender but it works great. Not sure why others have said it doesn&#x27;t get hot - it totally does. I have fine thin hair and this dryer really makes a difference. Love the pick attachment. An tempted to buy another as a backup it&#x27;s so fabulous. Am thinking of giving as Christmas gifts this year! Love it!</li>
            <li> I got a haircut that requires some blow drying and wanted an upgrade from the travel size piece of crap I had before. My stylist tried to get me to buy one from her for fifty to sixty bucks - no thanks. I am an amateur when it comes to blow dryers and honestly I had no idea what to look for except for something with good reviews. After using it a few times, I can&#x27;t believe I ever used the other one. The motor on it doesn&#x27;t screech, which is wonderful. I use the warm setting on low and its perfect - doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other dryers have. I am using it with the pick attachment (new to me) and it really does make a difference with hair volume. I used to hate blow drying my hair but with this thing its a breeze and my hair looks a lot better than air dried.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot belive that I have been using this dryer for as long as I have. I have waist length naturally curly hair and I use a dryer with a diffuser almost every day of my life and this one is by far the worst one I have ever bought.I absolutely hate the little shield on the diffuser because it does&#x27;t allow you to get the most hair on the diffuser itself and not to mention the diffuser is way too small anyways. The little finger things on the diffuser are too long and it makes my hair frizzy with them going into my hair like a comb.  I would not reccommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after my other Conair dryer broke after a year of use. I really liked the old one so I thought this one would be similar. This model leaves my hair flat and so tangled that I have had to cut the knots out of my hair. I threw the box away after receiving it so I can&#x27;t return it. So now I will also be throwing the hair dryer away.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is definitely powerful, which is a must for me, and a bit noisy.  Most people will find the low setting to be strong enough to suit most hair drying needs.  The noise doesn&#x27;t bother me and wouldn&#x27;t stop me from repurchasing. The volumizing pick attachment seems to work good even though I&#x27;ve only used a few times.</li>
            <li> The Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Boost Hair Dryer is a good dryer with some features, most notably the volume boost attachment.  With three heat settings, two speed settings, and a cold shot feature, it allows a variety of uses, depending on a person&#x27;s styling needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing we found was that it is advertized as lightweight, and my wife, who is the one in the house that uses a hair dryer for herself and our daughter, didn&#x27;t think it was that \\&quot;lightweight.\\&quot;  Sure, she is smaller, but when she tried this one beside the one I got her for Christmas a year ago, also made by Conair, she liked that one better because it was lighter and easier for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes this model as far as quality goes, and she likes the various settings and attachments, but she still likes the lighter one better for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because it said it speeds up drying time up to 50%. My girlfriend loved it! she says it took 15 mins off her normal drying time. She loved how much smoother and shinier it made her hair. I was pretty excited that she was ready a little faster...and then I heard  \\&quot;Baby, I&#x27;m almost ready, I just have to put my makeup on....\\&quot; oh well...somethings never change lol ;)</li>
            <li> What a great hair dryer for fast drying, no frizz, and no damage to my very fine, permed hair.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, has a nice variety of heat and speed settings, and hangs on a hook.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a medical condition, my once silky, baby fine, long locks had become a thinning, tangled nightmare. Even a combination of an expensive conditioner and leave-in detangler failed to improve this ongoing problem. When I saw this hair dryer offered, I recalled how much I once loved the detangling aspect of a previous dryer with volumizing attachment and knew I had to have it. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually frustrated with the extended dry time ionic hair dryers require but on its highest settings, this one gives my traditional one a run for its money, yet it leaves my hair much smoother and shinier. Where this product earns my highest raves, however, is with the volumizer attachment. Thanks to it, I now have again what I thought I&#x27;d lost forever: no tangles! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I see that most people like the extra power and special features of this hairdryer. I didn&#x27;t find it faster or better than average full-sized dryers, and it is considerably heavier and more complicated, with a price that is higher than most (although not in the high-end bracket). So, for me, there&#x27;s nothing special about this, and I&#x27;d opt for something simpler, lighter and cheaper. On the other hand, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it either, and it is quieter than most comparable products.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  I read the reviews at Amazon.com before I made the purchase, which made me aware of some cons of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found those cons to be negligible overall.  I had a Conair 1875 before and used it to death.  This one is just a better version of what I had before.  Granted, it does not get as hot, but my hair feels better for it.  After styling, my hair feels very smooth and shiny.  I am very pleased with both attachments and the attachment lock on the dryer.  My old one did not have that option, and the attachments would fall off while in use.  I also like that this dryer is smaller than my old one and weighs about the same.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with this hair dryer but I do really like it. I&#x27;m not a fancy girl when it comes to doing my hair-I like just get it over with and get on with my day-and I really enjoy that this hair dryer dries my hair really quickly. It has three heat settings-Hot, Warm, Cool and two levels of High and Low. It has two attachments to help your styling needs, which is nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have any complaints. Although, if I did have to say something negative, it would be that I would prefer the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting to be a little more hot. That&#x27;s usually the setting that I use and I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference between &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;warm&#x27;. But other than that, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to review this hairdryer!  I used this on my daughters hair (which is soooo thick) and I&#x27;m absolutely sure it cut the time in half!  Seriously.  The  attachment was the key!  As it lifted, separated and increased the volume, it dried it so much faster and there were little to NO complaints about hair getting tangled in the process.  Loved the different heat settings as well - I don&#x27;t want to burn her hair but I want it dried NOW and the 2 different speed settings were awesome.  I used the slower one around her face where there is baby-fine hair and the faster setting for the back.  I did notice that the filter got a bit hot so I don&#x27;t recommend using all the time for any length of time.  For this price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I have another conair hairdryer and I like it a lot. I thought I would give this one a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but it is a little heavier than my other hairdryer. My arm does get tired. The settings are good. Love the low, med, high. But the buttons are small. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this, since on my other hair dyer they are larger and easier to see. I found the mouth of the hair dryer(can you call it that?) smaller than the one I currently own, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I like the way it dries my hair. It isn&#x27;t to loud either when I am holding it up to my head, which is good. I have sensitive hearing and sometimes hairdryers can make you feel like you are going deaf.  The attachments are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product. I would highly recommend it despite the fact it is heavier and the buttons are smaller.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my new Conair Infiniti Pro hair dryer.  Ironically, I bought this at a store and before I even got the chance to use it, this same dryer was offered to me through the Amazon Vine program.  I took the one I bought back and got this one in the mail a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I chose this one in the store were that it was about middle of the pack price-wise, powerful (1875W), had different heat settings with cold shot, and I liked the look of it.  Since using it for a while, here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not quite as loud as my last one and has a lower pitch that is a little more agreeable to me.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m waking up the whole neighborhood when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple heat and speed settings are great for my very fine frizz-prone hair and the cold shot is great for when I&#x27;m starting to get too hot and need a cool blast.&lt;br /&gt;- The loop on the base of the handle allows me to hang it from my wall shelf so it&#x27;s off my counter but I don&#x27;t have to unplug and stash in a drawer every day.&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments are easy to put on and take off, but I haven&#x27;t used them much so I can&#x27;t give any insight on them.  Even without the concentrator attachment the air feels pretty well contained for drying one particular area (like my bangs).&lt;br /&gt;- Even though the handle doesn&#x27;t fold up like some I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s relatively small and lightweight which makes it easy to pack and take along when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s purple.&lt;br /&gt;- The switches for speed and heat are small and sometimes when I turn it on I have to be careful to stop the lever at the low setting and not skip past it to high.</li>
            <li> I bought this at TJMaxx (Amazon&#x27;s price is better, but I needed it immediately), and I am very happy with the find. I have fine, curly hair and this is the first hairdryer I&#x27;ve used that can handle styling it either curly or straight. The diffuser attachment works better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried and gives me soft, smooth curls. When I want to blow-dry it straight, the concentrator plus the high power of the highest speed setting blow it out quickly and without frizz. I can usually dry my hair on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting, and the cold-shot works well to finish off my blow-out. I also like the cold-shot because it cools down the dryer, and I don&#x27;t have to put it away hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this right after cutting my hair into a short inverted bob, so my current style demands that I still flat-iron after drying. However, if I still had my long hair, this blows my hair out so smoothly that I think I could get away with just drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the dryer&#x27;s performance, it feels well-made, isn&#x27;t too heavy (and I&#x27;m a wimp when it comes to holding up a hair dryer), and it has little rubber nubs on each side that prevent it from sliding off the counter when I put it down. It&#x27;s kind of loud, but not unbearably, and the fact that it takes less time to dry my hair makes up for the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for four months and use it every other day. Hopefully it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I finally found the tool to make my hair look like I just walked out of my salon!  I followed the instructions for adding volume to curly hair and in 5 minutes my hair looked amazing!  Planning on many good hair days.  Five minutest, salon awesomeness!  It is also very gentle on hair.  The plastic shield feels very hot, but your hair will probably dry fast enough so that it won&#x27;t overheat.  I have short hair if that helps.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer! I&#x27;m terrible about doing my hair, this made it so easy and fast! love ! love ! love!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is reasonably light, and easy to manage.  The volumizing attachment actually does what they claim.  I&#x27;ve also used it as a comb while drying, and it worked well for that as well.  The mid-level heat is the same temperature as hot on my old dryer, and high heat is even better.  It&#x27;s easy to use the controls while holding the dryer, too.  It took me 5 minutes to dry my hair this morning.  It had been taking 10-15 minutes with my old dryer.  My only complaint is that the cord is a little short for me to have it plugged in behind my dressing table and still be able to stand in front of it.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to pick up a power strip to get a few extra inches.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, the button to lock/unlock the fused plug just broke and the hair dryer now randomly changes power and heat on its own.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed about the cheap material and thus quality of this product.</li>
            <li> the diffuser locks in place, which is very cool because most diffusers snap on and my last one would continually fall off when I used it</li>
            <li> I had a older conair that was hotter than this one.  I&#x27;m sure my hair will appreciate not being overheated, but it takes soo much longer to dry my hair than it used to.  I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  My old one was half the price.</li>
            <li> The quality of the item for the price you pay is outstanding. I absolutely love this hair dryer. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my hair was dried in under 5 minutes. I used it on my hair soaking wet with product in it. I used the root drying attachment and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair dry so evenly and fast. The only complaint I have would be that the ends of the root-drying / volumizing attachment don&#x27;t feel great on your head but if you don&#x27;t apply pressure (or don&#x27;t let it touch your scalp) then it would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a caucasian female with medium - thick hair that&#x27;s past my chest and is color treated. I use volumizing spray and straightening gel from aussie when I blow-dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this blow dryer does a great job. It does not make it frizz or look gross. It does an awesome job on my hair type.</li>
            <li> For those of us with short cropped and curly hair, this hair dryer fits the bill.  It provides a strong air flow to help keep the curls and waves to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer - perhaps the best I&#x27;ve ever owned in all my 50 years.  The buttons are perfect - no bumping by accident.  The diffuser locks in place - no flipping off while styling.  It drys my curls so fast and NO FRIZZ - adds nice volume to crown.  Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair-dryer for less than a year, and used it only for about 4 months before it stopped working. Not only did it stop working, but it became a very dangerous hazard. The heating element was still working, but the fan was not, so it would get EXTREMELY hot and smell like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair that is not thin, but it&#x27;s very fine so I have to be really careful when it comes to styling.  Too much heat, or the wrong kind of appliance (uneven heat, harsh metals) and I will have to cut my hair off. I did a lot of research before I bought this dryer. I have found that ionic/ceramic technology is a great method for drying my hair faster while using less heat, particularly if the dryer has a stronger motor.  I try to blow dry no more than 3 times a week and let it air dry for awhile first whenever possible. I had one for years that I liked well enough, but it had a weaker motor so it took longer to dry my hair. I hated that I was sweating by the time my hair was dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for 4 months, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  It delivers on all of it&#x27;s claims.  My hair is soft and shiny, not burned, not frizzy, It is fairly quiet as blow dryers go, definitely powerful, and ergonomic.  It is of lighter weight than many others like it, but still a bit heavy if you have to hold it for a really long time.  An pitfall to a better motor, and one I&#x27;m willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;volumizing attachment&amp;#34; (diffuser) is decent and I use it sometimes, but it has an issue.  The &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; are pretty smooth and long, which is good for grabbing and volumizing longer hair.  The tool has a plastic shield around it; the idea being that with the plastic shield less air escapes. The air coming out of the drying stays concentrated on the hair you&#x27;re drying. It&#x27;s a great idea; however, a hair tends to get trapped between the plastic shield and the base of the attachment and rip the hair out of my head or break it off. It&#x27;s a small gap and doesn&#x27;t trap chunks of hair, but it traps one or two hairs at a time repeatedly every time I use it so I find myself using it less and less. That tool was one of the selling features for me and this was the reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. Still, I would buy it again without that tool or with a different version of it.  I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.  There is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s health, shine, and dry time is reduced over standard hair dryers that do not use the tourmaline technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love having heat and speed settings separate.  I use high speed warm heat.  The heat setting are &amp;#34;hot, warm, cool&amp;#34;.  Cool air works great for setting my hair before I turn the dryer off.  If I leave my hair hot, it goes flat and starts to lose it&#x27;s style before it cools off, wasting my precious time and effort. The cool air is great!  However, the blue &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t shoot out cool air very well.  It&#x27;s cooler than the warm air setting, but not truly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s better to just turn the heat setting to cool and cool all the hair down from the roots before turning the dryer off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hair look and health; price (very competitive!); separate heat/speed settings; size; overall quality; warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hair pulling issue with the &amp;#34;Volumizing tool&amp;#34;; cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really shoot cool air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I definitely recommend this hair dryer.  I can only speak to my fine hair that is partly straight and partly curly (a maddening hair type!). The weight is reasonable considering the power and features so if you have to hold it for a longer time than I do, my hope is that you find this one easier than some of the comparable dryers that are much heavier and bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me if you found this review helpful.  Please ask me if you have questions.  Thanks!with a different version of it.  I very much like the way my hair looks and feels after using this dryer.

            <li> read all the reviews prior to purchasing.  Wanted a strong blowdryer -- This is it!!!!! amazing, very powerful - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The best so far that I have purchased.  More expensive on other websites and stores. No issues with it so far....</li>
            <li> Great lift for thick curly hair.  The 4 out of five stars is for the noise.  I bought this as a replacement for a noisy dryer, but got another noisy one.  Cool button easy to reach and dryer doesn&#x27;t cause frizz, so definitely buy it if everyone is awake by the time of day you use it.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  my hair normally takes 30 minutes or more to dry and now takes 15 or less.  also, i have super wavy thick hair and always need to flat iron.  i&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer and a paddly brush and my hair is straight and full.  never has this happened before.  i highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My old Conair hairdryer died after six plus years and so I set out to find a replacement. I read probably hundreds of reviews, blogs, and websites on the pros and cons of different dryers before settling on this one. I&#x27;ll tell you what sold me - it said volume in the name, in the reviews, in the description and that&#x27;s what I want. I was a little worried that both videos showing women actually using the dryer had curly haired women featured. My hair is stick straight and baby fine - think Marsha Brady - very little natural volume. I long ago stopped fighting to curl it or tease it because by mid-morning it&#x27;ll be back to doing what it does naturally - hang straight down. I did find myself get a little bit of hope though - websites claimed that ceramic was the best for volume and straight hair. The girls in the videos all had big bouncy supermodel hair, reviewers were proclaiming love. The thing is this dryer is not a miracle worker for my type of hair. I added product, tried to follow what the videos did and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dramatically different. A little bit of volume maybe - but not sure if that&#x27;s the product or the dryer - and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s more than what I had with my previous blow-dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note: the nozzle gets really hot; it&#x27;s a little bulky to hold with the volume attachment; and the volume attachment takes a bit of getting used to. On the pro side: it puts out less noise than my cheap drugstore replacement I was using until this arrives; it does seem to dry my hair faster; and it&#x27;s much smaller than my previous Conair (also an Ionic dryer). One nice feature my last dryer had, you could turn off the ions (supposedly) by pushing a button - this one doesn&#x27;t have that. Some reviewers mention the button placement to be awkward but they are in the same spot as my last Conair and I don&#x27;t see a problem with it. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with how it performs and I hope I get six years out of it. I just can&#x27;t stand by the claim that it&#x27;s going to produce insane amounts of volume, maybe if you have naturally thick curly hair but not if your hair is like mine.going to produce insane amounts of volume, maybe if you have naturally thick curly hair but not if your hair is like mine.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this at a CVS out of desperation a couple summer&#x27;s ago. Didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but it was fast and left my hair so polished. Dropped it on the floor and noticed it wasn&#x27;t drying as fast, so I went out and bought another. A few months later, on a whim, I ordered a fabulously reviewed and expensive dryer. I was hoping to cut my drying time down even more, but I still go back to my Infiniti Pro. My other dryer gets so hot and leaves my hair frizzy and damp. Overall, this dryer is a blessing! TOTALLY worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have only had the hair dryer for a week, but I love it! It tames my frizzy hair and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used the Conair Infiniti Pro Dryer 4x now and each time my hair looks better and better, as I am getting more skilled at using it.  I bought this styling tool after hours of searching the internet for the best hair dryer and looked at endless reviews.  I was in search for a blow dryer with a diffuser for my natural curly hair, and this tool gives LIFE to my overly heated curls.  No more frizz, my curls are bouncy and full of body, and it even has a great tool for straightening your hair,  It makes blow drying your hair faster and leaves hair feeling smooth.  I can&#x27;t boost enough about this styling tool.  Oh I even dropped it once and it still works beautifully.  I am not the type to leave comments or feedback, but I had to inform anyone who is in search of a excellent styling tool to LOOK NO FURTHER YOU HAVE FOUND IT.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how amazing this Volume dryer is. The volume dryer straightens my hair a whole lot better than these salons near my house that charge $50 $60. Well worth the money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. Unlike others, I have had no issues with any plastic coming out. I use it with the diffuser, drop my curls in, twist a little, and push it to my head and wait. My curls come out perfect every time, with minimal frizz. I love that it has adjustable heat/power settings, so it keeps me from having to fry or blast my hair. It is also nice to have the cool setting to &#x27;set&#x27; my curls after they are mostly dry.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase, the dryer has alot of power! I would highly reccomend this dryer. The dryer gave my hair lots of volume also.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. Quick, easy to use, and my hair looks amazing Thanks so much. I usually don&#x27;t gush about products. THIS was a great find!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, the diffuser and wing tip piece snap into place so they never fall off while using.  Very powerful and light.</li>
            <li> I had been using  a Panasonic ionic blow dryer for the longest time and it took me forever to dry my hair and the cone kept of falling off. Then i did some looking and found this beauty. I just used it for the first time and it is unbelievable how fast my hair dried and not one lick of frizz. The blow dryer is not heavy like some people said in their reviews or too long either like another reviewer. It is the perfect balance for a hairdryer that feels and performs like a professional one. I wished i would have purchased this long ago. Oh one more thing. Most hairdryers the attachments just click in place but can fall off easily, this one does not. You have to press both buttons to release the attachment.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! I found it on Amazon fir $14 less than any store in my area! My hair looks as good as it does when I leave the salon....great dryer for great price!</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry it out. The fancy attachment doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine straight hair but it&#x27;s still a great hair dryer</li>
            <li> This dryer cuts my dry time in half. It is a little bulky but that&#x27;s not a problem for me. Can&#x27;t beat the price either! :)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and this blow dryer takes care of the job quickly. The volumizing attachment is a little crazy looking, and I&#x27;m still not sure if I use it totally correctly, but it definitely adds volume.  Generally my hair is nice and smooth once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Wednesday and had it by Friday.  It works really well and is easy to use.  The attachments snap on easily and feel secure.  The only negative thing I would say is that it is heavier than most dryers, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t mastered this the way the video shows, I love this!!!  The prongs are great for gripping my hair and then drying in a circular motion while lifting my hair up on my scalp.  I love all the different heat and speed settings as well.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> loves this, dries curly hair fast</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and after reading a review online I purchased this blow drier. I normally let my hair air dry over night. So I have only used it around 3 times this winter. The attachment isn&#x27;t the best for curly hair. I have used bowl diffuser attachments that I prefer. The drier works very well. I think I just pick up a bowl differ and use that instead of the one it comes with.</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer ever!  I gave two away when I moved twice.  I bought a different one and it was horrible so I changed right back to this one.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my wife . She likes it. The price was right. The hair dryer is what she expect.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has very thick and curly hair. She says it&#x27;s great! Replaced her old one of fifteen years. Not extremely quiet, but not extremely loud- it&#x27;s a hair dryer. Great for the price!!</li>
            <li> My Revlon 1875 Watt Ionic hair dryer died earlier this week.  I have thick wavy hair which requires the magic of a hair dryer to make it smooth with touch-up by a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power on this hair dryer is amazing and quick.  I&#x27;ve always used the concentrator, I would not need to use the other attachment (remember, thick wavy hair).  Because the hair dryyer was so quick, i was able to actually give myself a complete blow out.  I had tried in the past with my old hair dryer, but it took quite a bit of time and still had quite a bit of frizz left and would look as it I just walked through a wind tunnel (thus the need for follow-up with the flat iron).  This took me half the time, no frizz.  (Of course I&#x27;ll need to use the flat iron for 1 min of baby hair fly aways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is \\&quot;loud\\&quot; but I never really expect a hair dryer to be quiet.  It is also smaller than my last hair dryer and lighter- to the point I may consider packing this one for work trips - hotel dryers are miserable.  Very impressed, looks like I just had a blow out done by my salon.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be quieter, but that is my only complaint.  I use it mostly to dry my kids&#x27; hair after showers.  It gets used roughly 9 to 12 times a week for over a year now and works as well as the day we got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly, so I occasionally use the diffuser on my own hair.  I do like this diffuser a lot, though I haven&#x27;t noticed any less frizz than with another dryer.  The diffuser seems to dry faster though than with my past dryers.</li>
            <li> No frizz!! I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s possible but I get very little or no frizz when I use this dryer.  Granted, I&#x27;m not the round brush and blowdryer type (too uncoordinated) but even when I use this for a few minutes, my hair doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy.  I mainly air dry my hair overnight but sometimes I do use the diffuser (when I have the patience because it takes about 20 minutes).  I bought this dryer because of the good reviews and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s met all of my expectations. Every woman needs a blowdryer sometimes and I&#x27;m no exception.  The high heat is nice and hot and the cool shot works great too.  It also comes with a concentrator nozzle for those who&#x27;ve mastered the art of the blowdry.  It&#x27;s a great bargain for the price, as are all of Conair&#x27;s styling tools.  The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird is the clear plastic shield on the diffuser.  Still, it works fine and doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around, making nicely defined waves possible.  This dryer is also not too terribly heavy, which is a good thing.  The ion technology is obviously working because with my former dryer, I always had some degree of frizz (depending on the weather) and when I use this dryer, I get none at all.  This is a big plus because I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and my hair is very frizz prone, so anything that zaps frizz is a huge hit with me.  I noticed the difference the first time I used this dryer.  I just hope it continues to work well. But for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow, love this dryer, it takes half the time my old dryer took.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavy compared to all my other ones. The cord is long, so that is a plus. The dryer does work better compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, curly/wavy, prone to frizz and dryness, and generally a pain in the butt. I bought this specifically for the diffuser function because I decided to embrace my natural texture rather than straightening every day. I still prefer to air dry my hair but this does diffuse nicely with very minimal frizz. The long fingers on the diffuser are amazing because they let you dry your hair without drying it out as much and you aren&#x27;t blowing hot hair directly on your scalp like with other diffusers I have used. It also dries hair very quickly! If I&#x27;m not using the diffuser attachment and need to dry my hair quickly to put it up for work I can get it 95% dry in a few minutes (for reference my hair can take several hours to air dry completely). There are several speed and heat settings which is key for diffusing. Low heat, low speed is great for curls and waves because it gets your hair dry without pulling out your curls (which causes frizz!). The diffuser attachment easily snaps on and off using buttons which is a nice perk as they can sometimes be a pain to put on and remove otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few downsides. This thing is huge and heavy. The dryer itself is very bulky and between that and the humongous diffuser I struggle to find a good way to store this when not in use. It does not fit in the large basket that stored my old dryer, flat iron, AND curling iron. It would be nice if it folded up. Luckily it dries hair quickly because it is uncomfortable to hold for longer than a few minutes at a time. I can&#x27;t imagine doing a blow out with this. Another thing is that I have a hard time getting any extra volume from this for some reason. I also wish there was an even lower heat setting because I find the lowest one to still be hotter than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Pros- the color is nice, the volumizer attachment is nice, and it&#x27;s a Conair--good brand.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-It makes a fairly high pitched sound--too high for my sensitive ears.  Therefore, I typically use it on low because of the sound frequency.  It does not get hot enough--not even on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I had done tons of work looking for something that was going to last and would work for her hair. She needed the defuser. It needed to lock in place since many of them fall off. I was ready to spend about $70 and found this one. Great price and she loves it and honestly I saw a difference in her hair. The video helped as well.</li>
            <li> We have again purchased this hair dryer. After awhile, I believe most hair dryers need replacing. This one lasts longer than most. I purchased one for my daughter since her dryer was getting a little too hot.</li>
            <li> big and heavy but drys my hair. Not overly hot like my old school dryer. i wished id bought a mini.</li>
            <li> I like that the diffuser is removable. I just brought it on a vacation and it was easy to pack. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair. My current hair dryer that I have owned for many years still works, but I wanted a diffuser to see if I could give my straight, fine hair some umph. Most hair dryers suck my hair into the motor, which is why I have had my current one for so long, because it doesn&#x27;t do that. This Conair was no exception. Within 15 seconds of turning it on, it pulled a few strands of hair in and I had to rip them to get myself unstuck. Plus, it hurts. Not all hair dryers do this, but this one sure did. My Mom, who has short hair, said she&#x27;d take it and if she liked it, would buy it from me. It sucked her short hair in! So I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;I never used the tool that focuses the air flow, so I can&#x27;t rate that. And I briefly used the diffuser before my hair was sucked into the back of the hair dryer. It seemed too small and that small section of my hair didn&#x27;t look any different than it does with a regular hair dryer without an attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stick with my old hair dryer and not bother with a diffuser. It&#x27;s not worth the broken hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this blow dryer. I have had mine for a little over 2 years, and it still works great :)</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time of other dryers.  Has different heat and hi/low settings.  Compact and lightweight.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Right out of the box!  The first time I plugged this in to use it, it started sputtering, lost power and started to smell.  I could hear that something was loose inside.  The packaging was horrible.  The hairdryer box was smashed on the bottom and that box was placed in an Amazon box with no padding.  That could have caused the problem but I will never know.  I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> The dryer works great, the temperature adjusts are very useful.  It does seem to be powerful and dry quickly, however based on the product description I had anticipated that it would have a quieter operation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and I am very happy. I have since gone from very long hair to shoulder length, to ear length and short now. My hair is curly and wavy and this diffuser gets it, no matter what length. It is very efficient and the diffuser won&#x27;t ever fall off during its use as it is securely attached unlike others. I can massage my scalp with it while drying my hair and even style it by gently pulling my hair in the direction I want it to go. The price can&#x27;t be beat. I highly recommend this dryer ;-))</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a lot of versatility. I mostly use it on the low heat, low air setting but in a pinch it turns into a high-volume dryer and the styling attachments give lift to my thinning hair as well. It is a little heavy for me, but I don&#x27;t need to use it as long as others I have tried in the past so it balances out in the end.</li>
            <li> Able to thoroughly dry my natural hair and keep the curls. The cool setting and the diffuser works wonders on my hair. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer, it&#x27;s a good one. The color is nice too.</li>
            <li> I have only had this dryer a couple of weeks but have used it several times. It is extremely light weight without the attachment and still light with it on. I would not say it is quiet, however. I have heard worse, but this one is no better than average. As far as drying ability goes, I use it on medium heat and speed and it seems to work quickly. I have to add that I have very fine hair, shoulder-length hair so I cannot judge how it would work on thick hair. I have used diffusers in the past of the typical wide variety but I think I like this new design because it focuses the heat and therefore works faster. Also the longer prongs help lift the hair better. I can&#x27;t say that it is any better at adding curl, but certainly is no worse.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and it still work amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was using this dryer for at least 2 years. It still works, so I guess that is one good thing. I bought it in-store because the selection was limited and I needed one asap, I didn&#x27;t purchase it for the attachments and haven&#x27;t used them, but wish I would have kept the concentrator on it after what happened. I realized about 8 months ago the I had large areas of breakage in my hair. I thought it was due to blond highlights breaking off, but it was still happening after they&#x27;d long grown in. Finally I realized my hair dryer was getting so hot on the front that the hair was literally singeing off in large areas, and even looked like the hair was being sucked into the heating elements. So now I have to wear the front of my hair (long bangs) back in bobby pins, otherwise you&#x27;ll see about 2 or 3 CHUNKS of short hair sticking up. SO embarrassing. It was happening on a smaller scale without me knowing it for years, then suddenly got worse and my hair is probably about 20% less full at the bottom because of the breakage. I will never ever purchase a Conair dryer again.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer on the lowest setting, it is that powerful.  I like the variety of heat and speed settings.  It has a cover on the lint filter for extra protection.  I like that it has two adapters.</li>
            <li> I have spent some real money on dryers but this one stands strong with all its the best one I have ever owned and my daughter tried it and said oh my I need this lol</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My opinion of this hair dryer is just MEHHHH. I&#x27;d recommend looking for one elsewhere as this one was one huge disappointment and has been the source of much irritation. I&#x27;m sure it would be okay intact.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great and is really fast,  I have long hair to the middle of my back, it&#x27;s thick and it only takes me 10 - 15 minutes to dry my hair verses 20-30 minutes it would take with my old dryer. The attachment really does help to make your hair fuller and thicker looking.</li>
            <li> Would be great if it didn&#x27;t have that ridiculous clear plastic &#x27;shield&#x27; over the prongs.  That piece defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the power of the drier. Not so much with the accessories. The lift does not seem to do anything. I may not be using it correctly. However, I am going to keep it because I feel the drier is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Wanted volume for hair and this product delivers.  Solidly built and low price - recommended as an effective hair solution.</li>
            <li> This Conair 276r Infiniti pro volume Dryer works so good my hair is not full it&#x27;s more thin and when i use this blow dryer I first wash my hair then throw my hair up in a bun with out towel drying it then part my hair in half and comb out the tangles after that i put gel and mousse in my hair then i brush my hair out i know it sounds crazy but just trust me on this would you Please.... then I bend down with out bending my knees and hair spray my hair then i sprunch up my hair into like a sort of a bun then do your make- up once your done doing your make-up and put on your clothes I take off the scrunchie and bend down again and then i spray hair spray again and start blow drying my hair try this method and let me know how you like it&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS GET COMPLEMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERY SINGLE TIME!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is pretty loud. I was really surprised it got the rating it did with the noise factor. It seems to get the job done but wish someone had warned me in a review how loud it really is</li>
            <li> For home dryer,. this is a good one</li>
            <li> This dryer only made my hair more frizzy and it was deafeningly loud! The diffuser attachment, although it looks incredibly useful, is very awkward to use. The dryer is also pretty heavy. The good thing about it is that the attachments have a locking mechanism that makes attaching and removing them very easy. I really wish this worked better on my fine naturally curly hair, but I believe it is more for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item less then a year ago. I dry my hair maybe once a week...really not much. This dryer has completely stopped working and I can not return it. I don&#x27;t recommend getting this item.</li>
            <li> Blows a large volume of hot air on high heat.  Medium heat is exactly that.  Not too heavy, but 8 oz more than the cheaper DC models.  Nice balance and the switches stay where positioned.  Excellent value for the price.  Accessories come a bit to easily, but they work.  5 stars if they would design the accessories to stay on a bit more firmly.</li>
            <li> I probably just dot know how to use the attachment. I can&#x27;t get it to give me any volume. I do love the speed and temperature options</li>
            <li> had to find this online after trying 3 new dryers from the local big-box stores that didn&#x27;t compete. i had this model previously for years that i finally had to stop using. so glad i could still find this on amazon since i blow dry my hair straight daily. this dryer is apparently the one model that works for my thick/coarse wavy-curly hair. newer dryers have so much technology (ionic ceramic tourmaline etc etc etc etc) but only succeed in longer drying time and flatter hair. i completely prefer this model.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this blow dyer. I have natural curly hair which I air dry 98% of the time. I wanted something simple to use when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li> Great I love it even after 2 years from geting one! It does everything what it says, it&#x27;s simply great dryer. I would buy another but really no need,probably for a life time!!! Maybe as a present!</li>
            <li> Bought it together with BC178 and both of the 2 are satisfying and amazing as I expected!!!~~ Haven&#x27;t tried the curl-styling attachment cuz&#x27; my hair is straightened in Salon like just 2 weeks ago..~ appropriate size and weight for a girl to hold!~ Definitely great workmanship and quality!~~</li>
            <li> I love that the attachments snap on. On my old one they were always falling off.  I also like the power.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer on here about 2 or so years ago and I still use it. I love the diffuser for volume, and other head for straightening. Love the 3 settings for cold, warm and hot, and the 3 speeds. Very nice dryer, works great and dries well. Price point is perfect too. Use with a round brush and you get really volumized straight hair, as good as with an expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old hair dryer with this one and made the right choice. This one has really strong power and has a nice quiet sound, not too bulky, fits nice in your hands. Comes in a cool purple color. Comes with two nice attachments, a Volumizer and a Concentrator. I do wish that it could fold and that the cord would be retractable, for traveling, but not an issue. This dryer has a nice 4 year guarantee. The dryer offers a High and Low power setting with Hot, Warm, and Cool settings and a Cold Shot button. The attachments are very easy to take on and off and when you attach them, they snap into place and won&#x27;t fall off. I would say this is probably one of the nicest dryers out there right now and you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Having always been hair dryer- challenged, I was quite skeptical of this unit from Conair that promised \\&quot;Volume Boost\\&quot; and was not even called a hair dryer but a \\&quot;styling tool.\\&quot; I opened the unit with more skepticism; it was somewhat heavy and it had an attachment that looked like a number of scary plastic sticks on a base that attached to  a fairly standard-looking hair dryer. However, within two minutes of using the dryer and attachment on freshly washed damp hair I was blown away (not literally!) My hair is medium (between fine and thick) texture, straight, and usually a nightmare to dry, due to my impatience, generalized ineptitude with using a round styling brush and dryer simultaneously, and tendency to sweat profusely from a hot Sahara blast of wind, and the way a dryer makes my hair feel and look- fried. This dryer solved every aforementioned problem. The air- directed flow dried my hair in 1/3 the normal time. The volumizing tines made me feel as if I had a talented stylist drying my hair rather than my usual approach of giving up and allowing the dryer to blow my hair helter-skelter in a hot gust. I didn&#x27;t have a single sweat gland activated since the dryer directed the flow to the hair, not my upper body. My hair looked luxuriously healthy and not at all crispy. This is an absolute piece of genius. I simply can&#x27;t believe what a great buy this is. Believe the hype- for once it&#x27;s all real! There is also an air concentrator attachment, and a wide range of temperature/speed settings including a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; setting that locks in your final hairstyle. My only commentary is that with its heavy motor and attachments it is a bit more hefty than a standard dryer. However, considering the savings in time, it&#x27;s worth building your biceps for volumized, va-voom hair!</li>
            <li> Really good hair dryer does the job that it is intended to do.  It dries your hair, and you can styles it.  It comes with an infuser; it has 3 speeds; a cool/warm/hot button.  It is a two-in-one styling tool and hair dryer, volume boost, fast and frizz-free styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good hair dryer.  Both my daughter and I use this hair dryer.  It is definitely getting used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this hair dryer/styler to anybody who needs this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.</li>
            <li> Ok.. first off this hairdryer is quieter and way more powerful (fan wise.. not heat wise), this is due to the fact that the fan motor is  AC, not the usual DC motors that are usually in dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Volume attachment that works great if you have thick hair or long hair that you want to boost he volume of it, but if you have thin hair or short hair you may not really care about that. It also has a concentrator attachment to pinpoint airflow to a certain spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a \\&quot;True cold shot\\&quot; button to lock in hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;It has a removable filter  which is a great idea, an \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology for smooth, frizz-free, static-free results\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2 fan speeds and 3 temp settings round out the features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Wife noticed the difference right away, it dried her hair in WAY less than her other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;... and if she is happy then I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth 39.99? It is in the ballpark of other dryers, but I think the AC motor really pushes this model near the top of the pack to consider.</li>
            <li> With so many hairdryers out in the market right now, it is difficult to decide between so many different models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my own and my wife&#x27;s experience with this hair dryer, we&#x27;ve found that the design and the performance is what sets this apart from other good mid-range hair dryers ($30 - $50). This hair dryer is powerful, but not overbearing. Oddly enough, neither my nor my wife&#x27;s hair feels burned or hot. The airflow is efficient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for personal use if you&#x27;re looking for some extra \\&quot;oomph,\\&quot; as well as the option to keep your curls and preserve silky hair with the ceramic attachment. Excellent choice for personal  use, and perhaps good for simple tasks at salons. This hair dryer is not for the weak ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Conair really did a good job designing this dryer. The handle, the feel of the dryer is fluid, comfortable, and very intuitive. There are three heat settings: hot, warm, cold. This may seem odd to point out, but each heat setting is accurate. Other hair dryers I&#x27;ve tried had heat settings there were off and inaccurate. The switch for the heat settings are caved in, preventing any accidental switches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very well designed hair dryer that offers reliable and good performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also may want to consider the older model of the infiniti pro: [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Infiniti Pro by Conair AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]] and the [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and treat your hair well!</li>
            <li> This was a good hair dryer until literally after 9 months of use it started to smell like it was burning and started slowing down and 5 minutes later it was completely dead!</li>
            <li> Dear all,do not get fooled by this reviews and ads. This has low quality as its price.  Gets hot very soon,dries your hair and makes very loud noise.  i gave additinal star only for the design of the diffuser,it is really unique indeed. all in all,it doesn&#x27;t worth a penny at all. i was totally disapointed.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but I was SO disappointed with this item that I just had to. First of all, it takes forever for my hair to dry. I have thick, curly hair and I usually use the attached diffuser to dry my hair. The diffuser does NOTHING to my hair; it takes forever just to dry it, and it doesn&#x27;t even enhance my curls nor does it give volume. This was a complete waste of money and I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. I will have to buy a new dryer for my hair.  AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE THICK CURLY HAIR DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!</li>
            <li> Power is large, dry hair quickly, fly in the ointment is the sound a little bit big</li>
            <li> I bought this after the death of my Hello Kitty hairdryer that I had borrowed from my daughter.  So this is a big upgrade!  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very clear in the product info that this diffuser head you see in the picture does easily come off.  There is also a straightening head.  Or, just use it without either head as a regular hair dryer.  I have medium/wavy hair and I like to use either head depending on the humidity.  (In humid weather I can get my hair to be a little extra wavy.)  The only draw back to me is that it is a little heavy.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.  And I love the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting when I&#x27;m drying my 2 yr old&#x27;s hair so I don&#x27;t accidentally burn her (there&#x27;s cool/warm/hot).</li>
            <li> I bought this on 6/30/14 and it died today, so lasted a little less than 2 years. I really liked it while it worked, and it was only $20 then so was a great bargain. I would buy again except that it died so quickly, so planning to look at other options before buying a new one.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very heavy. Also, when used on high it looks like I have wind whipped hair. It&#x27;s so strong it ties my hair in knots. The lower setting works fine, but who has the time to dry their hair on the lower setting? I&#x27;m to lazy to return it, and I tossed the box. I will be looking for a replacement. If anyone needs a free blow dryer, hit me up for my address...this piece of $h!t will be sitting on the curb.</li>
            <li> Does the job. It is good for being so cheap. Hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer at Kmart because it was on sale and plus I just bought the infinity flat iron. So anyways, it works GREAT! Especially for African American hair. I have really thick hair and wear clip-ons and it dryed my hair in less than 15 min. Definitely recommended it for all types of hair</li>
            <li> The fingers part doesn&#x27;t really work for me, but the base blow dryer is good.  I don&#x27;t use the other attachment, either.  I love the color and the power is good.  I usually use the hot and low setting and it -seems- faster at drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Dryer!  I used it just twice and already my coworkers are commenting about how  shiny and pretty my hair looks.  I will say it is not at all quiet as the description says.  Also, it was the same price at a store I went into, so if you are shopping for a bargain it really isn&#x27;t, except for the tax on the sale.  So I saved a little money by purchasing online.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.. it&#x27;s been life changing! I can dry my curly hair in five minutes and it looks great all day.  I would definitely buy it again.  The extended diffuser makes all the difference.. it gives body without frizz and concentrates the forced air to make drying time so much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  And it locks in place! :) Other reviews have said the buttons are a little small and I&#x27;d agree with that, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem once I got used to it.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I enrolled me teenage daughters to help me evaluate this hairdryer. Right away they liked the design and color of it, and also thought that it was a tad quieter than other hairdryers they have used. They like the attachment which combs hair as it dries which they felt made their hair  more controllable and certainly not as fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;My trial was easy because my salt &amp; pepper hair is kept fairly short, I though it did a great job of drying my hair and to my ears was not as annoying as those cheapie models that have a high pitched sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer looks well made and it certainly has a feel of quality to it.</li>
            <li> The AC motor on this dryer does make a big difference in air flow compared to the other dryers of the same 1875 watt!  I have med/short thick wavy hair that i like to dry straight and used the Revlon RV484 for a few years, not realizing that it was so darn hot that my hair was getting fried &amp; breaking off!  My daughter came home from college and sparked her hair from that Revlon too!...so yes, the bad reviews on the Revlon RV484 are TRUE!!  After, trying out the Conair 178Xr Ionic Pro Style (not ever hot enough) and the Conair 121PR Ionic Ceramic (hot enough but NO air flow!)....I finally found a Conair with heat AND good air flow!  For those of you who have complained that it does not get hot enough, I have found that the lower speed with high heat gives plenty of HEAT without burning the scalp and frying the hair the way my Revlon RV484 did! Even though the Revlon was powerful and hot, that thing was actually dangerous throwing out sparks from time to time and the hood/motor area getting dangerously hot!  Also, i am a tiny petite person with no muscles and can&#x27;t understand why others are complaining about this thing feeling heavy!??  Not heavy at all for me!  Also, when looking for a blow dryer, it became an issue for me to get one with switches that don&#x27;t &#x27;toggle&#x27; as they keep getting pushed accidentally while drying!  Not so with this model!  I am actually tempted to get another one for a backup as it is NOT easy to find a dryer that is hot enough without frying hair AND with a powerful air flow to boot!  This one is a keeper!  So glad I can stop shopping around now!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because one key feature listed was that it was whisper quiet and it is not.  It may work well but it is too loud for me.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is very picky about what she will and won&#x27;t use.  She didn&#x27;t like the first hair dryer I got her, but loves this one!</li>
            <li> This product does not give more volume than most hairdryers. I do not think it is worth the price. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> what was advertised is not all that I got. I was missing a coupe attachment pieces, and the box that the product was in not the shipping box, was completely trashed.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the attachments.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic. I have straight fine hair so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a diffuser for curly haired folks but love love love it for the volume it provides at the roots. I blow dry my hair upside down for a bit without the attachment and then add it on and create circular motions at my roots. My hair has never been more voluminous!!</li>
            <li> All in all a quality product.  With the attachment in place, works great.  But if you want to use it without attachment, be prepared for a lot of air flow and resultant lower air temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/2017. This thing is still going eaned another star</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, extremely satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for daily-use hair dryer, I strongly recommend this one, fully functional! And it has a cool name: Infiniti! Do you like the cars? If so, just buy this one if you need hair dryer! Imagine, it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li> *** UPDATE **&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave the original material below, but include this update, which might bump this to 5-stars if you consider re-purchase a meaningful indicator of perceived quality.&lt;br /&gt;My wife travels a lot for work, so after a couple years now, TSA or just general wear and tear has finally broken or worn out her lighter traveling hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t know which it was, but that&#x27;s on no consequence...she has asked me to find &amp;#34;that one you got me&amp;#34;, which is this one, the Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume.  Apparently, the added weight DOES equate to quality and better performance.  She could go buy her own dryer anywhere at any time, but she specifically asked for a repeat on this one.  To me, that says it&#x27;s got the goods, and she finds it superior after having used it a while.  Pretty sure all the stuff I wrote before is still true, but now taken with the grain of salt that whatever it&#x27;s minor shortcomings, my wife is more willing to live with them than she is to take a chance of finding something better...generally, she would try something else and give it away if it weren&#x27;t up to snuff.  So, a solid, solid 4 stars on this one, with the added endorsement of re-purchase at normal price...  Hope that&#x27;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** END UPDATE ***Apparently, using a diffuser takes a bit more than casual training and practice, because she said it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  She also isn&#x27;t a regular &#x27;diffuser&#x27;, so that&#x27;s no indication of how it might do on pageant hair.  Her complaint was that the unit was quite a bit heavier than the dryer she already has, and to make things worse, the handle is narrower, thus making supporting the additional weight harder on her hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked it out, and it was indistunguishable from any other hair dryer to me in it&#x27;s normal function, and the diffuser served no purpose on my short hair.  It did seem an ounce or two on the heavy side.  Usually a mark of quality...  Still, I would have to say, unless you need, know how to use and have the wrists to handle a diffuer dryer, you probably just want a standard dryer.  Professionals who are accustomed to waggling one of these around all day would probably have no trouble.  From what I could tell, the diffuser produced a gentle and consistent breeze of warm air instead of the column of forced air it generates without it.

            <li> Bought for my wife, she uses it daily and says it works very well, but that it is a little heavier than she would like.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time. It dries my very porous (usually long drying) hair super fast! And it creates amazing lift at the crown. My hair is naturally wavy and curly with even some parts kind of straight, very multi-textured. It worked really well. I was able to wear it natural with only adding a few curls on the top to even the pattern, not create volume - the hair dryer did that!  So, finally a hair dryer to love! And I got it on clearance at a local chain department store.</li>
            <li> I have dry naturally curly hair and finding the right dryer/defuser combination is always such a hassle.  I love this product.  It dries my hair in under 10 minutes, normally will take close to 30-45 mins on any other dryer.  I really like the defuser attachment.  It allows me to get close to my scalp to dry the roots with out damaging the rest of my curls.  The plastic lip keeps the fly-aways form flying away and creating more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it as instructed in the video.  Instead I flip my hair over and dry my hair upside down.  This gives my curly hair better volume and a more polished look.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing dryer I have ever used. It does all the things a blow dryer does and much more.&lt;br /&gt;I can capture the bottom of my wet curl clump into the diffuser and let them fall into it. Raise it to my scalp barely moving for just a little lift and a cool burst and on to the next clump of curls. No more plopping a mass of curls dripping product. Now I am damp dry in minutes. And my curls are fantastic. This is a life saver. It&#x27;s light weight, easy to maneuver  and quieter than my last one.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair when it&#x27;s wet. So it does its job lol. I don&#x27;t really like the add-ons, I&#x27;m not too sure what to do with them or how to use them. But I like this hairdryer and it seems pretty durable :)</li>
            <li> This replaced an old blow dryer and it dried in half the time.  I didn&#x27;t even realize how slow my old hair dryer was!  I don&#x27;t use the attachments, truthfully I couldn&#x27;t figure out how (I don&#x27;t know if that is saying something about me or the dryer) but I LOVE the dryer!</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer for the money. This dryer comes with attachments, it&#x27;s sturdy, has different temperature settings and does the job.  Would recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this in a store last week for $49.99, luckily i was right there and did an amazon search and saw it under $30... with my Prime account i got it in 2 days without additional costs. She loves it! There isnt much i can say as im not stylist but she is happy and  added no complaints so i give it 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer thinking it would be good quality and it died in less than a year.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the description claims it is light weight and ergonomic.  I don&#x27;t find it to be either.  It is larger than it appears online, and it is certainly heavier than the one I already have (I got this because guests are coming.)  It has a long (about 6 feet) thick cord and a very large plug that occupies enough of the outlet that you probably can&#x27;t plug anything else in next to it.  (When it was said that unlike other hair dryers it was AC I got the impression that it would have a regular AC plug, but the connector is just as big as any other dryer plug.)  It&#x27;s new, so it performs well, but it&#x27;s hard to find a convenient place to put this along with the bulky attachment and long heavy cord. It&#x27;s probably best for big people with big hair and really big bathrooms.</li>
            <li> The reviews were great on this blow dryer so I decided to get it. Its not too loud and not too heavy and does seem to give extra shine to my hair when I blow it straight. I was looking for a dryer to use when I want to wear my hair curly. When I dry it curly it ends up getting frizzy and losing curly someone fast. I also get decent body at first but within 30 min it seems like that body just drops on me. I have very fine hair that is longer than my shoulders. It&#x27;s naturally wavy. As soon as I get into a moist atmosphere my hair immediately starts to frizz which drives me bonkers. I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products and nothing seems to work. Most products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. I prefer not having any product in my hair and I hate hairspray. My search continues.</li>
            <li> I have medium length spirals. This dries my hair faster than a regular dryer with a diffuser and isn&#x27;t as heavy as that combination.  For me, it would be an improvement if the clear plastic shield came off entirely.  It is permanently affixed.  What happens is that the air blows down on the lower side and dries the roots below, so you don&#x27;t get the volume.  I would like to really get in with those long fingers and you can&#x27;t.  I have actually gone back to my old cup style diffuser combo.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! The settings are easy to use, the attachment are easy to apply and remove with the two buttons on either side of the device. I didn&#x27;t believe that it would have any impact on the feel of my hair, but my hair seems less frizzy when I have used this dryer. As for shine, anytime you apply heat to your hair, it should be shiny, but this seems to help with smoothness.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had . It&#x27;s light weight and it&#x27;s very very easy to pack ! Best best</li>
            <li> Drys my hair fast, Not too heavy or loud .. Nice compact size and good attachments. Overall really good dryer. Would recommend !</li>
            <li> Works great!!  I have thick short hair and dries it in  3 minutes.  Looks like I styled it, do not need curling iron or other gadgets,</li>
            <li> This is the bomb!  Really gives great volume without much effort. I&#x27;m going to order another one so I have a backup someday when I need another!  AWESOME!</li>
            <li> A present for Christmas that was very well received.  Works exceptionally well.  This type of hairdryer is impossible to find in stores anymore, so it was really a welcome surprise--the recipient was trying to use an old taped together volume hair dryer because they couldn&#x27;t find a new one.</li>
            <li> The dryer has worked great for me for over 2 years. I definitely notice a difference using this hair dryer (vs. others) in terms of my hair volume.</li>
            <li> Box was pretty banged up.  I gave this as a gift to my wife and box banged up was ok.  If I was giving to someone else I would have been not so happy.  Dryer is great however and works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent blowdryer for the price. It is a tad heavier than I was expecting, but certainly not as heavy as a lot of other blowdryers can be. I do not find it loud, as others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pick diffuser attachment is very interesting. I have fine medium long hair, and it is naturally curly and wavy. I usually blow-dry it straight with round barrel brushes. Once in a while I will wear it curly and wavy and finish it up with a flat iron to produce more tame beach curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser speeds up the drying process and saves me some time. But you have to turn the dryer off and on between sections of hair - I hope that doesn&#x27;t wear out the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want to dry my hair straight - well, it does have some power. But the one drawback I see is that the nozzle attachment does not swivel. You get only one position. I always rotate the nozzle depending on which side of my head I&#x27;m working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will probably only use this blowdryer when I want to wear my hair curly and wavy.</li>
            <li> I am so glad now, that my old hair dryer finally quit and I bought this one- Its so much better than what I was used to- This one performs like High end Salons use.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer (volumizer) was the closest thing I could find to the Braun volumizer that I had.  It&#x27;s heavier than what I&#x27;m used to and the teeth for the volumizer don&#x27;t pick up hair that easy but overall it&#x27;s a good unit.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can take the filter off and clean.  What a concept.  I love Conair and they prove again they are the leader in hair appliances.  Also the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; attachment is great to dry underneath your hair.  A must buls</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer because it was supposed to be quiet.  NOT.  My old hairdryer is quieter.  Other than that, it works fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer based on good reviews, and the idea that finally a dryer was specifically designed for those of us with curly/wavy hair.  The diffuser is different--it&#x27;s at an angle and you&#x27;re supposed to put it right up onto your head as seen in the video.  I have to say I rarely did this but overall I was pleased with how gentle the air flow was with the diffuser attachment.  My daughter has straight hair and the concentrated nozzle also worked as expected.  However, maybe 2-3 months into owning it I noticed a screeching sound upon first turning it on (I went straight to high speed)--it sounded like metal on metal.  It freaked me out so I started turning it on low first, giving it a sec, then high and it seemed ok.  It is now about 9 months old and turning it on it is reeeaaaalllllyyy sllllooooowwww to rev up.  It&#x27;s a sick puppy :(&lt;br /&gt;SO I&#x27;m retiring the fairly new dryer for fear it will catch fire and I&#x27;m back to searching for one on Amazon.  Wish the warranty was longer than a few months.  I have never dropped it and put it away under my cabinet each day, so I can&#x27;t imagine what failed so quickly :(</li>
            <li> I hate spending the required time to wear my hair down in the mornings only to have it lay flat against my head by the time I get to work.  This dryer has changed all of that!  I love the volumizing attachment - it really works.  And it works without having to use any products (which I also avoid at all costs).  I wish it were a little easier to change between the volumizer and the isolating attachments during blow drying, but only because I dry my hair in sections.  Overall, I hope this one lasts forever because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do without it.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy 5 more to last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> The dryer worked well for about two months.  Then it started to spit black hot melted plastic. I noticed when I got a tiny burn on my finger and my forehead from the hot plastic while I was using it. Then the black tiny pieces of plastic in the drawer that dryer was stored made sense. I had been wondering where those came from even though I was cleaning the drawer every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still runs but is a big safety issue so stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Called Conair and the representative said I could get a new one once I ship the existing one to them. and Conair will not cover the shipping cost. I am not sure if it makes much sense spending half the money I spent on the dryer on shipping. Might as well buy a new different make. Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.  It is powerful and dries my hair very quickly.  It is also lightweight, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Very powerful &amp; not too noisy. The attachment is awkward, but helps make my naturally stick straight hair slightly wavy-think beachy waves, not curling iron curly.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer with a heavy feel.  Does not feel like a piece of junk.  It dries your hair,  it gets hot and blows.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Had this dryer for several months now and I love the diffuser. I don&#x27;t take the time to fluff my hair up because I do lazy and usually running late. But this really does dry hair faster with the higher power fan than my last one did so I love that I can get out the door those few minutes faster.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair. With the attachment, it really does enhance the look of my hair. Love it. The attachment removes with a pressure button so it can&#x27;t fly off the dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very useful with the diffuser on, but I found it to blow my hair around too much without it on.  I love it with the diffuser - it is easy to maneuver and gives my hair a lot of body.  But, when I used it without the diffuser it ate my hair and the rest ended up in knots.  For reference - I have fine hair with natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if you are looking for a dryer to use with the diffuser, but only 4 if you are looking for something that you can use both with and without.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! It has multiple setting, and the attachments come in handy. I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Delivers consistent heat and smart accessories.</li>
            <li> I got it in Feb, and it is already broken now for less than 3 months use which is extremely unacceptable. My last dryer&#x27;s life (not this brand) lasted 5 years. I didn&#x27;t use it every day since I travel a lot recently. But still 3 months life is too short. I can smell something is burned inside which means it is very dangerous. Not sure whether they sent me broken one.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair. I struggle all the time to find products and tools that can help me add the appearance of volume to my hair. I am quite savvy and know a lot of tips and techniques, but still always on the hunt. Also, when I let my hair air dry, it is a frizz-fest. So I just got this dryer delivered yesterday. I immediately washed my hair, applied a root booster, my anti-frizz serum and went to town on the roots with the diffuser. Trust me, this product is amazing. Better than blow drying upside down. Best part is, I didn&#x27;t have to use a round brush,or any brush for that matter. Which I will when I want a smooth, polished look. But with this dryer, I can literally get my hair dry root to tip, only scrunching my hair into the diffuser and using circular motions and I ended up with a nice, casual, beachy, wavy look that was not frizzy at all. Now, mind you, if I brush it at that point, it will frizz unless I use a straightening iron, but I can never let my hair air dry without the frizz, and I hate having to dry my hair straight with a brush then use a curling iron just to try to regain some of the natural wave. This blow dryer eliminates the fuss. I combed my hair wet in the shower, towel dried, applied a couple products, then scrunched away with fingers and diffuser on low speed (very fine hair), and I was literally stunned at the waves and how lifted/volumized my roots were. I LOVE this blow dryer. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the hair dryer my d-i-l had given me several years ago &amp; couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable until I saw this one. It&#x27;s perfect! I love the diffuser and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be less quiet but theclip attachments were cool. Kinda heavy too. My five yr ol like that its small.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really happy with this.  This is my first really great hair dryer in years.  I have fine thin, yet curly hair.  When I air-dry it, it just looks flat and greasy with no bounce.  Flat curls are the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dries my hair in less than five minutes and I love the two extra attachments.  A great buy and I hope to have it forever.</li>
            <li> Very powerful &amp; dries hair fast! A bit heavy and clumsy, though. Fluff attachment is useless - like running rocks across your head.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money! It dries my hair pretty fast and give my curls so much volume. I love this diffuser. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer! The price was great! I have long, thick hair and this drier dries it quicker than any I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> i MAYBE could have figured out how to make this unit work better for me, but it would have been more trouble than I felt it was worth.  I have fairly thin, wavy-to-curly blonde hair and this dryer made me look crazy!  I used it just as recommended -- but volume is one thing, and looking like a lightning-fried Mrs. Frankenstein is quite another.  The attachment was awkward to handle during the drying process, and you really have no control or manipulation over the style of your curls.  I&#x27;ve already disposed of this unit.</li>
            <li> Very well-made dryer and works well too.  We called Conair because our old dryer had been taken off the market.  A very good replacement!</li>
            <li> The best diffuser I&#x27;ve found for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this only a few times, but I wanted to give a review.  This product is lightweight compared to other hair-dryers I have used.  It takes little time to dry my hair, and my hair is long(down to the end of my back).  It is hard for me to hold an object in my hand for very long or use my arms for a length of time.  This product definitely took away the pain of drying my hair.  Now, it&#x27;s a breeze.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  It is a time saver, it definitely gives volume to my hair.  It is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my T3. Big mistake. It is incredibly loud and so high pitched I can barely use it long enough to dry my bangs. It is on the heavy side.  I look forward to purchasing another T3 as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is bad, bad and bad...first off it didn&#x27;t come with the attachments that were stated in the description.  Also if I had known how the buttons were layer out on the handle I would NEVER have purchased this.  Also after about a month of use it started shutting off half way through me drying my hair.  So now I have a basically brand new dryer in my drawer that isn&#x27;t being used...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommend by my roommate.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really thick, and it could let my hair dry quickly!&lt;br /&gt;and it has 2 different casings, so I could make more hair style.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought it just $25, I&#x27;m so satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> It does the job. My only complaint is that there are only 3 heat settings,  the highest heat setting is too hot and the one below it is too cool.</li>
            <li> I looked for several weeks and purchased this dryer because the old Conair which was 7 years old was slowing down, this new one has more power, drys hair super fast and doesn&#x27;t make much noise. It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> have a hard time using the attachment but this product is stellar and I&#x27;ve never regretted owning this product-- goes pretty hot though.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer with diffuser for volume.  I have been using a spare hair dryer after my last one blew up and I wanted a new one in case the spare (which works great) is no longer operable at some point.&lt;br /&gt;This one, however, does not do the job.  It is like it just sucks out the mousse and leaves my hair limp and lifeless.  I have used this type of dryer for years and have never encountered this problem before.  I do not recommend this product if your goal is to give your hair some volume.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair this makes it look fuller and is so easy to use. I love it. Very easy on the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest hair dryer I have ever owned! It is built very sturdy, and blows really hard! Very good for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I wanted a replacement for a hair dryer that didn&#x27;t have concentrator.  This product is lightweight and easy to handle, and has three heat settings along with three blower options.  I also like the cool shot button that sets my hair once it dries.  It is pretty quiet. I has all the features I wanted, works very well and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer made my hair frizzy.  Even when I used a lower setting it still did not give me the smooth sleek hair that my old hair dryer achieved.  My hair is naturally curly, but I can blow it out straight.  It was OK when I used the diffuser to keep my curls, but it was not good for blowing my hair our straight.  I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Even though this dryer is a bit heavy I love it! dries my hair efficiently especially for having it set at low speed and medium heat. my hair always looks fantastic! I have naturally curly hair so its kind of difficult to find things that work and was very pleased that this did but when I moved from Arizona to Illinois I was worried the difference in climate would affect my hair and I would have to stop blow drying it, But even with the humidity it works great! My hair is always silky and bouncy with lots of body. I&#x27;m in love with this diffuser, and am very happy with my decision to get it. My mom and I now share it and she loves using it to blow dry her hair straight, she says she almost doesn&#x27;t have to flat iron her hair, its just that good! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My old dryer was going and I love Conair products, so I chose this one.  It is hot enough for me to blow out my hair.  It also has 2 lower settings if I&#x27;m just doing a quick dry.  The attachments work really well.</li>
            <li> i like the product &amp; its specification...&lt;br /&gt;prices and services are excellent  than the other products that&#x27;s the reason i choose this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite ok. There is a big difference between the hot and the warm air programs, so sometimes you need to mix.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after my Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer suddenly died after only one year :( I am pleasantly surprised at the great quality for the price. Fast drying, high powered... It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I got this dryer because a friend had it and I liked it when I tried it.  It stop working correctly only after 3 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairdryer. I have had the travel version for probably 2 years now and it is fantastic so I knew this one would be too. The diffuser is fantastic and helps me dry my curls with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> Works good not lots of noise good price</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer! I first purchased just the diffuser portion of the hair dryer. Unfortunately, it did not fit the hair dryer I already owned. I had a feeling the diffuser would work really well, so I went on a mission to find the hairdryer that went with it. Enter this hair dryer! I promptly purchased it and have never owned a better hair drying system. I haven&#x27;t tried straightening my hair yet with the new dryer, but for my naturally curly hair nothing beats this!</li>
            <li> I never use a blow dryer. Seriously...never. I have super thick hair so it takes FOREVER to dry my hair and I&#x27;m always short on time. When I get my hair cut they blow dry it and it takes forever, so I was never motivated to buy my own and get stuck with that burden. I finally decided I should have one for the rare occasion when I have time to attempt to style my long, thick unmanageable hair. I did a lot of research on the various blow dryers available on Amazon before I chose this one, and of course price was a significant factor in my decision. I have used this dryer exactly once since I purchased it in April (a testament to my patience in dealing with my hair), and it worked great! It dried my hair faster than I expected and it had different heat settings. I tried using the attachment and couldn&#x27;t decide if I liked it better with or without, so I&#x27;ll have to experiment more with that later. My hair ended up softer and more manageable than I thought it would, especially since blow drying is supposed to dry out your hair. I&#x27;m hoping to change up my routine and start using it more in the near future, so if I learn anything significant in the process I will update my review!</li>
            <li> No complaints except that item arrived in a box that is not a conair box. Just some random brown box. Weird but it had everything in it including instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Order from Amazon July 30, received in two days.  I have used it 4-5 times a week since receiving it.  It worked fine, but isn&#x27;t the super fast drying dryer I thought it would be.  It takes awhile for it to heat up as it runs and then it does dry faster.  All in all it was ok, but never great.  Until today!  It started making an odd sound and then I realized it was blowing pieces of something out.  I picked some up and they appear to be a part that the blower blade has chopped up from inside the dryer.  I unplugged it and am now searching for another hair dryer.  Spent more on this one thinking it would last a long time and dry faster than my old cheaper one that lasted years and years.</li>
            <li> Bought an \\&quot;open box\\&quot; deal through Amazon (WAREHOUSE DEALS, Inc.) because it was cheaper than new.  However, when I got the package and opened it, the dryer inside the box was not at ALL the same hairdryer shown or purchased (so I can&#x27;t comment on unknown hairdryer).  Also, no accessories with it so not even useable.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying open box WAREHOUSE DEALS, Inc. because they don&#x27;t seem to check their returns at ALL!  A big colossal waste of my time to repackage, print labels, drive to the UPS place, drop it off, etc. etc.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Gives more volume to my permed hair</li>
            <li> I already had one at home, went to Amazon to find another &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  This blowdryer has two speeds and two heat settings plus a cold shot.  Oh... and two attachments, one for precision drying, the other (as in the picture) for lifting and volume.  Perfection!  And the color of this appliance is pretty too.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer that is really powerful without damaging or drying out my hair! I have naturally curly hair and I can blow dry it now without having to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> THis is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and I was a hairdresser for 25 yrs! I love this thing! I am buy another one in case they quit making it. I have natural curly hair but not the pretty kind. I have to load it down with several products and let it dry by itself and maybe it looks decent. I have tried all sorts of diffusers and such in my lifetime and as I said I was a hairdresser for 25 yrs. I normally dry my hair then straighten it with a 2-1/2&amp;#34; curling iron. What a pain! Now I apply Biolage Gelee and Rusk Mud and pop on the diffuser and in abt 5 minutes my hair is beautiful natural curl and ready to go. I watched the video and for once it works like they say ... really. My hubby has always liked my hair better curly but I could rarely wear it that way. Now he is happy and I am happy. Don&#x27;t question whether this thing works because I can tell you that it does!</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer for the hair pik attachment.  It works great and I love the attachment.  However, the dryer is heavy and difficult to hold above my head.  Would be better if the dryer was lighter.</li>
            <li> love it, it is a wonderful product would recommend it to every one who wants this product to get buying</li>
