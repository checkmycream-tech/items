            <li> Great price on this product, which is the main reason I purchased it.  I do like Estee Lauder cosmetics and was glad to find such a reasonably priced product.  The reason for a 4, rather than 5 star rating was the shipping charge.  It was way too high.  The lipstick was dropped into a small mailing package and could have been mailed with a couple of postage stamps on it, rather than the more than $5.00 charge.</li>
            <li> Great price and great color by Estee Lauder.  I wondered about the price and then when it was received and saw it said, &amp;#34;A-ha.&amp;#34;  The price was accounted for due to a ding in the point of the lipstick.  OK by me!</li>
            <li> It was possible good shopping you used to gift</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. A lot of lipstick s chap my lips, but not this one. Will order again.</li>
            <li> color not as pictuered further more it broke at the base upon second application.</li>
            <li> Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder lipsticks are great!  This one was a bargain, and the frosty almond color is exactly what I was looking for in a summer lipstick.  It&#x27;s long lasting and pleasantly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes lipstick makes my skin break out, usually the heavier ones, and, sadly, sometimes Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s.  This one does not, and it&#x27;s my go to neutral summer lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick from Estee Lauder. True colors and stays on great .</li>
            <li> This lipstick was at an excellent price for  Estee Lauder brand.  It is a pretty shade of shimmery brown. Long lasting too!</li>
            <li> Is ok was expecting to be a darker color but it fix ok with my skin color</li>
            <li> This color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected.  I wanted something darker.  It&#x27;s ok, though.  I will still use it.</li>
            <li> I love the color it is the same as in the picture and a staple for any makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Wrong color for me but pretty</li>
            <li> Not the original Estee Lauder casing.</li>
            <li> Lovely natural shade.</li>
            <li> The picture shown is not the same as the one I received. The lipstick I received is in black tube and the color of the lipstick is slightly brown. It looks like one of the giveaways that EL or Clinique (in green tube) and not like the one shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed with the color not what I thought..It was not shimmer to me. Also, it;s not the same as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> not as brown and too creamy</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. Not convinced it&#x27;s really Estee Lauder. Tube not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for transition to fall...tho I did wear it during the summer. Creamy, light feeling,yet as with all my experience with Estee Lauded lipsticks....very long wearing.</li>
            <li> All was OK, good seller</li>
            <li> love the color........</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous!  I&#x27;ve received a lot of comments about the color.  It&#x27;s a golden dark honey color with a gold pink.  Very nice for people with warm tones.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the color of this lipstick.  The Actual Shade Looked completely different from the picture on the website.  I was able to buy a lip liner that went well with it so all wasn&#x27;t lost. I won&#x27;t take that chance again though.</li>
            <li> I like the lipstick but it is not in this gold tone tube...So kind of an advertising boo-boo!</li>
            <li> Great price!  Timely shipping!</li>
            <li> It looked so good on me. Unfortunately it appears that it disappeared.  I&#x27;m hoping that I misplaced it. I plan on getting another one.</li>
