            <li>Also was pleased with the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Once again I spritzed with water and finger though I&#x27;m hoping once I wash it and apply curling products it will look way better.</li>
            <li>I am So glad i</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find out that the product includes the lotions and paper wrap things (I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called).</li>

            <li>It yielded just the right curls, and the smell is not offensive.</li>
            <li>I could not find it this time locally, so was glad to see it still availble this way.  </li>

            <li>We got fabulous results using extra large rollers.</li>
            <li>I bought it to have on hand, home perms are really going out of style, who know , if in the next two months it will still be available?  </li>

            <li>pre perm) conditioner really helped-</li>
            <li>Honest now that its rinsed and air dried</li>
            <li>I wanted more volume/body wave style, and the instructions on the box came with descriptive directions as to how to do this (along with other styles depending on hair types).</li>
            <li>As far as the results it looked so cute when it was wet</li>
            <li>I have medium length thin super duper fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The before and after perm treatments helped make my gray hair curly and shiney and not dried out.  </li>

            <li> I have used this product many times over the years  and found it to be the only one that gives me good results. I could not find it this time locally, so was glad to see it still availble this way.  Also was pleased with the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I am thankful that there is some place I can still get Ogilvie Home Permanents.  I have used this brand since 1963.</li>
            <li> Good resuts; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Received on time and product was as advertised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Will do business with this seller again! Thanks</li>
            <li> Compared to permanents given in shops today, Oglivie is by far the better permanent.  The before and after perm treatments helped make my gray hair curly and shiney and not dried out.  Amazon has quick and reliable delivery.</li>
            <li> It is as good as any permanent in a salon.  It is easy to even give to myself. Ogilve is the brand I always choose.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Not one curl.</li>
            <li> DID YOU CHANGE THE FORMULA, THE PERM DID COME OUT AS USUAL.</li>
            <li> Did not do the job as same product purchased in store.  Seemed like it had lost its strength.  Old  outdated product?</li>
            <li> Easy to use, satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> I bought it to have on hand, home perms are really going out of style, who know , if in the next two months it will still be available?  I prefer the foam, which is obsolete, or at least, not sold anymore. However,Ogilvie Home Perm, Extra body is a good substitute. Good name, good results.</li>
            <li> We got fabulous results using extra large rollers. My daughter&#x27;s hair looks great. Lots of soft curls with no hair damage.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin super duper fine hair.  Me and my vest friend bought this at Walmart in the Indianapolis area for a little over $5. The entire perm process took us four hours because you have to roll the hair in the perm rods of course. I didn&#x27;t like the fact it was so watery and it did burn like crazy. I loved the smell of the before perm conditioner and you are given a very decent amount of it. As far as the results it looked so cute when it was wet and we took it out it wasn&#x27;t spiral curls it was just it looked like a cheap Taylor Swift hair style attempt lol. It was 4:30am when we wore finished so when I had woke up it was fairly frizzy and I spritzed it with some water fingered though it. After a hot day my hair looked like a gaint frizz ball. Once again I spritzed with water and finger though I&#x27;m hoping once I wash it and apply curling products it will look way better. I do wish it was foam just like the other reviewers said too</li>
            <li> Wow i just had this put in by a family member-and it wow-i have long thin hair and needed to make a decision to cut it perm it or body wave it.  The week prior I applied 1/3 cup olive oil warmed to tolerance to my hair at bed time and wrapped with a throw away shower cap-was a bit nervous to do this-perm at home- but NOW  WOW- I am So glad i it did. I will need to wait a couple of days before shampoo -and -style it with hot curlers but the hair looks twice as thick or close.I have already gotten tons of compliments-with it pretty wave-y.  Honest now that its rinsed and air dried it has no smell and no horrible after soreness-scalp is fine! Wow-  I don&#x27;t even mind wearing it like this two days to conserve the wave or get the best use out of it-and help the hair settle after all those chemicals.   The B4 (pre perm) conditioner really helped- it did not burn or hurt the scalp at all- I have not had a perm or any chemical treatment for two years-after a horrible salon-experience totally damaged my hair-but this one is very impressive.  I wish it came in a foam though to ensure every curler rod is covered (the family member said that would be the only ting that could improve this!)))</li>
            <li> This is the third Ogilvie Home Perm I bought from Amazon. Can&#x27;t find a home perm anywhere. I will be coming back for more too. It gives me just enough body. That&#x27;s all I wanted.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Easily applied and gives good body.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried since this was the first time I was perming my hair at home and by myself. I was pleased to find out that the product includes the lotions and paper wrap things (I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called). I bought the curlers separately as none was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-lengthed, very thin hair. I was able to use all of the lotions/serums with some to spare for when I had to redo some curls that were flatter than I preferred. The whole process took me probably 3 or 4 hours, mainly because I have never curled my own hair before. That was atrocious. I will definitely get someone to help me next time, which should probably save me 1 or 2 hours. With that said, I am pleased with the results. I wanted more volume/body wave style, and the instructions on the box came with descriptive directions as to how to do this (along with other styles depending on hair types). It is still the first week since l&#x27;ve done the perm, so I can&#x27;t say much for it&#x27;s longevity, but I will be satisfied even if it lasts for 2 months, considering the price it costs. I&#x27;ve noticed that my shorter strands of hair, such as my bangs, have become frizzy. Likely this is due to how I rolled them, so next time I won&#x27;t do my bangs as tight and high up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will purchase this product again and recruit a friend to help.</li>
            <li> I dont know first hand, I bought it for someone else, but she seemed to be happy about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who loves her hair permed but have avoided parlors who tend to overdo her perm. She loves it. It yielded just the right curls, and the smell is not offensive. The instructions are ideal and as long as you follow it to the T, the outcome is highly desirable.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used to.  Didn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> Great for home perms.. Olivie is the brand I trust</li>
            <li> I bought this to give my Mom a perm. It gave very poor results, maybe only about 20% effective. Too expensive for such a lacking result.</li>
            <li> this is a good perm for whose hair takes a perm easily and lasts.  I can only get about two months&lt;br /&gt;out of it.  I think that&#x27;s because my hair has lots of that may be fighting the curl.  However, it is a&lt;br /&gt;good perm and easy to do myself.</li>
            <li> Perfect curl without kinks.  Gave my hair the body it needed to be thick and manageable.  Easy application and beautiful hair in a short time.  Lasts for three months plus.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the perm solution be foam rather than liquid.  I am sorry you have discontinued the foam as it is much easier and less messy.</li>
            <li> Although the invoice said it was STEP 1, the box and the perm was the regular permanent...no shortcut.</li>
            <li> I have long hair its allready curly just flat and no volume so i permed it with this and put short layers around the crown and some longer layers then permed it wow I look awesome! It saves me alot of money too because less volumizing products i have to use im so happy i dnt have to fight my hair every morning anymore and dnt have to tease it so thats why i used the extra body one, will def do again!</li>
