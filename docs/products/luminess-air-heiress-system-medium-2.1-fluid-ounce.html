            <li>Had no idea what to expect, but it looks good if you don&#x27;t overdo it :)</li>
            <li>The airbrush system is nice the color that it turns your face is not.</li>
            <li>but once you do, its very easy and can be done in minutes</li>
            <li>I love it for light every-day wear, too!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the coverage is great and the maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li>Far too orange-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought it up to four stars because I tried another color and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>Find your right color and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put on and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize its coming out (its very very fine mist)</li>

            <li>she loves it proffessional looking results ,easy clean up ,very easy to use ,great results,</li>
            <li>absolutely  LOVE  </li>
            <li>anyway.. wishing better luck for those who try it ...</li>
            <li>So much better than cakey</li>
            <li>I love using this, although it is time consuming for me, as a beginner.</li>
            <li>Really love this.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>ON TV: PERFECTION----You match your skin tone--which they say changes daily--based on many factors including the weather, age,</li>
            <li>You put in more and put it on your face.  </li>
            <li>OK now what?  </li>
            <li>many colors</li>
            <li>It works for the most part.  </li>
            <li>but definetely satisfied</li>
            <li>I looked better before applying this makeup.</li>
            <li>I can see this happening but follow the instructions and clean with warm water.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Luminess air brush system for my wife and at first she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use hence the 1 star.</li>
            <li>I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I had to use a sponge and smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I love it, it did clog up a time or two at first.</li>
            <li>I clean mine after every use with distilled water to keep it from doing that.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean the machine and do it again tomorrow.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Sweet Adeline</li>
            <li>So easy, at first didn&#x27;t even see it going on but kept at it.</li>
            <li>Once you get someone who is not trying to sell you the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; machine and more product, you discover you need a new stylus.  </li>
            <li>It  Dose not cover worth a flip...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $40.00.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use but the makeup blend you need is your own combination (that you need to figure out).</li>
            <li>Everyone else will have varying success and opinions.  </li>
            <li>is right for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally switch!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a bigger one. :)</li>
            <li>You add more, and you finally get it done.  </li>
            <li>so if you are interested in this---now is the time to get it.  </li>
            <li>IN REAL LIFE:  First off you have to match your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>it is very light anf natural looking just how it says my only problem is it makes my face oily towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>My Luminess Air starter kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I really like the luminess air brush system.</li>
            <li>Too much work and time.</li>
            <li>and then they charge for the whole product as a deposit....</li>
            <li>The luminess stuff is very expensive---(for</li>
            <li>Goes on well, lasts all day and gives a very even finish.</li>
            <li>Love this thing will never go back to the old way of make-up.</li>
            <li>With easy to follow directions, it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of this.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is not meant for an older woman with wrinkles and some sun damage because imo it accentuated my flaws and did nothing to cover my imperfections.</li>
            <li>Tonya helped me today with my order and was VERY knowledgeable and professional about the product.</li>
            <li>I have already replaced stylus, and customer service is good, but am tired of the pesky stylus.</li>
            <li>Still don&#x27;t know how often will I have to order new refills.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend a new one.</li>
            <li>Mine was used after it said new.</li>
            <li>they are a scam company and will not tell you that once you give them your card, THEN they tell that each month you will be debited automatically for a new supply.</li>
            <li>Do NOT ever ever buy directly from Luminess Air!  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li>Do NOT ever ever buy directly from Luminess Air!</li>
            <li>I cleaned it until the water came out clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this piece of junk directly from lumpiness, almost $400.00.</li>
            <li>If this is something you want to do, save yourself the headaches and get a professional ssytem.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Makeup application isn&#x27;t as smooth as they show, and it feels stiff on my face</li>
            <li>The company that amazon ordered it through was very helpful and handled my complaint quickly and to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>They said they would order me a new stylist; that was over 30 days, 4 phone calls, and 2 emails later</li>
            <li>But its only two weeks old you say, and they say, \\&quot;its not covered under the warranty\\&quot;  or you can send yours in and they will look at it and determine---but all at your expense.  </li>
            <li>( I have Asthma ) and first use a few minutes ago</li>
            <li>I have seen both good and bad reviews</li>

            <li> ( I have Asthma ) and first use a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> I have seen both good and bad reviews</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;N colors -- medium, is hard to mix a right shade for my face</li>
            <li> Not a great option if you want a full coverage look</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic case, broken throttle, make up inside spray needle before using!</li>
            <li> I had wanted one for so long ...</li>
            <li> I called the company and had to pay for a new stylus which after a few weeks use did the same thing as the previous one.  </li>
            <li> You put it in the machine, jsut a little tiny bit, and it spurts out and is gone.  </li>
            <li> All the bad reviews were that the stylish got clogged and stopped working.</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;ve spent over three hundred dollars on this fiasco.</li>
            <li> The other thing is Luminess is a scam company.</li>
            <li> go to any complaint site and see the numerous complaints on this company.</li>
            <li> and I even use it on some of the other women on my group!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t mess up the distribution of foundation.  </li>
            <li> Tomorrow rolls around and after a few tomorrows it starts working less and less</li>
            <li> a little</li>
            <li> They give you a \\&quot;cookbook\\&quot;, if you are this skin tone, then use a little of this, a little of that.  </li>
            <li> It is a pain to put on with all the layers and ends up looking worse than my regular lancome foundation.  </li>
            <li> The nob that controls the mist became lose and the makeup would spray too heavily.  </li>
            <li> It works well, its not easy to get it nailed down--takes some practice and some trial and error</li>
            <li> I have lots of dark spots n acne scars, doesnt cover much for me :(</li>
            <li> At least you&#x27;ll have some billing protection.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately every thing seemed to go down hill from there.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is extremely poor.  </li>
            <li> They do not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> This is not a flawless look but a CAKEY one!!!  </li>
            <li> I tried using it several times in case it was my inexperience that caused the terrible results.</li>
            <li> and of course I broke out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> and I have a sore throat like you would not believe :(  </li>
            <li> :(.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the results I achieved.</li>
            <li> Just received mine... and I am SOOOOOOO disgusted!!!!!</li>
            <li> HATED IT!</li>
            <li> so  NEVER use this horrible company!</li>
            <li> The customer service is just horrible.</li>
            <li> NEVER use this horrible company!</li>

            <li> I just got it and tried it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! So easy, at first didn&#x27;t even see it going on but kept at it. Tried the highlighter and blush too. Loved the finish look! All the bad reviews were that the stylish got clogged and stopped working. I can see this happening but follow the instructions and clean with warm water. I cleaned it until the water came out clear. I think it will be fine. I&#x27;m excited! :D</li>
            <li> I love it the packaging is perfect no damage</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cousin as her birthday gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift!  No comments yet!...except thank you!</li>
            <li> Have never worn make up in my life... Bought thus on a whim....it took me over a month to finally  pull it out and try it. Didn&#x27;t  even watch the video...that&#x27;s how easy and awesome  this item is...I  absolutely  LOVE  it</li>
            <li> Just received mine... and I am SOOOOOOO disgusted!!!!! I had wanted one for so long ... It  Dose not cover worth a flip... plus I noticed not one soul has asked this questioned... can people with asthma or breathing problems use this product?? I tried to ask them myself to Luminess air  .. with no response.. but took a chance  and purchased it ..( I have Asthma ) and first use a few minutes ago and I have a sore throat like you would not believe :(  anyway.. wishing better luck for those who try it ...</li>
            <li> Opened it, watched DVD, read instructions. Did everything correct. Cheap plastic case, broken throttle, make up inside spray needle before using! Going back next day!!!</li>
            <li> Their customer service is extremely poor.  The stylist does not work; it dumps all the makeup out at once. The dial has no control as to the air flow.  I called Luminess Air customer service.  After walking through the process to take the stylist apart and put it back together it still didn&#x27;t work.  They said they would order me a new stylist; that was over 30 days, 4 phone calls, and 2 emails later and I still don&#x27;t have a stylist.  They are now telling me that they can&#x27;t replace the stylist since I ordered the unit through Amazon.  Yet, the warranty in the packaging is their standard warranty.</li>
            <li> This system is a scam. It is a pain to put on with all the layers and ends up looking worse than my regular lancome foundation.  This is a gimmick  and future garage sale stuff next to the pet rocks.</li>
            <li> Makeup application isn&#x27;t as smooth as they show, and it feels stiff on my face</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mom and she loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, the coverage is great and the maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li> The color of make-up is too orange</li>
            <li> amazing amazing! So much better than cakey make up. I&#x27;m so glad I finally switch! ❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> I love using this, although it is time consuming for me, as a beginner.</li>
            <li> Not a great option if you want a full coverage look</li>
            <li> I bought this piece of junk directly from lumpiness, almost $400.00. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $40.00. It constantly clogs, sprays product everywhere except where it should. The other thing is Luminess is a scam company. Once the get that credit card number their like parasites, they just keep feeding off it. I had to cancel my credit card account to get rid of the leaches. Told my credit card  provider I lost the card. If you feel you need to try this Luminess thing. Do yourself a BIG favor...order though Amazon. At least you&#x27;ll have some billing protection. I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> Really love this.  Had no idea what to expect, but it looks good if you don&#x27;t overdo it :)</li>
            <li> I think that I will like this product.  Still don&#x27;t know how often will I have to order new refills.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> Works like advertised.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is not a flawless look but a CAKEY one!!!  HATED IT! Do NOT ever ever buy directly from Luminess Air!  I cancelled.becuae I did NOT like this product but I am still seeing charges on my amex. They are supposed to cancel and the agen still has not done so!  I am so  NEVER use this horrible company!</li>
            <li> Amazing! My Luminess Air starter kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be. With easy to follow directions, it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of this. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how great I look. I know what I&#x27;ll be giving out for X-Mas this year to my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while at this.  Read reviews and they were mixed.  I am glad I got it.  It does, as some have said, get clogged (I believe it is sticky residue from not cleaning it well enough) a little but it doesn&#x27;t mess up the distribution of foundation.  I clean mine after every use with distilled water to keep it from doing that.  For the cost, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I really like the luminess air brush system. I take it everywhere I travel to.</li>
            <li> works perfectly! love the product. shipped on time!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use! Love it!</li>
            <li> Tonya helped me today with my order and was VERY knowledgeable and professional about the product. I&#x27;m a Sweet Adeline and I use Luminess when we have Competition and when we have &amp;#34;Sing-Outs&amp;#34;... and I even use it on some of the other women on my group! WE GOTTA LOOK GOOD!!💋💋💋 I love it for light every-day wear, too!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Luminess air brush system for my wife and at first she loved it.  However, the stylus started giving her problems after three weeks of use and proper cleaning.  The nob that controls the mist became lose and the makeup would spray too heavily.  I called the company and had to pay for a new stylus which after a few weeks use did the same thing as the previous one.  Unfortunately every thing seemed to go down hill from there.  This product is defective!  Please do not waste your money!  The customer service is just horrible. They do not stand behind their product. They are not helpful in any way  and they blamed me for the defective stylus.  I&#x27;m very disappointed considering I&#x27;ve spent over three hundred dollars on this fiasco.</li>
            <li> Too much work and time. Sent back!</li>
            <li> BIG SCAM!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You order the trial and then they charge for the whole product as a deposit....deposit of what?? if you order only the trial .......&lt;br /&gt;They offer money back guarantee......BS, they charge some fees for shipping and handle and who knows what else&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t even try it.......</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with makeup ripoff</li>
            <li> My Mama go to for a flawless look. Could come in bigger bottle, so as to last longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! However you need to practice with it in good lighting until you get the hang of it. It is simple to use but the makeup blend you need is your own combination (that you need to figure out).</li>
            <li> I love this system! I had been contemplating getting an airbrush system for a while but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. I finally decided to get one with birthday money and I LOVE it! It&#x27;s so easy to put on and lasts all day! I don&#x27;t know how the fancier ones are, but I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so I don&#x27;t need a bigger one. :)</li>
            <li> Would recommend a new one. Mine was used after it said new. I looked in stylus snd it had makeup in it.</li>
            <li> I have seen both good and bad reviews but honestly im really happy with it.</li>
            <li> ON TV: PERFECTION----You match your skin tone--which they say changes daily--based on many factors including the weather, age, how you feel that day, and on and  on.  THen--you apply this which goes on perfectly even and without areas that are thicker/thinner or lighter darker so it appears like you have perfect skin with nothing on.  It works well, its not easy to get it nailed down--takes some practice and some trial and error but once you do, its very easy and can be done in minutes so the TV commercial says and shows you.    IN REAL LIFE:  First off you have to match your skin tone.  They give you a \\&quot;cookbook\\&quot;, if you are this skin tone, then use a little of this, a little of that.  You put it in the machine, jsut a little tiny bit, and it spurts out and is gone.  You put in more and put it on your face.  You don&#x27;t realize its coming out (its very very fine mist) and then its gone once you start to see it.  You add more, and you finally get it done.  OK now what?  You have to clean the machine and do it again tomorrow.    Tomorrow rolls around and after a few tomorrows it starts working less and less and then you call the company.  Once you get someone who is not trying to sell you the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; machine and more product, you discover you need a new stylus.  Is it defective, NO, you have to buy it.  But its only two weeks old you say, and they say, \\&quot;its not covered under the warranty\\&quot;  or you can send yours in and they will look at it and determine---but all at your expense.  Did I say the stylus is 99$?  Yes its 99$.    If this is something you want to do, save yourself the headaches and get a professional ssytem.  I was and am tempted to buy a badger airbrush, (the ones artists use) and tinkering around with regular store makeup.  The luminess stuff is very expensive---(for what you get--quality, quantity, shipping, handling, etc)    If you are trying to fix a miracle, and look like when you were 18 then maybe this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you are 18 you don&#x27;t need it, lol.  Everyone else will have varying success and opinions.  GOOD LUCK        UPDATE 12/4/2014    We bought ours on TV on infomercial and buy some of the products here on amazon.  I can tell you that this is a great buy for 100ish $.  The TV one is I think 5 payments of about 50&#x3D;60$ so if you are interested in this---now is the time to get it.  I am adding this FYI.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Sticky feeling. It s great of you want sheer coverage. I have lots of dark spots n acne scars, doesnt cover much for me :(&lt;br /&gt;N colors -- medium, is hard to mix a right shade for my face</li>
            <li> its for my wife she loves it proffessional looking results ,easy clean up ,very easy to use ,great results, many colors</li>
            <li> needs lots of practice I know. I don&#x27;t like doing underneath my eyes, it leave wrinkles I didn&#x27;t even know I had :(.  I had to use a sponge and smooth it out. the rest of the face look flawless.</li>
            <li> Do NOT ever ever buy directly from Luminess Air! they are a scam company and will not tell you that once you give them your card, THEN they tell that each month you will be debited automatically for a new supply. But you can cancel....no you can&#x27;t. We tried calls, letters, emails.....we have to cancel our card to stop the debits!!! They do NOT respond....go to any complaint site and see the numerous complaints on this company. If you must have this product, do so through Amazon.....or buy a similar product. NEVER use this horrible company!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my Mom for a gift. Love this thing will never go back to the old way of make-up. This is the third one I have bought I think I have family hooked on it.</li>
            <li> It works for the most part.  To get actual coverage it took a lot and of course I broke out like crazy.  I have only used it twice and will not be using again.  I would not recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great deal ive had it for a couple months now and i love it! it is very light anf natural looking just how it says my only problem is it makes my face oily towards the end of the day. but definetely satisfied</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 of these for my sister &amp; myself. I&#x27;m praying its gonna work without complications.</li>
            <li> The product does cover well, and looks nice- when I can get it to work! Air comes out, but no product. I have already replaced stylus, and customer service is good, but am tired of the pesky stylus.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use hence the 1 star. I was very disappointed with the results I achieved. Maybe it is not meant for an older woman with wrinkles and some sun damage because imo it accentuated my flaws and did nothing to cover my imperfections. I tried using it several times in case it was my inexperience that caused the terrible results. I looked better before applying this makeup. The company that amazon ordered it through was very helpful and handled my complaint quickly and to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, I am contacting company tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I love it, it did clog up a time or two at first. I took it all apart and cleaned it and put it back together...its worked perfectly since then.</li>
            <li> The airbrush system is nice the color that it turns your face is not. Far too orange-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought it up to four stars because I tried another color and it was perfect! Goes on well, lasts all day and gives a very even finish. Find your right color and it works great. I have ivory skin and #4 is right for me</li>
