            <li>So happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>I am very excited!</li>
            <li>I have hyperpigmentation and bleach products does not work as effectively as recommended.</li>
            <li>It really works, it smells nice, doesn&#x27;t Irritate my skin!!</li>
            <li>My butt is baby soft skin and the tone is just perfect.</li>
            <li>One of the best toning cream I use so far ...</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned.</li>
            <li>Flawless butt and inner thighs.</li>
            <li>I even order more .</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t product for prolonged use, so I can&#x27;t tell if it would work unless I bought more bottles</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already started to see results :)</li>
            <li>I used it for more than 3wks</li>
            <li>Many of these complaints were about the size and the price</li>
            <li>so i will be ordering more, but i use it twice a day like it instructs.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I will surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>i guess i will have to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with the kojic soap and the difference it has made is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love the product I used it for my anal bleaching and after 3 application I can tell that area has gotten lighter.</li>
            <li>To the point if I order two to three more bottles I will have the even skin I prayed on having all my life.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>But i will start moisturizing more than once a day</li>
            <li>so i can see more change.</li>
            <li>Make my skin pretty good</li>
            <li>They were quick and honest with a response, that they do not recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used the Marie Frances tone creme and so far I am seeing great results.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it, so I bought it not thinking if it was safe for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great especially when used with the Kojic soap.</li>
            <li>My skin light olive.bad purchase</li>
            <li>works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and so far so good on the results.</li>
            <li>so far so good i can see some change.</li>
            <li>only gud thing with this is dat it smells very nice</li>
            <li>and this whitening cream has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li>None of this stuff works I think, I found out that natural remedies work way better, when you use more than one combined, than all of these creams.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may have better results if you purchase several of these wallet busters, but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>However, I searched on the internet about its main whitening chemical agent called beta-arbutin, and I found out that it may cause cancer in some rare cases (not 100% safe).</li>
            <li>honestly I don&#x27;t think you will see a huge difference after the first but after that second bottle TRUST ME</li>
            <li>it still has probably another months worth</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li>small.i don&#x27;t think its worth the price in my currency.</li>
            <li>Ok first I will say that I have just got my 3rd bottle in the mail!</li>
            <li>When I first got this in the mail i was like &amp;#34;wtf&amp;#34; because of the size.</li>
            <li>I research high and low, this is by far is the most inexpensive, but accurate to its word product.</li>
            <li>I will order another tube and see if there is something positive.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly so can&#x27;t wear clothes directly over it.</li>
            <li>And for the amount of money for so little product you kind of hope for something.</li>
            <li>That being said I really was kind of skimpy when I used the product because I wanted to try it for a few weeks to see if there were any results.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as promised.</li>
            <li>Too much money for the quantity.</li>
            <li>or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add that I use this in the intimate area on my buttocks</li>
            <li>but in all fairness, the price was no secret and the size was posted so shame on us if that is the issue.</li>
            <li>maybe those with much darker skin would get some results)  </li>
            <li>I really saw no difference.</li>
            <li>Havent really noticed a difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does whiten, but not that much of the quantity.</li>
            <li>They were so fast and understanding and cancelled my order immediately.</li>
            <li>The only reason a lot people choose to buy the creams and not do the natural stuff, even though the home remedies are WAYYY cheaper, is because they require more of your patience and doing.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it enough I&#x27;m a busy full time student and full time employee.</li>
            <li>It works great even on dark skin, though have to moisturizer a lot as when using with the soap it dry up skin.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that it lightened my inner thighs significantly.</li>
            <li>If you keep your areas hair free then a dab can go a long way so you wont buy like 3 $20 bottles a month.  </li>
            <li>You can decide weather living without a risk of cancer or having this product for a beautiful skin but being insecure about your health status.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take months in most cases years to lighten a pigmentation dark spot, then what this creme can do within weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking even tone skin.</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up the skin on my knees, underarms and area between my legs</li>
            <li>I will probably need to use this more often and a lot longer before the dark area is completely gone.</li>
            <li>and if any signs of improvement I&#x27;ll repost with new comments.</li>
            <li>Actually, I just used this product for several days and it did really work quickly.</li>
            <li>an African American with light brown skin and have hyperpigmentation problems.</li>
            <li>Complete rip off!</li>
            <li>Print on label is so small I wouldn&#x27;t be able to read it with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I have no other complaints and I would purchase a few more tubes to ffinally get rid of my skin problem.</li>
            <li>Yes I recently discovered I&#x27;m pregnant and haven&#x27;t gotten used to the fact, that I need to screen products prior to use.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin has lightened up a few shades and it looks even and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really wish that they will increase the size of this product as it only lasts for maybe 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>After 2 months I had to get a refund directly from amazon because they ignore you and hope you just give up and go</li>
            <li>There is no way to describe it but BE WARNED IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO SMELLS.</li>
            <li>so far I have been using this for 3-4 weeks now.</li>
            <li>The tube is so small though, you will definitely have to order more.  </li>
            <li>After using one bottle of Marie France tone perfecting creme for a few weeks I have seen tremendous changes.</li>
            <li>Sure the bottle is tiny but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different creams before and it has caused some sort of allergic reaction (like burning feeling) and so far, this hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I must given a 4 star though because if you&#x27;re not careful it may leave the surrounding skin bit redness and irritation</li>
            <li>Barely did anything to bikini area.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>So far, I can see a difference in my skin tone especially in the inner thigh area.</li>
            <li>I would say a few marks *slightly* faded, then returned to its original state a week</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would say a few marks *slightly* faded, then returned to its original state a week</li>
            <li> Maybe if I wanted to invest quite a bit more to use for a few months it may have been different, but the tube is very small making it quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> Due to shaving, I&#x27;ve been suffering from discorolored thighs for about 7 years now and so far, this is the only cream that gave me noticeable results.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable change has been the lightening of black ingrown hair scars left behind.  </li>
            <li> I wish that this bottle is bigger because this doesn&#x27;t last me a long time.</li>
            <li> A complete rip off and a waste.</li>
            <li> Smelt like a fruity Jolly Rancher all day, and had a minimal effect even after following the directions.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no reason to not want to use it daily or forget to put the substance on due to the results and smell.</li>
            <li> its about as big as those little personal size bottles you get from bath and body works.</li>
            <li> Spots such as my buttocks, inner bikini area, and knees that hardly lightened a shade after numerous bleaching cremes, has now lightened areas I thought would never lighten within weeks.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this one will completely remove the dark skin after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I actually order the little bottle that would make you peel, and when the bottle arrived, it was leaking.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s been two weeks, and I see absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I used it on my inner thigh area where my skin is a few shades darker then the rest of me.(in the products defense</li>
            <li> As what other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I actually wish I had ordered two tubes because they are small.</li>
            <li> The only downfall I can say about this product is that it&#x27;s way too small for the price that you pay.</li>
            <li> But if you want something that lightens up dark buttocks but doesn&#x27;t give you a burning feeling, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with hopes of seeing results for my dark marks on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Not worth a try</li>
            <li> But after going to a two dermatologist that recommended me to pay $2k+ to remove dark spots with no guarantee that it will 100% even my dark spots.</li>
            <li> lead to itching also my skin it really thin and sensitive</li>
            <li> so i bought a few other marie france products.</li>
            <li> Brown area almost gone with less then one tube.  </li>
            <li> Too little of a tube for the price.</li>
            <li> I would moisturize after use of the products everyday.</li>
            <li> so far, I have not experienced any negative reactions.</li>
            <li> I bought this item feel like work a little bit the tube too small for price</li>
            <li> It is as small as travel shampoo.</li>
            <li> The size for the price was sooooooooo small.</li>
            <li> I know the bottle is a bit small</li>
            <li> I do realize things take time and that this is no magic cream.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Beware that this product is small</li>
            <li> but yet I don&#x27;t want to pay $20 for this small bottle.</li>
            <li> Small bottle..</li>
            <li> and you get a small amount</li>
            <li> , at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told.</li>
            <li> nothing dramatic yet but something slight.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small</li>
            <li> Very small tube for the price.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely skeptical about trying it as previous products caused me to get skin irritations, but</li>
            <li> A little expensive.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin and left me a really bad rash</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin got worse (darker instead of being lighter or toner as advertised) after using this cream.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst vendor I&#x27;ve dealt with.</li>
            <li> I immediately became sad and asked for a cancellation.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as well about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever, product was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad expensive to buy if it&#x27;s not doing anything, By the way, it smells bad!</li>
            <li> It literally made me sick.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed..</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid for getting fooled.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, so bad I can&#x27;t stand to use it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The customer service of this company is horrible.</li>
            <li> This product probably works, however it smells so awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I had to return this was because of the absolutely HORRIBLE SMELL!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream actually does work. It&#x27;s great especially when used with the Kojic soap. My butt is baby soft skin and the tone is just perfect. It works great even on dark skin, though have to moisturizer a lot as when using with the soap it dry up skin. Flawless butt and inner thighs.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen yet the result.i like the smell.it was good,though a bit expensive.i hope you can offer a big size or packaging.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as promised. Easy to apply and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Too much money for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I bought this item feel like work a little bit the tube too small for price</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. Maybe if I wanted to invest quite a bit more to use for a few months it may have been different, but the tube is very small making it quite pricey.  I purchased this based on reviews.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it said! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Used for 4 weeks no difference whatsoever. My skin light olive.bad purchase</li>
            <li> One of the best toning cream I use so far ...I even order more .</li>
            <li> Complete rip off! Just received my packet today and I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was! It is as small as travel shampoo. Paid a total of $24.98 including shipping. I feel so stupid for getting fooled.</li>
            <li> The size for the price was sooooooooo small. As what other reviews say. It didn&#x27;t do anything. The only thing I like is the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference using g the product. The customer service of this company is horrible.</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a month, and no results at all.  A complete rip off and a waste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the residue. There isn&#x27;t product for prolonged use, so I can&#x27;t tell if it would work unless I bought more bottles</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost three weeks and I&#x27;ve already started to see results :)....i have sensitive skin and I was extremely skeptical about trying it as previous products caused me to get skin irritations, but this works without any irritations which is a plus!</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with their kojic soap and all I can say is I love the results!!!! My skin has lightened up a few shades and it looks even and smooth. I wish that this bottle is bigger because this doesn&#x27;t last me a long time. I would probably reorder again every 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add that I use this in the intimate area on my buttocks (yes, THAT area), and so far, I have not experienced any negative reactions. I&#x27;ve tried different creams before and it has caused some sort of allergic reaction (like burning feeling) and so far, this hasn&#x27;t and this whitening cream has made a significant difference. I will probably need to use this more often and a lot longer before the dark area is completely gone. But if you want something that lightens up dark buttocks but doesn&#x27;t give you a burning feeling, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Ok first I will say that I have just got my 3rd bottle in the mail! I know the bottle is a bit small but this lotion has worked wonders for me along with the Marie France soap! It has really helped clear up the skin on my knees, underarms and area between my legs honestly I don&#x27;t think you will see a huge difference after the first but after that second bottle TRUST ME YOU WILL!!!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchased this product. So far, I can see a difference in my skin tone especially in the inner thigh area. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and so far so good on the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month but I see no difference. I apply morning and before bed to underarms but it&#x27;s the same. Although the bottle is surprisingly tiny it still has probably another months worth so I&#x27;ll use to end and if any signs of improvement I&#x27;ll repost with new comments.</li>
            <li> I used it for more than 3wks it didnt work!instead my knuckles went darker!d only gud thing with this is dat it smells very nice</li>
            <li> I used this cream daily and applied it daily as directed but two weeks later I don&#x27;t see a difference. I also noticed my skin got worse (darker instead of being lighter or toner as advertised) after using this cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with hopes of seeing results for my dark marks on my legs and arms. I do realize things take time and that this is no magic cream. Well it&#x27;s been two weeks, and I see absolutely no difference. I actually wish I had ordered two tubes because they are small. I will order another tube and see if there is something positive. It&#x27;s a tad expensive to buy if it&#x27;s not doing anything, By the way, it smells bad! I guess that&#x27;s a good thing though, at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told. Stand by.</li>
            <li> Here is the deal, I bought this product in preparation for giving birth and the amount of strangers that would be looking at my lady business, enough said? Many of these complaints were about the size and the price but in all fairness, the price was no secret and the size was posted so shame on us if that is the issue. I simply saw no change. I used it on my inner thigh area where my skin is a few shades darker then the rest of me.(in the products defense I am very light skinned. maybe those with much darker skin would get some results)  I really saw no difference. And for the amount of money for so little product you kind of hope for something. That being said I really was kind of skimpy when I used the product because I wanted to try it for a few weeks to see if there were any results. Conclusion: I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This creme, omg its working!  The tube is so small though, you will definitely have to order more.  I have been using this 2 weeks and can definitely see a difference.  I&#x27;m almost out so i will be ordering more, but i use it twice a day like it instructs.  The most noticeable change has been the lightening of black ingrown hair scars left behind.  I&#x27;m also going to order the soap.  This is the best an fastest tone/lightening creme I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it realy works ! love it</li>
            <li> None of this stuff works I think, I found out that natural remedies work way better, when you use more than one combined, than all of these creams. The only reason a lot people choose to buy the creams and not do the natural stuff, even though the home remedies are WAYYY cheaper, is because they require more of your patience and doing.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, it clears my skin in 2 weeks. It smells very good and no itchy. I will surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> so far so good i can see some change. i just wish the tube was a bit bigger! i guess i will have to buy some more.</li>
            <li> Havent really noticed a difference in my skin color. Too little of a tube for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now and I can tell that it lightened my inner thighs significantly. Due to shaving, I&#x27;ve been suffering from discorolored thighs for about 7 years now and so far, this is the only cream that gave me noticeable results. The only downfall I can say about this product is that it&#x27;s way too small for the price that you pay. I really wish that they will increase the size of this product as it only lasts for maybe 3 weeks. Aside from that, I have no other complaints and I would purchase a few more tubes to ffinally get rid of my skin problem.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin and left me a really bad rash</li>
            <li> It really works, it smells nice, doesn&#x27;t Irritate my skin!! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Took about a month to arrive. Print on label is so small I wouldn&#x27;t be able to read it with a magnifying glass. Hope it doesn&#x27;t have that ingredient that causes cancer.... Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly so can&#x27;t wear clothes directly over it.</li>
            <li> It does whiten, but not that much of the quantity. A little expensive.</li>
            <li> Too small. I actually order the little bottle that would make you peel, and when the bottle arrived, it was leaking. I called customer service, I told them about it, they&#x27;d said they would send me another bottle, instead they sent me the lotion. Kinda disappointed.. I also stopped using it. Its an airtight product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with the kojic soap and the difference it has made is phenomenal. Sure the bottle is tiny but a little goes a long way (I use it on underarms). It&#x27;s been almost a month and the darker patches are almost 100% gone. My skin tone looks even. So happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product now after using the peeling oil that comes with the kit. That product worked for me so I&#x27;m hoping this one will completely remove the dark skin after a few weeks. Beware that this product is small that&#x27;s why I purchased two of these creams because it will not last me a month using it.</li>
            <li> Ruined my private area skin! Actually, I just used this product for several days and it did really work quickly. However, I searched on the internet about its main whitening chemical agent called beta-arbutin, and I found out that it may cause cancer in some rare cases (not 100% safe). That is way I stopped using it. It doesn&#x27;t worth the risk. You can decide weather living without a risk of cancer or having this product for a beautiful skin but being insecure about your health status.</li>
            <li> This product probably works, however it smells so awful. I regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Make my skin pretty good</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this works. What I can tell you is you are stuck with it. This is by far the worst vendor I&#x27;ve dealt with. After 2 months I had to get a refund directly from amazon because they ignore you and hope you just give up and go away.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I had to return this was because of the absolutely HORRIBLE SMELL!! It literally made me sick. I didn&#x27;t even have to put it on. I had to wrap it up and keep it in another room until I mailed it back. There is no way to describe it but BE WARNED IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO SMELLS.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it enough I&#x27;m a busy full time student and full time employee.</li>
            <li> I love the product I used it for my anal bleaching and after 3 application I can tell that area has gotten lighter. Now it&#x27;s become hugh difference.  I must given a 4 star though because if you&#x27;re not careful it may leave the surrounding skin bit redness and irritation lead to itching also my skin it really thin and sensitive so that&#x27;s why. So watch where you apply to but anything from that I recommend this product if you want your anal to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever, product was disappointing. Not worth a try</li>
            <li> I tried and tried but couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because my sister said it has worked wonders for her. She used it on her inner thighs and private areas and said it has lightened her skin after on 3 uses. I wanted to try it, so I bought it not thinking if it was safe for pregnant women. Yes I recently discovered I&#x27;m pregnant and haven&#x27;t gotten used to the fact, that I need to screen products prior to use. Either way, I had bough the product and I then inquired to the seller if it was pregnancy-safe. They were quick and honest with a response, that they do not recommend. I immediately became sad and asked for a cancellation. They were so fast and understanding and cancelled my order immediately. They even congratulated me. I will definitely be buying this tone perfecter after my baby is born.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month now and I see great improvement in my skin.....will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see my skin peeled nor change color.  The bottle is very small so maybe I need 3 bottles before I see the result but yet I don&#x27;t want to pay $20 for this small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used the Marie Frances tone creme and so far I am seeing great results. The peel however, didn&#x27;t work ( I did everything I was instructed to do, but my skin refused to peel) I have hyperpigmentation and bleach products does not work as effectively as recommended. It&#x27;ll take months in most cases years to lighten a pigmentation dark spot, then what this creme can do within weeks. After using one bottle of Marie France tone perfecting creme for a few weeks I have seen tremendous changes. To the point if I order two to three more bottles I will have the even skin I prayed on having all my life. Spots such as my buttocks, inner bikini area, and knees that hardly lightened a shade after numerous bleaching cremes, has now lightened areas I thought would never lighten within weeks. The product smells very good and it isn&#x27;t oily so there&#x27;s no reason to not want to use it daily or forget to put the substance on due to the results and smell. I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking even tone skin. I was skeptical as well about purchasing this product. But after going to a two dermatologist that recommended me to pay $2k+ to remove dark spots with no guarantee that it will 100% even my dark spots. I research high and low, this is by far is the most inexpensive, but accurate to its word product. Good luck ladies and gents on your quest!</li>
            <li> After waiting three weeks for it to be delivered, I used this product for about a month. Smelt like a fruity Jolly Rancher all day, and had a minimal effect even after following the directions. I would say a few marks *slightly* faded, then returned to its original state a week afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have better results if you purchase several of these wallet busters, but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> works fantastic.  Brown area almost gone with less then one tube.  I love the smell.  I am very excited!</li>
            <li> Small bottle.. Barely did anything to bikini area. Idk if it was the bottle or what but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> When I first got this in the mail i was like &amp;#34;wtf&amp;#34; because of the size. its about as big as those little personal size bottles you get from bath and body works. I have come to the conclusion that nothing works alone so i bought a few other marie france products. I would moisturize after use of the products everyday. so far I have been using this for 3-4 weeks now. Im an African American with light brown skin and have hyperpigmentation problems. i use this on my underarms, inner thighs, bikini line, and pubic area. If you keep your areas hair free then a dab can go a long way so you wont buy like 3 $20 bottles a month.  Ive seen some lightening. nothing dramatic yet but something slight. But i will start moisturizing more than once a day so i can see more change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of the product so I don&#x27;t see results yet.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, so bad I can&#x27;t stand to use it. Very small tube for the price.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars. It&#x27;s expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all and you get a small amount</li>
            <li> Thought it helped for my Hyperpigmentation!</li>
            <li> this package is sooo small.i don&#x27;t think its worth the price in my currency. I been using it just over a month now and im still waiting for it to start working</li>
