            <li>and I loved the smell and asked him what it was?</li>
            <li>But the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just doesnt seem to be in good taste.</li>

            <li>Excellent value, very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>I own 10 colognes at the moment and all have been bought through the Internet.</li>
            <li>It could possibly be my own chemical makeup</li>
            <li>Smelled it on one of the testers, asked my husband if he liked it (which he did).</li>
            <li>Will update when I hear from Dad how he liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not screaming cologne at everyone around me, and it makes a nice surprise for the ladies who reach closer proximity.  </li>
            <li>A nice impression to leave with.  </li>
            <li>Incredible, modern gentlemen smell that my girlfriend loved immediately as I put it on.</li>
            <li>everything went perfect :) thanks</li>
            <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
            <li>so he uses about 4 sprays a day, but the bottle is huge and a good price.</li>
            <li>Awesome value as a gift for my 17 year old son, he loves it</li>
            <li>Fine!</li>
            <li>I will buy this perfume again smells very good to me, my 7 years old son loves it too!</li>
            <li>My wife spends more &#x27;quality&#x27; time with me when I wear this....</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>This is an awesome cologne, I tried it at Nordstrom and found it on Amazon way cheaper for the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Nice pleasing woodsy/smoky aroma with a smooth projection.</li>
            <li>I LOVE AMAZON</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and inquiries on what type of cologne</li>
            <li>while at Macy&#x27;s but knew I could find it more affordable online.</li>
            <li>Now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Me, I find it lovely, yes</li>
            <li>the ladies love smelling this on me</li>
            <li>my favorite scent of all time and</li>
            <li>and I love smelling it on him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I use it when I&#x27;m working in the yard.</li>
            <li>I love this smell and will always have a bottle.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to purchase more online.</li>
            <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
            <li>What is your station in life; what is your experience with fragrances; where on earth is something like this appropriate?</li>
            <li>One spray on the wrist and under the chin lasts me most of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times by both sexes on this.</li>
            <li>Sexy and intoxicating, makes anyone follow you around</li>
            <li>it seems to be cheap!</li>
            <li>I took a chance after getting slammed with so many online ads - just not my style or smell.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on it all the time and have been stopped by many strangers asking what it is and where to find it.</li>
            <li>Now I smell even better; or so do I think...</li>
            <li>It has a good smell that was priced right.</li>
            <li>this is the best smelling colone I have gotten my husband in a long time</li>
            <li>When I first got the cologne I loved it</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>NIETHER EROS OR GENTLEMAN WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN A FANCY BOTTLE WITH SOME CHEAP ALCOHOL LACED IN IT.....</li>
            <li>and it was over $60.00 there and was marked as very popular.</li>
            <li>and it was purchased on amazon due to the great price!  </li>
            <li>But, you&#x27;ll likely want to spray on some more towards the end of the afternoon if you want the smell great into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its not too strong</li>
            <li>In terms of high fashion, I have always loved anything by Givenchy.</li>
            <li>best cologne i own so far, wear it regularly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>but females really do enjoy this smell.</li>
            <li>So fresh and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and way cheaper than a dept store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s horribly cheap looking like its made at a flee market.</li>
            <li>thats cheap stuff).</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, my father could not be happier with this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, which is good.</li>
            <li>It dissipates perhaps more rapidly than some others, although I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning only to have a lady friend when  hugging me  goodnight remark with delight how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>But this is coming from a guy who loved the old hollister scent.</li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li>I originally came across this cologne</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, love this cologne.</li>
            <li>The package and bottle shows to original from MFG.</li>
            <li>The perfume was original.  </li>
            <li>It has that unique edge to it</li>
            <li>Original.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells pleasant to where it&#x27;s not too strong but it lasts ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li>Givenchy Gentlemen Only offers an excellent blend of those qualities.  </li>
            <li>Light and refreshing with strong masculine tones.</li>
            <li>I felt that the scent was just right for someone in that age range!</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne last summer and loved it.  </li>
            <li>minutes later I&#x27;m wondering if I smell as good as I paid for.  </li>
            <li>A slightly sweet citrusy smelling perfume (not cologne</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a good buy</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is a dreadfully sweet and uncomplicated potion.</li>
            <li>This scent is too sweet and flowery for my tastes.</li>
            <li>It was a quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I am glad I took a step ahead and decide to buy this cologne which became an instant favorite to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sophisticated and I would recommend it to a high school</li>
            <li>I love this smooth and fresh but masculine sent.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that lasted a long time and smelled good, so one of the two earns this cologne three stars.</li>
            <li>This is a very light-smelling cologne, which is fine for some men.  </li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t want to sound too much like a tool</li>
            <li>Great scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and lasts all day, definitely a repeat customer here</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Givenchy Gentlemen Only strikes a really nice balance.  </li>
            <li>Everytime my husband wears it, it reminds me of a fresh shower and a tuxedo.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean and has none of the strong must and leather present in the original Gentlemen.  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat, this fragrence shouted &amp;#34;buy</li>
            <li>Product smells great, but it does not last more than half an hour.</li>
            <li>But, certain smells (i.e.: Eternity for Men) are nauseatingly sweet to me.  </li>
            <li>smell is on the sweeter side but is still very manly for a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, very versatile, not overpowering my teenage son</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last too long but great for a night out sort of thing.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a cologne from Amazon</li>
            <li>I favor smells that are somewhat crisp and spicy for men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>My wife swears that Givench is one for the Tops, an exclusive aroma of higher caliber.  </li>
            <li>Should you be interested and you have some time at a mall.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Givenchy experience.</li>
            <li>to Macy&#x27;s and test it out first</li>
            <li>Once you use the product the smell does not last for more than a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I first smelled it when a co-worker of mine walked by</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested to know who on earth rates this well - as compared to what?</li>
            <li>Big time 0/10 rating.on earth is something like this appropriate?</li>
            <li>well how did I get it in the mail in the first place?).  </li>
            <li>So I purchased it because of an ad I saw on Details magazine; I instantly felt in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelt good still, but definitely not the same as what we had hoped.</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but positive responses from women.</li>
            <li>the cologne smell is magnificent but you will have to respray every hour and a half to two hours and a half.</li>
            <li>I am very particular on the kinds of scents I wear and</li>
            <li>But this one is too strong not the same as ones you find in europe.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and good projection.</li>
            <li>Absolutely intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>admit, it has an exotic perfume quality to it, it&#x27;s the pink pepper.  </li>
            <li>It is the real deal and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li>and he really likes it</li>
            <li>My wife likes the smell so thats all that really matters.</li>
            <li>I had tested Givenchy Gentlemen Only at the airport duty free shop in Paris</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot stand a &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even like the &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34; smells.</li>
            <li>Appreciate fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and woody however the smell disappears after about a half hour.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the fragrance and it would last all day long, so I was happy to see the larger bottle for less on Amazon and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This is the larger bottled size, has a great sprayer (some on Amazon the sprayer is defective in operating), and the smell is exactly the same as the more expensive ones on the ship.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll definitely buy more often for colognes online because you just simply cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well.</li>
            <li>I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well.</li>
            <li>Still early in the game to accurately gauge compliments, but I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Long lasting  Love it.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of barely launched smells; I&#x27;ve always tried to stick to the same good ol&#x27; ones like Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, Terre d&#x27;h&amp;egrave;rmes, or Mill&amp;egrave;sime Imperial by Creed...</li>
            <li>Sickeningly sweet and something you should generally wish to wash off as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>This is the second time in one year I bought this scent because I used it so much!</li>
            <li>Positive initial impression held.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but the solution is very weak.</li>
            <li>Log Cabin, or any generic fully artificially-flavored high-fructose corn syrup based syrup is much, much cheaper and, stirred with a little warm water and poured in a vaporizer bottle, will have the same net effect on those around you.</li>
            <li>As a 27 year old male, I&#x27;ve really taken a liking to this scent.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li>Classy and masculine.</li>
            <li>but it does not last or even really linger.  </li>
            <li>Ladies did not get aroused</li>
            <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li>I splurged on a blind-buy bottle based on reviews, but obviously I didn&#x27;t get the gist of what this really smells like from any of the reviews - therein lies the danger of believing the pyramid or the reviews you find</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s still there, trust me, I love the fragrance, but if it&#x27;s not their, then you&#x27;ll get what I mean.  </li>
            <li>My husband typically wears Lacoste which is musty and strong; similar to this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this same product from Macy&#x27;s and the lasting effect is much higher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll more than likely use this as my everyday cologne because of the big volume amount I bought.</li>
            <li>This was half the price and well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it&#x27;s an original product.</li>
            <li>Amazon had it more then half off the store value and got it here 3 days earlier then expected!</li>
            <li>It was given to a 30 year old male.  </li>
            <li>The smell barely stays for 30 mins..</li>
            <li>It has a masculine smell that i constantly get compliments on.</li>
            <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s similar characteristics, but prefer Givenchy Gentlemen Only for it&#x27;s more subtle</li>
            <li>What a hot mess.</li>
            <li>What a hot mess.</li>
            <li>Setting the record straight, yes, you are actually getting a nearly $90 bottle of cologne for half price.</li>
            <li>pictures of the item make it look a little sketchy, but the cologne i got was exactly the same as the one in stores!</li>
            <li>I bought it scent unsmelled, mainly due to high praise and review score from various Internet sources.</li>

            <li> Good for work.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the smell and asked him what it was?</li>
            <li> But the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just doesnt seem to be in good taste.</li>
            <li> Good perfume...</li>

            <li> Good, fresh office scent perfect for daytime wear.  </li>

            <li> Nice smell and not overpowering. ...</li>
            <li> Excellent value, very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> I own 10 colognes at the moment and all have been bought through the Internet.</li>
            <li> It could possibly be my own chemical makeup</li>
            <li> Smelled it on one of the testers, asked my husband if he liked it (which he did).</li>
            <li> Will update when I hear from Dad how he liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not screaming cologne at everyone around me, and it makes a nice surprise for the ladies who reach closer proximity.  </li>
            <li> A nice impression to leave with.  </li>
            <li> Incredible, modern gentlemen smell that my girlfriend loved immediately as I put it on.</li>
            <li> everything went perfect :) thanks</li>
            <li> I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
            <li> so he uses about 4 sprays a day, but the bottle is huge and a good price.</li>
            <li> Awesome value as a gift for my 17 year old son, he loves it</li>
            <li> Fine!</li>
            <li> I will buy this perfume again smells very good to me, my 7 years old son loves it too!</li>
            <li> My wife spends more &#x27;quality&#x27; time with me when I wear this....</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cologne, I tried it at Nordstrom and found it on Amazon way cheaper for the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasing woodsy/smoky aroma with a smooth projection.</li>
            <li> I LOVE AMAZON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and inquiries on what type of cologne</li>
            <li> while at Macy&#x27;s but knew I could find it more affordable online.</li>
            <li> Now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me, I find it lovely, yes</li>
            <li> the ladies love smelling this on me</li>
            <li> my favorite scent of all time and</li>
            <li> and I love smelling it on him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I use it when I&#x27;m working in the yard.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and will always have a bottle.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to purchase more online.</li>
            <li> I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
            <li> What is your station in life; what is your experience with fragrances; where on earth is something like this appropriate?</li>
            <li> One spray on the wrist and under the chin lasts me most of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times by both sexes on this.</li>
            <li> Sexy and intoxicating, makes anyone follow you around</li>
            <li> it seems to be cheap!</li>
            <li> I took a chance after getting slammed with so many online ads - just not my style or smell.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it all the time and have been stopped by many strangers asking what it is and where to find it.</li>
            <li> Now I smell even better; or so do I think...</li>
            <li> It has a good smell that was priced right.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling colone I have gotten my husband in a long time</li>
            <li> When I first got the cologne I loved it</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> NIETHER EROS OR GENTLEMAN WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN A FANCY BOTTLE WITH SOME CHEAP ALCOHOL LACED IN IT.....</li>
            <li> and it was over $60.00 there and was marked as very popular.</li>
            <li> and it was purchased on amazon due to the great price!  </li>
            <li> But, you&#x27;ll likely want to spray on some more towards the end of the afternoon if you want the smell great into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not too strong</li>
            <li> In terms of high fashion, I have always loved anything by Givenchy.</li>
            <li> best cologne i own so far, wear it regularly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> but females really do enjoy this smell.</li>
            <li> So fresh and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and way cheaper than a dept store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horribly cheap looking like its made at a flee market.</li>
            <li> thats cheap stuff).</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, my father could not be happier with this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, which is good.</li>
            <li> It dissipates perhaps more rapidly than some others, although I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning only to have a lady friend when  hugging me  goodnight remark with delight how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> But this is coming from a guy who loved the old hollister scent.</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> I originally came across this cologne</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, love this cologne.</li>
            <li> The package and bottle shows to original from MFG.</li>
            <li> The perfume was original.  </li>
            <li> It has that unique edge to it</li>
            <li> Original.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells pleasant to where it&#x27;s not too strong but it lasts ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> Givenchy Gentlemen Only offers an excellent blend of those qualities.  </li>
            <li> Light and refreshing with strong masculine tones.</li>
            <li> I felt that the scent was just right for someone in that age range!</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne last summer and loved it.  </li>
            <li> minutes later I&#x27;m wondering if I smell as good as I paid for.  </li>
            <li> A slightly sweet citrusy smelling perfume (not cologne</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a good buy</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is a dreadfully sweet and uncomplicated potion.</li>
            <li> This scent is too sweet and flowery for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It was a quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I am glad I took a step ahead and decide to buy this cologne which became an instant favorite to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sophisticated and I would recommend it to a high school</li>
            <li> I love this smooth and fresh but masculine sent.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that lasted a long time and smelled good, so one of the two earns this cologne three stars.</li>
            <li> This is a very light-smelling cologne, which is fine for some men.  </li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t want to sound too much like a tool</li>
            <li> Great scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lasts all day, definitely a repeat customer here</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Givenchy Gentlemen Only strikes a really nice balance.  </li>
            <li> Everytime my husband wears it, it reminds me of a fresh shower and a tuxedo.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> Masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and clean and has none of the strong must and leather present in the original Gentlemen.  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat, this fragrence shouted &amp;#34;buy</li>
            <li> Product smells great, but it does not last more than half an hour.</li>
            <li> But, certain smells (i.e.: Eternity for Men) are nauseatingly sweet to me.  </li>
            <li> smell is on the sweeter side but is still very manly for a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, very versatile, not overpowering my teenage son</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long but great for a night out sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a cologne from Amazon</li>
            <li> I favor smells that are somewhat crisp and spicy for men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> My wife swears that Givench is one for the Tops, an exclusive aroma of higher caliber.  </li>
            <li> Should you be interested and you have some time at a mall.  </li>
            <li> This was my first Givenchy experience.</li>
            <li> to Macy&#x27;s and test it out first</li>
            <li> Once you use the product the smell does not last for more than a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I first smelled it when a co-worker of mine walked by</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested to know who on earth rates this well - as compared to what?</li>
            <li> Big time 0/10 rating.on earth is something like this appropriate?</li>
            <li> well how did I get it in the mail in the first place?).  </li>
            <li> So I purchased it because of an ad I saw on Details magazine; I instantly felt in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelt good still, but definitely not the same as what we had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but positive responses from women.</li>
            <li> the cologne smell is magnificent but you will have to respray every hour and a half to two hours and a half.</li>
            <li> I am very particular on the kinds of scents I wear and</li>
            <li> But this one is too strong not the same as ones you find in europe.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and good projection.</li>
            <li> Absolutely intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> admit, it has an exotic perfume quality to it, it&#x27;s the pink pepper.  </li>
            <li> It is the real deal and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li> and he really likes it</li>
            <li> My wife likes the smell so thats all that really matters.</li>
            <li> I had tested Givenchy Gentlemen Only at the airport duty free shop in Paris</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot stand a &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t even like the &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34; smells.</li>
            <li> Appreciate fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and woody however the smell disappears after about a half hour.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the fragrance and it would last all day long, so I was happy to see the larger bottle for less on Amazon and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This is the larger bottled size, has a great sprayer (some on Amazon the sprayer is defective in operating), and the smell is exactly the same as the more expensive ones on the ship.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll definitely buy more often for colognes online because you just simply cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well.</li>
            <li> Still early in the game to accurately gauge compliments, but I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Long lasting  Love it.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of barely launched smells; I&#x27;ve always tried to stick to the same good ol&#x27; ones like Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, Terre d&#x27;h&amp;egrave;rmes, or Mill&amp;egrave;sime Imperial by Creed...</li>
            <li> Sickeningly sweet and something you should generally wish to wash off as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> This is the second time in one year I bought this scent because I used it so much!</li>
            <li> Positive initial impression held.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but the solution is very weak.</li>
            <li> Log Cabin, or any generic fully artificially-flavored high-fructose corn syrup based syrup is much, much cheaper and, stirred with a little warm water and poured in a vaporizer bottle, will have the same net effect on those around you.</li>
            <li> As a 27 year old male, I&#x27;ve really taken a liking to this scent.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li> Classy and masculine.</li>
            <li> but it does not last or even really linger.  </li>
            <li> Ladies did not get aroused</li>
            <li> I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li> I splurged on a blind-buy bottle based on reviews, but obviously I didn&#x27;t get the gist of what this really smells like from any of the reviews - therein lies the danger of believing the pyramid or the reviews you find</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s still there, trust me, I love the fragrance, but if it&#x27;s not their, then you&#x27;ll get what I mean.  </li>
            <li> My husband typically wears Lacoste which is musty and strong; similar to this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this same product from Macy&#x27;s and the lasting effect is much higher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll more than likely use this as my everyday cologne because of the big volume amount I bought.</li>
            <li> This was half the price and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s an original product.</li>
            <li> Amazon had it more then half off the store value and got it here 3 days earlier then expected!</li>
            <li> It was given to a 30 year old male.  </li>
            <li> The smell barely stays for 30 mins..</li>
            <li> It has a masculine smell that i constantly get compliments on.</li>
            <li> My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s similar characteristics, but prefer Givenchy Gentlemen Only for it&#x27;s more subtle</li>
            <li> What a hot mess.</li>
            <li> What a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Setting the record straight, yes, you are actually getting a nearly $90 bottle of cologne for half price.</li>
            <li> pictures of the item make it look a little sketchy, but the cologne i got was exactly the same as the one in stores!</li>
            <li> I bought it scent unsmelled, mainly due to high praise and review score from various Internet sources.</li>
            <li> Crisp,Clean,Fresh,and Long Lasting!!!</li>
            <li> He was disappointed to receive it and have it smell nothing like the sample he so loved.  </li>
            <li> I echo other people&#x27;s comments that the packaging is not quite the same either, so I feel like I got cheated with some generic version.  </li>
            <li> I even test sprayed 3 other fragrances on different parts of my arm to gauge this.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine sample, It wasn&#x27;t over powering and a single spray lasts me for a while.</li>
            <li> It dries down into something that is only overpoweringly cloying, but the topnote is a blast of sugar-coated, encrusted sugar cubes.</li>
            <li> as I hate that stench, however it is either so minimal that I can&#x27;t detect it, or every other part of its scent profile is just that good.</li>
            <li> However, this scent, while similar, is not very strong and I find I need two sprays to get the same effect of one spray on the previous bottle from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> Faint scent, wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Macy&#x27;s and realized i can save roughly 30 dollars</li>
            <li> but after some usage I started to notice that the smell was not lasting as long as other colognes that I had in the past.</li>
            <li> He can spritz about 5 sprays compared to 3 and it lasts about half as long.  </li>
            <li> Just saying - you can&#x27;t go wrong ;-)</li>
            <li> I was in Sephora the other day</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, exactly as I expected the product to be!</li>
            <li> I ran out and delayed buying it again due to the price.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only a small caveat.</li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;gentlemen&amp;#34; they must mean teenage boys, which may be clever marketing, but all the worse for those of us who need to smell, minimally, like a grown-up,</li>
            <li> Average longevity.</li>
            <li> Got 3.3 oz bottle online for slightly less than what 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> Please understand I&#x27;m not one who bathes in cologne, but I am fond of a smell that lasts, subtle, yet present.  </li>
            <li> Little shorter than I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li> And the other morning in my neighborhood coffee shop the owner stopped after walking past the group of people in line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the heavy musks.  </li>
            <li> It has a lightness to it that doesn&#x27;t sit too heavily in the air.  </li>
            <li> So bad in fact, that he literally made me order it right away.  </li>
            <li> Price was 50% less than department stores!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne at nearly half off the department store price!</li>

            <li> only last a minutes bad choice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; enough for my hubby, and expensive.</li>
            <li> but recipient said it seemed fake, scent did not last.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, stale cologne smell towards the late afternoon/evening.  </li>
            <li> Subtle,</li>
            <li> Very bad don&#x27;t smell like the real perfume and</li>
            <li> I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Not ideal for work since it starts to wear off after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Either i got a fake product or this is designed to stay for 30 mins.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are feeling vulnerable, don&#x27;t be around a man who is wearing this because you will give in to temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a fake no doubt</li>
            <li> BAD NOT GOOD.....</li>
            <li> I hate when someone walks past me</li>
            <li> It is ATROCIOUSLY bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is very good, stays for full day</li>
            <li> Absolutely intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, it has an exotic perfume quality to it, it&#x27;s the pink pepper.  But some of us guys can pull it off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and it was purchased on amazon due to the great price!  It is the real deal and the scent was amazing..  It was given to a 30 year old male.  I felt that the scent was just right for someone in that age range!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 17 year old son. He loved it!</li>
            <li> perfect! pictures of the item make it look a little sketchy, but the cologne i got was exactly the same as the one in stores! great deal!!</li>
            <li> This is my dayly fragance. Fine!</li>
            <li> Crisp,Clean,Fresh,and Long Lasting!!! Everytime I wear this cologne I receive a complement! I also love the way it stays in your clothes after weeks of spraying it on!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but the solution is very weak. I wanted something that lasted a long time and smelled good, so one of the two earns this cologne three stars.</li>
            <li> The smell barely stays for 30 mins.. Either i got a fake product or this is designed to stay for 30 mins.  Very disappointed..</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. Classy and masculine. I wear it at work and when going out.</li>
            <li> My wife spends more &#x27;quality&#x27; time with me when I wear this.... Just saying - you can&#x27;t go wrong ;-)</li>
            <li> Great men&#x27;s fragrance! I love the smell and I&#x27;m always getting compliments about it. I highly recommend this cologne! It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this from Sephora last year and said it cost around $60-65 for the 1.7 oz bottle.  I really liked the fragrance and it would last all day long, so I was happy to see the larger bottle for less on Amazon and ordered it.  However, this scent, while similar, is not very strong and I find I need two sprays to get the same effect of one spray on the previous bottle from Sephora.  It&#x27;s almost like this larger bottle was diluted.  I echo other people&#x27;s comments that the packaging is not quite the same either, so I feel like I got cheated with some generic version.  I guess you truly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cologne, I tried it at Nordstrom and found it on Amazon way cheaper for the larger bottle. The fragrance lasts throughout the day also.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. Nice smell and not overpowering. ...My fiance gets alot of compliments from women.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf after smelling it in an add in a magazine, and he and I just love it!! its not too strong so he uses about 4 sprays a day, but the bottle is huge and a good price. I was in Sephora the other day and it was over $60.00 there and was marked as very popular.</li>
            <li> A present for my son, bought in the States to take home to the UK. Excellent value, very speedy delivery. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, this fragrence shouted &amp;#34;buy me&amp;#34;. Nice pleasing woodsy/smoky aroma with a smooth projection. I even test sprayed 3 other fragrances on different parts of my arm to gauge this. ( 2 D&amp;G, 1 Versace). Positive initial impression held. Get a solid 5 - 6 hours out of this. Pleasing aroma without coming on too stong. Got 3.3 oz bottle online for slightly less than what 1.7 oz. was going for in mall dept. store. Still early in the game to accurately gauge compliments, but I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling colone I have gotten my husband in a long time and he really likes it</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, exactly as I expected the product to be! Awesome service and unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> This, in my opinion, is the best cologne made by Givenchy. The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Awesome value as a gift for my 17 year old son, he loves it</li>
            <li> VERY GREAT PRICE! I LOVE AMAZON</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long but great for a night out sort of thing. I have had nothing but positive responses from women. Not ideal for work since it starts to wear off after about 4 hours. That is just my mileage anyway. May be different for you. Women seem to like it.</li>
            <li> Good compliments from both friends and strangers. You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell that was priced right. My wife likes the smell so thats all that really matters.</li>
            <li> I had tested Givenchy Gentlemen Only at the airport duty free shop in Paris and I liked it. But this one is too strong not the same as ones you find in europe.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and inquiries on what type of cologne I&#x27;m wearing from both men and women. The cologne smells pleasant to where it&#x27;s not too strong but it lasts ALL DAY LONG! I originally came across this cologne while at Macy&#x27;s but knew I could find it more affordable online. Now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll more than likely use this as my everyday cologne because of the big volume amount I bought. So to anyone that enjoys smelling good or a good smelling man, this is the cologne to buy!</li>
            <li> best cologne i own so far, wear it regularly. It has a masculine smell that i constantly get compliments on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband just because.  He loved it and so do I!  Smells sooo good!  So fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, very versatile, not overpowering my teenage son and I can both get away with wearing it.</li>
            <li> We tried this scent on a cruise ship, but when we saw the price we said, &amp;#34;No freaking way we&#x27;re spending that!&amp;#34; We went on Amazon and voila! This is the larger bottled size, has a great sprayer (some on Amazon the sprayer is defective in operating), and the smell is exactly the same as the more expensive ones on the ship. We&#x27;ll definitely buy more often for colognes online because you just simply cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff. Great sophisticated fragrance that lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne last summer and loved it.  I ran out and delayed buying it again due to the price.  I found this on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is awesome!</li>
            <li> As I indicated above I suspect a counterfeit product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is sensual!  It is not overpowering, it brings out the best in me when my friend wears it!  Ladies, if you are feeling vulnerable, don&#x27;t be around a man who is wearing this because you will give in to temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an AWESOME cologne!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Givenchy!</li>
            <li> I been an Amazon buyer for some years already and I never had experienced what I did with this product. I own 10 colognes at the moment and all have been bought through the Internet. This was my first time buying a cologne from Amazon and I was so disappointed. This cologne IS NOT LEGIT. the smell does not last an hour. Don&#x27;t buy this product. IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE REMEMBER NO RETURNS ARE ALLOWED.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t want to sound too much like a tool but females really do enjoy this smell. one sprits does the trick.</li>
            <li> Cologne can be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;Really heavy scents tend to smell stale by the end of the day and can easily become unpleasantly overpowering.  However, really soft scents require heavy and/or frequent dosing.  Givenchy Gentlemen Only strikes a really nice balance.  On a scale of 1-10 where 1 requires a third of a bottle to notice and 10 burns your nostrils and eyes, I&#x27;d give it a 5.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, stale cologne smell towards the late afternoon/evening.  But, you&#x27;ll likely want to spray on some more towards the end of the afternoon if you want the smell great into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell appeal is subjective.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the heavy musks.  But, certain smells (i.e.: Eternity for Men) are nauseatingly sweet to me.  I favor smells that are somewhat crisp and spicy for men&#x27;s cologne.  Givenchy Gentlemen Only offers an excellent blend of those qualities.  I like Hugo Boss for it&#x27;s similar characteristics, but prefer Givenchy Gentlemen Only for it&#x27;s more subtle approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.  And, I do get a lot of compliments.  So, I say, &amp;#34;Givenchy it a try!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> NIETHER EROS OR GENTLEMAN WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN A FANCY BOTTLE WITH SOME CHEAP ALCOHOL LACED IN IT.....BAD NOT GOOD.....DAVE CLINE</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes  it. He says it has a manly smell.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells soooo good. My husband loves it! The price was excellent also. I would def buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife swears that Givench is one for the Tops, an exclusive aroma of higher caliber.  Me, I find it lovely, yes but it does not last or even really linger.  It could possibly be my own chemical makeup but I put it on and minutes later I&#x27;m wondering if I smell as good as I paid for.  Please understand I&#x27;m not one who bathes in cologne, but I am fond of a smell that lasts, subtle, yet present.  I don&#x27;t find this cologne to that...Subtle, yes it is, but present, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last - for me, that is.  Should you be interested and you have some time at a mall.  Spray it on your arm, then walk around a bit...if it&#x27;s still there, trust me, I love the fragrance, but if it&#x27;s not their, then you&#x27;ll get what I mean.  Happy shopping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad because he owns no cologne.  Good, fresh office scent perfect for daytime wear.  It&#x27;s sophisticated and I would recommend it to a high school could.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean and has none of the strong must and leather present in the original Gentlemen.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my dad thinks.</li>
            <li> the ladies love smelling this on me and i even love smelling it on me!  its a winner.  my favorite scent of all time and it gets the response im going for.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is SO picky about his cologne, but when he took a sniff of this from the magazine ad he HAD to have it.  So bad in fact, that he literally made me order it right away.  He was disappointed to receive it and have it smell nothing like the sample he so loved.  I thought it smelt good still, but definitely not the same as what we had hoped.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful cologne! Smelled it on one of the testers, asked my husband if he liked it (which he did). SO purchased this big bottle on Amazon (fraction of the price at Ulta) for Father&#x27;s Day. He LOVED it! and I love smelling it on him. So fresh and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!  Price was 50% less than department stores!</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality bottle of a GREAT fragrance. My girlfriend loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I like it and the wife can&#x27;t get enough of it. What else needs to be said?</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and way cheaper than a dept store. Love! Will order it again.</li>
            <li> I intended to order Givency Gentleman and did not realize this was Gentlleman &amp;#34;Only&amp;#34; and I can not return it?&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated.</li>
            <li> This was my first Givenchy experience. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and was quite impressed over the smell. And my wife loves it too. Just hope they are carrying Gentlemen Only Deodorant by now as well.</li>
            <li> Review of seller, not product.  Product smells great, but it does not last more than half an hour.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s an original product. My wife has seen the same product in Macy&#x27;s but she said that there are some differences in bottle labels.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve received many compliments. I seldom wear cologne but this has been the best. It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Est&amp;aacute;n una chimba!</li>
            <li> An extremely good smelling cologne. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a very light-smelling cologne, which is fine for some men.  Not &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; enough for my hubby, and expensive.</li>
            <li> Perfect product! Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Setting the record straight, yes, you are actually getting a nearly $90 bottle of cologne for half price. Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments every time I wear it. It&#x27;s not heavy, which is good. I hate when someone walks past me and I can smell them. I&#x27;ve noticed that it has a fade life of like 4 hours before I feel a need to reapply. Little shorter than I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s only a small caveat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I use it when I&#x27;m working in the yard. It&#x27;s horribly cheap looking like its made at a flee market.</li>
            <li> Faint scent, wears off quickly.  Good for work.  Ladies did not get aroused</li>
            <li> great scent and great delivery</li>
            <li> A slightly sweet citrusy smelling perfume (not cologne thats cheap stuff). I used to buy this at Macy&#x27;s and realized i can save roughly 30 dollars a bottle buying it on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to Macy&#x27;s and test it out first</li>
            <li> I love this smooth and fresh but masculine sent. Everytime my husband wears it, it reminds me of a fresh shower and a tuxedo.</li>
            <li> everything went perfect :) thanks</li>
            <li> The package and bottle shows to original from MFG. Once you use the product the smell does not last for more than a couple of minutes. I purchase this same product from Macy&#x27;s and the lasting effect is much higher.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne at nearly half off the department store price! Smells absolutely amazing. I first smelled it when a co-worker of mine walked by and I loved the smell and asked him what it was? He pulled a bottle of &amp;#34;Gentlemen Only&amp;#34; from his bag and let me try a couple of sprays. I got complimented on the smell later that day from a different co-worker. I love this smell and will always have a bottle. Whenever I am out and see a friend and they hug me they always say &amp;#34;ooh, you smell so good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is on the sweeter side but is still very manly for a sweet smell. I absolutely cannot stand a &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smell. I really don&#x27;t even like the &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34; smells. I am very particular on the kinds of scents I wear and Givenchy is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good experience, great items as described.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Appreciate fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great scent!!! Saved $$ by ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad. Actually I didn&#x27;t open it. But the packaging was good. No damage. No unbroken seals. The perfume was original.  Will update when I hear from Dad how he liked it.</li>
            <li> When I first got the cologne I loved it but after some usage I started to notice that the smell was not lasting as long as other colognes that I had in the past. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong the cologne smell is magnificent but you will have to respray every hour and a half to two hours and a half.</li>
            <li> Great scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells pretty good.  I noticed it when I did a bit of shopping in Dillard’s; however I did not buy it there b/c it was not offered in a gift set.  I saved over $30 purchasing it online and it&#x27;s the same spray!  It even arrived quicker than described.  Overall, it was a good buy and I will continue to purchase more online.</li>
            <li> Great prices! Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> Great Value &amp; Optimum Supply Time</li>
            <li> Long lasting and good projection. Has the feel of elegance in a bottle. Light and refreshing with strong masculine tones.</li>
            <li> Nice. Fresh. Not over-powering. Average longevity.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after reading the reviews and smelling the fragrance in a department store. This was half the price and well worth it. He loved it!</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple months ago.  Very happy with my purchase.  It has a lightness to it that doesn&#x27;t sit too heavily in the air.  It&#x27;s not musky or leathery.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering (some might find it weaker than they prefer) and I like to apply it to my sternum beneath my clothing so I&#x27;m not screaming cologne at everyone around me, and it makes a nice surprise for the ladies who reach closer proximity.  It dissipates perhaps more rapidly than some others, although I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning only to have a lady friend when  hugging me  goodnight remark with delight how good I smell.  A nice impression to leave with.  And the other morning in my neighborhood coffee shop the owner stopped after walking past the group of people in line and she demanded to know who smelled like &amp;#34;clean laundry and manliness&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine sample, It wasn&#x27;t over powering and a single spray lasts me for a while.</li>
            <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a big bust. I splurged on a blind-buy bottle based on reviews, but obviously I didn&#x27;t get the gist of what this really smells like from any of the reviews - therein lies the danger of believing the pyramid or the reviews you find online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a massive, mountainous, amorphous cloying scent, a bottle of Log Cabin maple syrup with a vaporizer. It dries down into something that is only overpoweringly cloying, but the topnote is a blast of sugar-coated, encrusted sugar cubes. It is ATROCIOUSLY bad. By &amp;#34;gentlemen&amp;#34; they must mean teenage boys, which may be clever marketing, but all the worse for those of us who need to smell, minimally, like a grown-up, if not actually NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t discourage this one enough. Do not buy it. This is a dreadfully sweet and uncomplicated potion. Log Cabin, or any generic fully artificially-flavored high-fructose corn syrup based syrup is much, much cheaper and, stirred with a little warm water and poured in a vaporizer bottle, will have the same net effect on those around you. Sickeningly sweet and something you should generally wish to wash off as quickly as possible. I&#x27;d be interested to know who on earth rates this well - as compared to what? What is your station in life; what is your experience with fragrances; where on earth is something like this appropriate? I could not wear this to work. I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well. I would have to issue apologies to anyone stuck in an elevator or in line at the grocery store with me. What a hot mess. Big time 0/10 rating.on earth is something like this appropriate? I could not wear this to work. I would not subject my wife to this, since I like her pretty well.

            <li> Just bought this for my husband for his birthday. Masculine and sexy. Love it! It reminds me a bit of Versace Dreamer.</li>
            <li> I think it smells great, people around me think it smells great. One spray on the wrist and under the chin lasts me most of the day.</li>
            <li> Wasnt attractive smelling to me. It just doesnt seem to be in good taste. But this is coming from a guy who loved the old hollister scent.</li>
            <li> It was a quick shipment. I liked that!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lasts all day, definitely a repeat customer here</li>
            <li> Good perfume...I wanted one that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> the novelty of this Esense last only one day then it begins to smell like skunk</li>
            <li> I meant to order the &amp;#34;Intense&amp;#34; version of this product.  Did you know you cannot return perfume and cologne? Neither did I since they don&#x27;t mention that fact anywhere in the description (something about federal law prohibiting the mailing of flammables...well how did I get it in the mail in the first place?).  This scent is too sweet and flowery for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> In terms of high fashion, I have always loved anything by Givenchy. The same goes for this cologne. It smells amazing! It&#x27;s not so overpowering. I spray a mist 3 times and walk through it. I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times by both sexes on this. A definite must buy.</li>
            <li> This is the second time in one year I bought this scent because I used it so much! Sexy and intoxicating, makes anyone follow you around it smells so good! Amazon had it more then half off the store value and got it here 3 days earlier then expected! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, my father could not be happier with this perfume. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I will buy this perfume again smells very good to me, my 7 years old son loves it too!</li>
            <li> it seems to be cheap!</li>
            <li> Really great smelling product. My husband typically wears Lacoste which is musty and strong; similar to this product.  The scent is very strong and woody however the smell disappears after about a half hour.  He can spritz about 5 sprays compared to 3 and it lasts about half as long.  I would rate the smell an A+ but wouldn&#x27;t advise for day to day wear... just a dinner evening out.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Long lasting  Love it.</li>
            <li> I took a chance after getting slammed with so many online ads - just not my style or smell. But, it can&#x27;t be returned - so lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Incredible, modern gentlemen smell that my girlfriend loved immediately as I put it on. Not a musky scent at all.</li>
            <li> Found out about it through a Dillard&#x27;s sample and loved it ever since. It has that unique edge to it</li>
            <li> Bought the cologne as a gift but recipient said it seemed fake, scent did not last.</li>
            <li> Original. Smells great</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! I get compliments on it all the time and have been stopped by many strangers asking what it is and where to find it.</li>
            <li> Very bad don&#x27;t smell like the real perfume and only last a minutes bad choice a fake no doubt</li>
            <li> As a 27 year old male, I&#x27;ve really taken a liking to this scent. I bought it scent unsmelled, mainly due to high praise and review score from various Internet sources. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. In my current rotation of four colognes, this one is tops. It&#x27;s scent is beautifully woodsy and strong  (not overpowering). I was worried about the description of patchouli as I hate that stench, however it is either so minimal that I can&#x27;t detect it, or every other part of its scent profile is just that good.</li>
            <li> So I purchased it because of an ad I saw on Details magazine; I instantly felt in love with the scent. I am not a big fan of barely launched smells; I&#x27;ve always tried to stick to the same good ol&#x27; ones like Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, Terre d&#x27;h&amp;egrave;rmes, or Mill&amp;egrave;sime Imperial by Creed... I am glad I took a step ahead and decide to buy this cologne which became an instant favorite to me. CONGRATULATIONS TO MYSELF! Now I smell even better; or so do I think...</li>
