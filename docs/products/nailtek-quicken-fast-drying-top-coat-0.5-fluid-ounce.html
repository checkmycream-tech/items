            <li>It covers great, dries super-fast, and looks good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent top coat.</li>
            <li>This makes a great top coat!  </li>
            <li>Good price, shipping was on time.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good price on it on-line.</li>
            <li>Anyway this was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Best Top Coat for natural nails!!</li>
            <li>Quicken is by far the best speed-dry product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This clear top coat is the best one I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Provides a durable, super-shiney top coat and dries nails within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>A top coat a day keeps the chipping away for 7-10 days</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t peel like most will buy again from this seller...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>so maybe it is easy to find at those.</li>
            <li>My very naturally, strong nails broke where the polish peeled.  </li>
            <li>The Nailtek Xtra works great on peeling nails followed by two coats of OPI nail polish and this Nailtek top coat to dry it all in just seconds.</li>
            <li>Quicken not only seals the polish it provides a great shine to the nails.  </li>
            <li>But with quicken, my nail polish has actually last for a good week, it doesn&#x27;t matter the brand.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve used Seche vite before I ever tried this particular product out, I was so used to their Intensive treatment, but I decided to try out their quicken formula just to see how it works</li>
            <li>This product dries so quickly and prevents smudges.</li>
            <li>I had been using OPI Rapid Dry top coat, but this product is so much better.</li>
            <li>, must I say, I will stop using Seche vite and stick to this one, seche vite is actually a pretty good product for fast drying, especially as a on the go,  but my nail polish would always chip.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put in on right after you finish color coat.</li>
            <li>I always do my nails right before I fall asleep...</li>
            <li>It take hours to dry and did absolutely nothing good for me.</li>
            <li>The positive reviewers were right and it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>so impressed because dry in less than one minute.</li>
            <li>They never last for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>purchased from amazon,great price and fast service!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>But I use really good brand nail polish and they chipped quickly with seche vite, but with this one, i swear by this product, it don&#x27;t dry as fast as seche vite but your nail polish last longer</li>
            <li>There is seriously nothing better than Quicken as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Makes my salon mani last a full week!  </li>
            <li>But yet it removes easily with regular nail polish  remover.</li>
            <li>I bought a lot of top coats and they don&#x27;t dry so faster like this one,</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t smart</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product!</li>
            <li>It works well with a lot of brands of colored polish and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Drys fast polish stays longer</li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>wait a few min until they get tacky, it works much better.</li>
            <li>and I needed something that would dry quickly.</li>
            <li>i always put 2 coats of color and a clear coat</li>
            <li>doesnt dry my nails as fast as other quick dry products.</li>
            <li>it mixed with your already aplied nail polish in such a degree that the colour comes off and the whole thing just ends upp a mess.</li>

            <li> i usually do them when i&#x27;m getting ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> and although this isn&#x27;t quite as shiny as the seche, this doesn&#x27;t make my polish shrink and makes my manicure last just as long if not longer.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier  than expected.</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t sit still for long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like topcoats that take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> my nails are dry in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> And it takes about 13 minutes to fully dry.</li>
            <li> so it always takes hours for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a hair dryer, the fan, ice water, and it still takes hours for them to be FULLY dry.</li>
            <li> I use a base coat, then 2 layers of polish and apply this to the top and</li>
            <li> Cuts drying time in half and no &amp;#34;dings&amp;#34; to worry about.  </li>
            <li> this product cuts the time in half!</li>
            <li> at least I see results from the other products under this brand</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations, but this is not good at all.. :(</li>
            <li> It is a thin texture and you only need a very SMALL amount on the brush per nail.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 5 years, and I have been using nail polish since 1978.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to find in salons and supply houses-</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the brush gets dirty.</li>
            <li> Polish usually lasts up to two weeks!</li>

            <li> Pros: Dries Quickly&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Polish peels off faster.  My very naturally, strong nails broke where the polish peeled.  All the nails broke, which never happens.  Used twice and it happened both times.  Would not recommend product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier  than expected. Products was great will reorder</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve used Seche vite before I ever tried this particular product out, I was so used to their Intensive treatment, but I decided to try out their quicken formula just to see how it works, must I say, I will stop using Seche vite and stick to this one, seche vite is actually a pretty good product for fast drying, especially as a on the go,  but my nail polish would always chip. They never last for more than 2 days. But with quicken, my nail polish has actually last for a good week, it doesn&#x27;t matter the brand. But I use really good brand nail polish and they chipped quickly with seche vite, but with this one, i swear by this product, it don&#x27;t dry as fast as seche vite but your nail polish last longer</li>
            <li> There is seriously nothing better than Quicken as a top coat.  Dries almost instantly so I can move on with my day!! The best top coat on the market.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have alot of time to do nails. i usually do them when i&#x27;m getting ready to go to sleep. 5 minutes after applying&lt;br /&gt;quicken i  can put my hands under the blankets,go to sleep and wake up with great looking nails! i highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product! purchased from amazon,great price and fast service!</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations, but this is not good at all.. :( it mixed with your already aplied nail polish in such a degree that the colour comes off and the whole thing just ends upp a mess. It take hours to dry and did absolutely nothing good for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. Will be back. Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Just about need a crow bar to chip my nail Polish after coats of Nail Tek Quicken. But yet it removes easily with regular nail polish  remover. I love this stuff!! It works well with a lot of brands of colored polish and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Makes my salon mani last a full week!  I&#x27;ve used seche vite and although this isn&#x27;t quite as shiny as the seche, this doesn&#x27;t make my polish shrink and makes my manicure last just as long if not longer.  Therefore, this is a winner in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat for natural nails!! Drys fast polish stays longer</li>
            <li> It dries fast. I don&#x27;t like topcoats that take forever to dry. I am always on the go, so this works for me.</li>
            <li> This makes a great top coat!  I use a base coat, then 2 layers of polish and apply this to the top and my nails are dry in a matter of minutes.  Quicken not only seals the polish it provides a great shine to the nails.  Polish usually lasts up to two weeks!</li>
            <li> I had been using OPI Rapid Dry top coat, but this product is so much better. The Nailtek Xtra works great on peeling nails followed by two coats of OPI nail polish and this Nailtek top coat to dry it all in just seconds. The positive reviewers were right and it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to.  Good price, shipping was on time.  Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Really works.  Cuts drying time in half and no &amp;#34;dings&amp;#34; to worry about.  Dries polish deep.  Nailtek products are a necessity since I stopped silk wraps.</li>
            <li> doesnt dry my nails as fast as other quick dry products. so wont buy again at least I see results from the other products under this brand</li>
            <li> This clear top coat is the best one I have ever found. I have been using it for the past 5 years, and I have been using nail polish since 1978.  It covers great, dries super-fast, and looks good.  I am always looking for a good price on it on-line. It is hard to find in stores - Ulta is often out - but I don&#x27;t go to beauty specialty shops so maybe it is easy to find at those. Anyway this was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a mailing envelop and I thought it might be smashed, but it wasn&#x27;t. I will buy another because my daughter may steal this one, lol.</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of top coats and they don&#x27;t dry so faster like this one, im so impressed because dry in less than one minute. I love it</li>
            <li> It will literally lighten your nailpolish by 3-4 shades. Not only that, but the brush gets dirty. And it takes about 13 minutes to fully dry. Never buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> Quicken is by far the best speed-dry product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Provides a durable, super-shiney top coat and dries nails within 5 minutes.  Hard to find in salons and supply houses-Thanks AMAZON.com!!!</li>
            <li> A top coat a day keeps the chipping away for 7-10 days</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Retail stores are not carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff!!! Doesn&#x27;t peel like most will buy again from this seller...</li>
            <li> This product was different from the one I purchased in the store.  The box is definitely different from the one I purchased in the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat. Always re-ordering it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put in on right after you finish color coat. wait a few min until they get tacky, it works much better. i always put 2 coats of color and a clear coat so it always takes hours for my nails to dry. i&#x27;ve tried a hair dryer, the fan, ice water, and it still takes hours for them to be FULLY dry. this product cuts the time in half! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought two bottles because I saw great reviews and I needed something that would dry quickly. I always do my nails right before I fall asleep... I know this isn&#x27;t smart but it&#x27;s when I have the time. I used to wake up with blanket marks and smudges. NOT ANYMORE! This product dries so quickly and prevents smudges. It is a thin texture and you only need a very SMALL amount on the brush per nail. I use this on my boyfriends daughters nails, she is two so she doesn&#x27;t sit still for long. When I use this product on her nails it helps a ton! I would recommend this product!</li>
