            <li>Very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The best under eye product EVER.</li>
            <li>Not the best concealer.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price!</li>
            <li>I got the fair colored one and it matches my face perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I had lots of people ask what I was doing because I looked great.</li>
            <li>and this concealer does a great job.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product; exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and I think this is the best one so far</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many under eye concealers and they&#x27;ve all ended up in the creases, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>For the price the product is okay.  </li>
            <li>Works well and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and it turns out to be better than Benefit&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Works ok for blemishes but does nothing for undereye circles</li>
            <li>Blends very well, provides great coverage, holds all day and does not gather in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage and totally worth it</li>
            <li>I use a brush to apply as I&#x27;ve found it gives a much more light touch than finger application.</li>
            <li>Its great except it caused my skin to break out in the sensitive under eye area.  </li>
            <li>Nyx is easy to smooth out around the eye</li>
            <li>Over it all for the price it is fine to use.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product.</li>
            <li>Be careful when ordering to make sure you are told what color it is as I had a bit of a problem finding the fair color.  </li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>The concealer is awesome but the reason for only 4 stars is because it&#x27;s so tiny.</li>
            <li>Amazing how much better you look with the dark circles covered up!</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m liking the garnier tinted anti-dark-circle roller in light/medium.</li>
            <li>Only trick is to apply it with your fingertip, but rub it on the product for about ten seconds just to warm it up and apply it easily.</li>
            <li>Covers pretty well.</li>
            <li>/capillaries pretty well.  </li>
            <li>but I use under eye moisturizer, suncreen,&amp; vitamin C gel first).</li>
            <li>covers pretty well...</li>
            <li>I find NYX is pretty hit or miss, and this product is 100% a miss.</li>
            <li>The price on this can&#x27;t be beat, and it&#x27;s just as good, if not, better.</li>
            <li>Easy application and such but</li>
            <li>I got this based on comments I&#x27;d seen related to how this concealer doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  </li>
            <li>this covers very well</li>
            <li>The concealer melts into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin (not dry or oily), but this concealer was super greasy and creased within minutes.</li>
            <li>very smooth and takes our the dark circles with out looking cakey</li>
            <li>When Nyx is applied, it goes on lightly where other products seem to deposit large quantities of stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a high end product from the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>had high hopes for this stuff, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It does cover up my dark circles but does seep into my fine lines that I have.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the fair, which is actually quite dark and too peachy pink for me.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use too much, it indeed doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines under my eyes (I learned this the hard way).  </li>
            <li>Completely unfeelable on skin</li>
            <li>I used to use Nars, which was great (and should be, for $22 a tube, grrrr).</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to dab (with the brush) several times to get enough on the brush as this concealer is not greasy or soft.</li>
            <li>I had been using the IT cosmetics bye bye undereye, but I found that to be too thick for daily, spring/summer, light makeup days.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if your skin isn&#x27;t really dry (mine is a bit dry,</li>

            <li> Covers pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t last all day though.</li>
            <li> works like a charm on dark circles</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product. It definitely helps to cover up my dark circles and brightens the area under my eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s too dry for my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I used to use Nars, which was great (and should be, for $22 a tube, grrrr). The price on this can&#x27;t be beat, and it&#x27;s just as good, if not, better.

            <li> this covers very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different kinds of under eye/dark circle concealer and I think this is the best one so far (I&#x27;ve tried an oil of olay concealer, in a tube with a sponge at the end - sorry, I don&#x27;t know names. Also, TonyMoly Eye Whitening Cream and I think another). When Nyx is applied, it goes on lightly where other products seem to deposit large quantities of stuff on my face. Nyx is easy to smooth out around the eye and then my eyes appear brighter without having that look where you know I&#x27;ve got something going on under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this based on comments I&#x27;d seen related to how this concealer doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  It is a dryer concealer with a matte appearance.  I use it sparingly under my eyes and it covers darks circles or tiny veins/capillaries pretty well.  If I don&#x27;t use too much, it indeed doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines under my eyes (I learned this the hard way).  I&#x27;ve tried many many under eye concealers and they&#x27;ve all ended up in the creases, but not this one.  I got the fair colored one and it matches my face perfectly.  Be careful when ordering to make sure you are told what color it is as I had a bit of a problem finding the fair color.  I think this little pot will last a very long time as it looks like I&#x27;ve hardly used it and I put it anywhere on my face that needs it such as covering brown spots or on the sides of my nose.  I use a brush to apply as I&#x27;ve found it gives a much more light touch than finger application. Sometimes I have to dab (with the brush) several times to get enough on the brush as this concealer is not greasy or soft. Highly recommend if your skin isn&#x27;t really dry (mine is a bit dry, but I use under eye moisturizer, suncreen,&amp; vitamin C gel first).</li>
            <li> covers pretty well...nothing special</li>
            <li> For the price the product is okay.  I didn&#x27;t expect a high end product from the price I paid.  It does cover up my dark circles but does seep into my fine lines that I have.  Over it all for the price it is fine to use.  Wore off after about 4 hours in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li> Great product; exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Works well and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very thin, creases instantly before you can set it, and too peachy pink for my undereye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this stuff, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.

            <li> Love this product. When I started wearing it I had lots of people ask what I was doing because I looked great. Amazing how much better you look with the dark circles covered up!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking it would be similar to Benefit&#x27;s \\&quot;Boiiing\\&quot; concealer - and it turns out to be better than Benefit&#x27;s product. Blends very well, provides great coverage, holds all day and does not gather in fine lines. Completely unfeelable on skin (is that a word?!)&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that there was an even lighter shade for a little bit of \\&quot;pop\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> Its great except it caused my skin to break out in the sensitive under eye area.  Easy application and such but my skin is hypersensitive.</li>
            <li> Alright for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> The best under eye product EVER. very smooth and takes our the dark circles with out looking cakey</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin (not dry or oily), but this concealer was super greasy and creased within minutes. It doesn&#x27;t last any longer than maybe an hour. The coverage is extremely weak as well. I find NYX is pretty hit or miss, and this product is 100% a miss.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and this concealer does a great job.  The concealer melts into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage and totally worth it</li>
            <li> Not the best concealer. Works ok for blemishes but does nothing for undereye circles</li>
