            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any means, but it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say how well it works on its own, but it seemed to me to be the powerhouse of the pair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the cleaning power of the shampoo and conditioner, I think that it does a really nice job.</li>

            <li>Now it is just finding my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Again I love this product and I use with the shampoo.  </li>

            <li>I felt more like</li>
            <li>The ingredients are intended to promote naturally healthy hair and many of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li>But I understand that many folks do not.</li>
            <li>over all I enjoyed using this product and will continue to purchase with a separate detangler.</li>
            <li>Desert Essence brand and aubrey organics much better.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique smell, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure that I liked it.</li>
            <li>Regardless though, I like the way I feel after using high quality bath products with great scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very important in a world filled with so many synthetic products.</li>
            <li>Fragrance a bit strong for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I also love the Sweet Orange Clarifying shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does help smooth and strengthen the hair with out adding silicones or chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with.</li>
            <li>It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with.</li>
            <li>As a green product, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>I was using sulfate free shampoos and conditioners for a while.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky, smooth, tangle free.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always used sulfate free products, but since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioner my hair has become greasy and clumpy like it has tons of gel in it.  </li>
            <li>And i like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I noticed EO had some sulfate-free shampoos with some really unique scents, so I decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>I was doing no-poo for a while to help when the excess secretion of hair oils, then decided I couldn&#x27;t just go without shampooing because it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase the cheapest soaps and hair products that were on sale at the grocery store; but recently decided that I wanted to start using products that made me feel good.</li>
            <li>but so far I am loving the results.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>she is really into natural and good products.</li>
            <li>I love the light fragrance, and it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>well, my hair is shiny and soft, very easy to take care of now.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great after using it- shiny and tangle-free but not weighed down.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent; great conditioner, especially in winter with the air so dry!</li>
            <li>IT makes hair soft and shiny and has great ingredients such as hemp seed oil in it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use mousse with it (although slightly more frizzy and natural looking than moussed hair).</li>
            <li>I have used several other more natural hair products that were good and smelled nice.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the way it filled the bathroom, and made me feel like I was somewhere other than my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those sensitive to strong scents, this is not the conditioner for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the shampoo, I immediately opened it to smell it.</li>
            <li>The scent is very herbal and kind of minty~ not much coconut, not too floral.</li>
            <li>It also did not leave my hair feeling clean or soft.  </li>
            <li>The product leaves my hair feeling soft with a truly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling a lot softer (I have thick asian hair), smells great and is a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>Recently I have begun to believe that high-quality bathing products make a huge difference in my life.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair coarse -- shouldn&#x27;t happen as a sulfate free conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li>Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li>have been using this for about 2 months now and really liking it.</li>
            <li>It smelled absolutely nothing like lavender, for one thing.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well to detangle and moisturize.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>So nourishing to my hair and gentle to the color.</li>
            <li>I have long curly, color treated but fine hair.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and my scalp thanks me, as other conditioners can make my head itch!</li>
            <li>Although I liked it, I do not love it.ove the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Although I liked it, I do not love it.</li>
            <li>This kind of smell usually have products for washing animals fur.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its been 3 months since my treatment and now my hair are starting to return to their normal state, so I dont think the condition as such \\&quot;adds keratin\\&quot; to the hair, but it is a good enough conditioner as is.</li>
            <li>Consequently, it gets decent scores from</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a few comments regarding the smell, and all I can say is the conditioner smells pretty nice, whereas the shampoo smells very medicinal, but as long as you use the conditioner afterwards, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be a good enough conditioner that leaves my keratin-treated hair soft and with definitely less</li>
            <li>I usually have very easy to care for hair</li>
            <li>A happy union between green and conventional.  </li>
            <li>This EO stuff does a poor jub conditioning does not do anything to benefit my hair and does not smell good at all.  </li>
            <li>Light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily, and thus, so is my scalp.  </li>
            <li>All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This made my already coarse hair much coarser.</li>
            <li>I use the sulfate free shampoo a few times a week</li>
            <li>Even the bottle itself is made of natural material.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the buildup in my hair is completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably should have been tipped off by the incorrect product description posted by the manufacturer, but I highly recommend you avoid this product if at all possible.</li>
            <li>I previously mentioned, I am starting to believe that scents and aromatherapy could be really important for me.</li>
            <li>use Amazon Subscribe and Save for a lot of my basic necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, plastic wrap, etc.), and noticed that they had a wide variety of EO products available for subscription.</li>
            <li>but it seems mostly natural, at least better than the other junk that&#x27;s out there.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> was busted when I got it. NO response from seller!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. I have long curly, color treated but fine hair. I wanted to try a shampoo and conditioner with Keratin, but i did not want to pay $70 for it. It does help smooth and strengthen the hair with out adding silicones or chemicals. I would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any means, but it is a nice product. The scent is very herbal and kind of minty~ not much coconut, not too floral.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner to help me with a problem I had been having with my hair.  It was gummy and sticky and the only cure seemed to be Dawn dishsoap.  I read a review on a hair care website suggesting keratin treatments for my issue, but I didn&#x27;t have the money at the time.  I have now used the entire bottle and can say without a doubt that I am CURED!  I have noticed a few comments regarding the smell, and all I can say is the conditioner smells pretty nice, whereas the shampoo smells very medicinal, but as long as you use the conditioner afterwards, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you.  I would recommend this product to ANYONE, as it will make any hair better and more manageable.  I have to admit I used the shampoo in conjunction, so I couldn&#x27;t say how well it works on its own, but it seemed to me to be the powerhouse of the pair.  To anyone with damaged hair: this is it.  This is the cure-all they say doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not too heavy.  I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent; great conditioner, especially in winter with the air so dry! Calms &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34;/frizzy hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Conditions well.  Fragrance a bit strong for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair coarse -- shouldn&#x27;t happen as a sulfate free conditioner. Not worth it at all</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice (it smells like a combination of coconut, hibiscus and lavender) and it makes my hair feel great! Love the ingredients, love this brand! I added this on subscribe and save, in addition to EO&#x27;s Lemon Coconut body lotion I have been using for the past year!</li>
            <li> Not as creamy/moisturizing as I would like. Does an OK job.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but some of the conditioner had gotten out of the container and sticky - not sanitary.</li>
            <li> Recently I have begun to believe that high-quality bathing products make a huge difference in my life. For me, bathing and showering is an extremely relaxing experience that helps me wind-down after a long day, regardless of whether that day was good or bad. I used to purchase the cheapest soaps and hair products that were on sale at the grocery store; but recently decided that I wanted to start using products that made me feel good. I noticed EO had some sulfate-free shampoos with some really unique scents, so I decided to give them a shot. So far, I have not been disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon Subscribe and Save for a lot of my basic necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, plastic wrap, etc.), and noticed that they had a wide variety of EO products available for subscription. I chose the Hibiscus and Coconut &#x27;flavor&#x27; because it was the only one that came in a single-pack. Everything else came in a pack of 3, and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a ton of them if I did not like the brand. When I first received the shampoo, I immediately opened it to smell it. It has a unique smell, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure that I liked it. After washing my hair with it though, I noticed that it has a real nice calming scent to it. I really liked the way it filled the bathroom, and made me feel like I was somewhere other than my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I previously mentioned, I am starting to believe that scents and aromatherapy could be really important for me. There is a lot of research and people who swear by the medicinal impact of aromatherapy; but I do not know if I fully believe it. Regardless though, I like the way I feel after using high quality bath products with great scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the cleaning power of the shampoo and conditioner, I think that it does a really nice job. My skin is naturally oily, and thus, so is my scalp.  I am finding that my scalp is not as oily, and my hair looks and feels a lot cleaner than it ever did with Suave or Pantene. I really love the way my hair feels. It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with. All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this product, but I will also be purchasing it in its other scents. Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack. Now it is just finding my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.

            <li> This Conditioner causes my hair to tangle instead of detangling. It also leaves a residue. I used it twice, and after tearing my hair to shreds trying to comb it after a shower, I&#x27;ve decided to chuck it and go with something else. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look clumpy and unclean. I wish I had detangler because this conditioner seems to make things worse! I&#x27;ve accidentally ripped out hair due to frustration of brushing after my shower. Please avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I used this product as a detangler for my daughters hair, mixed it with some water. love the smell and works beautifully. considering purchasing EO products for myself.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is sulfate-free, but I dislike the way it makes my hair feel when I rinse it out. I was doing no-poo for a while to help when the excess secretion of hair oils, then decided I couldn&#x27;t just go without shampooing because it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean. This made my already coarse hair much coarser.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner to use when I want protein in my hair.  IT makes hair soft and shiny and has great ingredients such as hemp seed oil in it.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I just got it and only used once but so far I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> Again I love this product and I use with the shampoo.  I makes my hair look great and shiny.  As I said I love this company&#x27;s products.  I think they deliver what they promise.  Thank you guys</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling a lot softer (I have thick asian hair), smells great and is a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine, curly hair. Not too heavy, but conditions well.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner feels and the way my hair feels afterward.  As a green product, I&#x27;m impressed.  A happy union between green and conventional.  (without all the junk!) Plus, it smells nice!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It makes the hair feel thicker, fuller, and smells great. I love that it has no harsh chemicals. It is my staple. Best price on Amazon rather in store.</li>
            <li> I was using sulfate free shampoos and conditioners for a while. This one is very smooth. Leaves hair silky, smooth, tangle free. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple if days to see if it gets dull and tangled but it stayed in a good shape. So I do recomend getting it. The only thing I really hate about it is the smell. This kind of smell usually have products for washing animals fur. It smells like herbs mixed up with hand cream. Yuck:( I was using keratin complex smoothing therapy brand before and I like it much better. The thing is my hair got used to it and started to become dull and tangly. I had to switch and I will have to use this one for a while until I could go back to keratin comlex one. If you don&#x27;t care for a smell it is a good conditioner. It does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have used by far! It makes my hair so smooth and I noticed that when I use it with the shampoo, my hair is so much less frizzy- I don&#x27;t even have to use mousse with it (although slightly more frizzy and natural looking than moussed hair). The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me- it smells coconutty to me. I use the sulfate free shampoo a few times a week but I use one with sulfates once a week to give it a good, thorough wash but the conditioner is a must for every day. Try this product- i have tried them all (almost literally) and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It has more ingredients than I would like but it seems mostly natural, at least better than the other junk that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> I recently got keratin treatment for my hair and was told to use a conditioner which had keratin added to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 2 months now and really liking it. It has a pleasant smell that I really enjoy, have seen alot of reviews by people complaining about the smell, but I like it so to each his own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a good enough conditioner that leaves my keratin-treated hair soft and with definitely less tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 3 months since my treatment and now my hair are starting to return to their normal state, so I dont think the condition as such \\&quot;adds keratin\\&quot; to the hair, but it is a good enough conditioner as is.</li>
            <li> Works well, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in my hair.  It smells lovely and my scalp thanks me, as other conditioners can make my head itch! I like that the packaging and production of this product is environmentally safe.</li>
            <li> I was deeply disappointed by this product.  I really wanted to love it.  It smelled absolutely nothing like lavender, for one thing.  It also did not leave my hair feeling clean or soft.  I felt more like I washed it with unfiltered sea water.  Organix sulfate-free products are SO much better than this!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because of the nice aroma to this conditioner and the gentleness on my hair. Even the bottle itself is made of natural material. Very important in a world filled with so many synthetic products. I would recommend this product to my daughter for she is really into natural and good products. She was impressed by the container even being a natural product.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different hair, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have long, wavy hair that is both fine and thin. I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like that EO products uses natural ingredients rather than harsh chemicals. The ingredients are intended to promote naturally healthy hair and many of the ingredients are organic. Consequently, it gets decent scores from GoodGuide.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: I love the smell! But I understand that many folks do not. For those sensitive to strong scents, this is not the conditioner for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The consistency is thin but I prefer thick, creamy conditioners. While using this conditioner, I needed to use extra leave-in conditioner as my hair still felt dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I like the ingredients but not the consistency. This is not the conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> The product leaves my hair feeling soft with a truly clean feeling. My hair feels rejuvinated, like it did years ago. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. Makes my hair soft. I don&#x27;t like the bottle though; it&#x27;s kind of a boring design.</li>
            <li> I have the Coconut and Hibiscus shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner at a reasonable price.  I also love the Sweet Orange Clarifying shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well to detangle and moisturize. It also smells amazing in the shower but the scent washes out easily so you don&#x27;t smell like coconut after rinsing. My hair looks great after using it- shiny and tangle-free but not weighed down. I also love EO products because they give you all the ingredients in their products!</li>
            <li> Yummy smell. Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Moisturizes well, my hair is shiny and soft, very easy to take care of now.  Less tangles.  It&#x27;s been working out great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this (along with the shampoo) after seeing it so highly recommended on Amazon and I am stunned at how terrible it is. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the buildup in my hair is completely unmanageable.  I usually have very easy to care for hair and I&#x27;ve always used sulfate free products, but since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioner my hair has become greasy and clumpy like it has tons of gel in it.  The only styling product that I use is a heat protectant, so I have no idea where all the gunk is coming from.  Also, it smells nothing like coconut or hibiscus.  The product also leaked badly in transport, but that is always a possibility when ordering online. I probably should have been tipped off by the incorrect product description posted by the manufacturer, but I highly recommend you avoid this product if at all possible.</li>
            <li> only thing I would change if it as all possible is to make it so it will detangle my hair in the shower....over all I enjoyed using this product and will continue to purchase with a separate detangler.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the light fragrance, and it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I gave this produst a try because I read ingredients and I thought this sounded like a good product.  I read the negative reviews but tried anyway.  I have used several other more natural hair products that were good and smelled nice.  This EO stuff does a poor jub conditioning does not do anything to benefit my hair and does not smell good at all.  Dont bother buying it.  Desert Essence brand and aubrey organics much better.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free which is the best for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;hard to find a product like this.</li>
            <li> Love this product! So nourishing to my hair and gentle to the color. And i like that it&#x27;s sulfate free. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is purely amazing!  I love how it smells.  I have thick, curly hair and this works miracles at detangling it in the shower,  I never have to use a detangling comb or brush to get any knots out.  I definitely recommend.</li>
