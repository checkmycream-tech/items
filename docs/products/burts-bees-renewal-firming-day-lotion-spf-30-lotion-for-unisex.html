    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This lotion has been perfect.</li>
            <li>I have not had breakouts since using this product which is my greatest concern when I use anything with SPF.</li>
            <li>All excellent products that noticeably work without the designer price tag and without having to go to the dermatologists office to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is the best face cream ever!</li>
            <li>Out of all Burts, this is the best day time lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking to myself, maybe this works for my sister beautifully</li>
            <li>I do have to say, the smell is the one thing which I greatly dislike about this product.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Great packaging.</li>
            <li>SPF 30 means it blocks 97% of UVB rays which is great for every day use.</li>
            <li>Another problem I experienced was my face felt coated and was itchy in spots.</li>
            <li>Great every day lotion/ sunscreen without a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great thing is you can reapply lotion during day, if needed, without any build up of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved to have said I found a really nice, lightweight day lotion with SPF 30, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I prefer the smell of sunscreen to this.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily and smells good.</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>I can confidently say that I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>As many have said, this product is smelly (I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;, I find it to smell like a sunscreen cream).</li>
            <li>but my acne is much better.</li>
            <li>This facial lotion, is great!</li>
            <li>I assume, will get better, more i use it.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of white cast, but very happy to have found a sunscreen for my combination, acne-prone skin :) I have not been bothered by smell at all</li>
            <li>as most SPF lotions cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF 30</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Glad Amazon took my suggestion and started selling this line.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain :) will buy it again.</li>
            <li>The pump is a very nice feature, and that is the high point of this product!</li>
            <li>Great Product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels good on my skin, my makeup goes on over it easily and looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Is been a great product so far.</li>
            <li>Love it...soft and smooth</li>
            <li>: I removed one star from my original review because one of my favorite aspects of this lotion, the pump, gets defective once you&#x27;re about 2/3 of the way done with this llotion.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but this one is way too strong.</li>
            <li>I believe part of why it&#x27;s so strong smelling is to mask the smell of sunscreen</li>
            <li>so my face is always protected and it goes on really smooth and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>This definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li>SPF is extremely important to me in the spring and summer months</li>
            <li>LOVE love love this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This issue is easily resolved by washing my hands right after application.</li>
            <li>I have used the firming serum more than the SPF &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but since I used them together, I will blame this new line for turning my skin into smooth to zit-ty-looking.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel firmer, but I am in my mid 20s - not necessarily the best judge of a firming product.</li>
            <li>Higher SPFs like SPF 75 or 100 don&#x27;t offer significantly more protection so SPF 30 was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, our noses function so that we stop smelling it after a while</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell which at first is floral</li>
            <li>But the next day, (the reason I give this one star) I woke up to soooo many pimples!</li>
            <li>and it actually works much better as a night cream!</li>
            <li>Not crazy itchy and no hives</li>
            <li>The dewey, oily cream gets absorbed overnight, I suppose...</li>
            <li>would still highly recommend this to someone looking for a good daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>But it goes away quickly and it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it along with the firming serum for about 3 weeks and have seen the effects: claimed to rejuvenate the skin, it sure &amp;#34;does&amp;#34; if by that it is meant to return me to the teenage years of bumpy skin...</li>
            <li>This product is very smelly, and you can&#x27;t stop smelling it!</li>
            <li>Tried many facial products out there, including Obagi and Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>My needs are sensitive, light skin.</li>
            <li>I love the pump and only need 1 - 2 pumps per day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to add a shine to my skin, I still stay pretty matte throughout the day while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Burt&#x27;s Bees even compared to more expensive brands like Shiseido, Estee Lauder, and Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After stopping the regimen for 5 days, my skin is back to smooth....</li>
            <li>After about 30-45 mins it absorbed completely into my hand</li>
            <li>Filled with fluid.</li>
            <li>Filled with fluid.</li>
            <li>Too bad, I loved the idea of a safe, less-chemical sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As a quick reminder, you always want to put this on 10-15 minutes BEFORE you go outside</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried it on the back of my hand first and told my sister it wasn&#x27;t sinking in and felt very sticky.</li>
            <li>Once my skin absorbed it though, I was back to my normal color.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.</li>
            <li>bought this for the high SPF, but found it far too greasy to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I only smell it when I first put it on in the morning or whenever.</li>
            <li>It is my daily sunscreen and never fails.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be great for everyday application and usually under makeup.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free and free of the questionable sun protection chemicals, but just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin underneath the oil slick did look nice but probably because all my shallow indentations were now filled or primed as they say with this oily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sensitive to fragrance product</li>
            <li>Wanted Burts and something natural with spf over 8, and this is o.k.</li>
            <li>During the summer I&#x27;m always looking for as much protection from the sun for my face as I can get within my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Therefore I would never use this product again and would not recommend it to oily, combination, acne prone or sensitive skin, unless you do a patch test which I should have done on my face not my hand.y ones..</li>

            <li>I had to buy this directly from Burts Bee&#x27;s a month ago because Amazon didn&#x27;t carry at time.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with hydrated, soft skin.</li>
            <li>It is thick and doesn&#x27;t soak in well, just sits on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion, it&#x27;s not too thick to put on either.</li>
            <li>Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combination skin and I live in a desert climate that&#x27;s very dry and hot.</li>
            <li>The only difference is she is 6 years older than I am (I&#x27;m 27).</li>
            <li>This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li>I had about five of these on each cheek, one on my nose, several above and under my mouth and a few more lower on my chin.</li>
            <li>I had about five of these on each cheek, one on my nose, several above and under my mouth and a few more lower on my chin.</li>
            <li>Does not always sit right in my stomach after application, slightly overpowering.</li>
            <li>The next day I tried it on my face which was clear and had been behaving.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and the daily moisturizer I use does not contain fragrance.</li>
            <li>Upon application it was very sticky and oily which I expected.</li>
            <li>Does make skin lighter for a second or two but coloring goes back to normal.  </li>
            <li>but then kind of smells weird like vitamins.</li>
            <li>For the past couple of years I have tried to find something that will adequately moisturize without worsening my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Granted the day was slightly humid but it was not too hot outside, it&#x27;s may</li>
            <li>Any lotion with SPF 30 or higher always feels heavy to me.</li>

            <li> Any lotion with SPF 30 or higher always feels heavy to me.</li>
            <li> but a bit thick, which is probably right, given the spf, but if you are looking for something lighter like the Burt&#x27;s day lotion, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers and that it has an odd smell when first applying it.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick, so it feels thicker on my skin under my foundation...</li>
            <li> Skin already evened out, slight glow undertone, feels soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks all over my face like other natural spf products due.</li>
            <li> I tried a little bit on my hand and my 15 months old kept sneezing.</li>
            <li> I think ymmv widely on this item because she&#x27;s had none of the problems that I have had even though we have similar skin.</li>
            <li> It bothers me enough that, along with the product&#x27;s other cons, I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> and it was dry.</li>
            <li> you have dry skin and want a dewey look with SPF protection, this might work for daytime, but if you&#x27;re like me (oily/combo, acne-prone) you should avoid it or use before bed, sparingly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As many have said, this product is smelly (I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;, I find it to smell like a sunscreen cream). It is indeed quite thick, yet absorbs well enough but does leave the skin white-ish or gray-ish looking, as well as greasy for a few hours. Again, I consider it to be a sunscreen, and in no way a lotion because of its texture, and scent/smell. The pump is a very nice feature, and that is the high point of this product! I have used it along with the firming serum for about 3 weeks and have seen the effects: claimed to rejuvenate the skin, it sure &amp;#34;does&amp;#34; if by that it is meant to return me to the teenage years of bumpy skin... I have used the firming serum more than the SPF &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but since I used them together, I will blame this new line for turning my skin into smooth to zit-ty-looking. Unfortunately, this is my (first) very unhappy experience with Burt&#x27;s Bees. In terms of the anti-wrinkle effect, I cannot say that I have noticed anything, but will stop using it anyway due to the cutaneous eruptions I now have... After stopping the regimen for 5 days, my skin is back to smooth.... Renewal was the culprit, no doubt.</li>
            <li> Today makes 8 weeks of daily use so I can confidently say that I love this stuff! I&#x27;m in my late thirties now and my acne has returned with a vengeance, it is worse now than it was in my teens. Unfortunately, my now mature skin is dry. For the past couple of years I have tried to find something that will adequately moisturize without worsening my breakouts. This not only does that but my acne is much better. This moisturizer feels good on my skin, my makeup goes on over it easily and looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I hate to give this bad review as I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face but I can&#x27;t use it. Though, I wish it were fragrance-free! I should&#x27;ve listen to all reviews about how smelly this lotion is! I&#x27;m not too sensitive to fragrance product but this one is way too strong. I tried a little bit on my hand and my 15 months old kept sneezing. There&#x27;s no way I would put this on my face. Sorry, back it goes!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for everyday application and usually under makeup. But to me it&#x27;s so greasy and leaves my face feeling heavy. Have to add a lot of powder to Tone down the oiliness. I will be choosing a different daily&lt;br /&gt;Spf next time.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to have said I found a really nice, lightweight day lotion with SPF 30, but I can&#x27;t. This product is very smelly, and you can&#x27;t stop smelling it! I have tried Burt&#x27;s Bees before and could never get past their products always being so fragranced. There is no way I would put on perfume after putting this lotion on my face; migraine city! My husband can smell it on me sitting on the couch. I thought I would give them one more try and am disappointed again. This product feels lightweight when putting on, but feels heavy on my skin when putting on my foundation. Too bad they can&#x27;t come out with an unfragranced line; then I might try again.</li>
            <li> Wanted Burts and something natural with spf over 8, and this is o.k. but a bit thick, which is probably right, given the spf, but if you are looking for something lighter like the Burt&#x27;s day lotion, this is not it.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been perfect. The consistency is not too heavy, but this is certainly not a light moisturizer. I have not had breakouts since using this product which is my greatest concern when I use anything with SPF. I have put makeup over the lotion without any issues. My skin does feel firmer, but I am in my mid 20s - not necessarily the best judge of a firming product. (Don&#x27;t hate, my time will come!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read one review talking about the smell. I do have to say, the smell is the one thing which I greatly dislike about this product. Fortunately, I only smell it when I first put it on in the morning or whenever. I do not smell it throughout the entire day. Hopefully, Burt&#x27;s Bees will tone down the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still highly recommend this to someone looking for a good daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t object to the smell and I didn&#x27;t find it to be greasy -- it is chalky on my skin, won&#x27;t fully absorb so it leaves me looking like a ghost. Too bad, I loved the idea of a safe, less-chemical sunscreen moisturizer. Unfortunately, this won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Tried many facial products out there, including Obagi and Oil of Olay. My needs are sensitive, light skin. Retionol products are very irritating to me. This facial lotion, is great! Skin already evened out, slight glow undertone, feels soft. Only issue is the odor. Very strong. Does not always sit right in my stomach after application, slightly overpowering. I assume, will get better, more i use it. Two pumps are all i need to cover face, and decolletage. Also use the Radiance eye cream, and the cotton night cream. All excellent products that noticeably work without the designer price tag and without having to go to the dermatologists office to buy it.</li>
            <li> This feels really heavy on my face. It is thick and doesn&#x27;t soak in well, just sits on top of my skin. Just like a regular lotion sunscreen. It also stings a bit on any open areas like a blemish. Not what I was looking for or expecting. I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of white cast, but very happy to have found a sunscreen for my combination, acne-prone skin :) I have not been bothered by smell at all and it does not run and sting my eyes like the other sunscreen creams/lotions that I tried in past.</li>
            <li> It does reduce winkles! My skin texture is smoother and firmer. Great it&#x27;s 30 SPF.</li>
            <li> Any lotion with SPF 30 or higher always feels heavy to me. This one was no different until I put it on. It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue. During the summer I&#x27;m always looking for as much protection from the sun for my face as I can get within my daily moisturizer. This definitely fit the bill. And I don&#x27;t feel like my face is covered in zinc oxide!</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combination skin and I live in a desert climate that&#x27;s very dry and hot. SPF is extremely important to me in the spring and summer months but I have to be very careful of which skin care items I use as most SPF lotions cause me to break out. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Burt&#x27;s Bees even compared to more expensive brands like Shiseido, Estee Lauder, and Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great packaging. I love the pump and only need 1 - 2 pumps per day.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;- Very reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30 means it blocks 97% of UVB rays which is great for every day use. Higher SPFs like SPF 75 or 100 don&#x27;t offer significantly more protection so SPF 30 was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Pungent smell. Luckily, our noses function so that we stop smelling it after a while so I still use it. Nonetheless, It&#x27;s extremely unpleasant when I first put it on. It smells as if hibiscus and apples got dunked in a toxic chemical lab. I believe part of why it&#x27;s so strong smelling is to mask the smell of sunscreen but honestly, I prefer the smell of sunscreen to this. Whether or not you like/tolerate/hate the smell will vary from person to person of course. My boyfriend thinks it smells pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a very sticky residue on my fingers but it doesn&#x27;t feel bad on my face. This issue is easily resolved by washing my hands right after application. As a quick reminder, you always want to put this on 10-15 minutes BEFORE you go outside or before you put your make up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: I would recommend this to anyone wanting a little extra protection for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I removed one star from my original review because one of my favorite aspects of this lotion, the pump, gets defective once you&#x27;re about 2/3 of the way done with this llotion. It bothers me enough that, along with the product&#x27;s other cons, I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> LOVE love love this daily moisturizer. I love that it has SPF 30 so my face is always protected and it goes on really smooth and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is cruelty free and free of the questionable sun protection chemicals, but just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this product but unfortunately had to discontinue using it. I agree with other reviewers and that it has an odd smell when first applying it. But it goes away quickly and it didn&#x27;t bother me too much. The reason I stopped using it is because it seems to cause me to breakout. I don&#x27;t breakout often but had 2 blemishes within 2 weeks of using this product. I do have sensitive skin and the daily moisturizer I use does not contain fragrance. I&#x27;m not sure if the fragrance is the culprit or the spf. I will probably use it once and a while because I like the firming and the added spf.</li>
            <li> Works!  What else do you need to know?</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream ever! Feels like it is lifting my skin!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all and I had I not opened it to use it I would have asked for a refund. The lotion leaves a film on your face that lasts all day and feels sticky. Not good at all. Not worth the money. Also the smell of it is not pleasant. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Is been a great product so far. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this moisturizer. My sister loves it and she suggested it to me. I think ymmv widely on this item because she&#x27;s had none of the problems that I have had even though we have similar skin. The only difference is she is 6 years older than I am (I&#x27;m 27). So basically I do not like this moisturizer at all, and I would never use it again. I enjoy the smell which at first is floral but then kind of smells weird like vitamins. I tried it on the back of my hand first and told my sister it wasn&#x27;t sinking in and felt very sticky. She said it absorbs on her face after a short wait but that she always washes her hands afterwards because it is sticky. After about 30-45 mins it absorbed completely into my hand and it was dry. The next day I tried it on my face which was clear and had been behaving. Granted the day was slightly humid but it was not too hot outside, it&#x27;s may and it was in the 70s here in nj. Upon application it was very sticky and oily which I expected. I waited 20 minutes and it was slightly less shiny, and applied my mineral makeup powder, which did not cover up all the sheen, but not for lack of trying. I went to work in an air conditioned environment and had the worst shiny look all day, it never absorbed and even got more oily. I had to blot like ten times. My eye makeup was smearing under my eyes continuously because I had applied the lotion there as well. My skin underneath the oil slick did look nice but probably because all my shallow indentations were now filled or primed as they say with this oily moisturizer. Another problem I experienced was my face felt coated and was itchy in spots. Not crazy itchy and no hives, just felt prickly and generally uncomfortable all day. I was thinking to myself, maybe this works for my sister beautifully but it&#x27;s not for me in may, maybe I will try it in the winter. But the next day, (the reason I give this one star) I woke up to soooo many pimples! Everywhere! Teeny tiny ones.. Filled with fluid. These type I tend to get when my face is too oily or is irritated by a product. I had about five of these on each cheek, one on my nose, several above and under my mouth and a few more lower on my chin. I also had a few along my hairline. Therefore I would never use this product again and would not recommend it to oily, combination, acne prone or sensitive skin, unless you do a patch test which I should have done on my face not my hand.y ones..

            <li> Great Product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen protection this provides.  It is pretty thick, so it feels thicker on my skin under my foundation...just something I will need to get used to.  But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to add a shine to my skin, I still stay pretty matte throughout the day while wearing it.  The only negative, is that for me, it may contribute to a blemish if used daily.  As a result, I only wear it when I know I will be out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is my daily sunscreen and never fails.  I use it daily and am out in the sun alot!</li>
            <li> Great every day lotion/ sunscreen without a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this directly from Burts Bee&#x27;s a month ago because Amazon didn&#x27;t carry at time.  Out of all Burts, this is the best day time lotion.  SP30 DOES Work.  I have bad Rosacea.  Does stop the rosacea from flairing up from the sunlight.  Great thing is you can reapply lotion during day, if needed, without any build up of lotion.  Does make skin lighter for a second or two but coloring goes back to normal.  Easy to apply.  Glad Amazon took my suggestion and started selling this line.</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily and smells good. Doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks all over my face like other natural spf products due.</li>
            <li> This feels like you&#x27;re putting on regular sunscreen. It is very thick and heavy. Don&#x27;t like it at all. Maybe for night, but during the day I want something that feels lighter, not so gunky.</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much, hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Not a day lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for the high SPF, but found it far too greasy to wear under makeup. I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, so I started using it at night and it actually works much better as a night cream! I wake up with hydrated, soft skin. The dewey, oily cream gets absorbed overnight, I suppose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin and want a dewey look with SPF protection, this might work for daytime, but if you&#x27;re like me (oily/combo, acne-prone) you should avoid it or use before bed, sparingly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, it&#x27;s not too thick to put on either. Only issue is that when you apply it, your skin definitely looks a shade lighter. Once my skin absorbed it though, I was back to my normal color. Can&#x27;t complain :) will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it...soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Have been using this with the serum on a daily basis for several weeks now and I do see some improvement in my skin.</li>
