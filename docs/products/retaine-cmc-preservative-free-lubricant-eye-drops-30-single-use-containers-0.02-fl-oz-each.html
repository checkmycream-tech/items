            <li> I have been taken it since it came and at this time it is hard to say if it is helping my eye problem or not.  I apparently have and allergy to our weather and the doctor and I are having a hard time clearing it up.  I have &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; eyes a lot and it seems nothing is drying them up so seems my eyes are to lubricated.  Maybe I need to cut back on the dose?  Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye doctor highly recommended the eye drops.</li>
            <li> The product I received was NOT, in fact the product I&#x27;ve used before. I ordered this from my Lasik doctor to handle potential dry eye problems. I do a lot of computer work and the Retaine CMC is the closest product to tears. I ordered this from Since1901 and they shipped it accordingly. After I received it, I realized it was NOT the same item I&#x27;ve used before. The product I had before had a snap on resealable lid. The idea being, you can use them a few times without wasting product. Hard to believe I would put a full container in both eyes. Good products do not require that kind of quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I contacted Since1901, and requested a refund. Expecting to have honored the typical Amazon prime policy of free returns, I waited to receive my follow up response. I got it. Basically, as a prime member, I was going to have to pay for shipping the false Retaine CMC back to Since1901. I decided then and there, no thanks. Keep your wolf in sheeps clothing product.</li>
            <li> I use this with the MGD solution. I use two drops morning, two drops nightly of the MGD. Then I carry the Cmc for anytime my eyes are dry. The more faithful I am with the MGD the less I&#x27;m using the CMC. I&#x27;ve tried them all. Finally the retaine MGD made a difference in my life. Apparently this MGD is the carrier solution in re stasis and for me it works as well without the meds. FYI do not use within 30 min before inserting contacts or while contacts are in. It makes them oily and will cloud your vision.</li>
            <li> It works for me better than any other</li>
            <li> Wonderful drops. Really fixes dry eyes and helps clear stye</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by eye doctor and seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and this product brings comfort to my eyes, even on windy days</li>
            <li> I bought for my mother who has an eye condition. She was using drugstore cheap stuff that didn&#x27;t help and wasn&#x27;t lubricating. She says this is better.</li>
            <li> My eyes have been the center of my life since I had cataract surgery and was taking Lumingen for glaucoma!  And what I mean is that most people don&#x27;t even notice their eyes on a daily basis but my were red, dry, swollen feeling, all day.  I tried all kinds of drops for dry eyes, Refresh etc... Until the doctor told me about these.  One drop at awaking, and another at night, if I need it.  However it is made, it seems to keep the eyes moist like they should be.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I have suffered with dry eyes for 50 years due to a reaction to a medication I was given as a child. I have tried every drop and ointment on the market nothing ever made a difference until I tried retaine mgd what a difference it has made in both comfort and redness.</li>
            <li> difficult to apply to the eye</li>
            <li> if you have dry eyes, this the stuff! very good, and price best, per rip off drug stores!</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist recommended this product as being particularly compatible with contact lenses. (I wear gas permeable lenses.) I have worn contacts for many years. When the humidity is low, and my eyes are dry, sometimes a particle gets between the contact lens and the eye, resulting in instant pain.  In the past, I have had to immediately remove the lens and clean it. Retaine CMC provides immediate relief in about 90% of these situations, making removal of the lens unnecessary. For me, it is worth the price, and I always carry it with me.</li>
            <li> excellant delivery time-fabulous product and fair pricefrom &amp;#34;since 1901</li>
            <li> being using for a couple of years.  Like the cost savings through amazon.</li>
            <li> it sucks the drops suck and it doens&#x27;t really moisten the eye that well. Its more of a gel then drop.</li>
            <li> Love the new tubes. So easy to open and squeeze. Easy on my thumbs.</li>
            <li> Recommended by eye dr, purchased in his office-love them! Ordered from Amazon through Hawaiian Island Trading Post-product in box did NOT look the same as the one from the doctor. The box was identical with a clear round seal in place on the top; however, there were no seals on the bottom, which could easily be pushed in. The word NED appeared on top of an expiration date. The vials in the one from dr were attached 5 across - the ones in Hawaiian&#x27;s order were shaped differently and were not attached. Different drug company name, Altaire, was stamped on vial. Emailed Ocusoft and they told me in order to meet customer demand, outsourced to Altaire-boxes marked with NED on the bottom. Said they were OK to use. FDA does not regulate over-the-counter products, but reported my experience. I can understand outsourcing, but not informing customers? I wouldn&#x27;t put anything in my eyes unless I am sure what it is. So, buyer beware: a refund or apology is no cure for blindness.</li>
            <li> Dry eyes can be quite painful, but these little drops are fantastic.  My Optometrist recommended them and he was right, these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are great. I was addicted to HypoTears and have tried at least 7 or 8 different kinds (including Restasis). These seem to be doing the trick and I have ordered them 3 times. I wish they were in a bottle though. These little individual ones sometimes hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye, an eye gland problem &amp; have had eye surgery &amp; this is the only brand eye drops I love. Everything else pales in comparison.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with dry eyes after having lasik done, and these are by far the best drops that I found to use to keep my eyes moisturized. Nice individual bottles that I usually take 2 a day to keep my eyes wet. Can&#x27;t recommend enough</li>
            <li> Great; I need to order more.</li>
            <li> Nice drops, similar maybe better then Blink.  Not thick enough for preventing cpap mask dry eyes, but excellent for rewetting and daily use.  Seem ok with contacts.  Don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  Small sterile packs are great!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described - fast shipping!</li>
