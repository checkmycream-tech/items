            <li>I use them on my Oster Professional Fast Feed and they fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled with the magnets as they stay securely on fine.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much I bought two \\&quot;full\\</li>

            <li> Not a better guard on the market!</li>
            <li> My main concern was whether or not these guards would fit my Oster Fast Feed, the answer is yes they do. They fit perfectly and they don&#x27;t budge or move at all, they fit rather snug and require a bit of force to take off since the magnet is quite powerful. They do not fit the Wahl Senior however.</li>
            <li> These Nano magnets are really strong ...   As good as the clip-Ons!  I wanted to try them before  I bought the complete sets.  I liked them so much I bought two \\&quot;full\\&quot; sets  (Small Set and Larger Set)  Really Good for the Andis Masters  I also like the color!   \\&quot;Clipper Dave\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These gaurds are great for any of the Andis clippers.  They also fit the Oster Fast Feed clippers.  The magnets are super strong and the gaurd won&#x27;t budge when you are cutting you&#x27;re hair.  I have alot of different clipper gaurds but these are the best way better than Speed -o-.</li>
            <li> That one was good it had to magnets on each one</li>
            <li> I love love these. Been cutting male hair for long time. Work great</li>
            <li> With theses guards I don&#x27;t have to worry about the guard coming off and knocking a patch of hair out someone&#x27;s head,these guards are five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious why andis doesn&#x27;t have the blue guards on there site or are these things purple when they arrive? And if they by chance are a knock off are the magnets as strong</li>
            <li> Stays in place perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t shift or bend. The first time I used these with my And is Masters I got a perfect cut!</li>
            <li> These guards stay on! I don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off and cutting plugs in my hair lol!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and brand new. I have been using it to cut my hair and it never falls off the clippers as my old guards use to. And this guard is strong and doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> fit perfect on andis master</li>
            <li> These things are awesome. Had been using the cheap plastic ones that come with the clippers. These will stay attached.They are purple.</li>
            <li> LIKE FLY ON SHHHHHHHHHH!</li>
            <li> Havent used them yet but they seem to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use with fade blade it will chew up your guard..prefect guards to use for a fade too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow IG: moblie_cutz</li>
            <li> These are by far the best guard that were every made. Andis does it again. Great product and I would recommend to anyone that cuts hair.</li>
            <li> my friend used it a lot for his work</li>
            <li> I purchased these guards for my husbands clippers. they are worth the price, they arrived on time, well, before time and I will recommend this seller to anyone who is looking for these guards and I plan on buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Who would of thought that magnets on the back of guides would make such a difference. I personally think that Andis should ship out their master clippers with these standard.</li>
            <li> Good service. I like it.</li>
            <li> Upgrade your attachment combs that clip on (old style), and get these. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> This is SOLID&lt;br /&gt;BUY  IT PLEASE</li>
            <li> These things are awesome. The magnets are pretty strong so you do not have to worry about them falling off. Very durable!!! Unlike the guards with the spring tab, I will never have to buy another one!!!!</li>
            <li> This work like a charm and I will have to order the other ones. Very durable and love the magnets</li>
            <li> Grrrrrreat product can&#x27;t wait to get the set!!</li>
            <li> Great product, and strong magnets</li>
            <li> Love it. Works well with my clippers and very durable. They don&#x27;t slip of like the ones that came with my set and don&#x27;t break as easy.</li>
            <li> These work great, haven&#x27;t fallen off yet.</li>
            <li> Everything I needed in a cute purple pckg</li>
            <li> Nice clips.  I use them on my Oster Professional Fast Feed and they fit perfectly.  Don&#x27;t be fooled with the magnets as they stay securely on fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It came just as I was described. They are alot better than my previous guards</li>
            <li> Worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had problems with losing, dropping, and breaking these clips. There&#x27;s no way you can lose these clips. You&#x27;ll throw them in a bag and the magnets are so strong they&#x27;ll just be stuck to the clippers when you pull them out later. Would recommend without a second thought.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  It is exactly as I ordered, nothing more and nothing less.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product works great&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the clippers and went back to buy the comb set&lt;br /&gt;really like there products&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;the magnetic clip&#x27;s do not  move</li>
            <li> I am loving these little guys. A snap to get on. Works great with Andis Master Clipper.</li>
            <li> This are by far the best clipper guards I have ever owned.  They fit my clippers perfectly and secure.  The magnets are very powerful and stay in place.  They work so good, I&#x27;m considering buying the whole set.  I would highly recommend this guards.</li>
            <li> Great Gauge set !! I was surprized by how well they stay connected to the clippers, just like the other feedback I read</li>
            <li> This was a present to my grandson who wants to be a barber.  I haven&#x27;t heard of any problem with the product and assume this means it met his needs.</li>
