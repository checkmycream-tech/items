            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>

            <li>Nice to set eyebrows too!</li>
            <li>so I am still completely satisfied, happy with my eyelashes and will continue to buy this product!  </li>
            <li>I had an eyebrow &amp;#34;overplucking problem&amp;#34; and read where this was an effective product for rapid growth and it was!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been successful in getting them to get fuller, but I have noticed that they make my eyebrows grow faster.</li>
            <li>I really liked it!</li>
            <li>This was a pleasant surprise since I thought it would take a couple of weeks to start noticing a difference.  </li>
            <li>all good &amp; nice eye lashes too!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the best results in this value :D</li>
            <li>The best thing about this also is that it helps lashes hold a curl from a curler much much more effectively.  </li>
            <li>The Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator had a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>She loved it too.</li>
            <li>I use my fingers and squeeze the bristles to get a good amount off &amp; apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Its a good product to keep your eyelashes from breaking or conditioning them.</li>
            <li>It was good to keep my hairs in place</li>
            <li>-Good day</li>
            <li>Works good on brows after about 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li>but my eyelashes are still there looking good.</li>
            <li>It is a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I wish I have taken before pictures to show you guys how good the product has been working for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Not so good for lashes though.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>This product could work for some, and its price is extremely good.</li>
            <li>There may be more effective products at higher prices, but this is very good, and a great bargain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is great for people that don&#x27;t have skin conditions, so I will give it three stars because it&#x27;s not the product but</li>
            <li>I find that an effective way to get good results.  </li>
            <li>will look 100% good every day that you try to grow them out, but it&#x27;s a process and honestly it has to be done, grasshopper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this makes my lashes or brows grow at all, but I love it because it combs my eyebrows very nicely.</li>
            <li>So glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>then it was by better then nothing !</li>
            <li>can you a apply it more the once in a day ?!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>i really love this product!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is easily removed when you want to take it off, great stuff.</li>
            <li>i was using revitabrow and it made an amazing difference in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this product really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been fanatical about using the product, have missed a day or two in a row and still the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>Not that effective.</li>
            <li>They are thicker than before but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if by eyebrows grew because of this.</li>
            <li>I can honestly tell a difference in my brows, the hairs appear fuller and darker.</li>
            <li>But its good to keep them healthy.  </li>
            <li>However, it is nice to use as a gel over the brows when doing makeup.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel so moist and my lashes and brows have a nice sheen to them.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it made my eyebrows look really good afterward because the progress was even more profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I really liked them during the day, but I&#x27;d take my makup off at night</li>
            <li>Did nothing, but a good cheap brow gel!</li>
            <li>Three of them for this price is great, and totally worth it!</li>
            <li>rec&#x27;d quickly and happy with product</li>
            <li>So in my opinion, that makes it a pretty good product!</li>
            <li>/grows more if I use it when my skin is still warm from the shower.</li>
            <li>and she is having great success with this brand accelerator.</li>
            <li>Too easy!</li>
            <li>Really works and good product!</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3 pack and got great results with the first tube which lasted about 45 days using on lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>does not work at all would love a refund</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it makes stuff grow, but it helps it be more healthy</li>
            <li>but my eye brown got more darker.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>which this product has successfully filled!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing more eyelashes start to fill in the sparse spots.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I can get it Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying :)</li>
            <li>I have to use a liner most of the time.</li>
            <li>There is no miracle but this stuff sure does help.</li>
            <li>Ardell filled in those gaps!  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it produces more growth for \\&quot;thinning brows\\&quot; (like the product description says).</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got three to share with my sister.</li>
            <li>It is such an awesome deal.</li>
            <li>Will order more when i need to.</li>
            <li>i use it on top lash and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>but like i said just been using this product for more than a week.</li>
            <li>im sure the results will be better once i use up the product.</li>
            <li>It took about six months, but I was able to stop filling in my eyebrows with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a replacement order and will be better able to answer the questions when I receive the replacement.</li>
            <li>I know Rapid lash is working for sure.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend, great product!!!</li>
            <li>2 weeks later, I have turned into this hairy gorilla beast thing - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I have been using ardell many times and it always does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it because I paid for it &amp; don&#x27;t want to throw away my money more than I already have.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update in 2 more weeks</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a trick for getting more of the product on to your eyebrows - squeeze the bristles and the product</li>
            <li>You can get more of the product on your eyebrows this way.</li>
            <li>I will know more as time goes on and will update this review.</li>
            <li>They look much more fuller than they used to be.</li>
            <li>buy this, i wanted more hair around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So even if I don&#x27;t see any change in thickness, I&#x27;m pleased that my lashes are longer and will continue to use this as a lash &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; during the day.</li>
            <li>but longer lashes for sure.</li>
            <li>I used it every night when I got it, until I noticed that instead of making my eyelashes grow...it makes them fall out even more.</li>
            <li>Man am I glad I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>but hoping to see more changes to come.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did...</li>
            <li>Not to sure because I just started using it trying to give it some more time to do what is its supposed to do</li>
            <li>After a week I noticed it was making my eyebrows lighter and they were falling out even more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and they looked so much better</li>
            <li>And be diligent :)</li>
            <li>I have seen many Lash enhancers but never wanted to spend a lot of money to try it.</li>
            <li>I did this for probably a month or more.</li>
            <li>I have since had some more growth to my brows</li>
            <li>Glad he recommended it to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually noticed that it works best</li>
            <li>for the most part, that goal was sorta reached.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work , so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t say how many times to do this ,</li>
            <li>Will keep this updated :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from eyebrow envy for many years.  </li>
            <li>So I put it on top of my lashes and then use the tip of the brush and apply a lot on my eyelid close to the lash line.</li>
            <li>I sure saw them.  </li>
            <li>More of a conditioner than a growth product.</li>
            <li>They look so much better</li>
            <li>I have noticed my shorter eyelashes coming in better to give me fullness</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and effective,</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did because my lashes are thicker and will hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were more brittle, and, I couldn&#x27;t curl them.  </li>
            <li>All you do pull the brush along your brow and also in the area you want more hair to grow.</li>
            <li>switching permanently from Rapid Lash to Ardell - absolutely fabulous results and price!</li>
            <li>im not even a 1/4 of the way through my 1st tube! :)</li>
            <li>Hey, I don&#x27;t have to shave under arms or legs more than every couple of weeks or more - that</li>
            <li>LAshes responded better than brows.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>Although, works better for eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It an okay product.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, most people said it work.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do, I am glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I love the results and the price of this product, I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Anyways I am satisfied with this product I apply it 2x one before bed and before makeup.</li>
            <li>you can see from my 5 star rating, I love it.</li>
            <li>so I am glad that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>Apply to brows 2x daily and lashes 1x with excellent results.</li>
            <li>So pleased that no longer need to wear eyebrow pencil when I workout at health club.</li>
            <li>I have had such great growth!  </li>
            <li>My lashes look better now than they did before I ever got extensions.  </li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Product is more than reasonably priced; reviews on web indicated results were good.</li>
            <li>The area where I want hair has more fine hairs growing.</li>
            <li>I made the HUGE mistake of over tweezing my eyebrows many months ago.</li>
            <li>But as a conditioner it is doing a great job so far.</li>
            <li>i saw this one was much cheaper and had some good reviews</li>
            <li>when you need a whole new eyebrow, it&#x27;s best to ease it in to it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled and purchased it right away....</li>
            <li>For a reasonably priced product,  this stuff is pretty good!  </li>
            <li>Such a good deal for the price too!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an add-on so order other things and get another 3 pack of this, great price!</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s like a dream come true!</li>
            <li>(But easily washes off with soap and water.)</li>
            <li>My lashes grow very quickly when I use this.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>apply it a half-hour before bed on clean lashes most nights of the week, and see a difference in my lashes within about a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lashes weren&#x27;t as strong and were easily pulled off by my lash curler.</li>
            <li>My lashes were shorter and both my lashes and brows can fall out easily.</li>
            <li>This much cheaper product has been more effective for me than Revitalash.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, fast delivery &amp; works!</li>
            <li>and so far I am loving my results!</li>
            <li>You can still see the vertical scar, but now it looks fine even when I don&#x27;t fill it in.</li>
            <li>worked fine</li>
            <li>a curler works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap!  </li>
            <li>Where I have seen a huge change is my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>and oh boy they are growing in at the ends where I had problems from over plucking and the difference is huge.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the benefits and can afford the price.</li>
            <li>They have filled in a bit.</li>
            <li>and I continue to lightly pencil and apply this accelerator.</li>
            <li>After my cleansing/moisturizing at night, I apply a light coat of this.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my brows and it has filled them in also.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try (and it was cheap</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a cheap alternative, but</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a wimp, because it was cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Ardell Accelerator off and on for a few years, and am always impressed with how well it works.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look fabulous now with this lash grower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten way more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The sparse areas on my brows have filled in.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this actually causes lash growth, but it sure does make a good mascara primer.</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this product.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for about a month so far and am seeing good results.</li>
            <li>My brows were darker right from the start and the jell helps me to shape my unruly brow hair better.</li>
            <li>I find that I see better result if I use it right after I get out of the shower even though I use it every morning</li>
            <li>and my eywbrows are not only getting thicker but the shape is amazing!</li>
            <li>and already I started seeing growth real fast!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>To me, it was definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>My lashes are significantly longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a significant difference with this thing</li>
            <li>I originally bought it and stopped using it for a while because I wasn&#x27;t seeing a change</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO worth it!</li>
            <li>ok first of all there is NO color to this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>I used this in combination with Almay Get up &amp; Grow Mascara and have seen significant changes in my lashes in a month.</li>
            <li>It says clean , apply to eyebrow or lases leave on all night.</li>
            <li>I will update with a positive reivew if, in time, i have more growth.  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to give it a try because it had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this product and really recommend it.</li>
            <li>as for my top lashes, i cant really tell if they are longer yet</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price but love this.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to give this a real try, to see if it works to grow lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle its more like a hair mask.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I&#x27;m buying it again because I lost mine</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a month and my brows are as full as when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results and that I found something that works at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love it, has made a difference in my eyebrows, not so much my eyelashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok it really didn&#x27;t fill in my bald spots in my eyebrows</li>
            <li>My eyebrows continue to be full with no patches.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly surprised I am so thrilled that I found this product</li>
            <li>Of course, this does not work as well as the Latisse, but for the price, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>now i gave up, and switch to my own soft brush.</li>
            <li>They are much longer and more fuller.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t have my full brows yet.</li>
            <li>with consistant use this makes my eyelashes grow in full.  </li>
            <li>but it def conditions your lashes so they are more resilient and don&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li>Very reasonable priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well... I should have know when I got THREE for such a low price that this wouldn&#x27;t be the best stuff in the world...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like super thankful</li>
            <li>it actualy grows hair in bold spots</li>
            <li>I used this and another lash-lengthening product and ended up with the most success with castor oil from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Some of the high end ones may be better</li>
            <li>and definitely for the price, i am very pleased and would buy it again</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>CORRECTLY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash before (which is also great but more expensive) and was looking for an even more economical solution and am now using Ardell.  </li>
            <li>so I can use a new tube every six weeks or so and have it be more</li>
            <li>but I also use generic Latise, now that makes a difference for sure!</li>
            <li>and I saw a difference in my lower lashes in the first week!  </li>
            <li>I actually stopped using it because I reclaimed my shape and using more would probably make them grow out of shape!</li>
            <li>I have never had any brows and for the first time in eons I am growing eyebrows!</li>
            <li>To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I didn&#x27;t use it for a night, and my eyes were fine the next day.  </li>
            <li>A visible change in one week is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>A year ago I was not dabbing, but I literally had to draw and then rub it in so it didn&#x27;t look draw on (but it did) which was a huge hassle getting ready for school.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care, however, since I got this primarily to fix my brows.</li>
            <li>but it does do a nice job as a simple brow gel, one for keeping your brow hairs in place.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>Maybe more time is needed, but i expected to see some change after more than a couple of weeks..</li>
            <li>Then they reach the underside of my eyebrows, even though I rarely use mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not for me, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about my lashes and check them several times a day.</li>
            <li>Had no issues with it stinging - worth a try.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was using this product, and I noticed I have a lot more light blonde hairs around my brows.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s totally worth a try, I figure if it doesn&#x27;t work you can always give it to a friend to try.</li>
            <li>Uses this daily and so far, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so exciting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still kind of in shock that I have eyebrow hair on my left one.</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t grow, at least it is also good as a light mascara!</li>
            <li>The price was worth checking it out.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, it just wasn&#x27;t worth using anymore.  </li>
            <li>I took me a while to see results, but it was worth the wait and money.  </li>
            <li>Being clear it doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up application, I just have more time at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That would be like carrying the bottle in your purse and expecting it to magically be absorbed through the strap.  </li>
            <li>However, I found this product, and it was inexpensive, so I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re using this product for brow regrowth, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to try it</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>My brows have been loving this stuff and they need all the extra help they can get!</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my lashes so soft and allows them to grow faster.</li>
            <li>This is a good night treatment, but just make sure not to gob it on thick.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t properly used this product so I haven&#x27;t experienced any major change in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using this with RapidLash (as another reviewer wrote) and between the 2 products, I have LONG, healthy lashes!</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I will right another review when i am finished using it.</li>
            <li>I have had a space right where one eyebrow starts..</li>
            <li>right now it&#x27;s not looking like that&#x27;s going to be happening.</li>
            <li>So I started researching products and this one was cheap and had decent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again new hair growth is fine and gapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to full tubs of it and really couldn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>and I really see true changes.</li>
            <li>but I use this under my mascara everyday anyway since it&#x27;s good for you anyway, being all protein filled and all haha.</li>
            <li>I get with pure castor oil!</li>
            <li>At the inexpensive price that it&#x27;s being offered for here it&#x27;s a good buy but only as a clear brow gel groomer, not something that will make your brows and lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far I love this product I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my eyelashes</li>
            <li>As an Asian female with medium length, somewhat sparse lashes, I experienced no noticeable increases in the length or thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>, it makes a pretty good brow tamer and a very good base on which to apply brow powder.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed that my eyelashes have particularly grown much, but I do notice that my eyebrows have filled in a little which is awesome enough for the price.</li>
            <li>It very much did speed up the growth of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>have very light blonde eyebrows and lashes.  </li>
            <li>thanks Mom!)</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day consistently for 4 months and had virtually no results.</li>
            <li>works on eyelashes pretty well</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference after about 3-4 days of consistent application before bedtime.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for this first time based on its reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this, and I started noticing results almost immediately!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks, seems like I do have more lashes already.  </li>
            <li>i will sure be back to review on the results then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not at the thickness that I would like, but I continue to apply and am confident that these eyebrows will one day be back to their childhood bushiness.  </li>
            <li>Then I apply a second coat and make sure you get it on like you would mascara.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know it&#x27;s more than the directions say which is only at night</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not too sure if it has actually contributed to my eyebrows growing.</li>
            <li>and now I have them exactly how I want them to look.</li>
            <li>I have used the Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator consistently and have found that my eyelashes are longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back today to order more.  </li>
            <li>first surprise was when I opened the package</li>
            <li>This product definitely works for most, if not all, skin type.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier, you should use it for a atleast a week straight for you to start seeing a difference!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, it really worked after just two weeks!</li>
            <li>NOW, AT FIRST</li>
            <li>I like this since even though my brows are over plucked they are still pretty curly</li>
            <li>I was always able to buy Ardell locally at a drug store but no longer can so am ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I attribute that more to my not using facial lotion on my brow area as to not clog my follicle.</li>
            <li>so.... just don&#x27;t put too much on!</li>
            <li>really recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t burn when it got in my eyes</li>
            <li>The morning after using it I had clumps of the formula with my regular oil and flakiness, which resulted in more eyebrow loss.</li>
            <li>Im doing eyebrow threading for the last 30 years and this product works like magic for my clients</li>
            <li>I am still using the first one I opened</li>
            <li>love it for brows only.  </li>
            <li>I used it religiously at first and thought I saw a difference</li>
            <li>but then I realized I just stopped tweezing my brows so much!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my eyebrows back since (about 6 years ago).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this exactly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I figured it was worth a shot but did not expect much.  </li>
            <li>Okay I definitely was a doubting Thomas when it came to this</li>
            <li>At first i just started applying it on my eyebrows before bed.</li>
            <li>my second tube, i love it</li>
            <li>Really have been liking this product!</li>
            <li>It definitely conditions my lashes so they look and feel better.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work and be aware using it on your lashes.</li>
            <li>I gave one tube away to a friend who was getting married so she could grow her lashes longer.</li>
            <li>Good price but a waste of money since it does  nothing.</li>
            <li>I watched a youtube video about using mens Rogaine on your eyebrows and it was about $50 for the stuff, and then I saw this and the reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li>I truly love this product it actually works I have been using it for a while  now and will continue too I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>And when I put mascara now, my eyelashes look very thick and beautiful.   </li>
            <li>Positive: THICKER AND DARKER EYEBROWS plus FULLER AND STRONGER EYELASHES.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but I do use it more for my eyebrows since I already have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes are already long but helped them to grow LONGER and more volume.</li>
            <li>and this makes my lashes look long with keeping them healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as consistently on my eyebrows, so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes there.  </li>
            <li>You can also tell that I have had my brows plucked where the tech would pull straight up because that&#x27;s how the are growing, straight up!</li>
            <li>Works pretty fast</li>
            <li>: When I was in High School, I was curling my lashes and accidentally pulled out some eyelashes on my right eye</li>
            <li>Several times as I have gotten older, I have lost most of my eyelashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was SUPER surprised.</li>
            <li>It also has a kind of odd smell, but I don&#x27;t smell it (and neither does anyone else</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and fill in the sparse areas then PLEASE make sure you wait until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of lash and brow growth accelerators and honestly, I did not expect this to work any better than the other very pricey over-the-counter brands.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the rims of my eyelashes are darker, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It may have only helped a little with growth but it does work Great</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I saw results after the first few days!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t use it on my eyelashes as much.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>and I can see real results.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything..</li>
            <li>Well, not only have the sparse brow areas filled in, but my eyelashes are even a bit longer than they were before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even noticed how much longer and fuller my eyelashes are now!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey, if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out much money.</li>
            <li>Did not see a fast growth as stated...</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>By July/August of 2012, I saw so much improvement that I didn&#x27;t have to fill in (though I still chose to).  </li>
            <li>I am using it with Rapid lash and my lashes are longer and much thicker than before.</li>
            <li>This really burns.</li>
            <li>Do not use too much and do not use on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes feel really good.&lt;br /&gt;Edit;</li>
            <li>I tried it just a couple of times, but it really irritates my eyes and makes them water continuously until I wash it off.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I also used it on my lashes, even though they don&#x27;t really need it, and I have to say it made them noticeably longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This product really hasn&#x27;t done what they said it would do.  </li>
            <li>so i cant give my whole review</li>
            <li>it really seem to have improved the strength of my lashes which allows them to grow longer</li>
            <li>I also learned how to correctly tweeze thanks to YouTube.</li>
            <li>&amp; no matter what can&#x27;t seem to get a whole lot of the serum on.</li>
            <li>But I know for a fact that this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>but it really burns when you use it on your eye</li>
            <li>but it seems like it&#x27;s making them healthier; they seem thicker, not so much longer...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear any make up because I work out a lot</li>
            <li>not as much luck with regrowth in the gappy-spots on either eyelashes or brows.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my brow growth.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t disagree.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>When i saw this one, I decided it wasn&#x27;t much i would be spending if it didn&#x27;t work as well as they say.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Boooooo, have to go to the dermatologist after all for a real script.</li>
            <li>I do the whole eyebrow question thing</li>
            <li>I still fill them in a bit, but mostly where I&#x27;m still working on the empty spots.</li>
            <li>Wholy *</li>
            <li>I use it very day.</li>
            <li>For me this has made a decided difference in my eyebrows but not so much for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>you start seeing improvement really fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first visit with a dermatologist a month ago and haven&#x27;t figure out what is causing this yet because all of my labs are normal.</li>
            <li>It works very well and fast.</li>
            <li>Will keep using on eyebrows a whole longer.</li>
            <li>Now it has been almost three weeks, and my eyebrows have grown so much.</li>
            <li>The beginning of my brows show the most improvement as far as individual hair fullness and how fast they are growing.</li>
            <li>absolutely works!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Put it on in the morning and before bed for a whole week without putting on eye make up.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I did not have eyelashes before at all.</li>
            <li>It REALLY DOES work.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t really purchasing for my eyelashes, but use it on them anyways before applying my mascara</li>
            <li>I bought it just to probe it, but i didn&#x27;t think it really would work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but this stuff really works stay dedicated to it twice a day morning and night it works</li>
            <li>But who wants to pay that price every month if there is something else that works well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 6 months now, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of difference in growth or length.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>thank you so much that everyone has taken your time to write the reviews.</li>
            <li>seems to work very well</li>
            <li>, I was really embarrassed to be eyebrow-less for anything water involved for the trip.</li>
            <li>I find this product will flake, and if it gets in eyes it is very bothersome.  </li>
            <li>Have used up one tube, but the result leaves much to be desired, but there is a bit of improvement in my brows</li>
            <li>This has really worked to grow and fill out my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Did not seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>I am reporting that this really does work.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast i ordered it on June 25 and got it today June 27.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight stubborn lashes-</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li>have been VERY pleasantly surprised and pleased with the results of this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I was able to get them professionally done and back to how they used to be, before I messed them up!</li>
            <li>The only reason I was nice and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because it works the same as an eyebrow gel</li>
            <li>I seems like I have had some growth, more on one side than the other.</li>
            <li>After applying it on my eyebrows and eyelashes liberally for about a week, it&#x27;s safe to say this works extremely well.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, my brows were somewhat normal again!  </li>
            <li>I finally started using this product and now I have nice long lashes.</li>
            <li>It just let your lashes grow to their full potential.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this really helped me.</li>
            <li>NOTICED A THICKER APPERANCE OF EYEBROW HAIRS AND SOME NEW GROWTH!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll live!</li>
            <li>I bought it for my eyelashes mainly</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as thick as when I used a much more expensive growth accelerator, but this has been a good subsitute that is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li>but this product help grow back those eyelashes that didn&#x27;t want to grow back :)</li>
            <li>I did take pictures the first day, end of first week, and second.  </li>
            <li>I mainly got it for my lashes, but also have been using it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I was very vigilant with applying this every single night on a clean face before going to bed.</li>
            <li>While I wanted them to grow back in with a shape, I wanted to have nice natural (not completely penciled in) brows.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you are using this for eyelashes, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product, mostly because I&#x27;ve used  far more expensive products with fewer results.</li>
            <li>As a skeptic I thought since it was so cheap price wise that the product was as well, and boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li>so i got this product for a little more than a week now.</li>
            <li>With the three pack, it literally lasts forever, maybe a little more than a year.</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows got a little better</li>
            <li>I did not like the wand provided, it is kind of hard to apply.</li>
            <li>To see if Ardell really works, I put the product on my right eyebrow and right eyelashes for a month and a half.   </li>
            <li>I bought this based on all the great reviews, sadly I have been using it for over 2 weeks now with no change.</li>
            <li>Almost a month in and so far it&#x27;s not doing much.</li>
            <li>Be aware if you get some in your eyes it will burn like crazy but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>After about three months, the formula started smelling like old socks (no joke) and I could smell it on my face the whole day.</li>
            <li>I use a pencil and my brows look amazing and full without looking fake.</li>
            <li>Then it surprised me it really works just that it doesn&#x27;t happen immediately.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very excited and wish to have a Little fuller eyebrow and eyelash.</li>
            <li>The bottom one was from a few weeks ago &amp;  the top one is from tonight.</li>
            <li>I took the suggestion of another and dab a few dots on the top of my eyelids and then rub it in along the lash line.</li>
            <li>(hopefully no negative effects happen from it) .</li>
            <li>I have bought a few more to give to my friends as I believe in this product.</li>
            <li>As in, focus on the spots that are sparse first, not empty.</li>
            <li>eyebrows are pretty much grow back !!</li>
            <li>have extremely long full eyelashes already.</li>
            <li>I will update after a few more weeks to see if there is any growth.  </li>
            <li>as I said, I pretty much now only use this now as a gel to guide the hair where I want, to keep up the progress of my new and improved eyebrows, and to keep working on my arches.</li>
            <li>It darkens and lengthens my lashes just enough to make them easily visible, especially if I use a curler, and I don&#x27;t get clumps as I do with mascara.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker and easy to curl, especially the left eye.  </li>
            <li>I had much better luck with plain ol&#x27; vaseline.</li>
            <li>Now my right eyelashes match my left!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference between my left eyebrow and right eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like hairs started sprouting right out of it, but it&#x27;s almost like the hairs are growing from the outside in.</li>
            <li>And my right eyebrow frowning at my left like }.</li>
            <li>I had 15 hairs on left brow and 5 on right.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it to tame my eyebrows after I put on my foundation and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First of all my eyelashes are thinning and it takes for ever for them to grow back as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>I have used a more expensive one in the past and that one worked great.</li>
            <li>I have found I can&#x27;t live without this now.</li>
            <li>So the lashes you have look healthier, but I don&#x27;t think it makes new ones grow in.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for 3 days and already has new growth coming in.</li>
            <li>i doubt that this makes any follicles growth new lashes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not going to grow new hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I can definitely see a growth in lenght in my lashes, not as much in the eyebrows, which I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really flush the particles out because they blend in the white portion of your reye very well.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if this can grow new hair though I am sure hopeful as I seem to be losing my eyebrow length, which for me is hereditary.</li>
            <li>Now my lashes are long and beautiful, I tried smart lash before, but was too expensive for me.</li>
            <li>but it almost works like a clear mascara!</li>
            <li>This is actually the first review that I&#x27;ve written that gives the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The price was pretty low when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>will say that I think for those of us that have lost eyebrows, it is a product that you have to use consistently and possibly for life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar to the results I got with Loreal&#x27;s product, but this is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>(obviously when I first started using it, I felt like my lashes did</li>
            <li>Was only interested in the growth of brows.</li>
            <li>This is always my first recommendation to women who want their brows back.</li>
            <li>So first off, I am Asian.</li>
            <li>received three individual packages that looked exactly the product photo in the ad.</li>
            <li>ill stick with the amazingly effective and affordable select lash!</li>
            <li>I needed a low cost way to speed up the process, and this syrum was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my eyebrows are a little thinner and not growing very quick</li>
            <li>I use this to smooth them down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell a huge improvement in my brows yet, but I put this on as a brow gel to shape and smooth them, let it dry and put my foundation on then</li>
            <li>and I will definitely continue to buy this product especially since the price is right!</li>
            <li>So far I am unsure of new growth on my eyebrows but it does make them look conditioned darker and tames them.  </li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that some of the new hairs growing on my brows grow in a bit wild.  </li>
            <li>During the week I&#x27;ll put it right before I go to bed and leave it all night long.</li>
            <li>I pretty much stopped tweezing for about 6 months now and they grew back pretty well as my eyebrows are naturally fairly thick, but the area that was over-tweezed the most wasn&#x27;t growing in, One eyebrow in particular had an extremely sparse area I needed to fill in for the arch.</li>
            <li>Grew back to Normal length in (no lie) 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li>WOW, my lashes are getting long, very long almost to them starting to curl on their own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for the four stars is because it really didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes grow as long and fast as my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Eyebrow growth within four days; by a week and a half, all patches were filled in.</li>
            <li>I personally think doing it every day is a small price to pay for nice eyebrows again.</li>
            <li>So far it has done anything to my skin , I have very sensitive skin to.  </li>
            <li>It does go on clear which is a plus</li>
            <li>Goes on clear</li>
            <li>Its like using clear mascara on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>, it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving</li>
            <li>&gt; The accelerator is clear and has a mascara type brush for application.</li>
            <li>But clearly there is some inconsistency.  </li>
            <li>but I have a lot of thinning spaces near my arch which I tweezers alot.</li>
            <li>as far as i can tell this product doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>after a couple of months, nearly all the fuller growth i had is gone.</li>
            <li>So far, not working for me.</li>
            <li>It also has worked on my eye lashes dramatically but you can&#x27;t really see that because that growth is blonde on the ends!</li>
            <li>course I cannot guarantee you will have the same results, but this products works very well for me</li>
            <li>Did not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen results in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>I am Asian and this stuff absolutely DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>However, it does condition my lashes and keeps them from falling out as frequently as they did.</li>
            <li>So I started getting them waxed professionally</li>
            <li>It lasts so long, I&#x27;m not even close to finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I shaved my eyebrows off when I was 12 years old</li>
            <li>but I continued to shave them until I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows grew back, much to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not irritable at all, all natural</li>
            <li>I have been using for 18 days, never missing a day and applying twice a day at times.</li>
            <li>This is the second that I have purchased this product, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find a mascara wand in lieu of a brush.</li>
            <li>It was too cheap to believe and have had NO growth results after a few weeks...</li>
            <li>I used this for a while, I was constant AND used it for almost 20 days straight before going to bed</li>
            <li>My dreams of lush, Disney princess-esque lashes remain unfulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Wow was I ever surprised.  </li>
            <li>They lasted 4 days and ripped out all of my natural lashes with them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old</li>
            <li>I am notorious for over-plucking my brows, and this really gets them growing after just a short period of time!</li>
            <li>Daily use is recquired if you want to really see progress.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>so I had this stripe or gap, really, through the middle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 45</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I use it just for my eyebrows, The only thing is it leaves my eyebrows really oily.</li>
            <li>figured I&#x27;d try out the cheapest option before a more expensive one, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but there were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>That is good since I am a ruff eye rubber and tend to pull lashes out because they go in all the wrong directions.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to help encourage new growth and within a month they were back to normal.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I put the first coat of Ardell on my lashes and let it dry.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a grat product and is a cheap alternative to all of the other products that are advertised today.</li>
            <li>I was kind of sloppy</li>
            <li>Little stubbles popped up more frequently to start growing, and the protine in the syrum kept the hairs long and</li>
            <li>I wish the applicator was a bit different, hard to apply to eyebrows though very easy for the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s blonde (and I have dark brown hair), but blonde is better than none.  </li>
            <li>(Main reason I got it was to try to grow my eyebrows back thicker and in places the hair would no longer grow)</li>
            <li>the space is all the way filled in.. not sure about lashes..</li>
            <li>will, but it makes them grow long and feel really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin on top of my head but did come back; eyebrows not so much.</li>
            <li>You have to work a bit fast as the product seems to dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>now the outside ends are much thinner and receding in a bit, and I have a lot of white eyebrows as well, so I should continue to try this product on them to see if I get any results.  </li>
            <li>They are coming back slowly but surely</li>
            <li>Been using this for two weeks but haven&#x27;t seen a major difference.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I have major brow loss.</li>
            <li>So if for no other reason I gave it five stars, nothing has worked until now</li>
            <li>I love the applicator; I was worried after seeing the reviews about it, but it is a mascara wand, Duh you use it on your eyelashes!</li>
            <li>only con would be that if you apply a bit too much it gets hard and crusty, I would smooth my eyebrows over in the morning or later after applying them and crusty flakes would get in my eyes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve over-tweezed for about 10 years and my eyebrows got to the point of being very thin and straight, rather than arched like I eventually decided looked better</li>
            <li>However, if you apply a light coat at the beginning of your makeup routine, brush brows where you want them to stay, and wait a few mins to dry completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks, as some of the other reviews stated it may take longer to see results.</li>
            <li>Lashes look so full and dark!!</li>
            <li>I had to color it in to match the shape of the other one and then had to color the right eyebrow to match the color of the left then blah blah blah..</li>
            <li>its clear obviously.........</li>
            <li>/&gt;After so long of plucking and shaping, you begin to damage the whole growth process until growth isn&#x27;t possible.</li>
            <li>Not so much in my lashes, but that&#x27;s not really want</li>
            <li>I went from barely any hair to a lot</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried it on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a week now so far</li>
            <li>I saw barely any results.</li>
            <li>I am not particularly careful when I put it on, and it has never bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I barely fill them in!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one tube so far, but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>Next time,  I will have them professionally shaped.  </li>
            <li>and I have my natural brows back after about 20 years.</li>
            <li>and I was not impressed or thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick lashes on the top and bottom of my lids</li>
            <li>I honestly think it feels really weird while I put it on and</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying before spending a lot on other products that are more expensive.</li>
            <li>Every night I apply a little on the bald spot with the brush and rub it in with my finger, then I put a little more and use the tip of the brush to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I also use on my lashes each night and I like it because it helps then not cross each other even if I did sleep funny the night before</li>
            <li>Now, you can&#x27;t see the scar going through my eyebrow at all now, because the hairs above and below it cover it enough, which is saying a lot because it&#x27;s deep and pretty long in</li>
            <li>I also still have some bald spot on my eyebrows that don&#x27;t seem to grow as fast as the other parts of the brow.</li>
            <li>It actually works, almost have a full eyebrow grown in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li>Now my eyebrows look evenly thick and my eyelashes grew a bit more center meters not an inch..</li>
            <li>a positive note, less lashes fell out when I removed my eye makeup at night.</li>
            <li>Also, I want to point out that when I say fill in, I mean I lightly dab it a couple of times with my eyebrow wax (E.L.F.), but only so that it blends it in with the rest and you can still see skin by it.</li>
            <li>Another goes vertically toward the T zone, but is still in the eyebrow hair (where it should be).&lt;br /&gt;So for like 17 years I&#x27;ve been walking around like a hot mess with my left eyebrow arched like a horizontal parentheses sign.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the thickness and even length of my eyelashes after the first few applications.  </li>
            <li>the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>One day I finally decided that I was tired of how long it took to get ready to go out because I had to fill in and clean up my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are really thinned out halfway through, so it looks like I have half eyebrows</li>
            <li>/&gt;**To be clear, this did not fill in the scaring, HOWEVER it has made the hair around it long enough to cover the scar.</li>
            <li>It makes my mascara go on super smooth, and the clumping isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as when I dont use this.</li>
            <li>So, I plucked the outer brow off and did the other eye to match, thinking they could grow in at the same time and be normal again.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had never tweezed so thin, but hey, you live and learn right?</li>
            <li>Not really in anywhere useful and eventually the little stubs of hair stopped growing further.  </li>

            <li> So glad I don&#x27;t have to pencil them in or have to worry about pool water washing them&lt;br /&gt;Off !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing !</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> will keep on using this product, since in the 2 weeks of use I have put in, it has already made an Amazing difference!</li>
            <li> Nice to set eyebrows too!</li>
            <li> so I am still completely satisfied, happy with my eyelashes and will continue to buy this product!  </li>
            <li> I had an eyebrow &amp;#34;overplucking problem&amp;#34; and read where this was an effective product for rapid growth and it was!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been successful in getting them to get fuller, but I have noticed that they make my eyebrows grow faster.</li>
            <li> I really liked it!</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise since I thought it would take a couple of weeks to start noticing a difference.  </li>
            <li> all good &amp; nice eye lashes too!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the best results in this value :D</li>
            <li> The best thing about this also is that it helps lashes hold a curl from a curler much much more effectively.  </li>
            <li> The Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator had a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> She loved it too.</li>
            <li> I use my fingers and squeeze the bristles to get a good amount off &amp; apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Its a good product to keep your eyelashes from breaking or conditioning them.</li>
            <li> It was good to keep my hairs in place</li>
            <li> -Good day</li>
            <li> Works good on brows after about 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li> but my eyelashes are still there looking good.</li>
            <li> It is a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I wish I have taken before pictures to show you guys how good the product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it and a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not so good for lashes though.</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> This product could work for some, and its price is extremely good.</li>
            <li> There may be more effective products at higher prices, but this is very good, and a great bargain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is great for people that don&#x27;t have skin conditions, so I will give it three stars because it&#x27;s not the product but</li>
            <li> I find that an effective way to get good results.  </li>
            <li> will look 100% good every day that you try to grow them out, but it&#x27;s a process and honestly it has to be done, grasshopper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this makes my lashes or brows grow at all, but I love it because it combs my eyebrows very nicely.</li>
            <li> So glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> then it was by better then nothing !</li>
            <li> can you a apply it more the once in a day ?!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> i really love this product!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is easily removed when you want to take it off, great stuff.</li>
            <li> i was using revitabrow and it made an amazing difference in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this product really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been fanatical about using the product, have missed a day or two in a row and still the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> Not that effective.</li>
            <li> They are thicker than before but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if by eyebrows grew because of this.</li>
            <li> I can honestly tell a difference in my brows, the hairs appear fuller and darker.</li>
            <li> But its good to keep them healthy.  </li>
            <li> However, it is nice to use as a gel over the brows when doing makeup.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel so moist and my lashes and brows have a nice sheen to them.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it made my eyebrows look really good afterward because the progress was even more profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I really liked them during the day, but I&#x27;d take my makup off at night</li>
            <li> Did nothing, but a good cheap brow gel!</li>
            <li> Three of them for this price is great, and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d quickly and happy with product</li>
            <li> So in my opinion, that makes it a pretty good product!</li>
            <li> /grows more if I use it when my skin is still warm from the shower.</li>
            <li> and she is having great success with this brand accelerator.</li>
            <li> Too easy!</li>
            <li> Really works and good product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack and got great results with the first tube which lasted about 45 days using on lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> does not work at all would love a refund</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes stuff grow, but it helps it be more healthy</li>
            <li> but my eye brown got more darker.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> which this product has successfully filled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing more eyelashes start to fill in the sparse spots.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I can get it Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying :)</li>
            <li> I have to use a liner most of the time.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle but this stuff sure does help.</li>
            <li> Ardell filled in those gaps!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it produces more growth for \\&quot;thinning brows\\&quot; (like the product description says).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got three to share with my sister.</li>
            <li> It is such an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Will order more when i need to.</li>
            <li> i use it on top lash and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> but like i said just been using this product for more than a week.</li>
            <li> im sure the results will be better once i use up the product.</li>
            <li> It took about six months, but I was able to stop filling in my eyebrows with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a replacement order and will be better able to answer the questions when I receive the replacement.</li>
            <li> I know Rapid lash is working for sure.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend, great product!!!</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later, I have turned into this hairy gorilla beast thing - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have been using ardell many times and it always does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it because I paid for it &amp; don&#x27;t want to throw away my money more than I already have.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in 2 more weeks</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a trick for getting more of the product on to your eyebrows - squeeze the bristles and the product</li>
            <li> You can get more of the product on your eyebrows this way.</li>
            <li> I will know more as time goes on and will update this review.</li>
            <li> They look much more fuller than they used to be.</li>
            <li> buy this, i wanted more hair around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So even if I don&#x27;t see any change in thickness, I&#x27;m pleased that my lashes are longer and will continue to use this as a lash &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; during the day.</li>
            <li> but longer lashes for sure.</li>
            <li> I used it every night when I got it, until I noticed that instead of making my eyelashes grow...it makes them fall out even more.</li>
            <li> Man am I glad I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> but hoping to see more changes to come.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did...</li>
            <li> Not to sure because I just started using it trying to give it some more time to do what is its supposed to do</li>
            <li> After a week I noticed it was making my eyebrows lighter and they were falling out even more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and they looked so much better</li>
            <li> And be diligent :)</li>
            <li> I have seen many Lash enhancers but never wanted to spend a lot of money to try it.</li>
            <li> I did this for probably a month or more.</li>
            <li> I have since had some more growth to my brows</li>
            <li> Glad he recommended it to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed that it works best</li>
            <li> for the most part, that goal was sorta reached.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work , so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t say how many times to do this ,</li>
            <li> Will keep this updated :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from eyebrow envy for many years.  </li>
            <li> So I put it on top of my lashes and then use the tip of the brush and apply a lot on my eyelid close to the lash line.</li>
            <li> I sure saw them.  </li>
            <li> More of a conditioner than a growth product.</li>
            <li> They look so much better</li>
            <li> I have noticed my shorter eyelashes coming in better to give me fullness</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and effective,</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did because my lashes are thicker and will hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were more brittle, and, I couldn&#x27;t curl them.  </li>
            <li> All you do pull the brush along your brow and also in the area you want more hair to grow.</li>
            <li> switching permanently from Rapid Lash to Ardell - absolutely fabulous results and price!</li>
            <li> im not even a 1/4 of the way through my 1st tube! :)</li>
            <li> Hey, I don&#x27;t have to shave under arms or legs more than every couple of weeks or more - that</li>
            <li> LAshes responded better than brows.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more</li>
            <li> Although, works better for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It an okay product.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, most people said it work.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do, I am glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I love the results and the price of this product, I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Anyways I am satisfied with this product I apply it 2x one before bed and before makeup.</li>
            <li> you can see from my 5 star rating, I love it.</li>
            <li> so I am glad that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> Apply to brows 2x daily and lashes 1x with excellent results.</li>
            <li> So pleased that no longer need to wear eyebrow pencil when I workout at health club.</li>
            <li> I have had such great growth!  </li>
            <li> My lashes look better now than they did before I ever got extensions.  </li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Product is more than reasonably priced; reviews on web indicated results were good.</li>
            <li> The area where I want hair has more fine hairs growing.</li>
            <li> I made the HUGE mistake of over tweezing my eyebrows many months ago.</li>
            <li> But as a conditioner it is doing a great job so far.</li>
            <li> i saw this one was much cheaper and had some good reviews</li>
            <li> when you need a whole new eyebrow, it&#x27;s best to ease it in to it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled and purchased it right away....</li>
            <li> For a reasonably priced product,  this stuff is pretty good!  </li>
            <li> Such a good deal for the price too!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an add-on so order other things and get another 3 pack of this, great price!</li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s like a dream come true!</li>
            <li> (But easily washes off with soap and water.)</li>
            <li> My lashes grow very quickly when I use this.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> apply it a half-hour before bed on clean lashes most nights of the week, and see a difference in my lashes within about a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lashes weren&#x27;t as strong and were easily pulled off by my lash curler.</li>
            <li> My lashes were shorter and both my lashes and brows can fall out easily.</li>
            <li> This much cheaper product has been more effective for me than Revitalash.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, fast delivery &amp; works!</li>
            <li> and so far I am loving my results!</li>
            <li> You can still see the vertical scar, but now it looks fine even when I don&#x27;t fill it in.</li>
            <li> worked fine</li>
            <li> a curler works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap!  </li>
            <li> Where I have seen a huge change is my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> and oh boy they are growing in at the ends where I had problems from over plucking and the difference is huge.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the benefits and can afford the price.</li>
            <li> They have filled in a bit.</li>
            <li> and I continue to lightly pencil and apply this accelerator.</li>
            <li> After my cleansing/moisturizing at night, I apply a light coat of this.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my brows and it has filled them in also.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try (and it was cheap</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a cheap alternative, but</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a wimp, because it was cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Ardell Accelerator off and on for a few years, and am always impressed with how well it works.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look fabulous now with this lash grower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten way more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> The sparse areas on my brows have filled in.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually causes lash growth, but it sure does make a good mascara primer.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this product.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for about a month so far and am seeing good results.</li>
            <li> My brows were darker right from the start and the jell helps me to shape my unruly brow hair better.</li>
            <li> I find that I see better result if I use it right after I get out of the shower even though I use it every morning</li>
            <li> and my eywbrows are not only getting thicker but the shape is amazing!</li>
            <li> and already I started seeing growth real fast!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> To me, it was definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> My lashes are significantly longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a significant difference with this thing</li>
            <li> I originally bought it and stopped using it for a while because I wasn&#x27;t seeing a change</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO worth it!</li>
            <li> ok first of all there is NO color to this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Almay Get up &amp; Grow Mascara and have seen significant changes in my lashes in a month.</li>
            <li> It says clean , apply to eyebrow or lases leave on all night.</li>
            <li> I will update with a positive reivew if, in time, i have more growth.  </li>
            <li> However, I decided to give it a try because it had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this product and really recommend it.</li>
            <li> as for my top lashes, i cant really tell if they are longer yet</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price but love this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to give this a real try, to see if it works to grow lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle its more like a hair mask.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I&#x27;m buying it again because I lost mine</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month and my brows are as full as when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results and that I found something that works at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love it, has made a difference in my eyebrows, not so much my eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it really didn&#x27;t fill in my bald spots in my eyebrows</li>
            <li> My eyebrows continue to be full with no patches.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly surprised I am so thrilled that I found this product</li>
            <li> Of course, this does not work as well as the Latisse, but for the price, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> now i gave up, and switch to my own soft brush.</li>
            <li> They are much longer and more fuller.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t have my full brows yet.</li>
            <li> with consistant use this makes my eyelashes grow in full.  </li>
            <li> but it def conditions your lashes so they are more resilient and don&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li> Very reasonable priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well... I should have know when I got THREE for such a low price that this wouldn&#x27;t be the best stuff in the world...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like super thankful</li>
            <li> it actualy grows hair in bold spots</li>
            <li> I used this and another lash-lengthening product and ended up with the most success with castor oil from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Some of the high end ones may be better</li>
            <li> and definitely for the price, i am very pleased and would buy it again</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> CORRECTLY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash before (which is also great but more expensive) and was looking for an even more economical solution and am now using Ardell.  </li>
            <li> so I can use a new tube every six weeks or so and have it be more</li>
            <li> but I also use generic Latise, now that makes a difference for sure!</li>
            <li> and I saw a difference in my lower lashes in the first week!  </li>
            <li> I actually stopped using it because I reclaimed my shape and using more would probably make them grow out of shape!</li>
            <li> I have never had any brows and for the first time in eons I am growing eyebrows!</li>
            <li> To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I didn&#x27;t use it for a night, and my eyes were fine the next day.  </li>
            <li> A visible change in one week is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> A year ago I was not dabbing, but I literally had to draw and then rub it in so it didn&#x27;t look draw on (but it did) which was a huge hassle getting ready for school.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care, however, since I got this primarily to fix my brows.</li>
            <li> but it does do a nice job as a simple brow gel, one for keeping your brow hairs in place.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> Maybe more time is needed, but i expected to see some change after more than a couple of weeks..</li>
            <li> Then they reach the underside of my eyebrows, even though I rarely use mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not for me, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about my lashes and check them several times a day.</li>
            <li> Had no issues with it stinging - worth a try.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was using this product, and I noticed I have a lot more light blonde hairs around my brows.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s totally worth a try, I figure if it doesn&#x27;t work you can always give it to a friend to try.</li>
            <li> Uses this daily and so far, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so exciting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still kind of in shock that I have eyebrow hair on my left one.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t grow, at least it is also good as a light mascara!</li>
            <li> The price was worth checking it out.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, it just wasn&#x27;t worth using anymore.  </li>
            <li> I took me a while to see results, but it was worth the wait and money.  </li>
            <li> Being clear it doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up application, I just have more time at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would be like carrying the bottle in your purse and expecting it to magically be absorbed through the strap.  </li>
            <li> However, I found this product, and it was inexpensive, so I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using this product for brow regrowth, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to try it</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> My brows have been loving this stuff and they need all the extra help they can get!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my lashes so soft and allows them to grow faster.</li>
            <li> This is a good night treatment, but just make sure not to gob it on thick.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t properly used this product so I haven&#x27;t experienced any major change in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using this with RapidLash (as another reviewer wrote) and between the 2 products, I have LONG, healthy lashes!</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I will right another review when i am finished using it.</li>
            <li> I have had a space right where one eyebrow starts..</li>
            <li> right now it&#x27;s not looking like that&#x27;s going to be happening.</li>
            <li> So I started researching products and this one was cheap and had decent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again new hair growth is fine and gapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to full tubs of it and really couldn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> and I really see true changes.</li>
            <li> but I use this under my mascara everyday anyway since it&#x27;s good for you anyway, being all protein filled and all haha.</li>
            <li> I get with pure castor oil!</li>
            <li> At the inexpensive price that it&#x27;s being offered for here it&#x27;s a good buy but only as a clear brow gel groomer, not something that will make your brows and lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I love this product I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> As an Asian female with medium length, somewhat sparse lashes, I experienced no noticeable increases in the length or thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> , it makes a pretty good brow tamer and a very good base on which to apply brow powder.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed that my eyelashes have particularly grown much, but I do notice that my eyebrows have filled in a little which is awesome enough for the price.</li>
            <li> It very much did speed up the growth of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> have very light blonde eyebrows and lashes.  </li>
            <li> thanks Mom!)</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day consistently for 4 months and had virtually no results.</li>
            <li> works on eyelashes pretty well</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference after about 3-4 days of consistent application before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for this first time based on its reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this, and I started noticing results almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks, seems like I do have more lashes already.  </li>
            <li> i will sure be back to review on the results then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not at the thickness that I would like, but I continue to apply and am confident that these eyebrows will one day be back to their childhood bushiness.  </li>
            <li> Then I apply a second coat and make sure you get it on like you would mascara.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know it&#x27;s more than the directions say which is only at night</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not too sure if it has actually contributed to my eyebrows growing.</li>
            <li> and now I have them exactly how I want them to look.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator consistently and have found that my eyelashes are longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back today to order more.  </li>
            <li> first surprise was when I opened the package</li>
            <li> This product definitely works for most, if not all, skin type.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier, you should use it for a atleast a week straight for you to start seeing a difference!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, it really worked after just two weeks!</li>
            <li> NOW, AT FIRST</li>
            <li> I like this since even though my brows are over plucked they are still pretty curly</li>
            <li> I was always able to buy Ardell locally at a drug store but no longer can so am ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I attribute that more to my not using facial lotion on my brow area as to not clog my follicle.</li>
            <li> so.... just don&#x27;t put too much on!</li>
            <li> really recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t burn when it got in my eyes</li>
            <li> The morning after using it I had clumps of the formula with my regular oil and flakiness, which resulted in more eyebrow loss.</li>
            <li> Im doing eyebrow threading for the last 30 years and this product works like magic for my clients</li>
            <li> I am still using the first one I opened</li>
            <li> love it for brows only.  </li>
            <li> I used it religiously at first and thought I saw a difference</li>
            <li> but then I realized I just stopped tweezing my brows so much!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my eyebrows back since (about 6 years ago).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this exactly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I figured it was worth a shot but did not expect much.  </li>
            <li> Okay I definitely was a doubting Thomas when it came to this</li>
            <li> At first i just started applying it on my eyebrows before bed.</li>
            <li> my second tube, i love it</li>
            <li> Really have been liking this product!</li>
            <li> It definitely conditions my lashes so they look and feel better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and be aware using it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I gave one tube away to a friend who was getting married so she could grow her lashes longer.</li>
            <li> Good price but a waste of money since it does  nothing.</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube video about using mens Rogaine on your eyebrows and it was about $50 for the stuff, and then I saw this and the reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li> I truly love this product it actually works I have been using it for a while  now and will continue too I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> And when I put mascara now, my eyelashes look very thick and beautiful.   </li>
            <li> Positive: THICKER AND DARKER EYEBROWS plus FULLER AND STRONGER EYELASHES.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I do use it more for my eyebrows since I already have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are already long but helped them to grow LONGER and more volume.</li>
            <li> and this makes my lashes look long with keeping them healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as consistently on my eyebrows, so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes there.  </li>
            <li> You can also tell that I have had my brows plucked where the tech would pull straight up because that&#x27;s how the are growing, straight up!</li>
            <li> Works pretty fast</li>
            <li> : When I was in High School, I was curling my lashes and accidentally pulled out some eyelashes on my right eye</li>
            <li> Several times as I have gotten older, I have lost most of my eyelashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was SUPER surprised.</li>
            <li> It also has a kind of odd smell, but I don&#x27;t smell it (and neither does anyone else</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and fill in the sparse areas then PLEASE make sure you wait until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of lash and brow growth accelerators and honestly, I did not expect this to work any better than the other very pricey over-the-counter brands.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the rims of my eyelashes are darker, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It may have only helped a little with growth but it does work Great</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I saw results after the first few days!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t use it on my eyelashes as much.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> and I can see real results.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything..</li>
            <li> Well, not only have the sparse brow areas filled in, but my eyelashes are even a bit longer than they were before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even noticed how much longer and fuller my eyelashes are now!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey, if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out much money.</li>
            <li> Did not see a fast growth as stated...</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> By July/August of 2012, I saw so much improvement that I didn&#x27;t have to fill in (though I still chose to).  </li>
            <li> I am using it with Rapid lash and my lashes are longer and much thicker than before.</li>
            <li> This really burns.</li>
            <li> Do not use too much and do not use on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes feel really good.&lt;br /&gt;Edit;</li>
            <li> I tried it just a couple of times, but it really irritates my eyes and makes them water continuously until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on my lashes, even though they don&#x27;t really need it, and I have to say it made them noticeably longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> This product really hasn&#x27;t done what they said it would do.  </li>
            <li> so i cant give my whole review</li>
            <li> it really seem to have improved the strength of my lashes which allows them to grow longer</li>
            <li> I also learned how to correctly tweeze thanks to YouTube.</li>
            <li> &amp; no matter what can&#x27;t seem to get a whole lot of the serum on.</li>
            <li> But I know for a fact that this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> but it really burns when you use it on your eye</li>
            <li> but it seems like it&#x27;s making them healthier; they seem thicker, not so much longer...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear any make up because I work out a lot</li>
            <li> not as much luck with regrowth in the gappy-spots on either eyelashes or brows.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my brow growth.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t disagree.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> When i saw this one, I decided it wasn&#x27;t much i would be spending if it didn&#x27;t work as well as they say.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Boooooo, have to go to the dermatologist after all for a real script.</li>
            <li> I do the whole eyebrow question thing</li>
            <li> I still fill them in a bit, but mostly where I&#x27;m still working on the empty spots.</li>
            <li> Wholy *</li>
            <li> I use it very day.</li>
            <li> For me this has made a decided difference in my eyebrows but not so much for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> you start seeing improvement really fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first visit with a dermatologist a month ago and haven&#x27;t figure out what is causing this yet because all of my labs are normal.</li>
            <li> It works very well and fast.</li>
            <li> Will keep using on eyebrows a whole longer.</li>
            <li> Now it has been almost three weeks, and my eyebrows have grown so much.</li>
            <li> The beginning of my brows show the most improvement as far as individual hair fullness and how fast they are growing.</li>
            <li> absolutely works!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Put it on in the morning and before bed for a whole week without putting on eye make up.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I did not have eyelashes before at all.</li>
            <li> It REALLY DOES work.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t really purchasing for my eyelashes, but use it on them anyways before applying my mascara</li>
            <li> I bought it just to probe it, but i didn&#x27;t think it really would work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but this stuff really works stay dedicated to it twice a day morning and night it works</li>
            <li> But who wants to pay that price every month if there is something else that works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of difference in growth or length.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> thank you so much that everyone has taken your time to write the reviews.</li>
            <li> seems to work very well</li>
            <li> , I was really embarrassed to be eyebrow-less for anything water involved for the trip.</li>
            <li> I find this product will flake, and if it gets in eyes it is very bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Have used up one tube, but the result leaves much to be desired, but there is a bit of improvement in my brows</li>
            <li> This has really worked to grow and fill out my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Did not seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> I am reporting that this really does work.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast i ordered it on June 25 and got it today June 27.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight stubborn lashes-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li> have been VERY pleasantly surprised and pleased with the results of this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was able to get them professionally done and back to how they used to be, before I messed them up!</li>
            <li> The only reason I was nice and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because it works the same as an eyebrow gel</li>
            <li> I seems like I have had some growth, more on one side than the other.</li>
            <li> After applying it on my eyebrows and eyelashes liberally for about a week, it&#x27;s safe to say this works extremely well.</li>
            <li> In two weeks, my brows were somewhat normal again!  </li>
            <li> I finally started using this product and now I have nice long lashes.</li>
            <li> It just let your lashes grow to their full potential.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this really helped me.</li>
            <li> NOTICED A THICKER APPERANCE OF EYEBROW HAIRS AND SOME NEW GROWTH!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll live!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my eyelashes mainly</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as thick as when I used a much more expensive growth accelerator, but this has been a good subsitute that is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li> but this product help grow back those eyelashes that didn&#x27;t want to grow back :)</li>
            <li> I did take pictures the first day, end of first week, and second.  </li>
            <li> I mainly got it for my lashes, but also have been using it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was very vigilant with applying this every single night on a clean face before going to bed.</li>
            <li> While I wanted them to grow back in with a shape, I wanted to have nice natural (not completely penciled in) brows.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> you are using this for eyelashes, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product, mostly because I&#x27;ve used  far more expensive products with fewer results.</li>
            <li> As a skeptic I thought since it was so cheap price wise that the product was as well, and boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> so i got this product for a little more than a week now.</li>
            <li> With the three pack, it literally lasts forever, maybe a little more than a year.</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows got a little better</li>
            <li> I did not like the wand provided, it is kind of hard to apply.</li>
            <li> To see if Ardell really works, I put the product on my right eyebrow and right eyelashes for a month and a half.   </li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews, sadly I have been using it for over 2 weeks now with no change.</li>
            <li> Almost a month in and so far it&#x27;s not doing much.</li>
            <li> Be aware if you get some in your eyes it will burn like crazy but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> After about three months, the formula started smelling like old socks (no joke) and I could smell it on my face the whole day.</li>
            <li> I use a pencil and my brows look amazing and full without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Then it surprised me it really works just that it doesn&#x27;t happen immediately.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very excited and wish to have a Little fuller eyebrow and eyelash.</li>
            <li> The bottom one was from a few weeks ago &amp;  the top one is from tonight.</li>
            <li> I took the suggestion of another and dab a few dots on the top of my eyelids and then rub it in along the lash line.</li>
            <li> (hopefully no negative effects happen from it) .</li>
            <li> I have bought a few more to give to my friends as I believe in this product.</li>
            <li> As in, focus on the spots that are sparse first, not empty.</li>
            <li> eyebrows are pretty much grow back !!</li>
            <li> have extremely long full eyelashes already.</li>
            <li> I will update after a few more weeks to see if there is any growth.  </li>
            <li> as I said, I pretty much now only use this now as a gel to guide the hair where I want, to keep up the progress of my new and improved eyebrows, and to keep working on my arches.</li>
            <li> It darkens and lengthens my lashes just enough to make them easily visible, especially if I use a curler, and I don&#x27;t get clumps as I do with mascara.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and easy to curl, especially the left eye.  </li>
            <li> I had much better luck with plain ol&#x27; vaseline.</li>
            <li> Now my right eyelashes match my left!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference between my left eyebrow and right eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like hairs started sprouting right out of it, but it&#x27;s almost like the hairs are growing from the outside in.</li>
            <li> And my right eyebrow frowning at my left like }.</li>
            <li> I had 15 hairs on left brow and 5 on right.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it to tame my eyebrows after I put on my foundation and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First of all my eyelashes are thinning and it takes for ever for them to grow back as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li> I have used a more expensive one in the past and that one worked great.</li>
            <li> I have found I can&#x27;t live without this now.</li>
            <li> So the lashes you have look healthier, but I don&#x27;t think it makes new ones grow in.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for 3 days and already has new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> i doubt that this makes any follicles growth new lashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not going to grow new hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I can definitely see a growth in lenght in my lashes, not as much in the eyebrows, which I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really flush the particles out because they blend in the white portion of your reye very well.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this can grow new hair though I am sure hopeful as I seem to be losing my eyebrow length, which for me is hereditary.</li>
            <li> Now my lashes are long and beautiful, I tried smart lash before, but was too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> but it almost works like a clear mascara!</li>
            <li> This is actually the first review that I&#x27;ve written that gives the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The price was pretty low when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> will say that I think for those of us that have lost eyebrows, it is a product that you have to use consistently and possibly for life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to the results I got with Loreal&#x27;s product, but this is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> (obviously when I first started using it, I felt like my lashes did</li>
            <li> Was only interested in the growth of brows.</li>
            <li> This is always my first recommendation to women who want their brows back.</li>
            <li> So first off, I am Asian.</li>
            <li> received three individual packages that looked exactly the product photo in the ad.</li>
            <li> ill stick with the amazingly effective and affordable select lash!</li>
            <li> I needed a low cost way to speed up the process, and this syrum was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows are a little thinner and not growing very quick</li>
            <li> I use this to smooth them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell a huge improvement in my brows yet, but I put this on as a brow gel to shape and smooth them, let it dry and put my foundation on then</li>
            <li> and I will definitely continue to buy this product especially since the price is right!</li>
            <li> So far I am unsure of new growth on my eyebrows but it does make them look conditioned darker and tames them.  </li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that some of the new hairs growing on my brows grow in a bit wild.  </li>
            <li> During the week I&#x27;ll put it right before I go to bed and leave it all night long.</li>
            <li> I pretty much stopped tweezing for about 6 months now and they grew back pretty well as my eyebrows are naturally fairly thick, but the area that was over-tweezed the most wasn&#x27;t growing in, One eyebrow in particular had an extremely sparse area I needed to fill in for the arch.</li>
            <li> Grew back to Normal length in (no lie) 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> WOW, my lashes are getting long, very long almost to them starting to curl on their own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for the four stars is because it really didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes grow as long and fast as my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow growth within four days; by a week and a half, all patches were filled in.</li>
            <li> I personally think doing it every day is a small price to pay for nice eyebrows again.</li>
            <li> So far it has done anything to my skin , I have very sensitive skin to.  </li>
            <li> It does go on clear which is a plus</li>
            <li> Goes on clear</li>
            <li> Its like using clear mascara on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> , it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving</li>
            <li> &gt; The accelerator is clear and has a mascara type brush for application.</li>
            <li> But clearly there is some inconsistency.  </li>
            <li> but I have a lot of thinning spaces near my arch which I tweezers alot.</li>
            <li> as far as i can tell this product doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> after a couple of months, nearly all the fuller growth i had is gone.</li>
            <li> So far, not working for me.</li>
            <li> It also has worked on my eye lashes dramatically but you can&#x27;t really see that because that growth is blonde on the ends!</li>
            <li> course I cannot guarantee you will have the same results, but this products works very well for me</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen results in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and this stuff absolutely DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> However, it does condition my lashes and keeps them from falling out as frequently as they did.</li>
            <li> So I started getting them waxed professionally</li>
            <li> It lasts so long, I&#x27;m not even close to finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I shaved my eyebrows off when I was 12 years old</li>
            <li> but I continued to shave them until I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows grew back, much to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not irritable at all, all natural</li>
            <li> I have been using for 18 days, never missing a day and applying twice a day at times.</li>
            <li> This is the second that I have purchased this product, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find a mascara wand in lieu of a brush.</li>
            <li> It was too cheap to believe and have had NO growth results after a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I used this for a while, I was constant AND used it for almost 20 days straight before going to bed</li>
            <li> My dreams of lush, Disney princess-esque lashes remain unfulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Wow was I ever surprised.  </li>
            <li> They lasted 4 days and ripped out all of my natural lashes with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old</li>
            <li> I am notorious for over-plucking my brows, and this really gets them growing after just a short period of time!</li>
            <li> Daily use is recquired if you want to really see progress.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> so I had this stripe or gap, really, through the middle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 45</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I use it just for my eyebrows, The only thing is it leaves my eyebrows really oily.</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d try out the cheapest option before a more expensive one, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but there were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> That is good since I am a ruff eye rubber and tend to pull lashes out because they go in all the wrong directions.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help encourage new growth and within a month they were back to normal.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I put the first coat of Ardell on my lashes and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a grat product and is a cheap alternative to all of the other products that are advertised today.</li>
            <li> I was kind of sloppy</li>
            <li> Little stubbles popped up more frequently to start growing, and the protine in the syrum kept the hairs long and</li>
            <li> I wish the applicator was a bit different, hard to apply to eyebrows though very easy for the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s blonde (and I have dark brown hair), but blonde is better than none.  </li>
            <li> (Main reason I got it was to try to grow my eyebrows back thicker and in places the hair would no longer grow)</li>
            <li> the space is all the way filled in.. not sure about lashes..</li>
            <li> will, but it makes them grow long and feel really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin on top of my head but did come back; eyebrows not so much.</li>
            <li> You have to work a bit fast as the product seems to dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> now the outside ends are much thinner and receding in a bit, and I have a lot of white eyebrows as well, so I should continue to try this product on them to see if I get any results.  </li>
            <li> They are coming back slowly but surely</li>
            <li> Been using this for two weeks but haven&#x27;t seen a major difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have major brow loss.</li>
            <li> So if for no other reason I gave it five stars, nothing has worked until now</li>
            <li> I love the applicator; I was worried after seeing the reviews about it, but it is a mascara wand, Duh you use it on your eyelashes!</li>
            <li> only con would be that if you apply a bit too much it gets hard and crusty, I would smooth my eyebrows over in the morning or later after applying them and crusty flakes would get in my eyes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve over-tweezed for about 10 years and my eyebrows got to the point of being very thin and straight, rather than arched like I eventually decided looked better</li>
            <li> However, if you apply a light coat at the beginning of your makeup routine, brush brows where you want them to stay, and wait a few mins to dry completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks, as some of the other reviews stated it may take longer to see results.</li>
            <li> Lashes look so full and dark!!</li>
            <li> I had to color it in to match the shape of the other one and then had to color the right eyebrow to match the color of the left then blah blah blah..</li>
            <li> its clear obviously.........</li>
            <li> /&gt;After so long of plucking and shaping, you begin to damage the whole growth process until growth isn&#x27;t possible.</li>
            <li> Not so much in my lashes, but that&#x27;s not really want</li>
            <li> I went from barely any hair to a lot</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried it on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a week now so far</li>
            <li> I saw barely any results.</li>
            <li> I am not particularly careful when I put it on, and it has never bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I barely fill them in!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one tube so far, but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Next time,  I will have them professionally shaped.  </li>
            <li> and I have my natural brows back after about 20 years.</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed or thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick lashes on the top and bottom of my lids</li>
            <li> I honestly think it feels really weird while I put it on and</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying before spending a lot on other products that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Every night I apply a little on the bald spot with the brush and rub it in with my finger, then I put a little more and use the tip of the brush to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I also use on my lashes each night and I like it because it helps then not cross each other even if I did sleep funny the night before</li>
            <li> Now, you can&#x27;t see the scar going through my eyebrow at all now, because the hairs above and below it cover it enough, which is saying a lot because it&#x27;s deep and pretty long in</li>
            <li> I also still have some bald spot on my eyebrows that don&#x27;t seem to grow as fast as the other parts of the brow.</li>
            <li> It actually works, almost have a full eyebrow grown in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> Now my eyebrows look evenly thick and my eyelashes grew a bit more center meters not an inch..</li>
            <li> a positive note, less lashes fell out when I removed my eye makeup at night.</li>
            <li> Also, I want to point out that when I say fill in, I mean I lightly dab it a couple of times with my eyebrow wax (E.L.F.), but only so that it blends it in with the rest and you can still see skin by it.</li>
            <li> Another goes vertically toward the T zone, but is still in the eyebrow hair (where it should be).&lt;br /&gt;So for like 17 years I&#x27;ve been walking around like a hot mess with my left eyebrow arched like a horizontal parentheses sign.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the thickness and even length of my eyelashes after the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> One day I finally decided that I was tired of how long it took to get ready to go out because I had to fill in and clean up my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are really thinned out halfway through, so it looks like I have half eyebrows</li>
            <li> /&gt;**To be clear, this did not fill in the scaring, HOWEVER it has made the hair around it long enough to cover the scar.</li>
            <li> It makes my mascara go on super smooth, and the clumping isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as when I dont use this.</li>
            <li> So, I plucked the outer brow off and did the other eye to match, thinking they could grow in at the same time and be normal again.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had never tweezed so thin, but hey, you live and learn right?</li>
            <li> Not really in anywhere useful and eventually the little stubs of hair stopped growing further.  </li>
            <li> I have sparse brows and haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth, but I think that might just be because my brows grow really slow to begin with!</li>
            <li> This sucks when you want to swim comes right off.</li>
            <li> On his other brow, I used a clear mascara.  </li>
            <li> A millimeter below that is also a horizontal scar that goes directly under the place where the other horizontal scar is.</li>
            <li> I noticed there is a young lady in one of the other review photos</li>
            <li> I saw a very very small improvement but nothing worth the hassle of remembering to use it every night</li>
            <li> I went about 2 years before finding this (with very little growth) and it has really transformed my brows.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if the product really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly sure how much this accelerates growth.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it really works.</li>
            <li> As usual, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I also use it on my brows, but I am not sure how much of a difference it has made.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Now I know a year sounds like a long time to see results, especially using it every day, but that all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far i notice that my bottom lashes are fuller and getting slightly longer.</li>
            <li> This may work for some, but it did nothing for my short, dry lashes.</li>
            <li> Then eventually i actually applied it and let it dry before shaping and filling in my brows.</li>
            <li> I had looked at that SmartBrow Eyebrow Filler stuff a while back but saw all the trouble people had with making it look natural.  </li>
            <li> This product does well to tame unruly brows, but I don&#x27;t see much new growth if any and no darkening.</li>
            <li> pretty ridiculous - think Pamela Anderson.</li>
            <li> It does cause a little morning eye redness, but it&#x27;s nothing that a glass of water doesn&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li> Let it dry before blinking or you can use a cardboard and fan your eyes open to dry the gel faster.</li>
            <li> I had a pierced brow YEARS ago (in the early 90s) and plucked it like crazy to keep the area clean.  </li>
            <li> I used this only for my eyebrows, as over time and constant abuse to my brows, I was left with little to no hair.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i cant enjoy the benefits as it burns and itches my eyes. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> only used this product on my eyelashes for a few days before it starting to cause my eyes to water constantly, so I had to stop using it on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With regular application there have been absolutely no results from this product.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my brows are overplucked and the hair long gone.  </li>
            <li> It also works on eyelashes although mine are naturally long</li>
            <li> I put it on my lashes as well for the hell of it even though I already have long lashes</li>
            <li> My lashes, while always on the long side, were losing thickness.  </li>
            <li> I went to my dentist and he told me how long my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long</li>
            <li> Each one has lasted me a really long time.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are insanely long.</li>
            <li> In the photos you can see the beginning of my brows have long brows growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this gel.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s looking for long lashes without pay expensives lash serum.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but had burned them a bit from smoking, &amp;#34;stupid wind&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it just takes it an extremely long time to work I will fix my review, but</li>
            <li> Used for  2 months, morning and evening with no clear improvement in lash and /or eyebrow growth.</li>
            <li> Definitely seeing some growth in terms of length, not super drastic but definitely getting a longer.</li>
            <li> I only kept the ring for less than a year, but the eyebrow never grew back</li>
            <li> I guess it just depends how much your eyebrows mean to you.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t dry up in tube.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers stated, I saw results (longer, fuller lashes) after only a couple of days of using it.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a week and it itched a little, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> wand looks like any other basic mascara wand.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to have to join the crowds of other reviewers who tell you this actually does work.</li>
            <li> But with very minor grooming they&#x27;re shaply, and on their way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started tweezing my eyebrows sophmore year of high school, by senior year I had hardly none at all.</li>
            <li> Let that dry too.</li>
            <li> but I have not had any problems with dry or itching or burning...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes a while to dry,</li>
            <li> Just apply it at night like mascara and let it dry before you bury your face in covers so it won&#x27;t wear off</li>
            <li> It stings and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> They are still not as thick, but I guess that comes with getting older.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product after reading all the positive reviews, but all that did was intensify my disappointment upon using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t accelerate one single eyelash or brow hair period.</li>
            <li> Usually during the day or if I&#x27;m going out i put this product on because its clear and dries</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s growing my eyelashes but not eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a month ago hoping it would help with the gaps in my eyebrows and am so far not satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> That may be due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to get a &#x27;thick&#x27; coat on my brows.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I fell victim to the 90s obsession with drawing in non-existent brows.  </li>
            <li> The only down side to the bottle is the info on it.</li>
            <li> They give you three vials, but I barely used half of one to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I did see a few other reviews saying the same thing about the blonde hairs when i bought this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Asian</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now been a month and a half and my eye brows are filling in and eye lashes are definitely filling in and longer.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re so black, (that&#x27;s my Asian side)</li>
            <li> If you do them at the same time, it will look like you have never heard of tweezers, much less wax, in your life.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered them, and they came in less than a week of ordering them.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and in the past years have seen hair loss in the eye lash and brow area as to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally long eyelashes, but they were falling out a bit, maybe due to stress.</li>
            <li> ; this is to make the skin that does not usually produce hair (at least not eyebrow hair) grow hair.</li>
            <li> so I can easily scoop the gel and put it directly on the base of my eyelashes and use the remaining bristles and swipe.</li>
            <li> The only downside is when a little gets into your eyes.</li>
            <li> The eyebrows especially, but also the lashes, although that took a little longer to notice.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the NYX brow powder and a tiny little angled brush from Cvs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little longer than a week.</li>
            <li> Too bad it dropped a couple more bucks since I bought it, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, even stupid home remedies that I found online.</li>
            <li> I know it may sound crazy to some people - that my eyebrows (eyEBROWS???)</li>
            <li> I have always had thinner eyebrows and eyelashes, and I have tried quite a few different products.  </li>
            <li> Why I expected it to work</li>
            <li> I was really careful not to put it in my eyes, But still ended up at the eye doctor getting antibiotic drops...</li>
            <li> So be careful not to get the gel in your eyes.       </li>
            <li> Tips: Be careful on applying this gel.</li>
            <li> It dried on my brows and left a flaky-like dander that I had to brush out - thus I am returning them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days of using this product</li>
            <li> it says the product come&#x27;s with pack of 3, but i recieved only one pack of one item, so 2 are missing</li>
            <li> no real results yet after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not a total waste.</li>
            <li> It did take about a week or two to notice the length, but only a few days to fell them plump up.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, no thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Hair will grow all over the brow area so be careful to wipe it off from everywhere except the brow line you want to regrow on.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like GolFroy, you can also use A mascara brush (Minus the mascara on it) and Vitamin E oil, or PURE/100%/Virgin Olive oil, to grow your lashes.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would do something, but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and for some reason, tried another brand a few months ago.</li>
            <li> when i apply it on my eyelash, i have to be so much careful to don&#x27;t get it in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to the eye line at the base of my lashes so it can be absorbed into the skin (and hair follicle) and have seen the same results as with Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li> What I really don&#x27;t like is having to fix false lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but the price was right, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> had lost eyebrows because of bad waxing and over plucking as many women have down, but thankfully, I found this product.  </li>
            <li> Remember, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I have done better just cleansing with virgin cold pressed coconut oil and using it as a moisturizer and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I wanted it to help mine GROW like other products I have purchased...</li>
            <li> I came across this one and was very skeptical that it would work based solely on the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended to other people who had lost eyebrows as well and</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , it is too petty and small to return it back, but I wished I didnot buy this.</li>
            <li> I use to use this on my brows to shape them, not sure if it actually grows the hairs though...    </li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll spend the money on the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Even my friend asked the other day if I had falsies on.</li>
            <li> I probably have to say it does not exactly grow your brows and make them fuller.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I apply morning and night.</li>
            <li> So I am always thinning the other one to match</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost, compared to other brands, I got THREE tubes of this strum.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but also was using other growth methods -</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had bushy black eyebrows with a weird bald batch right before the arch.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical when ordering, but I was desperate after my brows have been looking more and more sparse and pathetic.</li>
            <li> Be very careful about getting it into your eyes, because it stings like a mother if you do.</li>
            <li> the brush that comes with it, it&#x27;s very rough,</li>
            <li> I had to send my product back after using it only 2 days, I discovered that the bottom of 2 of the bottles I received were broken out at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed it is growing my short broken lashes back quite well.</li>
            <li> Despite having read all of the positive reviews, I was somewhat skeptical about ordering this.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the results of this product, but I was proven wrong and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My lashes on my left eye were hard to curl and would not keep the curl, so I went searching for a product for my lashes, and I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> Goes on too dark.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to see much difference without a coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are dark brown though.</li>
            <li> Well unfortunately, it didnt really do much for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth paying any money.  </li>
            <li> But it burns on your eye, Like to the point I threw mine away, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I use it every day on both upper and lower lashes, and have noticed at least a doubling of lenght and thickness.</li>
            <li> After using this product.. slowly started to grow in.. about a month later..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have definitely seen results in that area slowly growing out...</li>
            <li> As time went on, my left one grew in, but my right one is still a little bald, not as bad as before</li>
            <li> In a few days, I noticed that my lashes were a little longer and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> There may be slight improvement in my lash length, hard to say, but definitely not in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> However, it does work well to keep eyebrows neat and in place without looking caked down or gooey.</li>
            <li> matter how this goes down,  I&#x27;m seeing hair</li>
            <li> But of course, after religiously using it for a few weeks, there was no difference whatsoever with my eyelashes or eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll experiment with using less and hope that it will not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost a month and a half</li>
            <li> I would say my brows are slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> It seems to darken my lashes and brows slightly.</li>
            <li> and it appears to be working slightly.</li>
            <li> I bought this Ardell Brow  Growth over a year ago as my eyebrows had stopped grown half way across my Eye.  </li>
            <li> My acne has since cleared up, but unfortunately, has left me with only half of my eyebrow on both sides.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like eyebrow gel, but slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item at CVS Pharmacy..then they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> My lashes seem longer and thicker already and it has been a week and half.</li>
            <li> Previous to using this my eyebrows had hair</li>
            <li> and I have seen slight improvement.</li>
            <li> Got the 3 pack, ended up giving one to my sister and throwing half of another one out.</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s the lashes in the center of the eye would just fall out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mess if not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided to stop plucking as soon as the trip was over, and boy were those first weeks awkward.</li>
            <li> But it does make your lashes thick and long.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t work or its extremely slow slow slow.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products!</li>
            <li> It leaves a tight coat when it dries, so I&#x27;ll wear it to bed or under my makeup in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i mean it&#x27;s not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I owe at least one third, if not more, of my lashes&#x27; length to this</li>
            <li> and they stay a little longer</li>
            <li> i had use this product for 2 moths and i notice just a little bit result on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> but they also seem a little fuller.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyebrows a little shiny</li>
            <li> I am 45 and have noticed my lashes have thinned and gotten a little shorter as the years have passed, so I wanted to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month</li>
            <li> then I got lazy and started using it every other night, sometimes three times a week</li>
            <li> I lost a little money</li>
            <li> I lost a little money</li>
            <li> I started filling them in thicker but the hair still wasn&#x27;t there which made getting the right shape nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I applied every night before bed, even when I woke up and a few little hairs popped up.</li>
            <li> Lashes are fuller and longer after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It made my eyebrows grow in within just a few times of using it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and its not working..</li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> So I applied it liberally to my eyebrows twice a day, and noticed some regrowth within a few days.</li>
            <li> I wasted my time and money for this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it got me through a truly miserable time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks now, the bristles irritate my brow area when applying it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I put this product religiously on everyday for about 3 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hairs can sometimes look messy and wavy.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I noticed my lashes looked healthier, after about 2 weeks they were getting longer, and after about 2 months they were growing in thicker.</li>
            <li> but since I used to pluck my eyebrows too thinly because that was the only way you couldn&#x27;t see the bald spot.</li>
            <li> I also tried Eyebrows Accelerator from Green Touch Beauty.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for like a year.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve asked) once its dried.</li>
            <li> I started to see results after a few days.</li>
            <li> I tried it for growth on my lashes and brows, for a few weeks but didnt notice any</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t thicken up your lashes the way something like Latisse (which I used for a few months)</li>
            <li> Tried for a few weeks didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> Although the liquid didn&#x27;t leak out, it had dried inside the tube.</li>
            <li> Although the liquid didn&#x27;t leak out, it had dried inside the tube.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes were very short and thin.  </li>
            <li> I have worn extensions before and now see them as a waste of money....</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few said it didn&#x27;t, which made me a bit scared to spend my money on it.</li>
            <li> These hepled grow my lashes just a bit but after a few months, these started to stink (like a smelly shoe).</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my lashes are short and thin.</li>
            <li> If I could sue both \\&quot;Beverly Hills 90210\\&quot; and Drew Barrymore for influencing me to destroy my then-perfect brows, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few weeks</li>
            <li> I suffer from thin eyelashes that occasionally fall out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hair earned money on this junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to pluck a few out.  </li>
            <li> and before I got to the last tube, I had at least 50% THICK re-growth.</li>
            <li> Growth accelerator is not accurate imo.</li>
            <li> I had some false eyelashes put on at a salon that were supposed to last for up to a month.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a little over a week and can see dramatic changes.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for 3 and a half weeks, IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> All the other hair growth stuff would have been too expensive, especially if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> change.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to useing plain Castor Oil on my eyebrows and brished in to my lashes at night, and have noticed a difference in growth with that.</li>
            <li> Noticed a dramatic difference, especially on brows, and my husband did as well.</li>
            <li> I mean, when you look in the mirror and one side of your face doesn&#x27;t look close to matching up with the other</li>
            <li> it was pretty bad</li>
            <li> The scar just under that is pretty noticeable now, but not in a bad way</li>
            <li> They got so thick and so dark.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick, dark eyebrows and</li>
            <li> And finally, they got to the point in which they smelled so bad, I threw them away and began simply using olive oil to grow my eyebrows and eyelashes everynight.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for approximately 6 weeks and saw no new hair growth or lengthening of already existing brow and lash hairs.</li>
            <li> Dries a little hard, but makes my eyebrows look neat and sculpted.</li>
            <li> They made that change a little to late in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found very little information, so I promised myself I&#x27;d write a review after I tried it for MY brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw eyelash growth within a few days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product 1-2 times a day for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I wanna believe it does, even to a small extent, but i am not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not, But gave me a eye infection after a week of using.</li>
            <li> And no more eyelash fall off when I wash my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the past two months and there has been no change in my eyelashes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people are giving this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> There were small gaps on my lash line ever since.  </li>
            <li> So not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of expensive brow &amp; lash accelerators in the past that have worked well but were too expensive to use consistently.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, just as some reviewers stated, I woke up with red, irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li> No better than L&#x27;oreal lash serum which I&#x27;ve also used.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and still perfection!</li>
            <li> Plus, the price is so low you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting my brows tinted and waxed, so hopefully the blonde hairs will take the tint, otherwise this product will end up having been useless.</li>
            <li> Im really not sure that this does anything.  </li>
            <li> By the way you have to use it everyday for at least one month to see results.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I take a small amount on my finger and run it along my lash line then use the wand to coat the lashes.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but I usually do something else while I wait.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work with me comparing to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not able to curl them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a small difference but again, I think that may be because of the years difference in brow removal and shaping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I put a small amount in the morning and put a thicker two layer amount on at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even what I&#x27;m supposed to do</li>
            <li> I usually apply it 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many of these lash builders and this is probably the worst performer  yet.</li>
            <li> and my brows have made an unbelievable comeback.</li>
            <li> not sure how it would be alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> If you have short or thin lashes...try it!</li>
            <li> Finally, when I was sick of being told that my eyebrows are too thin, you look like you draw them with eyeliner like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Due to over-plucking in the past, I&#x27;ve noticed how thin my brows were getting and therefore wanted a solution.  </li>
            <li> Even when younger, they were very thin.</li>
            <li> i have very thin Asian eyelashes</li>
            <li> Some of the less deeper parts of the scars did grow hair though!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product mainly for my eyebrows, over the years I have over tweezed and am sick of having to fill my brows in all of the time.</li>
            <li> I asked him if he sees any difference in his brows, and he was shocked to see a definite difference in one over the other.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick eyebrows but wanted a product that would help fill in some small sparse spots in my brows.</li>
            <li> but I always had long eyelashes (with mascara) and it looks really weird when you have no lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the rave reviews, I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference</li>
            <li> I buy hundreds of items from Amazon every year but hardly post reviews.</li>
            <li> has a masacara wand, hard to apply to brows..</li>
            <li> hard to tell if any serum is getting onto brows...</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to brush stuff on hair</li>
            <li> When I found this product a month ago, I looked hard for thorough reviews on use of this product for eyebrow regrowth.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time remembering to do things at night, so instead I just put this on as I am doing my make up each morning.</li>
            <li> This product is not effective.</li>
            <li> Negative:</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s nothing negative</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get it into your eyes, it sucks.</li>
            <li> I applied this goo at least once a day and sometimes twice a day until I finished the tube.</li>
            <li> I use the product at least once, and hopefully twice a day.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll at least use it until it runs out.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are thick</li>
            <li> This product is like a thick gel that leaves your eyelashes brittle.</li>
            <li> It has been a month since I bought it, and is really slow, as the reviews said it.</li>
            <li> But, as thick as this makes your lashes you will soon no longer need mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate mascara and will avoid using it unless I absolutely have to for parties, weddings, etc.</li>
            <li> However, for eyebrows, you are going to have slow results.</li>
            <li> I have had one eyebrow that seems to not grow in as thick as they were when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and have already seen a dramatic difference in my brows.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean I quit using mascara</li>
            <li> have told several people about this product, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> WELL it works, I had some missing eyelashes in the bottom eyelid and they grew, my eyelashes are somewhat longer and thicker nothing to dramatic though</li>
            <li> The reason, I decided to order this item was because it has castor oil as the main ingredient without that annoying sticky feel</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative and bought into your advertising.  </li>
            <li> seriously suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes are beginning to look slightly ridiculous, but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> so I use an old eyeliner brush to get the gel onto the base of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> (duh!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process, but after a month I could tell immediately that my lashes had gotten longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> product makes your lashes very thick.</li>
            <li> but I guess it does; just at a very slow process it moves at.</li>
            <li> My eye brows have always been thin..</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are sparse and thin 😩</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were pencil thin.</li>
            <li> I tried this for approximately 3-4 weeks, and did not see any growth or improvement.</li>
            <li> I noticed my lash became thin after using this product.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit worried this product might be irritating</li>
            <li> She used it for about a month before she got tired of doing it every night.</li>
            <li> Like when you apply them to your lashes, it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> This worked to fill in some of my eyebrows after about 6 weeks but was too irritating to use on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s, so for 20+ years I have been keeping my eyebrows in the thin 90&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using for approximately 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Yeah dude it was mad tight  </li>
            <li> I also gave one to my sister and she is seeing dramatic results on her thinly sparse eyebrows within a week.</li>
            <li> Very Bad Product .this should be Red flagged !!!!!</li>
            <li> have continued to use it on my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m sorry to say I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for the ladies that it does not work on, for me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Im terrible about using it on a regular basis, but I still notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it since, and unfortunately bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Sad to say it too because I had hopes for this to help my thinning eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Ill cycle using it, on and off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes look fake, but nothing will unless you get extensions.</li>
            <li> weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, so comparing my eyebrows now to how they looked a year ago is scary.</li>
            <li> something that wrong with me.</li>
            <li> Did notice both are noticeably softer but that&#x27;s all sadly</li>
            <li> Alas!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that this would give you thicker lashes, but you&#x27;d be wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say........</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I just re-ordered this again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Extremely useless.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep my eyebrows on in the water, and I realized how rediculous it was to pluck eyebrows off to draw fake ones on every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows, I was hoping for them to grow</li>
            <li> People who say this doesn&#x27;t work prob have very thin sparse lashes to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying having bad eyebrows ruined my life because that would be dumb, but it did lower my confidence and make me feel ehk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say negative about Ardell is don&#x27;t get this in your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews because I am trying desperately to regrow the ends of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> U won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> and there is no hair - I know, weird!)</li>
            <li> I must confess, I was actually skeptical about using this product, but hey, 3 for a price of 1!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this product would work for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> (made me look ridiculous) and whoa!!!</li>
            <li> but it burned really bad and made my eyelids swollen.</li>
            <li> could make me feel bad about myself, but it does make sense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but for all of you who want to buy this, beware that it does burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> , you feel ugly.</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m shocked and overjoyed is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT</li>
            <li> Order it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I know, it&#x27;s crazy, and my parents were NOT having it!)</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> This stuff works and it&#x27;s not that expensive!!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this product would work, but I was wrong!!  </li>
            <li> The reason I took off one star is because the formula sometimes irritates my eye when I start applying it too close to the base of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for my mascara to protect and build my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I hate they don&#x27;t carry it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> How does stoking your lashes affect growth that starts at the base?</li>
            <li> I had very bad acne once upon a time and would break out underneath my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed because I was hoping it would help!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s insane.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No noticeable difference in my brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product about 5 times already and it&#x27;s totally worth the money! As a skeptic I thought since it was so cheap price wise that the product was as well, and boy was I wrong! So glad I took the chance! I use it for both eyebrows and eyelashes but I do use it more for my eyebrows since I already have long eyelashes. My eyebrows are thick but I have a lot of thinning spaces near my arch which I tweezers alot. Now my eyebrows look evenly thick and my eyelashes grew a bit more center meters not an inch.. but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t use it on my eyelashes as much.</li>
            <li> I have always had thinner eyebrows and eyelashes, and I have tried quite a few different products.  The Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator had a lot of good reviews so I figured I would try another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product on my eyelashes for a few days before it starting to cause my eyes to water constantly, so I had to stop using it on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to use it on my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m sorry to say I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first review that I&#x27;ve written that gives the product 5 stars. I saw eyelash growth within a few days! Great product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick eyebrows but wanted a product that would help fill in some small sparse spots in my brows. I tried this product for approximately 6 weeks and saw no new hair growth or lengthening of already existing brow and lash hairs. The product didn&#x27;t work for me as a brow and lash growth accelerator but it does do a nice job as a simple brow gel, one for keeping your brow hairs in place. At the inexpensive price that it&#x27;s being offered for here it&#x27;s a good buy but only as a clear brow gel groomer, not something that will make your brows and lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li> To me, it was definitely worth the buy! Such a good deal for the price too! It&#x27;s been two months that I&#x27;ve used it and my eywbrows are not only getting thicker but the shape is amazing!</li>
            <li> NOTICED A THICKER APPERANCE OF EYEBROW HAIRS AND SOME NEW GROWTH! REALLY LIKE THIS APPLY 2X&#x27;S A DAY.</li>
            <li> worth it would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the results of this product, but I was proven wrong and I LOVE it! I gave a tube to my mother and a friend. I would recommend this to any man or woman.</li>
            <li> This product is not effective. I did not see any improvement in either my lashes or brows, even after after using the entire tube. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Really works and good product! Try this. U won&#x27;t be sorry! I&#x27;ve been using for a 3 weeks and I can see real results.</li>
            <li> Been using this for two weeks but haven&#x27;t seen a major difference. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks, as some of the other reviews stated it may take longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product 1-2 times a day for the past 3 weeks and I am not sure if the product really works. I wanna believe it does, even to a small extent, but i am not sure. Maybe more time is needed, but i expected to see some change after more than a couple of weeks..</li>
            <li> First of all my eyelashes are thinning and it takes for ever for them to grow back as I have gotten older.  This product is like a thick gel that leaves your eyelashes brittle. As you know brittle lashes tend to break and/or fall out.  Of course, I brought a pack of three and I was not impressed or thrilled with this product.  Oh well back to the search.</li>
            <li> Works! Lashes are fuller and longer after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews, sadly I have been using it for over 2 weeks now with no change.</li>
            <li> does not work at all would love a refund</li>
            <li> Great item! Not sure if it helps growth but it almost works like a clear mascara!</li>
            <li> as far as i can tell this product doesn&#x27;t do anything. i was using revitabrow and it made an amazing difference in my eyebrows. i saw this one was much cheaper and had some good reviews so thought i&#x27;d try it. after a couple of months, nearly all the fuller growth i had is gone.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and have already seen a dramatic difference in my brows. Not so much in my lashes, but that&#x27;s not really want I wanted it for.&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try out the cheapest option before a more expensive one, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a week on my brows and lashes. There may be slight improvement in my lash length, hard to say, but definitely not in my eyebrows.  I will update with a positive reivew if, in time, i have more growth.  So far, not working for me.</li>
            <li> My eye brows have always been thin..&amp; I&#x27;ve always had to fill in my eye brows..well after from using this a couple times I could see a difference. The bottom one was from a few weeks ago &amp;  the top one is from tonight. This product worked for me! &amp;&amp; I lost it! It also has worked on my eye lashes dramatically but you can&#x27;t really see that because that growth is blonde on the ends!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes stuff grow, but it helps it be more healthy and they stay a little longer is how I feel. Nice to set eyebrows too! I will keep using but I also use generic Latise, now that makes a difference for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle.....works great!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything.. After using it for months... I had 3 of them.. and used them every day... but nothing.</li>
            <li> Works great. Its been two months and my eyebrows look fuller</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of lash and brow growth accelerators and honestly, I did not expect this to work any better than the other very pricey over-the-counter brands. I&#x27;ve never tried the prescription brand because that is not covered by insurance and it&#x27;s around $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been VERY pleasantly surprised and pleased with the results of this product, especially for the price. I have naturally long eyelashes, but they were falling out a bit, maybe due to stress. And I had boo-boo&#x27;d and overplucked my brows, and wanted them to fill in. Well, not only have the sparse brow areas filled in, but my eyelashes are even a bit longer than they were before. They actually bump into my sunglasses, unless I curl them. Then they reach the underside of my eyebrows, even though I rarely use mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I cannot guarantee you will have the same results, but this products works very well for me and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> i had use this product for 2 moths and i notice just a little bit result on my eyelashes but my eye brown got more darker.  i was happy but also dissapointed 2.And also i notice that it affect my vision, so i stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my eyebrows grow in within just a few times of using it.  Especially where they wouldn&#x27;t grow in properly before.  I will buy this again.I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Of all accelerators, my sister and I have had the best results with this product.  We have an inherited gap in our eyebrows (thanks Mom!) which this product has successfully filled! Eyelashes are already long but helped them to grow LONGER and more volume. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the thickness and even length of my eyelashes after the first few applications.  This was a pleasant surprise since I thought it would take a couple of weeks to start noticing a difference.  The reason I took off one star is because the formula sometimes irritates my eye when I start applying it too close to the base of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> No good. I used it twice a day consistently for 4 months and had virtually no results. I had much better luck with plain ol&#x27; vaseline. You get what you pay for...Save your money!</li>
            <li> works on eyelashes pretty well but not eyebrows</li>
            <li> Goes on too dark. Can&#x27;t get a lighter color.</li>
            <li> Why I expected it to work I don&#x27;t know! But of course, after religiously using it for a few weeks, there was no difference whatsoever with my eyelashes or eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not, But gave me a eye infection after a week of using. I was really careful not to put it in my eyes, But still ended up at the eye doctor getting antibiotic drops...</li>
            <li> Well... I should have know when I got THREE for such a low price that this wouldn&#x27;t be the best stuff in the world...but one can hope, right? I was praying it was a serum, but no...it&#x27;s a product with another doggone spoolie! Leave on all night after cleansing, and it&#x27;s supposed to enhance your brows and lashes. The packaging tells a wee bit different story than the online ad! Frankly, I have done better just cleansing with virgin cold pressed coconut oil and using it as a moisturizer and conditioner! Maybe this works for some people...  The title of the product says GROWTH...but the actual product packaging states it ENHANCES your lashes and brows...NOT that it will help them grow. Quite a difference!!! It says it conditions and helps reduce breakage, etc.  I wanted it to help mine GROW like other products I have purchased...any oil or conditioner can do the former! All I can say is buyer beware...if you want a lash and brow CONDITIONER, this is one. If you want a GROWTH FORMULA for your brows and lashes, this is NOT one!</li>
            <li> Positive: THICKER AND DARKER EYEBROWS plus FULLER AND STRONGER EYELASHES. I noticed the difference after about 3-4 days of consistent application before bedtime. I&#x27;m seeing more eyelashes start to fill in the sparse spots. And no more eyelash fall off when I wash my face in the morning. My husband noticed the big difference on my eyebrows. They got so thick and so dark. I used to put eyeliner on my brows before but now I don&#x27;t need to. And when I put mascara now, my eyelashes look very thick and beautiful.   Negative: Sticky gel on my eyes when I wake up and Dandruff Looking on my eyebrows. (But easily washes off with soap and water.) It burns when the gel gets in your eyes. So be careful not to get the gel in your eyes.       Tips: Be careful on applying this gel. Let it dry before blinking or you can use a cardboard and fan your eyes open to dry the gel faster. I don&#x27;t like the brush, so I cut the bristles short just on the tip of the wand so I can easily scoop the gel and put it directly on the base of my eyelashes and use the remaining bristles and swipe. I find that an effective way to get good results.  Summary: I used to buy this at RiteAid for $4.50 each and I&#x27;m glad I can get it Amazon for a cheaper price. With consistency and patience, this works. I&#x27;m happy that it worked for me and I enjoy the benefits and can afford the price. I love this product. I will keep buying :)</li>
            <li> I buy hundreds of items from Amazon every year but hardly post reviews. Now I have straggly, scanty eyelashes and eyebrows. I have to use a liner most of the time. I don&#x27;t really mind that. What I really don&#x27;t like is having to fix false lashes all the time. I never can get the hang of putting stick ons so i have to go to the salon all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this for a week. I use it morning and night,(at times in between) and I already see a difference in my eyelashes. They have filled in a bit. You might think a week is too short. Not for me, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about my lashes and check them several times a day. A visible change in one week is nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update after a month of using this product.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle but this stuff sure does help. I like this product and it seems to thicken lashes and brows. The only downside is when a little gets into your eyes. It burns and lingers for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  for 2 weeks and I have seen no results. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3-pack after reading all the great reviews about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the past two months and there has been no change in my eyelashes whatsoever. Maybe I can sell the remaining two packs to the next person who falls for it like I did!</li>
            <li> Not sure why people are giving this product 5 stars.  The growth is not substantial.  To see if Ardell really works, I put the product on my right eyebrow and right eyelashes for a month and a half.   Eyelashes: When I was in High School, I was curling my lashes and accidentally pulled out some eyelashes on my right eye (hey, I was a newbie).  There were small gaps on my lash line ever since.  Results: Now my right eyelashes match my left!  Ardell filled in those gaps!  Eyebrows: Regarding the eyebrow growth, I was looking for density.  I like my eyebrow shape, they&#x27;re just too sparse.  Results: I didn&#x27;t see any difference between my left eyebrow and right eyebrow.  That&#x27;s why I gave this 3 stars.  I think the product just restores lost hairs from \\&quot;over-tweezing,\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think it produces more growth for \\&quot;thinning brows\\&quot; (like the product description says).</li>
            <li> I see the result in a week, my lashes grow faster and longer than it used to be. I would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product.  It dried on my brows and left a flaky-like dander that I had to brush out - thus I am returning them.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for my mascara to protect and build my eyelashes. It is easily removed when you want to take it off, great stuff. P.S. If you do get some in your eye, once you have put it on, it feels scratchy for a minute or two, like a piece of lint or dust would.</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my sensitive eyes. My boyfriend even noticed how much longer and fuller my eyelashes are now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Although, I do wish the hairs on the outer part (Where I have a gap and there is no hair - I know, weird!) were thinker and blacker!</li>
            <li> With regular application there have been absolutely no results from this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My lashes grow very quickly when I use this. I have been using this for years. I hate they don&#x27;t carry it in the stores anymore. I have to order it from amazon. I&#x27;m sorry for the ladies that it does not work on, for me it&#x27;s the BOMB!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and planned on keeping one for myself.  I only received 1 and it says it comes in a pack of 3.  So I gave that one away.  So not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for one week (and I&#x27;m still using it) and already I started seeing growth real fast! When using it on your eyelash compared to your eyebrows the growth is a bit faster, but nevertheless it still is working! Now I have longer eyelashes and thicker eyebrows. This stuff works and it&#x27;s not that expensive!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually causes lash growth, but it sure does make a good mascara primer.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for this first time based on its reviews on amazon. All I can say is that this product really is amazing. I have received numerous complements with regards to the length of my eyelashes. So far I have seen results in about 2 weeks. It has done a great job lengthening my eyelashes. My eyebrows still do not appear to be filling in at the thinning spots but I am hopeful with time I will see results as I have with my eyelashes. I love this product and really recommend it. The price is also great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of expensive brow &amp; lash accelerators in the past that have worked well but were too expensive to use consistently.  I came across this one and was very skeptical that it would work based solely on the cheap price. However, I decided to give it a try because it had so many positive reviews. Hey, if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out much money. To my surprise - it works!  As some other reviewers stated, I saw results (longer, fuller lashes) after only a couple of days of using it.  Unfortunately, just as some reviewers stated, I woke up with red, irritated eyes.  To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I didn&#x27;t use it for a night, and my eyes were fine the next day.  I&#x27;ll experiment with using less and hope that it will not irritate my eyes. It would be great to continue to use this one since it&#x27;s so affordable.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This worked for me  well enough.  No better than L&#x27;oreal lash serum which I&#x27;ve also used. The price was pretty low when I bought it.  They do burn my eyes though, I did not have that is issue with the the L&#x27;oreal serum. It does go on clear which is a plus but as I said they burn my eyes. So I will finish my tube but this is not for me.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this, and I started noticing results almost immediately! I don&#x27;t quite look like a cocker spaniel yet, but my lashes are noticeably longer, thicker, and seemed to have multiplied! Great product!     I took the suggestion of another and dab a few dots on the top of my eyelids and then rub it in along the lash line. Then I use it as I would regular mascara. I apply it in both the morning and night.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows did grow, but depending on the individual, the rate of growth and the amount of growth will vary.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a change. I&#x27;ve been using this for three months bought a pack of three and nothing.</li>
            <li> I finally started using this product and now I have nice long lashes. I recommend this product to family and friends all the time now. I am glad I got three to share with my sister. She loved it too.</li>
            <li> It works if you faithfully use it every night.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost a month and a half and I can definitely notice a difference in my eyebrows. I have also used it for my eye lashes and I can tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the four stars is because it really didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes grow as long and fast as my eyebrows. I also still have some bald spot on my eyebrows that don&#x27;t seem to grow as fast as the other parts of the brow. I went from barely any hair to a lot more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it. It is such an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Asian so my lashes are short and I saw a difference in my lower lashes in the first week!  I&#x27;ve been using Peter Thomas Roth LTDF for so I already had some results on my upper lashes with, and I think this has helped though I must confess I don&#x27;t use it so faithfully.  Had no issues with it stinging - worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks, seems like I do have more lashes already.  So far, so good with this product.  Will order more when i need to.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I over-plucked my eyebrows and wanted them back ASAP. Two weeks using this product and it was like my eyebrows came back bushier than ever. I was able to get them professionally done and back to how they used to be, before I messed them up! They give you three vials, but I barely used half of one to get the job done! I have no clue how it works on eyelashes, but it worked like a charm for me on my brows!</li>
            <li> so i got this product for a little more than a week now. i use at night and in the morning also on days i dont wear make-up. i use it on top lash and bottom lashes. so far i notice that my bottom lashes are fuller and getting slightly longer. as for my top lashes, i cant really tell if they are longer yet but they also seem a little fuller. but like i said just been using this product for more than a week. im sure the results will be better once i use up the product. i will sure be back to review on the results then.</li>
            <li> Did not see a fast growth as stated...</li>
            <li> MM.. It has been a month since I bought it, and is really slow, as the reviews said it. Is cheaop tho.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in my eyebrows.  It does burn the bottom eyelid if it get in your eye.  I think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Where would I be without this stuff?  I know!  Still filling in my brows with mascara!  Well, guess what?  It took about six months, but I was able to stop filling in my eyebrows with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lost eyebrows because of bad waxing and over plucking as many women have down, but thankfully, I found this product.  Regarding the loss of eyebrows, this was for over a decade.  One day I finally decided that I was tired of how long it took to get ready to go out because I had to fill in and clean up my eyebrows.  So I started researching products and this one was cheap and had decent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using in January of 2012.  By July/August of 2012, I saw so much improvement that I didn&#x27;t have to fill in (though I still chose to).  By the one year mark, January 2013, I was no longer filling in at all, but still receiving compliments from people.  I love it!  I&#x27;ve recommended to other people who had lost eyebrows as well and all report the same thing...improvement in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I think for those of us that have lost eyebrows, it is a product that you have to use consistently and possibly for life.  I&#x27;m still not at the thickness that I would like, but I continue to apply and am confident that these eyebrows will one day be back to their childhood bushiness.  Will recommend and also repurchased myself.  With the three pack, it literally lasts forever, maybe a little more than a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and its not working.. I have used a more expensive one in the past and that one worked great. Ladies if you want longer lashes you might want to just spend the extra money..</li>
            <li> I had to send my product back after using it only 2 days, I discovered that the bottom of 2 of the bottles I received were broken out at the bottom.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I was to use this for color as well.  I&#x27;m getting a replacement order and will be better able to answer the questions when I receive the replacement.</li>
            <li> I am using it with Rapid lash and my lashes are longer and much thicker than before. I know Rapid lash is working for sure. All I can say negative about Ardell is don&#x27;t get this in your eyes!!! This really burns. Do not use too much and do not use on the bottom lashes. It finds it&#x27;s way into eyes. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;But, I will continue using this. It makes my lashes feel really good.&lt;br /&gt;Edit; 4/12/2012&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your lashes very thick. It helps with the growth of your lashes and the best way I FOUND to use this product is....&lt;br /&gt;I put the first coat of Ardell on my lashes and let it dry. About a minute. Then I apply a second coat and make sure you get it on like you would mascara. Let that dry too. Wait a few minutes and it you use a eyelash curler use it now then use your mascara over it. But, as thick as this makes your lashes you will soon no longer need mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/11/2012- I have found I can&#x27;t live without this now. I sometimes put this on (2 coats) and curl them and don&#x27;t even need mascara. I love this stuff!! That doesn&#x27;t mean I quit using mascara, it&#x27;s only when I am not going out. But it does make your lashes thick and long.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! This does nothing to thicken the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2.5 weeks and ot works!! My friends notice, my shadow of my lashes are even longer, and when I put my head in my arms on a.desk I feel my lashes on my arms like never before. Miracle in a vile!</li>
            <li> Great! Its helped my lashes and brows get thicker!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price but love this. My lashes are significantly longer and fuller. I got my eyeliner tattooed so I wanted to stop using mascara as well. This did the trick. I will be a repeat customer. You get 3 which is really awesome. I considered getting a prescription from my doctor but that is 125.00 a month. Now I wouldn&#x27;t even consider going with a different product. I have been using this for a few months and still perfection!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Ardell Brow and Eyelash Serum in packs of 3 twice now.  I&#x27;m on my 5th tube with one left and I will be reordering then.  Several times as I have gotten older, I have lost most of my eyelashes on both eyes.  Usually it&#x27;s the lashes in the center of the eye would just fall out.  I still don&#x27;t know why but I always had long eyelashes (with mascara) and it looks really weird when you have no lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff 7 or 8 months ago and it started regrowing my lashes almost immediately.  I have used it continuously and have never had my lashes fall out again.  I use it about every night and several times a week in the morning before work I use it in place of mascara.  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL stuff!!  I recommend this to anyone that has had their eyelashes fall out.  You have to keep it out of your eyes of course, it will irritate the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing negative I can say about the lash part of this serum.  The price is heaven sent also for a pack of 3 and they last a long time.  I have not noticed any growth in my eyebrow area.  The ends of my brows are overplucked and the hair long gone.  I use this serum about 5 times a week on my brows (not as religious with it as I am with my eyelashes) and have not noticed regrowth on brows.  I bought it for my eyelashes mainly so I am still completely satisfied, happy with my eyelashes and will continue to buy this product!  :)</li>
            <li> It took some time and dedication but this truly helped my brows grow back!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days of using this product and I can already see growth on the eyebrows. I am so happy about this. As for the eyelashes, that still remains to be seen at this stage but I will update the progress at a later date.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but the price was right, so I gave it a try. I have been applying it to my eyebrows and eyelashes once daily for about a month. My lashes and brows are blonde so it&#x27;s difficult to see much difference without a coat of mascara. Today when I brushed on mascara I truly saw a difference in the length of my lashes. I would say my brows are slightly fuller. It seems to darken my lashes and brows slightly. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Not that effective. Used for  2 months, morning and evening with no clear improvement in lash and /or eyebrow growth.</li>
            <li> My lashes seem longer but not fuller. I am satisfied with the product. I want the lashes to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to give this a real try, to see if it works to grow lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness.  I tried it just a couple of times, but it really irritates my eyes and makes them water continuously until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Almost a month in and so far it&#x27;s not doing much. I&#x27;ll keep using it though. Hopefully something will happen...</li>
            <li> Yay, my brows are finally growing back.  This stuff really works.  Goes on clear and I have seen noticeable results just after a week.  I would definitely recommend, great product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months. It&#x27;s very similar to the results I got with Loreal&#x27;s product, but this is much cheaper! I use it to coat my lashes before mascara. It keeps my lashes from drying out and breaking off. So the lashes you have look healthier, but I don&#x27;t think it makes new ones grow in. Not for me anyway. But it is a great lash conditioner and at a great price. I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m also using this with RapidLash (as another reviewer wrote) and between the 2 products, I have LONG, healthy lashes!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but there were a lot of good reviews so I decided to give it a try. I had overplucked my eyebrows and was looking pretty ridiculous - think Pamela Anderson. So I applied it liberally to my eyebrows twice a day, and noticed some regrowth within a few days. 2 weeks later, I have turned into this hairy gorilla beast thing - it&#x27;s great! Now I can go get my brows shaped properly and leave the upkeep to the professionals. I also used it on my lashes, even though they don&#x27;t really need it, and I have to say it made them noticeably longer and thicker. Be very careful about getting it into your eyes, because it stings like a mother if you do. I would recommend this purchase both for brows and lashes. Plus, the price is so low you can&#x27;t really go wrong. Too bad it dropped a couple more bucks since I bought it, but c&#x27;est la vie!</li>
            <li> So I am very happy with my order . I ordered it and it came 3 days later . So far I have only tried it on my eyebrows so I cannot yet speak for my eyelashes yet . But for my eyebrows it&#x27;s working fantastically . I read on some reviews that it&#x27;s suppose to take two weeks to work but I put it on the day I received it in the mail and a day or two later, my eyebrows grew in the spots where it&#x27;s thinning which is at the end . I didn&#x27;t put a lot on there but I do use it 3 times a day (1 time in the morning, 1 time at noon, then 1 time at night) . Yes, I know it&#x27;s more than the directions say which is only at night but it&#x27;s working haha that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m happy about (hopefully no negative effects happen from it) . My eyebrows are sparse and thin 😩 So I&#x27;m happy with the growth . Will use on my eyelashes next to see what improvement I can get .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week.  Lest you are mistaken this is not Latisse.  It is a conditioner for your lashes, not a growth serum.  If you want a growth serum you need to go to a doctor to get an RX.  But as a conditioner it is doing a great job so far.</li>
            <li> I wasted my time and money for this product. it doesnot work. ended up throwing it away. it should have been taken out. I don&#x27;t have time to follow up w/ this, it is too petty and small to return it back, but I wished I didnot buy this.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. Now I&#x27;m not too sure if it has actually contributed to my eyebrows growing. I&#x27;m growing them out and I&#x27;ve been putting coconut oil on them every night religiously. Usually during the day or if I&#x27;m going out i put this product on because its clear and dries so I&#x27;m not walking around with greasy brows. However before i started using the coconut oil I was using this product, and I noticed I have a lot more light blonde hairs around my brows. My eyebrows are dark brown though. I did see a few other reviews saying the same thing about the blonde hairs when i bought this. I think this product definitely has to do with the blonde hairs. I plan on getting my brows tinted and waxed, so hopefully the blonde hairs will take the tint, otherwise this product will end up having been useless.</li>
            <li> This product really hasn&#x27;t done what they said it would do.  Very disappointed!  Have been using for four weeks and there has been no change.</li>
            <li> Im really not sure that this does anything.  Used it for weeks and saw no measurable results. I used to full tubs of it and really couldn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it for brows and it works! I have used so many brow growth serum including all the expensive kinds and only Ardell works for me. I also gave one to my sister and she is seeing dramatic results on her thinly sparse eyebrows within a week. I have been using ardell many times and it always does what it says. I&#x27;m so satisfied with the quality. Will never go without!</li>
            <li> I am still using this so i cant give my whole review seems to be working. I will right another review when i am finished using it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I wake up with my eyes stinging at times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this makes my lashes or brows grow at all, but I love it because it combs my eyebrows very nicely. I use it as brow gel &amp; it makes my brows look perfectly combed.</li>
            <li> it really seem to have improved the strength of my lashes which allows them to grow longer</li>
            <li> I made the HUGE mistake of over tweezing my eyebrows many months ago. While I wanted them to grow back in with a shape, I wanted to have nice natural (not completely penciled in) brows.  Every morning I did add some brown pencil and then with this product I blended it in. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Now that several months have gone by I&#x27;m very happy with my brows and I continue to lightly pencil and apply this accelerator. I also learned how to correctly tweeze thanks to YouTube. Honestly, it got me through a truly miserable time and I will definitely continue to buy this product especially since the price is right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks now, the bristles irritate my brow area when applying it. &amp; no matter what can&#x27;t seem to get a whole lot of the serum on. I use my fingers and squeeze the bristles to get a good amount off &amp; apply with my fingers. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I have very thin eyebrows, I was hoping for them to grow so I can shape them. But now I just use an eyebrow pencil. I will keep using it because I paid for it &amp; don&#x27;t want to throw away my money more than I already have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this stuff does not work. It makes your eyebrows a little shiny but that&#x27;s all it does. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I have seen my eyelashes and eyebrows grow uncontrollably! I myself have use 100% castor oil for years. The reason, I decided to order this item was because it has castor oil as the main ingredient without that annoying sticky feel I get with pure castor oil! By the way you have to use it everyday for at least one month to see results. I learned about the benefits of castor oil, when I was living in Jordan the salons there also recommend you use it on your scalp as well!  Love this product</li>
            <li> I used the lash growth accelerator - not even a week, and I saw results! I applied it at bed time, as the instructions indicated. In a few days, I noticed that my lashes were a little longer and no longer dry. I also like the fact that my lashes look like I have eye makeup on, when I go to bed -without actually wearing any! Great product!</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the difference in my brows. They are thicker than before but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective on my lashes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong my lashes are thicker but not compared to my brows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference nothing changes after weeks of using.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again...if someone can recommend anything different please do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly sure how much this accelerates growth.  But I&#x27;ve been using it for probably a couple of years (obviously when I first started using it, I felt like my lashes did grow).....but at this point I feel like it&#x27;s a great conditioner for my lashes.  After my cleansing/moisturizing at night, I apply a light coat of this.  Can&#x27;t think of the last time I&#x27;ve noticed losing a lash in the curler.  So in my opinion, that makes it a pretty good product!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if by eyebrows grew because of this.</li>
            <li> When I ordered them I ordered 3.  I do not remember the details saying each order was 3.  I only would have ordered 1 set. I do not need 9!</li>
            <li> I am Asian and this stuff absolutely DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;Save your time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how it could work for some people</li>
            <li> I did not like the wand provided, it is kind of hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about ordering this product. But I know for a fact that this stuff really works. My eyebrows were pencil thin. I put this product religiously on everyday for about 3 to 6 months. My eyebrows grew back thicker than ever and now I have them exactly how I want them to look. I have used this on my eyelashes. it does work but once you stop putting it on your eyelashes because you get them to were you want them to grow your eyeslashes start falling off. But it works great for your eyebrows. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I purchased it &amp; have not noticed any difference :/ I am rather disappointed because I was hoping it would help!</li>
            <li> Only came with one, not three as listed in the title. Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although this product is called a growth accelerator, I have yet to notice any growth or gain in my eyelashes or eyebrows. However, it does condition my lashes and keeps them from falling out as frequently as they did. I would recommend this as a condition if you use a lot of make up and want healthier lashes.</li>
            <li> Was only interested in the growth of brows. (I do have brows, just sparce and never over plucked them)Did not do a thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have major brow loss. For me it was a waste of money. I used as directed for a month and there was no change.</li>
            <li> it says the product come&#x27;s with pack of 3, but i recieved only one pack of one item, so 2 are missing</li>
            <li> I started tweezing my eyebrows sophmore year of high school, by senior year I had hardly none at all. Looking back at my prom pictures it&#x27;s all pencil.  A year after I graduated I started filling them in thicker but the hair still wasn&#x27;t there which made getting the right shape nearly impossible. I went about 2 years before finding this (with very little growth) and it has really transformed my brows. I bought the 3 pack and before I got to the last tube, I had at least 50% THICK re-growth. It also works on eyelashes although mine are naturally long so I don&#x27;t think to put it on. I actually stopped using it because I reclaimed my shape and using more would probably make them grow out of shape! This is always my first recommendation to women who want their brows back.</li>
            <li> has a masacara wand, hard to apply to brows.. no real results yet after 3 weeks. hard to tell if any serum is getting onto brows...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a significant difference with this thing but it really burns when you use it on your eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;They should just claim this to be a brow gel instead. :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2.5 weeks. I can say I am very impressed. I bought the product mainly for my eyebrows, over the years I have over tweezed and am sick of having to fill my brows in all of the time. I have used it religiously since I&#x27;ve bought it except for maybe once or twice. I can honestly tell a difference in my brows, the hairs appear fuller and darker. I have a couple bald spots that I&#x27;m still waiting to see growth in but I&#x27;m giving it time. I put it on my lashes as well for the hell of it even though I already have long lashes but it seems like it&#x27;s making them healthier; they seem thicker, not so much longer...yet. I have faith that this product does the trick. Though everyone is different. For the price it&#x27;s totally worth a try, I figure if it doesn&#x27;t work you can always give it to a friend to try. I&#x27;ll update in 2 more weeks</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while.  Im terrible about using it on a regular basis, but I still notice a difference. My lashes are longer and fuller. Just don&#x27;t get it into your eyes, it sucks. Remember, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Product is more than reasonably priced; reviews on web indicated results were good. This may work for some, but it did nothing for my short, dry lashes. In fact, I think they became shorter and dryer with each use. I can&#x27;t recommend this one...</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this product would work, but I was wrong!!  My lashes, while always on the long side, were losing thickness.  After a few weeks I could not believe how much longer they are.  They are still not as thick, but I guess that comes with getting older.  I also do what another reviewer suggested and that is also applying it during the daytime under my mascara.  I went to my dentist and he told me how long my lashes looked. Great product, plenty of it, and an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I love this product I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my eyelashes but they take longer to see any change.  Where I have seen a huge change is my eyebrows.  Haven&#x27;t had this long and oh boy they are growing in at the ends where I had problems from over plucking and the difference is huge.  So if for no other reason I gave it five stars, nothing has worked until now so I&#x27;m very happy indeed.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a trick for getting more of the product on to your eyebrows - squeeze the bristles and the product will go on to your finger tips and then use your fingers to apply it to your brows. You can get more of the product on your eyebrows this way. You can still go back and brush them afterwards if you would like. You have to work a bit fast as the product seems to dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has this worked for my thinning brows? I have only been using it a week now so far and it appears to be working slightly. I will know more as time goes on and will update this review. I am not sure if this can grow new hair though I am sure hopeful as I seem to be losing my eyebrow length, which for me is hereditary. No one in my Asian family has eyebrows to speak of after they go to about the age of 30. Even when younger, they were very thin.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator consistently and have found that my eyelashes are longer. They aren&#x27;t as thick as when I used a much more expensive growth accelerator, but this has been a good subsitute that is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li> Just started using it; may be too soon to evaluate how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for only several weeks and can visually see a difference!  Due to over-plucking in the past, I&#x27;ve noticed how thin my brows were getting and therefore wanted a solution.  This product is affordable and working for me.  I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I saw results after the first few days! My eyelashes are now longer and thicker than ever. I don&#x27;t really wear any make up because I work out a lot but I get a lot of compliments on my eyes now even without make up. Be aware if you get some in your eyes it will burn like crazy but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Uses this daily and so far, I am happy with it. Whether it works remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> have used this for a couple of weeks. My brows were darker right from the start and the jell helps me to shape my unruly brow hair better. I seems like I have had some growth, more on one side than the other.</li>
            <li> I must confess, I was actually skeptical about using this product, but hey, 3 for a price of 1! After applying it on my eyebrows and eyelashes liberally for about a week, it&#x27;s safe to say this works extremely well. I used to have really short, stubby lashes, but it has grown a lot since I&#x27;ve used this; my eyebrows as well! They look much more fuller than they used to be. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 3 days, will continue to use to see if I see any results, will rewrite review when done with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> For a reasonably priced product,  this stuff is pretty good!  I used it on my brows, and within a couple of weeks, I actually saw them darken and thicken.  I thought maybe I was imagining it, so I decided to do a &amp;#34;blind study&amp;#34; and tested it on my husband, only  doing one brow.  On his other brow, I used a clear mascara.  He didn&#x27;t know which product was which - nor did he care - but he went along with this folly anyway.  After a couple of weeks, I noticed the Ardell brow getting fluffier.  I asked him if he sees any difference in his brows, and he was shocked to see a definite difference in one over the other.  I told him the fuller brow was the one I&#x27;d been using the Ardell Lash Growth on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back today to order more.  Great product,  great price.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but this product on my eyelashes. I cannot stand the hastle&lt;br /&gt;of mascara and this makes my lashes look long with keeping them healthy.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hairs can sometimes look messy and wavy. I use this to smooth them down. Dries a little hard, but makes my eyebrows look neat and sculpted.</li>
            <li> I saw barely any results. there are some differentials i noticed but if you are aiming for thicker looking eyebrows than thicker hairs in your eyebrows. buy this, i wanted more hair around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I saw this item online and ordered it for a girlfriend of mine.  Sent it to her aned am waiting for her to use it and let me know how it works, so I have no opinion yet.  Sorry</li>
            <li> Its a good product to keep your eyelashes from breaking or conditioning them. But I didnt see actual results like in length or thickness.  But its good to keep them healthy.  I used the whole bottle its more like a hair mask. But for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this for approximately 3-4 weeks, and did not see any growth or improvement. I haven&#x27;t used it since, and unfortunately bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference yet, and its been about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe tomorrow I will sprout thicker brows &amp; lashes...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen growth at all but i use it as a gel to hold my eyebrows in place</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any increased growth in my eyebrows. However, it is nice to use as a gel over the brows when doing makeup. Not a total waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks, both at night and during the day, and have noticed that my eyelashes are definitely longer, though not necessarily fuller.  I am 45 and have noticed my lashes have thinned and gotten a little shorter as the years have passed, so I wanted to give this a try.  For the price it was worth it.  I don&#x27;t use it as consistently on my eyebrows, so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes there.  I have always had thick, dark eyebrows and now the outside ends are much thinner and receding in a bit, and I have a lot of white eyebrows as well, so I should continue to try this product on them to see if I get any results.  I hate mascara and will avoid using it unless I absolutely have to for parties, weddings, etc. and I&#x27;m dressing up, but I like the way this product makes my eyelashes look during the day when I use it.  It darkens and lengthens my lashes just enough to make them easily visible, especially if I use a curler, and I don&#x27;t get clumps as I do with mascara.  So even if I don&#x27;t see any change in thickness, I&#x27;m pleased that my lashes are longer and will continue to use this as a lash &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; during the day.</li>
            <li> this has definitely made my eyelashes longer. not as much luck with regrowth in the gappy-spots on either eyelashes or brows. but longer lashes for sure. i have to curl them now so that they dont brush my glasses. and definitely for the price, i am very pleased and would buy it again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on 8/3/13 and have waited to write a review so that it would be thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a more expensive product several times and would have ordered it again, but just couldn&#x27;t afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first surprise was when I opened the package and it was a pack of 3. I hadn&#x27;t paid attention when ordering and can&#x27;t believe the value of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some customer reviews said they saw a difference in 3 days. I didn&#x27;t see a difference for about a week. This could be because of my age (54).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been a month and a half and my eye brows are filling in and eye lashes are definitely filling in and longer. I haven&#x27;t been fanatical about using the product, have missed a day or two in a row and still the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I used it every night when I got it, until I noticed that instead of making my eyelashes grow...it makes them fall out even more. I don&#x27;t even use it for the purpose of growing my eyelashes or brows anymore. I just use it to make my brows stay in place. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have found that this product definitely works for me.  The eyebrows especially, but also the lashes, although that took a little longer to notice.  I have read some reviews here that talk about it burning the eyes, but I have had NO experience of this whatsoever.  I am not particularly careful when I put it on, and it has never bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it both morning and night.  There may be more effective products at higher prices, but this is very good, and a great bargain!</li>
            <li> just started using it, let&#x27;s see how it works. I bought it based on all the positive reviews. Let&#x27;s hope I can add something similar soon!</li>
            <li> Not sure it really works.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I noticed my lash became thin after using this product.</li>
            <li> So first off, I am Asian. This product definitely works for most, if not all, skin type. Two, I needed to enhance my eyebrows for a recent event. I received this about 6 days before the event, and I started on it immediately. I applied on both my eyebrows and eyelashes twice! Yes, I reapplied, and I guess it helped because I can see results that week the night before the event. I can see my eyebrows getting darker and thicker and my eyelashes longer and curvier!!! The only drawback is that the rims of my eyelashes are darker, but I think it&#x27;s fine. In fact, I can grow to like it; it&#x27;s almost like I have smudged-eye liner on. So it&#x27;s all good! Highly recommended for the best results in this value :D</li>
            <li> Great for lashes!! I might stop using it on my brows as they appear to be thinning.</li>
            <li> i dont think it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Sad to say it too because I had hopes for this to help my thinning eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference. My eyelashes are the same. Eye cream used at night probably gives the same benefits. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I needed something after discovering that my eyelashes were looking sparse and stubby. Man am I glad I stumbled upon this product. Within a few days I noticed my lashes looked healthier, after about 2 weeks they were getting longer, and after about 2 months they were growing in thicker. I&#x27;m hooked on this product. Some sparse areas have grown in and my lashes when curled and with a coat of mascara now touch my brow bone. I take a small amount on my finger and run it along my lash line then use the wand to coat the lashes. I find that rubbing some against the lash line has increased the effectiveness. I use it on my brows and it has filled them in also. Hope this helps anyone considering this!</li>
            <li> has not given the result</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! My eyelashes are growing in, even though i dont use it regularly. but hoping to see more changes to come. P.S. i have very thin Asian eyelashes but its helping them grow longer, but the volume and thickness hasnt change.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted if you ask any question</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Great price. Have used for about a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results!! Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before...  I bought this after reading some reviews. I have had a space right where one eyebrow starts.. no hair would grow.. I.looked off balance... After using this product.. slowly started to grow in.. about a month later.. the space is all the way filled in.. not sure about lashes.. I am using Latisse.</li>
            <li> let me tell you I love it! I&#x27;ve noticed my eyebrows get thicker and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier, you should use it for a atleast a week straight for you to start seeing a difference! Be patient it actually works! I originally bought it and stopped using it for a while because I wasn&#x27;t seeing a change but I started up again and I&#x27;m so glad I did...</li>
            <li> Not to sure because I just started using it trying to give it some more time to do what is its supposed to do</li>
            <li> its clear obviously.........</li>
            <li> I have been using this product nightly for about 2 weeks. While it doesn&#x27;t sting, it makes my eyes water throughout the night. I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I have no noticed any difference in growth or thickness with use for about 6 months.  However, it does work well to keep eyebrows neat and in place without looking caked down or gooey.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I&#x27;m buying it again because I lost mine but it&#x27;s amazing, I get compliments at school all the time because my lashes are now very good looking</li>
            <li> It really works.  I bought this Ardell Brow  Growth over a year ago as my eyebrows had stopped grown half way across my Eye.  I now have hair growth to the end outside edge.  This product does work.  It will show results in about 4 months on just one tube</li>
            <li> Yeah dude it was mad tight  my eyebrows grew and junk, I&#x27;m a happy bitch. Yeah I&#x27;m a walnut with eyebrows</li>
            <li> I used it for my brows. It made my them grow faster but not re-grow in places that were lacking hairs. After about three months, the formula started smelling like old socks (no joke) and I could smell it on my face the whole day. It was good to keep my hairs in place but I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product maybe I&#x27;m allergic I don&#x27;t know but it burned really bad and made my eyelids swollen. I have use Latisse and had wonderful results with beautiful fuller lashes some irritation around my eyelid but nothing like this product it literally burns my eyelids were swollen it was pretty bad I went to the doctor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, it really worked after just two weeks! I hope it lasts for a while!</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THIS FOR AWHILE NOW, AT FIRST I WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT THEN I DID START SEEING GROWTH. SO STAY PATIENT, IT DOES WORK. THE PRICE MAKES IT WORTHE THE WAIT I GUESS</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my brow growth.</li>
            <li> I suddenly had bald spots in my eyebrows. I used this for a week and it itched a little, but nothing major.  After a week I noticed it was making my eyebrows lighter and they were falling out even more. I stopped using it and my eyebrows got a little better but I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel so moist and my lashes and brows have a nice sheen to them.  You do notice some growth after regular use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for years. Ill cycle using it, on and off. I&#x27;ll wait until I start to lose my lashes then I&#x27;ll start using he it again. Sometimes I&#x27;ll wear it under mascara! It doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes look fake, but nothing will unless you get extensions. It just let your lashes grow to their full potential. It may not work for everyone but it works for me!</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had bushy black eyebrows with a weird bald batch right before the arch. As time went on, my left one grew in, but my right one is still a little bald, not as bad as before but since I used to pluck my eyebrows too thinly because that was the only way you couldn&#x27;t see the bald spot. Finally, when I was sick of being told that my eyebrows are too thin, you look like you draw them with eyeliner like an old lady. Since they&#x27;re so black, (that&#x27;s my Asian side) I really couldn&#x27;t disagree. So I started getting them waxed professionally and they looked so much better but that patch was still noticeable! I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, even stupid home remedies that I found online. Nothing made a difference. I finally found this and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been a little over a month and it&#x27;s made a huge difference! Every night I apply a little on the bald spot with the brush and rub it in with my finger, then I put a little more and use the tip of the brush to rub it in. I used it every night for about two weeks then I got lazy and started using it every other night, sometimes three times a week but a couple days ago I noticed that the bald spot is smaller. It&#x27;s not like hairs started sprouting right out of it, but it&#x27;s almost like the hairs are growing from the outside in. Even the lady who does my brows noticed. I can brush my brows and almost comb over it haha weird I know, but it&#x27;s great! I have long, thick lashes on the top and bottom of my lids but I use this under my mascara everyday anyway since it&#x27;s good for you anyway, being all protein filled and all haha. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my lashes but people have asked if I have mascara on when I didn&#x27;t so I guess that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, perfect product. It lasts so long, I&#x27;m not even close to finishing my first bottle. It does take patience though and it might take longer for some. Be patient! It&#x27;s SO worth it! And be diligent :)</li>
            <li> I have seen many Lash enhancers but never wanted to spend a lot of money to try it. When i saw this one, I decided it wasn&#x27;t much i would be spending if it didn&#x27;t work as well as they say. WOW, my lashes are getting long, very long almost to them starting to curl on their own. It did take about a week or two to notice the length, but only a few days to fell them plump up. I have bought a few more to give to my friends as I believe in this product. Order it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this since even though my brows are over plucked they are still pretty curly and it&#x27;s still enough to control them. I also tried Eyebrows Accelerator from Green Touch Beauty. I was always able to buy Ardell locally at a drug store but no longer can so am ordering from Amazon. As usual, fast shipping but it&#x27;s an add-on so order other things and get another 3 pack of this, great price!</li>
            <li> Growth accelerator is not accurate imo. Its a conditioner</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews because I am trying desperately to regrow the ends of my eyebrows. I had very bad acne once upon a time and would break out underneath my eyebrows. My acne has since cleared up, but unfortunately, has left me with only half of my eyebrow on both sides. I have to pencil in the ends of my brows so I don&#x27;t look like Spok. I decided to give this a try (and it was cheap so I figured why not?). Well unfortunately, it didnt really do much for me. I was very vigilant with applying this every single night on a clean face before going to bed. I did this for probably a month or more. I saw a very very small improvement but nothing worth the hassle of remembering to use it every night so I stopped using it. I have since had some more growth to my brows but I attribute that more to my not using facial lotion on my brow area as to not clog my follicle. They are coming back slowly but surely but unfortunately, no thanks to this product. :/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable change in my lashes or brows since I started using this, but it works great to hold brows in place and makes brow pencils and powders stay on longer so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it just for that. One tube lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t dry up in tube.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work, I&#x27;ve got eyebrow hair coming in where it hasn&#x27;t been for years.  Hair will grow all over the brow area so be careful to wipe it off from everywhere except the brow line you want to regrow on.  Also, it&#x27;s hard to brush stuff on hair that&#x27;s not there so I used a q-tip to apply it where the skin is (was) bald from over-plucking.  Very happy with this product, haven&#x27;t tried it on my lashes though, just brows.</li>
            <li> It really works.  Noticed a dramatic difference, especially on brows, and my husband did as well.</li>
            <li> Not worth paying any money.  I was hoping for a cheap alternative, but nope. Boooooo, have to go to the dermatologist after all for a real script.</li>
            <li> Nice product, fast delivery &amp; works! I am a contact wearer  so I was a bit worried this product might be irritating but I have not had any problems with dry or itching or burning...all good &amp; nice eye lashes too!</li>
            <li> Wife says not overly impressed.</li>
            <li> I shaved my eyebrows off when I was 12 years old (I know, it&#x27;s crazy, and my parents were NOT having it!) but I continued to shave them until I was 19 years old. After I turned 19 I just overplucked the hell out of them, well what was left of them... since you know there is a chance your eyebrows will never grow back if you keep shaving them... and well... my eyebrows used to be in gross clumpy patches... up until I started using this product, combined with some vitamins and some castor oil, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW? My eyebrows grew back, much to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother purchased this product for his girlfriend at the time, who has trichotillomania, and he said it worked for her, so it might for me. Glad he recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con would be that if you apply a bit too much it gets hard and crusty, I would smooth my eyebrows over in the morning or later after applying them and crusty flakes would get in my eyes... so.... just don&#x27;t put too much on!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I was SUPER surprised. I have been using this everyday for like a year. I&#x27;ve just included it into my makeup routine and every time I get out of the shower. I&#x27;ve actually noticed that it works best/grows more if I use it when my skin is still warm from the shower. I&#x27;ve gone through almost 3 tubes. Now I know a year sounds like a long time to see results, especially using it every day, but that all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it to fill in scars and so that I didn&#x27;t have to practically draw on my left eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;And for the most part, that goal was sorta reached. It took a year, but my eyebrows match now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have 3 separate scars on my eyebrow. One scar goes horizontally through my entire left eyebrow. A millimeter below that is also a horizontal scar that goes directly under the place where the other horizontal scar is. Another goes vertically toward the T zone, but is still in the eyebrow hair (where it should be).&lt;br /&gt;So for like 17 years I&#x27;ve been walking around like a hot mess with my left eyebrow arched like a horizontal parentheses sign. And my right eyebrow frowning at my left like }. No joke. Just a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**To be clear, this did not fill in the scaring, HOWEVER it has made the hair around it long enough to cover the scar. Some of the less deeper parts of the scars did grow hair though!! It&#x27;s so exciting. My eyebrows practically match now. And I barely fill them in!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand looks like any other basic mascara wand. I honestly think it feels really weird while I put it on and while its drying, but after I don&#x27;t mind. It also has a kind of odd smell, but I don&#x27;t smell it (and neither does anyone else, I&#x27;ve asked) once its dried. Its like using clear mascara on your eyebrows. Each one has lasted me a really long time. I actually bought one tube to begin with to see if it worked and then bought a 3 pack. I gave one from the 3 to my sister because she wanted to growher overplucked eyebrows out. She used it for about a month before she got tired of doing it every night. So I don&#x27;t know. I personally think doing it every day is a small price to pay for nice eyebrows again. I guess it just depends how much your eyebrows mean to you. I do the whole eyebrow question thing so it&#x27;s important to me. Ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I added this to my makeup routine. It&#x27;s kinda like eyebrow gel, but slightly thicker. I apply this TO THE SKIN ON THE EYEBROW. You have to remember this is not mascara; if you brush it on the hairs you&#x27;re just painting the hair and that&#x27;s not what this is for; this is to make the skin that does not usually produce hair (at least not eyebrow hair) grow hair. So you don&#x27;t have to put a ton on, but enough on that it&#x27;s on the skin where you want the growth.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to dry, but I usually do something else while I wait. If you&#x27;re like me and fill in the sparse areas then PLEASE make sure you wait until it&#x27;s dry. It&#x27;s just a mess if not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly did help me. I know it may sound crazy to some people - that my eyebrows (eyEBROWS???) could make me feel bad about myself, but it does make sense. I mean, when you look in the mirror and one side of your face doesn&#x27;t look close to matching up with the other, you feel ugly. I&#x27;m not saying having bad eyebrows ruined my life because that would be dumb, but it did lower my confidence and make me feel ehk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I found this and a year later I feel like my eyebrows are sorta twins!!! I still use this today even because I figured out about 4 months in that when you need a whole new eyebrow, it&#x27;s best to ease it in to it. As in, focus on the spots that are sparse first, not empty. If you do them at the same time, it will look like you have never heard of tweezers, much less wax, in your life. I can&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;re eyebrows will look 100% good every day that you try to grow them out, but it&#x27;s a process and honestly it has to be done, grasshopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if you don&#x27;t like adding this to your morning routine, then doing it at night and washing it off in the morning. I find that I see better result if I use it right after I get out of the shower even though I use it every morning I don&#x27;t shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, so comparing my eyebrows now to how they looked a year ago is scary. I still fill them in a bit, but mostly where I&#x27;m still working on the empty spots. You can still see the vertical scar, but now it looks fine even when I don&#x27;t fill it in. Also, I want to point out that when I say fill in, I mean I lightly dab it a couple of times with my eyebrow wax (E.L.F.), but only so that it blends it in with the rest and you can still see skin by it. A year ago I was not dabbing, but I literally had to draw and then rub it in so it didn&#x27;t look draw on (but it did) which was a huge hassle getting ready for school. I had to color it in to match the shape of the other one and then had to color the right eyebrow to match the color of the left then blah blah blah.. A hassle I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole goal with this was to not have to fill in my eyebrows everyday. Now, you can&#x27;t see the scar going through my eyebrow at all now, because the hairs above and below it cover it enough, which is saying a lot because it&#x27;s deep and pretty long in it&#x27;s entirety. The scar just under that is pretty noticeable now, but not in a bad way I don&#x27;t think. I actually like it as a matter of fact. I&#x27;m still kind of in shock that I have eyebrow hair on my left one. I&#x27;m like super thankful this was recommended to me. All the other hair growth stuff would have been too expensive, especially if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said, I pretty much now only use this now as a gel to guide the hair where I want, to keep up the progress of my new and improved eyebrows, and to keep working on my arches. Also, I wanted to recommend that when you see progress (a noticeable difference, not 3 hairs) getting your eyebrows tinted or diy. I&#x27;ve done it once or twice and I thought it made my eyebrows look really good afterward because the progress was even more profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this to everyone! It worked wonders for me and I hope it does for you too!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have either fallen out or I am picking them in my sleep either way I have no eyebrows. So I have been using eyebrow pencil. This sucks when you want to swim comes right off. So I ordered this. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work , so I gave it a shot. Wholy ****** !!!! It totally works ! I am on week two. I use it very day. I can see eyebrow hair coming in. Lighter then it was by better then nothing ! The only down side to the bottle is the info on it. It says clean , apply to eyebrow or lases leave on all night. Doesn&#x27;t say how many times to do this , can you a apply it more the once in a day ?! I have been using it twice a day. In the morning after my shower and when I go to bed , after I wash my face. So far it has done anything to my skin , I have very sensitive skin to.  Will keep this updated :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update ; 12/23/15&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are pretty much grow back !! It&#x27;s amazing ! So glad I don&#x27;t have to pencil them in or have to worry about pool water washing them&lt;br /&gt;Off !!</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it works...</li>
            <li> I had never used a serum for my lashes and decided to give this one a try. I bought one for me and one for my mother and we&#x27;ve used it for over a month. We both can say we feel our lashes prettier and fuller. I&#x27;ve got several issues with my eyes so i used to scrath them because they stink, thus, i&#x27;ve ripped my lashes off. With this product i am beggining to see (or feel?) they are growing back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can give them a try.. If they don&#x27;t grow, at least it is also good as a light mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from eyebrow envy for many years.  I had 15 hairs on left brow and 5 on right.  Bought this thinking it would never work and it&#x27;s fantastic.  Have been using it for a month and my brows are as full as when I was a teenager.  To say I&#x27;m shocked and overjoyed is an understatement.  And it&#x27;s inexpensive!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for 5 days before noticing an improvement in my eye lashes. I don&#x27;t have to cake on mascara anymore. I started using it day and night. At first it didn&#x27;t burn when it got in my eyes but now it does. So I put it on top of my lashes and then use the tip of the brush and apply a lot on my eyelid close to the lash line. I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell a huge improvement in my brows yet, but I put this on as a brow gel to shape and smooth them, let it dry and put my foundation on then I use a pencil and my brows look amazing and full without looking fake. Definitely worth trying before spending a lot on other products that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Despite having read all of the positive reviews, I was somewhat skeptical about ordering this.  For me this has made a decided difference in my eyebrows but not so much for my eyelashes.  That may be due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to get a &#x27;thick&#x27; coat on my brows.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results and that I found something that works at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but for all of you who want to buy this, beware that it does burn your eyes. Like when you apply them to your lashes, it&#x27;s irritating. No problem when putting on eyebrows, it dries sort of like how mousse dries, and when you rub it leaves a sort of residue. I use to use this on my brows to shape them, not sure if it actually grows the hairs though...    But it burns on your eye, Like to the point I threw mine away, not worth it. Unless you can cope with the burning, then go ahead and buy it... If not, I also bought GolFroy. Way milder, doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes at all and smells minty. Totally reccomend. If you don&#x27;t like GolFroy, you can also use A mascara brush (Minus the mascara on it) and Vitamin E oil, or PURE/100%/Virgin Olive oil, to grow your lashes. Not irritable at all, all natural and it REALLY works. It&#x27;ll take you about a week to see results. I sure saw them.  -Good day</li>
            <li> you start seeing improvement really fast</li>
            <li> More of a conditioner than a growth product.</li>
            <li> Love it, has made a difference in my eyebrows, not so much my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have hair loss and oily skin on my eyebrows and scalp. I was really hoping this would do something, but it made it worse. The morning after using it I had clumps of the formula with my regular oil and flakiness, which resulted in more eyebrow loss. I&#x27;ve had my first visit with a dermatologist a month ago and haven&#x27;t figure out what is causing this yet because all of my labs are normal. I&#x27;m sure this product is great for people that don&#x27;t have skin conditions, so I will give it three stars because it&#x27;s not the product but something that wrong with me.</li>
            <li> It works very well and fast. My lashes grew 1-2 days after I used the product. My eye&#x27;s lashes grew 2 millimeter longer and fuller. Even on the spot that didn&#x27;t have any lashes, it started to grow after I applied the product and continued to grow after I stopped using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advice is to use it before bedtime. After you put it on, try not to open your eyes cause it stings your eyes if it gets in.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference in the thickening of my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I truly love this product it actually works I have been using it for a while  now and will continue too I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Im doing eyebrow threading for the last 30 years and this product works like magic for my clients eyebrows ✌️It makes my job easier bc it actualy grows hair in bold spots and i can make their eyebrow perfect😂✌️</li>
            <li> This worked to fill in some of my eyebrows after about 6 weeks but was too irritating to use on eyelashes. Will keep using on eyebrows a whole longer.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work with me comparing to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past. But it keeps your eyebrows and eyelashes healthier, reducing the number of eyelash falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it but see no change. I gave a friend a bottle we both wanted to try it. Not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to see a difference. I&#x27;m not yet convinced it will work.</li>
            <li> I gave this only 3 stars because I feel it is still too soon to rate.  I got a pack of 3 and am still on the 1st one.  I feel that it may be working as I &#x27;ve seen some change in my eyebrows.  The price was worth checking it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of this product.  I see an improvement in my eyelashes.  The appear thinker and longer.  I&#x27;m even getting compliments on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I put a good amount on every night, and within like 2-3 days I noticed my lashes grew quite a bit &lt;3</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look the same as well as my eyelashes. Did notice both are noticeably softer but that&#x27;s all sadly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it really didn&#x27;t fill in my bald spots in my eyebrows but it definitely made the hair already there longer</li>
            <li> I have always over plucked my eye brows. I started to see results after a few days. Now it has been almost three weeks, and my eyebrows have grown so much. I used to fill my eyebrows in in parts that I had NO hair and now i fill them in where I have hair. My eye lashes are also a lot longer! They look so much better and I am so happy i bought this product. I am still using the first one I opened and they come in a pack of three. Three of them for this price is great, and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my shorter eyelashes coming in better to give me fullness</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have no complaints at the moment it works but you have to give it time.</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube video about using mens Rogaine on your eyebrows and it was about $50 for the stuff, and then I saw this and the reviews were pretty positive so I thought what the heck if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll spend the money on the other stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe 6 weeks? I CAN NOT believe the difference! My brows are double what they were before and my lashes are insanely long. Even my friend asked the other day if I had falsies on. This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The pack of 3 is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;I love it for brows only.  My eyes were irritated on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;For brows, my patches are beginning to filling in after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on all day, it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving it on all day, keeps my brows groomed and in place.&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been a year of use and I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. My eyebrows continue to be full with no patches.</li>
            <li> ok first of all there is NO color to this product.  I read a lot of the reviews, and because of the price decided to try it.  I used it religiously at first and thought I saw a difference but then I realized I just stopped tweezing my brows so much!  I probably have to say it does not exactly grow your brows and make them fuller.  However, if you apply a light coat at the beginning of your makeup routine, brush brows where you want them to stay, and wait a few mins to dry completely, it makes a pretty good brow tamer and a very good base on which to apply brow powder.  I use it with the NYX brow powder and a tiny little angled brush from Cvs.  Ive also tried it with a brow pencil and that works too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one tube so far, but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I can see hair growth on my eyebrows. The hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> I kept trying to see an improvement.  After 3 weeks, it just wasn&#x27;t worth using anymore.  It stung my eyes, made them red and irritated.  I never saw a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 18 days, never missing a day and applying twice a day at times. NO change! NO growth. Bummer, I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a wimp, because it was cheap and I know the brand name. I have been using it as a brow gel to keep them in place after I do my make up. I tried it for growth on my lashes and brows, for a few weeks but didnt notice any change.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to useing plain Castor Oil on my eyebrows and brished in to my lashes at night, and have noticed a difference in growth with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Ardell Accelerator off and on for a few years, and am always impressed with how well it works.  It doesn&#x27;t thicken up your lashes the way something like Latisse (which I used for a few months) will, but it makes them grow long and feel really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Revitalash, and that did nothing for me. This much cheaper product has been more effective for me than Revitalash.  (Latisse was the best, but I was worried about the consequences of using it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it a half-hour before bed on clean lashes most nights of the week, and see a difference in my lashes within about a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a three-pack of this so I can use a new tube every six weeks or so and have it be more sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and effective, and I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Works good on brows after about 2 weeks of using. I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> This is the second that I have purchased this product, and I really like it.  My lashes are thicker and easy to curl, especially the left eye.  My lashes on my left eye were hard to curl and would not keep the curl, so I went searching for a product for my lashes, and I chose this one.  I am really glad I did because my lashes are thicker and will hold a curl.  It does take some time to see results but you will.  I took me a while to see results, but it was worth the wait and money.  A very good price for this product.  I will continue to use this product on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is like a mascara wand...for growth??  I have used it and find that I cannot curl my lashes anymore, and have not seen anymore growth.  I have bought Latise that you line your lashes with &amp; had great results.  I was looking for a less expensive alternative and bought into your advertising.  I was surprised to find a mascara wand in lieu of a brush. How does stoking your lashes affect growth that starts at the base? My lashes were more brittle, and, I couldn&#x27;t curl them.  Your product is simply coating my lashes with &#x27;something&#x27; and making them brittle and I&#x27;m not able to curl them. It was too cheap to believe and have had NO growth results after a few weeks...DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Tried for a few weeks didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> The area of brow that has hair is slighty fuller. The area where I want hair has more fine hairs growing. However, that area is still gapped after one month of use. I am going to keep applying and see if I aquire any additional results. In the photos you can see the beginning of my brows have long brows growing. You can also tell that I have had my brows plucked where the tech would pull straight up because that&#x27;s how the are growing, straight up! I will trim them but I wanted to see the difference if any. (I haven&#x27;t plucked, waxed or trimmed while waiting to take the photos.) The beginning of my brows show the most improvement as far as individual hair fullness and how fast they are growing. Again new hair growth is fine and gapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think age maybe a determining factor on how well this product works. I am in my 40&#x27;s, so for 20+ years I have been keeping my eyebrows in the thin 90&#x27;s shape. I noticed there is a young lady in one of the other review photos and she is having great success with this brand accelerator. I&#x27;m seeing a small difference but again, I think that may be because of the years difference in brow removal and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;After so long of plucking and shaping, you begin to damage the whole growth process until growth isn&#x27;t possible. Also, now spa techs say to always wax, never pluck. They made that change a little to late in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely long full eyelashes already. That&#x27;s why I have not mentioned eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The accelerator is clear and has a mascara type brush for application. All you do pull the brush along your brow and also in the area you want more hair to grow. Too easy! Like other reviewers, I apply morning and night. Although I put a small amount in the morning and put a thicker two layer amount on at night. Being clear it doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up application, I just have more time at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received three individual packages that looked exactly the product photo in the ad. One of bottles was busted at the bottom. It was unuseable. Although the liquid didn&#x27;t leak out, it had dried inside the tube. I lost a little money but when you divide the total cost by two (useable bottles), your talking $5.84 + tax each. I think I&#x27;ll live!bottles was busted at the bottom. It was unuseable.

            <li> I used this for a while, I was constant AND used it for almost 20 days straight before going to bed and I can tell you it work, I only used it in my eyelashes, not eyebrows I heard some ppl do used it in their eyebrows. WELL it works, I had some missing eyelashes in the bottom eyelid and they grew, my eyelashes are somewhat longer and thicker nothing to dramatic though, I would recommend it. I haven&#x27;t been using it constantly for several weeks now but my eyelashes are still there looking good. My problem was and still is i guess that I rub my eyes often and every now and then my eyelashes fall so yeah, but this product help grow back those eyelashes that didn&#x27;t want to grow back :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to grow out my eyebrows.. I&#x27;ve over-tweezed for about 10 years and my eyebrows got to the point of being very thin and straight, rather than arched like I eventually decided looked better (duh!). I pretty much stopped tweezing for about 6 months now and they grew back pretty well as my eyebrows are naturally fairly thick, but the area that was over-tweezed the most wasn&#x27;t growing in, One eyebrow in particular had an extremely sparse area I needed to fill in for the arch. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have definitely seen results in that area slowly growing out... I would say that people with naturally sparse eyebrows may not see as much results as people with naturally thick eyebrows they&#x27;d like to re-grow from shaving or tweezing. I don&#x27;t think it will make hair grow anywhere it never has before. it may still help with the thickness though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t work&#x27; reviews on here, but this product is actually GREAT IF YOU APPLY IT CORRECTLY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash before (which is also great but more expensive) and was looking for an even more economical solution and am now using Ardell.  This product absolutely works!&lt;br /&gt;The mascara type brush doesn&#x27;t work well for this application (unless you only want to condition your lashes) so I use an old eyeliner brush to get the gel onto the base of my lashes.  If you only use it just like a mascara and get it on the lashes only (without getting any on your eyelid), it won&#x27;t work because the compound doesn&#x27;t reach the actual hair follicles.  That would be like carrying the bottle in your purse and expecting it to magically be absorbed through the strap.  I apply it directly to the eye line at the base of my lashes so it can be absorbed into the skin (and hair follicle) and have seen the same results as with Rapid Lash.  I owe at least one third, if not more, of my lashes&#x27; length to this product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching permanently from Rapid Lash to Ardell - absolutely fabulous results and price!</li>
            <li> I was in an accident where my face was burned and I lost all my eyebrow hair.  I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my eyebrows back since (about 6 years ago).  I tried the Arbonne hair growth product and it didn&#x27;t work.  So I gave up.  However, I found this product, and it was inexpensive, so I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I have some hair growth - it&#x27;s blonde (and I have dark brown hair), but blonde is better than none.  I expect it to darken up as time goes on.  So if you&#x27;re using this product for brow regrowth, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try it on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product after reading all the positive reviews, but all that did was intensify my disappointment upon using it. As an Asian female with medium length, somewhat sparse lashes, I experienced no noticeable increases in the length or thickness of my lashes. I applied this goo at least once a day and sometimes twice a day until I finished the tube. Alas! My dreams of lush, Disney princess-esque lashes remain unfulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, less lashes fell out when I removed my eye makeup at night. You&#x27;d think that this would give you thicker lashes, but you&#x27;d be wrong.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s growing my eyelashes but not eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This product I use with rapid lash. It is a good conditioner.  My lashes and brows are growing in.  For the price...can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Helped grow fuller brows.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Put it on in the morning and before bed for a whole week without putting on eye make up. Lashes look so full and dark!! I recommend this product to all my friends</li>
            <li> does not work like some others I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this gel. I stopped for months and saw a change. Lashes weren&#x27;t as strong and were easily pulled off by my lash curler. I actually purchased this again when I lost a ton of lashes on my left eye (made me look ridiculous) and whoa!!! Grew back to Normal length in (no lie) 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> Do not purchase .....It makes the eyebrows fall out....... Very Bad Product .this should be Red flagged !!!!!</li>
            <li> I had an eyebrow &amp;#34;overplucking problem&amp;#34; and read where this was an effective product for rapid growth and it was! It very much did speed up the growth of my eyebrows. I did not use on my eyelashes however as I wear contacts and do not use anything on my eyes unless prescription.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exactly 2 weeks.  I use it in the morning after washing my face and in the evening after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I have very light blonde eyebrows and lashes.  I can&#x27;t say this made them darker in appearance but, it has definately made my lashes longer and thicker.  Also, it has helped grow my eyebrows, although not darker.  I still need to use some type of eyebrow product to make my eyebrows stand out so you know they are there.  However, it has helped my eyebrows grow, especially in places where they were bald.  I hope with continued use, my eyebrows will eventually fill in more.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on using this product, since in the 2 weeks of use I have put in, it has already made an Amazing difference!</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item at CVS Pharmacy..then they stopped carrying it.  Then I found it on Amazon for (3) for the same price that CVS Pharmacy sold (1) for!  Needless to say........I was thrilled and purchased it right away....and it arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I can definitely see a growth in lenght in my lashes, not as much in the eyebrows, which I don&#x27;t really mind, my goal was to use for the lashes. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I did not have eyelashes before at all. Now my lashes are long and beautiful, I tried smart lash before, but was too expensive for me. I decided to give a try to Ardell Brow and  Lash and  I&#x27;m very happy with the results, I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s looking for long lashes without pay expensives lash serum.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this product would work for me.  I am fifty-something and my eyelashes were very short and thin.  After reading some of the reviews I figured it was worth a shot but did not expect much.  Wow was I ever surprised.  I have only been using this a little over a week and can see dramatic changes.  My lashes are already longer and fuller.  I am thrilled.  This is definitely worth it.  It REALLY DOES work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eyebrows. My eyebrows are really thinned out halfway through, so it looks like I have half eyebrows and it&#x27;s insane. I haven&#x27;t been successful in getting them to get fuller, but I have noticed that they make my eyebrows grow faster. I also use this on my eyelashes and man do I have some killer eyes now.&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this for eyelashes, I highly recommend. However, for eyebrows, you are going to have slow results.</li>
            <li> i really love this product! ive been using it for 2 weeks and have seen growth in my eye brows in spots that havent grown in years! and i got 3 tubes for the price??! woohoo!! im not even a 1/4 of the way through my 1st tube! :)</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a month now on brows, it works. I brush it on every night before bed and I&#x27;ve notice by brows are getting Fuller. haven&#x27;t noticed a difference to my eyelashes, but works for my eyebrows. Recommend. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I was kind of sloppy the first few times I used it so had to tweeze some of the hairs that grew in. Works pretty fast - I have almost no eyebrows at all since I got lupus and my hair fell out. It&#x27;s thin on top of my head but did come back; eyebrows not so much. Hey, I don&#x27;t have to shave under arms or legs more than every couple of weeks or more - that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this does work and I use it about once a week is all. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even what I&#x27;m supposed to do but it&#x27;s how it suits me.</li>
            <li> I had some false eyelashes put on at a salon that were supposed to last for up to a month. They lasted 4 days and ripped out all of my natural lashes with them.  I bought this to help encourage new growth and within a month they were back to normal. Another month later, they are longer and fuller.  I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack and got great results with the first tube which lasted about 45 days using on lashes and brows.  LAshes responded better than brows.  Then the next tube did nothing, but the third one, well I can&#x27;t tell yet.  But clearly there is some inconsistency.  Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> IT has some effect on eyebrows but has nothing to do with eyelash growth. It only works as invisible mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ardell on my lashes and brows for the last 3 months. It&#x27;s a slow process, but after a month I could tell immediately that my lashes had gotten longer and thicker! I usually apply it 2x a day. Once at night and once in the morning while applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My brows were a bit slower of a process, but still affective on them. I can see the tiny hairs that I&#x27;ve been struggling to thicken up forever are starting to sprout and are getting darker.&lt;br /&gt;Women now ask me now if I have eyelash extensions on. I have worn extensions before and now see them as a waste of money.... My lashes look fabulous now with this lash grower</li>
            <li> I have had one eyebrow that seems to not grow in as thick as they were when I was a kid.  So I am always thinning the other one to match and it always comes back. I wish I had never tweezed so thin, but hey, you live and learn right? Well I looked at all the reviews on this product and figured I’d give it a shot.  I have been using for approximately 3 weeks.  I wasn’t really purchasing for my eyelashes, but use it on them anyways before applying my mascara and they look longer and fuller.  I love the applicator; I was worried after seeing the reviews about it, but it is a mascara wand, Duh you use it on your eyelashes! So far I am unsure of new growth on my eyebrows but it does make them look conditioned darker and tames them.  I will update after a few more weeks to see if there is any growth.  I did take pictures the first day, end of first week, and second.  If I can post I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s made any difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it just to probe it, but i didn&#x27;t think it really would work. Then it surprised me it really works just that it doesn&#x27;t happen immediately. I have been using it about two months and I really see true changes. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little longer than a week. During the week I&#x27;ll put it right before I go to bed and leave it all night long. Any time that I stay home all day, I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning and all night. It&#x27;s smoothening out my eyebrows and stretching my lashes to its maximum.  Update: This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered them, and they came in less than a week of ordering them. Love!</li>
            <li> Love this! it definitely works. I saw eyebrow growth instantly.  It&#x27;s not a bushy eyebrow yet but definitely could see the differnece in a couple days. Will buy more</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is great for your eyelashes. I already have long lashes but had burned them a bit from smoking, &amp;#34;stupid wind&amp;#34;. The product helped restore them and helped a bit with my eyebrows. Although, works better for eyelashes. ( recommend)</li>
            <li> Ladies, It works! I have never had any brows and for the first time in eons I am growing eyebrows! I use it daily and nightly!</li>
            <li> It an okay product. It does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t accelerate one single eyelash or brow hair period. I&#x27;ve tried so many of these lash builders and this is probably the worst performer  yet.</li>
            <li> One week using it and I can see the results.  The product&#x27;s direction says to apply it at night after watching your face and go to bed.  That my be the reason some people here are experiencing irritation.  I apply it in the morning and try to keep my hands away from my eyes because if it gets in your eyes it can burn a litle and that&#x27;s the reason I don&#x27;t apply it before bed.  I wish I have taken before pictures to show you guys how good the product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> junk. used it for a month and saw no difference. they did send three of them maybe i need to use all three to see the effect.</li>
            <li> Nope!  This product really doesn&#x27;t work or its extremely slow slow slow.  I would recommend it and a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Do not think it works</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that my eyelashes have particularly grown much, but I do notice that my eyebrows have filled in a little which is awesome enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again. My brows have been loving this stuff and they need all the extra help they can get! I also use on my lashes each night and I like it because it helps then not cross each other even if I did sleep funny the night before</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, most people said it work. A few said it didn&#x27;t, which made me a bit scared to spend my money on it. However, after using it for 3 and a half weeks, IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Used it as directed. Did NOTHING!! I just regret that I didn&#x27;t notice I purchased 3 bottles instead of one. Threw them all away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks and can definitely see a difference.  My eyebrows are filling in again.  Good product at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Okay I definitely was a doubting Thomas when it came to this I&#x27;m 51 years old so my eyebrows are a little thinner and not growing very quick but this stuff really works stay dedicated to it twice a day morning and night it works I was incredibly surprised I am so thrilled that I found this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and for some reason, tried another brand a few months ago. Needless to say, I just re-ordered this again. I am notorious for over-plucking my brows, and this really gets them growing after just a short period of time!</li>
            <li> These hepled grow my lashes just a bit but after a few months, these started to stink (like a smelly shoe). And finally, they got to the point in which they smelled so bad, I threw them away and began simply using olive oil to grow my eyebrows and eyelashes everynight.</li>
            <li> I will only give three stars at this point still using</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  I have used the Latisse which works like a perfect charm. But who wants to pay that price every month if there is something else that works well. Of course, this does not work as well as the Latisse, but for the price, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not but I guess it does; just at a very slow process it moves at. Probably just for me that is.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of difference in growth or length. At first i just started applying it on my eyebrows before bed. (Main reason I got it was to try to grow my eyebrows back thicker and in places the hair would no longer grow) Then eventually i actually applied it and let it dry before shaping and filling in my brows. It may have only helped a little with growth but it does work Great has a brown wax/gel to keep your brows in place! Even though it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do, I am glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Great for brows! Used for a couple of weeks and saw results! Not so good for lashes though.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to try this;  the price was so low and I&#x27;d read the descriptions of the more expensive ones;  but figured I had nothing to lose.......I actually have eyebrows again!  Some of the high end ones may be better but I won&#x27;t take the chance on spending the money since this works for a  song</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my lashes so soft and allows them to grow faster. No odor and I&#x27;m just left with silky lashes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t properly used this product so I haven&#x27;t experienced any major change in my eyelashes.  I definitely am not losing any lashes since I started using it.  That is good since I am a ruff eye rubber and tend to pull lashes out because they go in all the wrong directions.  I can also say that this product does straighten my eyelashes out with out the itch I would get from mascara.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over a month, have not seen any results</li>
            <li> Started to make my lashes grow for two weeks, but then did nothing.</li>
            <li> It actually works, almost have a full eyebrow grown in a small amount of time. Daily use is recquired if you want to really see progress. I really liked it! Plus, it comes with 2 extra ones.</li>
            <li> My lashes seem longer and thicker already and it has been a week and half. I really like this product. Great price and my eyelashes are thicker and longer in a week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> This product does well to tame unruly brows, but I don&#x27;t see much new growth if any and no darkening.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very excited and wish to have a Little fuller eyebrow and eyelash. i give 3 stars because i just start using it, but i have 1 issue that i have to replace it myself. the brush that comes with it, it&#x27;s very rough, i mean it&#x27;s not soft at all. i feel like a metal brush after i tried to use it several times. now i gave up, and switch to my own soft brush. when i apply it on my eyelash, i have to be so much careful to don&#x27;t get it in my eyes. the gel does not smell, and does not bother me. i will wait after 4-6 weeks for the result, then i will post my update again. after i read all reviews from the so helpful customers, that&#x27;s why i bought it. thank you so much that everyone has taken your time to write the reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my lashes are short and thin. I used this in combination with Almay Get up &amp; Grow Mascara and have seen significant changes in my lashes in a month. They are much longer and more fuller. I use this every night before I go to bed, sometimes on the weekend when I don&#x27;t wear mascara I will apply this twice. I love the results and the price of this product, I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
            <li> seems to work very well but unfortunately i cant enjoy the benefits as it burns and itches my eyes. &#x3D;-O  ill stick with the amazingly effective and affordable select lash!</li>
            <li> my second tube, i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and so far I am loving my results! My eye brows are fuller longer thicker and now I just powder it in instead of drawing my entire eye brows. Previous to using this my eyebrows had hair I wanted it thicker n longer. Anyways I am satisfied with this product I apply it 2x one before bed and before makeup. Do your part by not Tweezing, waxing watsoever! Let it grow and only tweeze in areas outside of where youd like the eyebrow hair to grow. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I admit that I fell victim to the 90s obsession with drawing in non-existent brows.  If I could sue both \\&quot;Beverly Hills 90210\\&quot; and Drew Barrymore for influencing me to destroy my then-perfect brows, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas,  I can&#x27;t,  and here I am at almost 40 with the remnants of the brows that were.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product, mostly because I&#x27;ve used  far more expensive products with fewer results. But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  For such an inexpensive product;  in 4 weeks I&#x27;ve seen enough hair growth to inspire me to stop coloring in my brows altogether.  Next time,  I will have them professionally shaped.  But for this time,  only a month in and I&#x27;m seeing hair growth where before there was no hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how this goes down,  I&#x27;m seeing hair i haven&#x27;t seen in months! !</li>
            <li> Extremely useless. Been using since October. There is not even a 0.1% effect. The lashes or the brows are not thicker/longer/voluminous. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Really have been liking this product! I have used it for about a month so far and am seeing good results. It definitely conditions my lashes so they look and feel better. Definitely seeing some growth in terms of length, not super drastic but definitely getting a longer. I have also noticed it is growing my short broken lashes back quite well. I mainly got it for my lashes, but also have been using it on my eyebrows. I have sparse brows and haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth, but I think that might just be because my brows grow really slow to begin with! For the price and quantity received I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Never noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not because I just received, this after over a month.  I couldn&#x27;t remember when I ordered this.  I&#x27;ll have to write a review after I&#x27;ve had it for a while.</li>
            <li> 1.  It doesn&#x27;t work to accelerate or grow lashes or brows.&lt;br /&gt;2.  But it does work as a setting gel for brows after you&#x27;ve used your brow treatment.&lt;br /&gt;3.  For the price, it works for #2, but not any price for #1.</li>
            <li> I had looked at that SmartBrow Eyebrow Filler stuff a while back but saw all the trouble people had with making it look natural.  I had a pierced brow YEARS ago (in the early 90s) and plucked it like crazy to keep the area clean.  I only kept the ring for less than a year, but the eyebrow never grew back so I had this stripe or gap, really, through the middle.  So, I plucked the outer brow off and did the other eye to match, thinking they could grow in at the same time and be normal again.  That didn&#x27;t happen.  Recently, I bought Ardell Brow and Lash Accelorator on Amazon.com.  Super cheap!  $8 and change for 3 tubes.  Just apply it at night like mascara and let it dry before you bury your face in covers so it won&#x27;t wear off (you can wear it in daytime, too, though).  In two weeks, my brows were somewhat normal again!  By the end of a month of using it, I have my eyebrows back and never even used all the stuff.  Now I use it every-so-often just to maintain them and put it on my lashes, too.  I&#x27;m nearly 45 and I have my natural brows back after about 20 years.</li>
            <li> When I found this product a month ago, I looked hard for thorough reviews on use of this product for eyebrow regrowth. I found very little information, so I promised myself I&#x27;d write a review after I tried it for MY brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from my 5 star rating, I love it. I use the product at least once, and hopefully twice a day. It leaves a tight coat when it dries, so I&#x27;ll wear it to bed or under my makeup in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve over plucked my eyebrows six four years now. To the point where 90% of what someone would see was only drawn on. I really liked them during the day, but I&#x27;d take my makup off at night and I looked like an alien.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to Puerto Villarta with my family a month ago, I was really embarrassed to be eyebrow-less for anything water involved for the trip. (Which staying beach side was a lot of stuff) I couldn&#x27;t keep my eyebrows on in the water, and I realized how rediculous it was to pluck eyebrows off to draw fake ones on every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop plucking as soon as the trip was over, and boy were those first weeks awkward. It was like having two sets of overlapping eyebrows, the ones I drew on and the ones growing around them. I needed a low cost way to speed up the process, and this syrum was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For a fraction of the cost, compared to other brands, I got THREE tubes of this strum. With daily use (like I said) my brows looked fuller in three days. Little stubbles popped up more frequently to start growing, and the protine in the syrum kept the hairs long and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST 3 WEEKS LATER and my brows have made an unbelievable comeback. Now I just fill them in with some shadow and I&#x27;m good to go. No, I don&#x27;t have my full brows yet. But with very minor grooming they&#x27;re shaply, and on their way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously suggest trying this product. I&#x27;ve gotten way more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for 3 days and already has new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d quickly and happy with product</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the rave reviews, I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using, I saw the difference in my lashes.  After a couple of weeks, some people asked me what I had done with my lashes.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This actually helped my eyebrows to become fuller... Some of the regions with sparse hairs have begun to grow in. I&#x27;ve been applying 1-2x/day for about a month now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few weeks and I have seen slight improvement. I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> My daughter and i tested this out for 3 months. We both did not see growth for improvement. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years after seeing the rave reviews on makeupalley.com. It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores so I am glad that Amazon carries it.  In short, it works.  I suffer from thin eyelashes that occasionally fall out.  with consistant use this makes my eyelashes grow in full.  It takes about 4 weeks to see results, but when the lashes start growing in I don&#x27;t need mascara anymore.  I can just use this accelerator as a mascara and still get pronounced lashes.  This is a good night treatment, but just make sure not to gob it on thick.  I find this product will flake, and if it gets in eyes it is very bothersome.  You can&#x27;t really flush the particles out because they blend in the white portion of your reye very well.  Overall it is a grat product and is a cheap alternative to all of the other products that are advertised today.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for like a couple of months and my eyebrows grow back, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it works yet.</li>
            <li> Have used up one tube, but the result leaves much to be desired, but there is a bit of improvement in my brows</li>
            <li> It works! my eyebrows are fuller now and only after a couple of weeks using the product</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple months to regrow over plucked brows. Worked well, but also was using other growth methods - not sure how it would be alone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this really helped me. I was super skeptical when ordering, but I was desperate after my brows have been looking more and more sparse and pathetic. In two weeks my brows were obviously fuller. The formula also works well to keep brows staying put and looking groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this on my eyelashes, but it bothered my eyes. I didn&#x27;t really care, however, since I got this primarily to fix my brows.</li>
            <li> This has really worked to grow and fill out my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10 months and am going to reorder it.  It didn&#x27;t have an effect on growing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Did not seem to do much.  Maybe a couple eyebrow hairs after a year of use.</li>
            <li> I am reporting that this really does work. My eyebrows look fuller thicker. And I&#x27;m def recommending this to all whom want fuller brows</li>
            <li> I ordered this product several months ago - and have been using daily since.  So far, I have seen no results whatsoever.  I will continue to use until it is used up, but I believe that this product does not deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past. It does work for me, it may not work for everyone. The shipping was fast i ordered it on June 25 and got it today June 27. I will continue to use this product and order from this seller when needed.</li>
            <li> Ardel brow and lash growth works.  I use is to my lashes and brows at night and have seen a difference in the hair growth. I am 57 years old and in the past years have seen hair loss in the eye lash and brow area as to be expected.  This product is helping to replace lashed and making my brows thicker.  I have had eye surgery and some products can irritate.  This one does not!!  Very reasonable priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works great! I can see a difference just after applying to my eyebrows two or three nights in a row. I wish the applicator was a bit different, hard to apply to eyebrows though very easy for the eyelashes. I don&#x27;t often use for my eyelashes because at night if I rub my eyes at all it will make them sting. But very good product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hair earned money on this junk.</li>
            <li> Apply to brows 2x daily and lashes 1x with excellent results. One tube lasts over 3 mos. So pleased that no longer need to wear eyebrow pencil when I workout at health club. No longer use mascara just Ardell.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need this. I used this and another lash-lengthening product and ended up with the most success with castor oil from Whole Foods. Apply castor oil to your lash line and brows before bed and wash off in the morning. My lashes were shorter and both my lashes and brows can fall out easily. With castor oil, I noticed that my lashes lengthened and both my brows and lashes are stronger and do not fall out. Don&#x27;t buy this product-- go get castor oil!</li>
            <li> This product works great I use it just for my eyebrows, The only thing is it leaves my eyebrows really oily.</li>
            <li> I used this only for my eyebrows, as over time and constant abuse to my brows, I was left with little to no hair. I applied every night before bed, even when I woke up and a few little hairs popped up. Not really in anywhere useful and eventually the little stubs of hair stopped growing further.  This product could work for some, and its price is extremely good. It just didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Used this for month on both my lashes and also my eyebrows. Saw no visible results. Got the 3 pack, ended up giving one to my sister and throwing half of another one out. Good price but a waste of money since it does  nothing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grow..i been using it for the longest..</li>
            <li> worked fine I guess I don&#x27;t use it-lol</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and be aware using it on your lashes. It stings and takes forever to dry. Made my eyes water and sting.</li>
            <li> This is the best lash and brow conditioner I have ever tried.  i doubt that this makes any follicles growth new lashes but it def conditions your lashes so they are more resilient and don&#x27;t fall out as much hence they grow longer and your lashes look fuller. People who say this doesn&#x27;t work prob have very thin sparse lashes to begin with.  This might help them  a tiny bit but it&#x27;s no latisse- it&#x27;s not going to grow new hairs.  The best thing about this also is that it helps lashes hold a curl from a curler much much more effectively.  I have stick straight stubborn lashes- I actually do lash perms when I can but with this- no need- a curler works just fine.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical. But I&#x27;m going to have to join the crowds of other reviewers who tell you this actually does work. There may be a few people now and then for whom it won&#x27;t, but it worked for me, and fast. Used on eyebrows nightly and saw results with one or two days, to my surprise!</li>
            <li> Works if you keep using it for a while, irritated my eyes quite a bit though</li>
            <li> I have to say that for the price, I&#x27;m impressed.  The sparse areas on my brows have filled in.  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that some of the new hairs growing on my brows grow in a bit wild.  I&#x27;ve had to pluck a few out.  Tried this product on my lashes but it made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I lost my lashes after having eyelash extensions removed and I truly thought they weren&#x27;t going to come back.  They were short, spaced, and stubby for MONTHS.  I found this stuff and based off of the reviews, I bought it.  I have had such great growth!  My lashes look better now than they did before I ever got extensions.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Did nothing, but a good cheap brow gel!</li>
            <li> Eyebrow growth within four days; by a week and a half, all patches were filled in. Amazing product and great value!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! This is my second time ordering (on my 4th tube now), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I gave one tube away to a friend who was getting married so she could grow her lashes longer. I have a hard time remembering to do things at night, so instead I just put this on as I am doing my make up each morning. It makes my mascara go on super smooth, and the clumping isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as when I dont use this. I use it every day on both upper and lower lashes, and have noticed at least a doubling of lenght and thickness. I also use it on my brows, but I am not sure how much of a difference it has made. I mostly use it to tame my eyebrows after I put on my foundation and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told several people about this product, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! If you have short or thin lashes...try it! You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my brows and lashes for 5 days. One of my brows was half-bald, but today I looked in the mirror this morning and set aside my brow pencil! My lashes are beginning to look slightly ridiculous, but I&#x27;m not complaining. My lash and brow hair are already much stronger at the roots, too: haven&#x27;t lost anything to mascara removal for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results after 2 days. It does cause a little morning eye redness, but it&#x27;s nothing that a glass of water doesn&#x27;t clear up. I haven&#x27;t noticed any stinging.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s like a dream come true!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a month ago hoping it would help with the gaps in my eyebrows and am so far not satisfied with it. I have been using this product twice a day and have not seen any results at all. The only reason I was nice and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because it works the same as an eyebrow gel so I&#x27;ll at least use it until it runs out. If out of some miracle I continue using this and it just takes it an extremely long time to work I will fix my review, but right now it&#x27;s not looking like that&#x27;s going to be happening.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
