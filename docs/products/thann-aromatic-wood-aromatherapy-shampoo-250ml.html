            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I ordered all the thann products and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>However, we are using it and are pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last week and find is one of the best shampoos that I have a reused but!</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems fuller and has more body.</li>
            <li>love the product.  </li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo while staying at Marriott Casa Magna in Puerto Vallarta last November, and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>$21 for each, free shipping.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was excellent though and had the great smell and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I first used it at a Hotel in California and fell in love with the scent and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair feel fuller, and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair looked just as good the next day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s delicate on my hair and leaves it smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li>My fine hair did looked great with just a little blow drying.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a musky woodsy scent, mild and not perfume-like.</li>
            <li>The odor lingers on and makes you remember where you where when you first used it!</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with my purchase, but if I am going to consider replacing this as my primary shampoo, I&#x27;d like to see a bigger bottle included for the price, thus the 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner at a Marriott Hotel and instantly fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>Although I really enjoyed using this product while I was traveling, it did not perform the same way when I used it at home.  </li>
            <li>I use this to wash my hair and beard and the fantastic orange smell lasts all day and is fantastic to get the scent wafting around all day long.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this shampoo when I stayed at a Marriott in Kona, Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>I took as many &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; from the hotel as I could, and I was upset when they finally ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shampoo didn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo in small bottles provided at Marriot hotels.</li>
            <li>you have a large shampoo budget, go for it.</li>
            <li>My scalp is not dry anymore, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Tried it at a marriot in Shanghai and it made my hair naturally curly hair so soft and light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the negative reviews i was hesitant to spend the money on this product even though i loved using it at the Marriott.  </li>
            <li>Super shiny and smooth without being weighed down.</li>
            <li>That being said you need very little to get a nice lather going, i would say something around a dime size will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>This was the main reason I bought.</li>
            <li>I was hoping because of the high cost that I would like this product</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There are also a few users who are claiming the quality is subpar but i will let you know right now because i still have a travel size and the full bottle that they are identical in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sample bottle had a much higher quality shampoo and the smell was very strong, which is why i spent $32 here to buy a little bottle.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and slightly citrus-y.  </li>
            <li>Essential oils are expensive and having this product contain a good deal of them naturally dictates a higher than grocery store quality shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We did not realize how far it needed to travel to get to us.</li>
            <li>That being said if you keep an eye on amazon or simply use the Thann website to purchase this product you will find it at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>how soft it made my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is not very thick so be careful when applying it tends to run.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> For a long time, any shampoo that I used, caused my scalp to get dry.  </li>
            <li> I use a little at a time so the bottle will last longer.</li>

            <li> searched to find a bottle, and was a little reluctant to buy due to the price and the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Half of a small hotel bottle for my long, layered and thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Very little bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Far too expensive!</li>
            <li> Poor quality compared to hotel sample.  </li>
            <li> This product is expensive and I hate that I had to give it away, but my hair looked limp when I used it at home.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> For a long time, any shampoo that I used, caused my scalp to get dry.  I tried this shampoo while staying at Marriott Casa Magna in Puerto Vallarta last November, and I loved it!  My scalp is not dry anymore, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Far too expensive! $40 for 250mL of shampoo. It must be laced with Gold or Silver.</li>
            <li> The wife says, &amp;#34;It smells great, and made me want you more&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Tried it at a marriot in Shanghai and it made my hair naturally curly hair so soft and light. I use a little at a time so the bottle will last longer. I&#x27;ve tried everything on my hair from apple cider vinegar to salon brand shampoo and this is what works for me. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I was hoping because of the high cost that I would like this product but unfortunately I was disappointed. Shampoo didn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo in small bottles provided at Marriot hotels. This was the main reason I bought. But to add to this, the shampoo itself made my hair very rough as I was trying to lather. I couldn&#x27;t use this shampoo without next using conditioner because of the texture my hair after using shampoo. I would not recommend..just grab a couple of bottles from hotel if you like his shampoo. I have shoulder length brown curly hair as information.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I ordered all the thann products and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Try them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this product.  We did not realize how far it needed to travel to get to us. However, we are using it and are pleased.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner at a Marriott Hotel and instantly fell in love with the product. My fine hair did looked great with just a little blow drying. I did not need to use any product for the volume and bounce I got. My hair looked just as good the next day. I immediately bought the product from the Thann online site. $21 for each, free shipping. That seems to be the best deal around.</li>
            <li> I tried this in a hotel - incredible shampoo! GREAT deal here on Amazon....</li>
            <li> Although I really enjoyed using this product while I was traveling, it did not perform the same way when I used it at home.  This product is expensive and I hate that I had to give it away, but my hair looked limp when I used it at home.</li>
            <li> nice but not as nice an aroma as I hoped it would be. thank you</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative reviews i was hesitant to spend the money on this product even though i loved using it at the Marriott.  There are also a few users who are claiming the quality is subpar but i will let you know right now because i still have a travel size and the full bottle that they are identical in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the review of the actual product.  The shampoo is not very thick so be careful when applying it tends to run.  That being said you need very little to get a nice lather going, i would say something around a dime size will do the trick.  I use this to wash my hair and beard and the fantastic orange smell lasts all day and is fantastic to get the scent wafting around all day long.  I would buy this shampoo again in a heartbeat.  In regards to people saying this product is overpriced are evaluating the value of this product in an obtuse way.  Essential oils are expensive and having this product contain a good deal of them naturally dictates a higher than grocery store quality shampoo.  That being said if you keep an eye on amazon or simply use the Thann website to purchase this product you will find it at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAMPOO....</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I first used it at a Hotel in California and fell in love with the scent and how soft it made my hair. I came home and looked it up on the internet and ordered it.  It is a little pricey but worth it. I also bought the conditioner and body lotion, The scent is sooo nice, it has a citrus base and is very addicting. Will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a musky woodsy scent, mild and not perfume-like. Leaves hair soft and shiny.  I used it at a Marriott hotel and immediately bought some.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it it relaxes me. The odor lingers on and makes you remember where you where when you first used it! In a spa some place, maybe Thailand. Makes you want to go back!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great!  The price is not!  Very little bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Just like the hotel shampoo but totally over-priced for the small amount you get.</li>
            <li> Tried this and the conditioner at Marriott and my hair felt better than it has in years!! Super shiny and smooth without being weighed down. I just wish it were cheaper. I didn&#x27;t need much. Half of a small hotel bottle for my long, layered and thick wavy hair. At this price I may just have to swipe them off of the housekeeping cart.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last week and find is one of the best shampoos that I have a reused but! There is always a bug and this but is the reason that I have given it to stars, it is based solely on the shipping. It takes forever to ship the product from Thailand. Hopefully these distributors will be able to get around this problem and builds up stocks here in the US for this great product. If it were not for the shipping today I would give this product five stars every day. Hopefully this problem will be rectified and the next time I review it I will give it five stars without hesitation. That is the end my review hopefully it meets the minimum word count for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  My hair seems fuller and has more body.</li>
            <li> Poor quality compared to hotel sample.  The sample bottle had a much higher quality shampoo and the smell was very strong, which is why i spent $32 here to buy a little bottle.  I would definitely not purchase this product again and do not recommend anyone use this shampoo.  The conditioner was excellent though and had the great smell and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!! I used it at the Marriott never have I fallen in love with a shampoo and conditioner!!! It gets 5 plus a million more stars! You will love it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo...one of the best I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel fuller, and clean. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  The scent is light and slightly citrus-y.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, plus it&#x27;s delicate on my hair and leaves it smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> love the product.  Was pricey</li>
            <li> I first discovered this shampoo when I stayed at a Marriott in Kona, Hawaii.  I took as many &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; from the hotel as I could, and I was upset when they finally ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched to find a bottle, and was a little reluctant to buy due to the price and the size of the bottle.  I am overall happy with my purchase, but if I am going to consider replacing this as my primary shampoo, I&#x27;d like to see a bigger bottle included for the price, thus the 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a large shampoo budget, go for it.</li>
            <li> This has the best scent ever!  I wish it was sold everywhere!</li>
