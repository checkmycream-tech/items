            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This product is the best!</li>
            <li>sally hansen is a very good brand.</li>
            <li>Takes off the polish good!</li>
            <li>These are great for your hands--not drying-smells nice--extra holes for you to use to remove nail color--but there is no brush for your toes....</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>GREAT IDEA.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>Price is good, too.</li>
            <li>But it is a good remover</li>
            <li>The formula seems pretty garden variety, perfectly acceptable remover.  </li>
            <li>I bought a 24 pack of nail polish and it came in handy</li>
            <li>Nice Kwik</li>
            <li>I suppose if you have a very secure place to keep it</li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe they think the bottle looks better that way.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>If it was a grittier sponge it may have worked better.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love glitter nail polishes</li>
            <li>It does have a marginally better scent than some removers</li>
            <li>but you do want to be able to have faith in the cap.  </li>
            <li>and I decided I would not get any more.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good (don&#x27;t say that often for nail polish remover) and works really well to take off polish.</li>
            <li>this stuff is really cool!</li>
            <li>IT IS EASY TO USE AND CLEANER AREA</li>
            <li>This remover is good quality and it is quick off for real ...  </li>
            <li>Removes polish effectively and cuticles feel soft after use.  </li>
            <li>Took a chance based on the other reviews and they seem happy with it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly (2 days) a reason to buy from seller again.</li>
            <li>it ran out quickly</li>
            <li>I do feel like I had to refill it quickly</li>
            <li>but overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy and smells</li>
            <li>Really nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really great for removing glitter polish because the sponge is too soft, and it takes a while to remove regular polish with this.</li>
            <li>Its pretty cool all you have to do is dip yr fingers in the jar, but that doesn&#x27;t the nail polish will come off just like that.</li>
            <li>I just use old wash clothes to take off nail polish usually, it works best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I works very  well!</li>
            <li>For me this is the sort of thing that ends up laying around my night stand over night and if it gets somehow knocked over by cats, children, or clumsiness it will leak and it will damage pretty much anything it happens to leak on.  </li>
            <li>Product worked very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it takes the polish off so fast.</li>
            <li>the price was cheap enough</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>but they are an absolute pain to remove.</li>
            <li>This nailpolish remover works really well and really fast - so much better than other ones I&#x27;ve bought from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>You can get more for less, the sponge doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>but yes it does make the job a little more easier</li>
            <li>but it is still a cloying chemical smell covered by some sort of powerful perfume which will give you a headache if you don&#x27;t wash your hands all the same.  </li>
            <li>This product contains a very soft sponge in a plastic jar of acetone.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li>I only wonder how fast will the container collect the polish?</li>
            <li>is only half way filled in the jar.</li>
            <li>The polish remover wasn&#x27;t bad, it worked nicely though I think it smelled stronger than most other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The way this particular product works, without leaving the tips of your finger and your nails feeling dry, is beyond me.</li>
            <li>As I was curious to see if this particular product would work, I purchased it at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I live where is very dry,</li>
            <li>I paint my nails very frequently and had been curious about this style of nail polish remover.  </li>

            <li> As I was curious to see if this particular product would work, I purchased it at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I live where is very dry,</li>
            <li> I paint my nails very frequently and had been curious about this style of nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> inside stains and doesn&#x27;t last very long, won&#x27;t buy again, go back to bottle</li>
            <li> I usually go through a lot of cotton balls to get the polish off, but this stuff made it so easy stick your finger in and swish swish and no more polish!</li>
            <li> so, my hands get very dry, especially after removing nail polish.</li>
            <li> picture deceiving, read carefully you are only purchasing one jar</li>
            <li> Obviously you want to be careful with any remover</li>
            <li> The sponge is so very soft it&#x27;s hard for it to grip your nails or grip the polish and take it off.</li>
            <li> The sponge hardly worked in removing the nail polish, my guess is because it was too soft.</li>
            <li> Off nail color remover, works well as expected.</li>
            <li> only objection I have with this and the reason I will not be buying it again is because the cap leaks even if you screw it on very tightly every time.  </li>
            <li> Plus it takes up half the jar and the polish remover</li>
            <li> I like the non mess</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed that because I expected to or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to put a little work in it.</li>
            <li> So, I will purchase again, because it even removes heavy glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li> The sponge has a few openings to slip your fingertips into and once in, you just swirl and soak for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> then you will have very little risk.  </li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing as I thought I was getting two jars and only received one.  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR ACRYLIC NAILS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there is nothing wrong with the formula itself.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I ordered,will order again</li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing as I thought I was getting two jars and only received one.  It works fine, but won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> There are two in the picture, but you only get one. Should be obvious form the description. So why do they picture two? Who knows, maybe they think the bottle looks better that way. Bought this for my wife and daughter the last time I got the \\&quot;we&#x27;re out of nail polish remover\\&quot;. Took a chance based on the other reviews and they seem happy with it. I like the price.</li>
            <li> Really nice, especially for the price. Smells really good (don&#x27;t say that often for nail polish remover) and works really well to take off polish.</li>
            <li> These are great for your hands--not drying-smells nice--extra holes for you to use to remove nail color--but there is no brush for your toes....which is the only downside....</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is product that i choose for my nails. This remover is good quality and it is quick off for real ...  You need to try!</li>
            <li> sally hansen is a very good brand. picture deceiving, read carefully you are only purchasing one jar&lt;br /&gt;sponge inside stains and doesn&#x27;t last very long, won&#x27;t buy again, go back to bottle</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly (2 days) a reason to buy from seller again. Product worked very well. Was just as instructions of product said. It only took about 20-30 seconds for polish to be removed, had to go back in for smaller sections but overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the non mess it ran out quickly I bought a 24 pack of nail polish and it came in handy</li>
            <li> Fast, easy and smells okay. I can&#x27;t believe it takes the polish off so fast. I only wonder how fast will the container collect the polish? I will purchase again. I recommend you give it a try. Price is good, too.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I was under the impression by the picture that it came with two bottles but I only received the 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR ACRYLIC NAILS. THIS  SAVES ON COTTON BALLS.  IT IS EASY TO USE AND CLEANER AREA AFTER YOU ARE DONE.  GREAT IDEA.</li>
            <li> As I was curious to see if this particular product would work, I purchased it at the grocery store. I works very  well! I live where is very dry, so, my hands get very dry, especially after removing nail polish. The way this particular product works, without leaving the tips of your finger and your nails feeling dry, is beyond me. So, I will purchase again, because it even removes heavy glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li> This in my opinion is a rip off sort of. The sponge is so very soft it&#x27;s hard for it to grip your nails or grip the polish and take it off. Plus it takes up half the jar and the polish remover is only half way filled in the jar. The sponge hardly worked in removing the nail polish, my guess is because it was too soft. If it was a grittier sponge it may have worked better. I just use old wash clothes to take off nail polish usually, it works best in my opinion. The polish remover wasn&#x27;t bad, it worked nicely though I think it smelled stronger than most other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this. You can get more for less, the sponge doesn&#x27;t work well etc I&#x27;ll stick with bottles of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Takes off the polish good! Just have to put your fingers in longer then advertised!</li>
            <li> picture misleading, there is only 1 not 2. the price was cheap enough and I figured there was only 1. it works very well and i didnt feel like it overdried my fingers.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really great for removing glitter polish because the sponge is too soft, and it takes a while to remove regular polish with this. But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love glitter nail polishes but they are an absolute pain to remove. This product contains a very soft sponge in a plastic jar of acetone. The sponge has a few openings to slip your fingertips into and once in, you just swirl and soak for a few seconds. Works great!</li>
            <li> The formula seems pretty garden variety, perfectly acceptable remover.  It does have a marginally better scent than some removers but it is still a cloying chemical smell covered by some sort of powerful perfume which will give you a headache if you don&#x27;t wash your hands all the same.  But it is a good remover and I like these sponge removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only objection I have with this and the reason I will not be buying it again is because the cap leaks even if you screw it on very tightly every time.  Obviously you want to be careful with any remover but you do want to be able to have faith in the cap.  For me this is the sort of thing that ends up laying around my night stand over night and if it gets somehow knocked over by cats, children, or clumsiness it will leak and it will damage pretty much anything it happens to leak on.  If you are like me and like to keep this thing laying about then this can end in disaster.  I would also imagine that having a leaky lid would contribute to evaporation.  I do feel like I had to refill it quickly but I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed that because I expected to or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t just the one I ordered either, it is something I have observed over the course of 2 jars of it until the 2nd jar caused permanent damage to my floor and I decided I would not get any more.  I suppose if you have a very secure place to keep it then you will have very little risk.  However it only takes one slip up to cause disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is nothing wrong with the formula itself.</li>
            <li> This product is the best!</li>
            <li> Its pretty cool all you have to do is dip yr fingers in the jar, but that doesn&#x27;t the nail polish will come off just like that. You have to put a little work in it. like actually use a cotton n rub it off. but yes it does make the job a little more easier</li>
            <li> this stuff is really cool! I usually go through a lot of cotton balls to get the polish off, but this stuff made it so easy stick your finger in and swish swish and no more polish!</li>
            <li> This nailpolish remover works really well and really fast - so much better than other ones I&#x27;ve bought from the drugstore. Plus, it was the same price through Amazon prime as if I had bought it at a store.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  Removes polish effectively and cuticles feel soft after use.  I would recommend this product to all use use nail polish.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails very frequently and had been curious about this style of nail polish remover.  This remover worked very well, however, after only a few uses, the product changed color (based on the polish I had removed) and the sponge started to rip.  Compared to a bottle of polish and a paper towel, the value just wasn&#x27;t there to buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice Kwik Off nail color remover, works well as expected.</li>
            <li> makes taking off nail polish a breeze!  will definitely repurchase!</li>
