            <li>Love it this smells wonderful</li>
            <li>Smells good though</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on your hair though, which is good.</li>
            <li>, you just spray one or two pumps &amp; walk into the list or let it just fall into your hair; the healthy look is incredible.</li>
            <li>good for hair and smells very sexy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try more OGX products!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>My hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Love this light weight spray and smells soo good</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.</li>
            <li>So most of it wouldn&#x27;t be on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My curls will also be frizz free if I choose to have that hairstyle!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t needed a hair cut in many months.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It comes in a bottle with a spray nozzle on top</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the ends of my hair look stronger.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>my hair was so damaged and so many split ends before using this for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>will be purchasing more soon</li>
            <li>So light, smells great, so much better control in a spray than straight oil applied with your hands.</li>
            <li>Many can easily be misled by non-informative labels and lack of information in item description.</li>
            <li>I have really fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>that poofs a fine mist of product.</li>
            <li>It works out good with my hair which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like you&#x27;re misting with air, so it&#x27;s VERY EASY to overdo it, as I learned on my first time trying this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is really light.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling so soft :)</li>
            <li>Oil-based products can be far more healthy for your hair than conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the spray is more of a mist</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fly away, split ends, and lots of breakage due to the coloring and heat styling.  </li>
            <li>I like it in the morning when I put it on, but by evening it makes my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and this is a second purchase, the first bottle from a different seller worked great, the sprayer on this bottle doesn&#x27;t spray ...</li>
            <li>spray top better than expected.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a huge Organix fan because my hair has never felt this soft.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;d go to the top of my head last.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair, I could already tell a difference because it really tamed the frizz!</li>
            <li>After a month of daily placing a squirt or 3 on my hands, and then running it through my hair (mostly on the ends)</li>
            <li>First ingredient is mineral oil, then isopropyl myristate, then argan oil.</li>
            <li>DEfiantly will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is easily weighted down, but this product doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Considering what other similar products are priced at this is great</li>
            <li>Not only do they smooth the cuticle, but they penetrate the hair shaft to help fill in the microscopic weak spaces of a damaged strand of hair, making it softer, more flexible, more elastic and shiny.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not as much humidity in the air in the cooler months</li>
            <li>It has really helped my split end</li>
            <li>If you are looking for real argan oil, this is not it.</li>
            <li>Too much will leave your hair looking greasy and</li>
            <li>It gives you shiny healthy hair and seems to prevent frizz in wet weather.</li>
            <li>Didnt really like it</li>
            <li>Really good stuff, helps my dry hair problem !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying the other products in this line, since there are so many and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong, fake smell, like cheap drugstore perfume.</li>
            <li>all they can ever hope to do for your hair is smooth a rough and damaged cuticle (covers the hair shact).  </li>
            <li>The hair on top of a person&#x27;s scalp is made of dead cells.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful with how much you put on because if you put to much your hair will get greasy.</li>
            <li>Nothing will ever restore my 18 year old locks...</li>
            <li>am completely sold on this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is so light I can use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>my hair is so shiny and soft and no split ends.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, just a few puffs and it makes my hair feels much softer and looks very shiny, with no fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Only the hair still inside your skin (the root) is alive.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s too hot to mess with.</li>
            <li>Which would normally be a hot mess!</li>
            <li>If I need a little bit more,  I won&#x27;t hesitate to put a little on my hair when it is dry too.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>So far this oil has revive my dry coarse hair.</li>

            <li> I proceeded to section my hair off and use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> my hair has back that long lost shine,  body, and strength that I&#x27;ve lacked for so long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Once the hair leaves the scalp, it cannot grow and is not alive.  </li>
            <li> The hair not only breaks and splits, but becomes extremely pourous, soaking in every manner of damaging chemical  and stinky odor around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it became very dry</li>
            <li> and it was a big frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Or just make my head a big oily mess.</li>
            <li> This will hopefully help prevent further damage and add a little shine.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It made my limp, weak hair silky, shiny and stronger after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that this list includes a few other oils, various coloring, fragrance, and preservative ingredients.</li>
            <li> i use the coconut serum, then when my hair is half dry, i spray on this.</li>
            <li> It does not leave hair feeling greasy, and did not make my hair frizzy like other products.</li>
            <li> I am 44 and have grey and heavily color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the smell of this unbelievable (I would wear this scent as a Perfume) but my hair is silky, shiny, and I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> Still skeptical I proceeded to use 2 sprays again onto the palm of my hands and put it onto my hair from mid to ends and whatever was left, I would put onto my head.</li>
            <li> It is thick and dry and can take a ton of oil without getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> But I love to straighten my hair in the cooler months because it&#x27;s not so miserable to blow dry and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I used a couple of sprays in the palm of my hand, rubbed my palms together and put it on my towel dried damp hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> it gives the hair a luxurious shine Without the heavy oily look.</li>
            <li> so that helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I got this because I dyed my hair quite a few times the past few months</li>
            <li> At least state on the front of the bottle that it is scented.</li>
            <li> cuz I was sick of the length and flat ironed my hair</li>
            <li> Earlier in the week I just saw frizz and had to go through with the rest of my hair to finish the disaster of all bad hair days!</li>
            <li> I did half my head and was so shocked to see how well it worked!</li>
            <li> However, oil is always BAD news because.</li>
            <li> must admit that I&#x27;m shocked by this product&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed about that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great quality Argan Oil that smells good!. It does not leave hair feeling greasy, and did not make my hair frizzy like other products. This product helps my scalp stay moisturized after all the products I put in it.</li>
            <li> I like it in the morning when I put it on, but by evening it makes my hair super greasy. Smells good though and I use occasionally now.</li>
            <li> I have really fine curly hair. But I love to straighten my hair in the cooler months because it&#x27;s not so miserable to blow dry and straighten my hair. Summer time means I go curly cuz it&#x27;s too hot to mess with. There&#x27;s not as much humidity in the air in the cooler months so that helps tame the frizz. I got my hair cut short cuz I was sick of the length and flat ironed my hair and it was a big frizzy mess. A dear friend of mine let me use this spray. She has thicker hair and it&#x27;s just wavy as opposed to curly. Being different hair types I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me. Or just make my head a big oily mess. It smells great, and it disappears as soon as you spray it. I used a couple of sprays in the palm of my hand, rubbed my palms together and put it on my towel dried damp hair after my shower. I put the oil mid to ends of my hair and then I&#x27;d go to the top of my head last. So most of it wouldn&#x27;t be on my scalp. After blow drying my hair, I could already tell a difference because it really tamed the frizz! Which would normally be a hot mess! Still skeptical I proceeded to use 2 sprays again onto the palm of my hands and put it onto my hair from mid to ends and whatever was left, I would put onto my head. I proceeded to section my hair off and use the flat iron. My hair looked amazing! I did half my head and was so shocked to see how well it worked! Earlier in the week I just saw frizz and had to go through with the rest of my hair to finish the disaster of all bad hair days! After using this spray in the spring humidity, I will actually have a different hair style for an option in humid weather! My curls will also be frizz free if I choose to have that hairstyle!</li>
            <li> So light, smells great, so much better control in a spray than straight oil applied with your hands.</li>
            <li> Looks and sprays on like regular oil; but is not oily. Makes hair shine and feels as though just washed.</li>
            <li> My face loves it, good under makeup in cold weather!</li>
            <li> Im NOT a fan of potions or creams for the hair, or the skin.  The hair on top of a person&#x27;s scalp is made of dead cells.  Once the hair leaves the scalp, it cannot grow and is not alive.  Only the hair still inside your skin (the root) is alive. Once your hair shafts become damaged, they stay damaged, weakening the hair, causing further damage.  The hair not only breaks and splits, but becomes extremely pourous, soaking in every manner of damaging chemical  and stinky odor around.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioners, emollients,  treatments... all they can ever hope to do for your hair is smooth a rough and damaged cuticle (covers the hair shact).  This will hopefully help prevent further damage and add a little shine.  Oil-based products can be far more healthy for your hair than conditioners.  Not only do they smooth the cuticle, but they penetrate the hair shaft to help fill in the microscopic weak spaces of a damaged strand of hair, making it softer, more flexible, more elastic and shiny.  Conditioners cannot do that.  However, oil is always BAD news because. .., well, it is oily!!  It makes your hair look like you haven&#x27;t washed it in a week!&lt;br /&gt;  This argon oil treatment, however,  this amazing oil treatment, does miraculous things to hair!  I am 44 and have grey and heavily color treated hair.  My hair has always been fly away, split ends, and lots of breakage due to the coloring and heat styling.  Nothing will ever restore my 18 year old locks... but this product has come the closest thing yet to a fountain of youth for my hair.  After a month of daily placing a squirt or 3 on my hands, and then running it through my hair (mostly on the ends) my hair has back that long lost shine,  body, and strength that I&#x27;ve lacked for so long.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I&#x27;m shocked by this product&#x27;s effectiveness.  I actually like my hair again!  The best part about it is I&#x27;m getting ALL of the benefits of oil without the 50s greaser look!  My hair isn&#x27;t greasy AT ALL  it&#x27;s just shiny, silky, tamed, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely sold on this oil.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got brittle, fly away, or color damaged hair like me, you wont regret using this product too!&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, I just massage a few squirts into my freshly washed and towel dried hair.  If I need a little bit more,  I won&#x27;t hesitate to put a little on my hair when it is dry too.&lt;br /&gt;Very very satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> My hair is amazing.  It is thick and dry and can take a ton of oil without getting greasy.  This oil is so light I can use it everyday.  It has really helped my split end and I haven&#x27;t needed a hair cut in many months.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling so soft :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Perfect oil spray without the weight. Left my hair shiny and silky!</li>
            <li> This is NOT argan oil. First ingredient is mineral oil, then isopropyl myristate, then argan oil. After that this list includes a few other oils, various coloring, fragrance, and preservative ingredients. If you are looking for real argan oil, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Its great and none greasy ....</li>
            <li> I love all Organix Products!! I bouht this plus coconot oil mist as well and m hair as never felt more silkier and look shinier than ever!! DEfiantly will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> They made no attempt to disclose that this smells like perfume. Many can easily be misled by non-informative labels and lack of information in item description. At least state on the front of the bottle that it is scented.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make hair oily</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL with this stuff. Just a little goes a long, long way. It comes in a bottle with a spray nozzle on top that poofs a fine mist of product. It almost feels like you&#x27;re misting with air, so it&#x27;s VERY EASY to overdo it, as I learned on my first time trying this stuff. Too much will leave your hair looking greasy and awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just a few puffs and it makes my hair feels much softer and looks very shiny, with no fly-aways. I have fine hair that is easily weighted down, but this product doesn&#x27;t do that. It just makes my hair look... better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con for me is the scent. It&#x27;s a very strong, fake smell, like cheap drugstore perfume. It doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on your hair though, which is good. Overall, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, only because I don&#x27;t like the scent. I&#x27;ll be trying the other products in this line, since there are so many and the ingredients in them are all essentially the same, just with different fragrance.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a huge Organix fan because my hair has never felt this soft. I got this because I dyed my hair quite a few times the past few months and it became very dry and I started to freak out so I started using this. Not only is the smell of this unbelievable (I would wear this scent as a Perfume) but my hair is silky, shiny, and I&#x27;m a believer! I will so be rebuying this for how it treated my hair and the smell, in love!!!!</li>
            <li> spray top better than expected.</li>
            <li> It gives you shiny healthy hair and seems to prevent frizz in wet weather. It is also not at all sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but a little goes a long way...it gives the hair a luxurious shine Without the heavy oily look. I really like that the spray is more of a mist, you just spray one or two pumps &amp; walk into the list or let it just fall into your hair; the healthy look is incredible.</li>
            <li> works great on frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> It made my limp, weak hair silky, shiny and stronger after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use this!  I&#x27;m going to try more OGX products!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the ends of my hair look stronger. Just be careful with how much you put on because if you put to much your hair will get greasy.</li>
            <li> i use the coconut serum, then when my hair is half dry, i spray on this. good for hair and smells very sexy</li>
            <li> So far this oil has revive my dry coarse hair. I absolutely love it! Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Works great. When I recieved it, the bottle was leaking. I was disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> great product. It works out good with my hair which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Considering what other similar products are priced at this is great</li>
            <li> Love this light weight spray and smells soo good</li>
            <li> Didnt really like it I felt like made my hair drier.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and this is a second purchase, the first bottle from a different seller worked great, the sprayer on this bottle doesn&#x27;t spray ... so the PRODUCT itself is great, but the packaging on this one is faulty. Otherwise it would be 5 star.</li>
            <li> Love it this smells wonderful</li>
            <li> my hair was so damaged and so many split ends before using this for a couple weeks. my hair is so shiny and soft and no split ends. i love this stuff!! will be purchasing more soon</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  It is really light.  It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down at all.  It leaves the hair shiny and frizz free.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, helps my dry hair problem !!!!!!!</li>
