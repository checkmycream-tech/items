            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>I was unimpressed by this matte top coat over most colors I tried.</li>
            <li>Drying time is ok, I have not kept track before</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish matte.</li>

            <li>I love this because I use any polish and put this on top.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love having a matte finish on my nails.</li>
            <li>I feel like my nails still chip just as often as without this top coat.</li>
            <li>I thought the bottle was going to be bigger, but its still an awesome matte.</li>
            <li>I got this mini version because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product.</li>
            <li>It is rated the top matte top coat out there</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear the nail polish under and works on top of most colors</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than opi matte color</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like a top coat</li>
            <li>Looked at many reviews and decided to purchase this one because others I found were on the pricey side</li>
            <li>This China Glaze Matte Magic Top Coat is really useful!!</li>
            <li>and I loved it from the first coat.</li>
            <li>Really useful!!</li>
            <li>I read about this particular one in a nail blog, so it is supposed to be a fairly good matte top coat.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li>it also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>But still it was easy to use, lasted about a day or two before it started to wear off.</li>
            <li>but I would gladly pay $4.99 again because it&#x27;s such a great product.</li>
            <li>a very light coat will do the job and it drys so quick i don&#x27;t have to worry about messing up my nails anymore.</li>
            <li>Only need one coat and it looks beautiful</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t run over.  </li>
            <li>but overall it works great</li>
            <li>Love this polish sooo much!</li>
            <li>It was worth it!</li>
            <li>Good size brush that covers your entire nail, super light weight/non-sticky, mattifies with one coat, and is super fast-dry.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time over white nail polish and it looks great and matte.  </li>
            <li>I found that OPIs were matte when you first put them on but after any type of activity, washing hands, petting your pet, and especially putting on lotion, the matte effect was diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cool.  </li>
            <li>I never had matte nail polish and this top coat really help a lot to making my nails matte.</li>
            <li>I really like this matte top coat.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a full size bottle for the prize but didn&#x27;t realize I ordered a mini bottle which is kinda pricy.</li>
            <li>This is a much better investment than purchasing individual matte colors and it looks especially pretty when used over glitter polish.</li>
            <li>It dries rather quickly and leaves the polish texture feeling almost like rubber.  </li>
            <li>Quick drying, and durable.</li>
            <li>ok naked glaze better</li>
            <li>Besides, with this product, my polish started to crack 3 days after aplication, since it normally lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li>But this works really well when I am in the mood for a matte design, it even gives a cool effect when used over glitter polish!</li>
            <li>I just wish I liked the matter-look a little more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nice effect but not a strong top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can turn any of my polishes into matte with this, the price was a bit better than some of the other brands I saw, and nail salons use this brand so I was sold.</li>
            <li>, Was so excited it came really</li>
            <li>Looks nice and flat.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t use a fast dry shiny top coat like Seche Vite on top</li>
            <li>And i think that seller sold this at a cheap rate as i live in a place that don&#x27;t sell china glaze at all.</li>
            <li>its not bad, like it has really good matting but its sooo small.</li>
            <li>It works really well and the finish it very pretty.</li>
            <li>You may want to apply this matte polish over a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>I like that this is a tinier bottle size than regular fingernail polish because I mostly prefer glossy nails vs. matte.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>This was the first matte nail polished</li>
            <li>Which is probably the first time you&#x27;ve ever heard somebody say that.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the bottle is so small, but this really is the best Matte top coat I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Although, its a lot smaller than I expected, but it works great.</li>
            <li>When applied directly on top of nail color, the tips of my polish looked very worn after only a day.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that even though I spilt the entire bottle by accident!</li>
            <li>I got this to use for a comic book nail design, works really well.</li>
            <li>I am truly happy that I didn&#x27;t spend big bucks on other brands.  </li>
            <li>Tried with black polish and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I heard that other brands rub off easily, which makes no sense!</li>
            <li>I have recently really gotten into the matte look, and now I can matte out the designs that really need it.</li>
            <li>Makes any nail polish i put on very matte without taking away from the color.</li>
            <li>I really like this matte.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really works</li>
            <li>but I still really like this one.</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>makes a nice matte finish, WARNING: container is much smaller than regular china glaze polishes.</li>
            <li>The only downside would be that the bottle was half the size, but it worked AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li>The only downside to Matte magic is that the finish does not last as long as Essie&#x27;s version, however, the lower price more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>With this top coat, all you have to do is reapply every other day to keep your manicure matte.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of other matte top coats</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other matte top coats</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a steal for the price turns out its super tiny</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to waste as much money if I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Loved how it makes my nails look but upset at the size because its smaller than usual nailpolish bottles</li>
            <li>normally lasts for me</li>
            <li>Its not the size of a normal bottle but almost sample size.</li>
            <li>i have only tried it a few times and i am loving this</li>
            <li>The only hitch about this product is that I didn&#x27;t read the guide saying that it isn&#x27;t a full sized bottle (totally my fault)</li>
            <li>I love it when I do the black matte french tip.  </li>
            <li>I love using it with black and red nail polishes</li>
            <li>So in that respect, it&#x27;s not  great product, but if you just want a nice matte finish</li>
            <li>While it looks cool over grays (and some golds), it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>but I give it at least 10 minutes to not ruin it while doing light tasks.</li>
            <li>It also dulls the color and causes the mani to chip faster than normal.  </li>
            <li>i paid too much for this little thing</li>
            <li>the matte coat is very matte, can make some colors look a little dry/ powdery</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the bottle is so small, but this really is the best Matte top coat I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Although, its a lot smaller than I expected, but it works great.</li>
            <li> When applied directly on top of nail color, the tips of my polish looked very worn after only a day.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that even though I spilt the entire bottle by accident!</li>
            <li> I got this to use for a comic book nail design, works really well.</li>
            <li> I am truly happy that I didn&#x27;t spend big bucks on other brands.  </li>
            <li> Tried with black polish and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I heard that other brands rub off easily, which makes no sense!</li>
            <li> I have recently really gotten into the matte look, and now I can matte out the designs that really need it.</li>
            <li> Makes any nail polish i put on very matte without taking away from the color.</li>
            <li> I really like this matte.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really works</li>
            <li> but I still really like this one.</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> makes a nice matte finish, WARNING: container is much smaller than regular china glaze polishes.</li>
            <li> The only downside would be that the bottle was half the size, but it worked AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> The only downside to Matte magic is that the finish does not last as long as Essie&#x27;s version, however, the lower price more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> With this top coat, all you have to do is reapply every other day to keep your manicure matte.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of other matte top coats</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other matte top coats</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a steal for the price turns out its super tiny</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to waste as much money if I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Loved how it makes my nails look but upset at the size because its smaller than usual nailpolish bottles</li>
            <li> normally lasts for me</li>
            <li> Its not the size of a normal bottle but almost sample size.</li>
            <li> i have only tried it a few times and i am loving this</li>
            <li> The only hitch about this product is that I didn&#x27;t read the guide saying that it isn&#x27;t a full sized bottle (totally my fault)</li>
            <li> I love it when I do the black matte french tip.  </li>
            <li> I love using it with black and red nail polishes</li>
            <li> So in that respect, it&#x27;s not  great product, but if you just want a nice matte finish</li>
            <li> While it looks cool over grays (and some golds), it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> but I give it at least 10 minutes to not ruin it while doing light tasks.</li>
            <li> It also dulls the color and causes the mani to chip faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> i paid too much for this little thing</li>
            <li> the matte coat is very matte, can make some colors look a little dry/ powdery</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that warned me it would be small and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> It came early and it wasn&#x27;t dried up or anything.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, and the main reason why it got as low as 3 stars is because people were not happy with the size.</li>
            <li> Its leaves ur polish looking totally matte, dried evenly without any streaks and didn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (dark blue, black, red, pink).</li>
            <li> I just wish the bottle was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> With this, you can make any polish matte and it isn&#x27;t rough.  </li>
            <li> I will use it on the days when I&#x27;m going to be at a day party or something, not really for night life.</li>
            <li> so i wuldnt pay $6 for something so small overall</li>
            <li> every day/ every other day.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to dry</li>
            <li> It is not the average size of a nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shine once its dried.</li>
            <li> i use it when i paint my nails black a lot</li>
            <li> It gave a slight matte finish but not what I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> With some polishes it also appears to slightly change the polish colour (beyond what you would expect in a matte topcoat).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a half size bottle</li>
            <li> When looking at the bottle, it looked like the bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it game in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> but I find that unless I apply a heavy coat the brush doesn&#x27;t distribute the polish evenly and I end up with glossy streaks.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s longer than plain nail polish</li>
            <li> , so I was a tad disappointed that it is NOT the full sized bottle - a small sample version</li>
            <li> It is like a mini bottle but its not that small.</li>
            <li> Well.... The seller does state that the product size is .325 ounces (Usually polishes</li>
            <li> just a bit too small!</li>
            <li> You might want to order 2 bottles, they are very small.</li>
            <li> but I hate how rough they feel</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product itself.  </li>
            <li> The bad: The matte look itself is an acquired taste.</li>

            <li> this creates a great matte effect.  I love it when I do the black matte french tip.  It goes on so smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t run over.  it arrived on time and in great condition</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cool.  I just used it for the first time over white nail polish and it looks great and matte.  I&#x27;m really happy with it I just wish the bottle was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It turns nail polish matte.  However, glossy nail polish not as matte as non glossy ones.  I would buy it and recommend it. Love it.</li>
            <li> makes your color matte. i use it when i paint my nails black a lot and it make them look so nice. it also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> China Glaze&#x27;s version of the matte topcoat is one of the best around. I purchased this product after trying some of OPIs matte collection. I found that OPIs were matte when you first put them on but after any type of activity, washing hands, petting your pet, and especially putting on lotion, the matte effect was diminished greatly. With this top coat, all you have to do is reapply every other day to keep your manicure matte. This is a much better investment than purchasing individual matte colors and it looks especially pretty when used over glitter polish. The only downside to Matte magic is that the finish does not last as long as Essie&#x27;s version, however, the lower price more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best matte nail polish. It came early and it wasn&#x27;t dried up or anything. One thing you have to know is that it isn&#x27;t the same size as the regular China Glaze. It is like a mini bottle but its not that small. It didn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s still awesome! :)</li>
            <li> This polish does turn your polish into matte but it doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping. Maybe try a topcoat before the matte magic. I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, according to my daughter. When looking at the bottle, it looked like the bottle was not full. You might want to order 2 bottles, they are very small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product like this and I&#x27;m so happy I found this.  Great way to do matte/shiny nail art.</li>
            <li> This China Glaze Matte Magic Top Coat is really useful!! I never had matte nail polish and this top coat really help a lot to making my nails matte. It gives a very nice finishing touch. Having this top coat is better than having all the matte colour in the world as this top coat works on all nail polish, all brands and all nails!!!!    Really useful!! And i think that seller sold this at a cheap rate as i live in a place that don&#x27;t sell china glaze at all.</li>
            <li> Loved how it makes my nails look but upset at the size because its smaller than usual nailpolish bottles so i wuldnt pay $6 for something so small overall it did the job thats all that matters</li>
            <li> The good: I like this top coat best over gray nail polish. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking, consistency, drying time, or drastic color changes. This product works well in that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It dries rather quickly and leaves the polish texture feeling almost like rubber.  The bad: The matte look itself is an acquired taste. I was unimpressed by this matte top coat over most colors I tried. While it looks cool over grays (and some golds), it doesn&#x27;t last very long. You may want to apply this matte polish over a regular top coat. When applied directly on top of nail color, the tips of my polish looked very worn after only a day.</li>
            <li> this is awesome. a very light coat will do the job and it drys so quick i don&#x27;t have to worry about messing up my nails anymore.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a matte topcoat.  And I like it a lot for nude fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note it comes in a half-size bottle, which is not what I was expecting.  But I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderfull! just a bit too small! It works really well and the finish it very pretty. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> It gave a slight matte finish but not what I was trying to achieve. It was still to bright for me so I&#x27;ll be trying a different matte.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool! It gives you the nail polish protection that you want, without the shine! Looks completely natural and it feels great on the nails!</li>
            <li> I like that this is a tinier bottle size than regular fingernail polish because I mostly prefer glossy nails vs. matte.  But this works really well when I am in the mood for a matte design, it even gives a cool effect when used over glitter polish!</li>
            <li> fab nail polish. mattifies any nail color. i you can draw with a glossy color over it for nail art.</li>
            <li> its not bad, like it has really good matting but its sooo small. i paid too much for this little thing</li>
            <li> Nice effect but not a strong top coat. Requires touch ups every day/ every other day. Drying time is ok, I have not kept track before but I give it at least 10 minutes to not ruin it while doing light tasks.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! I have recently really gotten into the matte look, and now I can matte out the designs that really need it. I am very impressed and will most certainly be buying again!</li>
            <li> Amazing matte top coat. Get the matte polish look on any polish color you already own. Tried with black polish and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish matte. I just wish that it game in a bigger bottle. I love it so much that even though I spilt the entire bottle by accident! Accident by dog tail! I just had to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> The product works well but I find that unless I apply a heavy coat the brush doesn&#x27;t distribute the polish evenly and I end up with glossy streaks. With some polishes it also appears to slightly change the polish colour (beyond what you would expect in a matte topcoat).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the bottle is so small, but this really is the best Matte top coat I&#x27;ve seen. I heard that other brands rub off easily, which makes no sense! Anyways it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a steal for the price turns out its super tiny but overall it works great I love using it with black and red nail polishes</li>
            <li> I really like this matte top coat.  It does gorgeous things to shiny polish.  I like the way matte polish looks but I hate how rough they feel, it makes me want to pick at it.  With this, you can make any polish matte and it isn&#x27;t rough.  It does take a little while to dry and you can&#x27;t use a fast dry shiny top coat like Seche Vite on top or it brings back the shine as if you never used the matte topcoat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a half size bottle but it&#x27;s worth it.  I have a couple of other matte top coats but this is the one I like the best.</li>
            <li> Makes any nail polish i put on very matte without taking away from the color. Quick drying, and durable. I like it better than my glossy top coat. Gotta reapply once a week or so but that&#x27;s longer than plain nail polish normally lasts for me so this is great. Amazing buy!</li>
            <li> Was Just what i wanted. It lookis just like the pic, Was so excited it came really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> This was the first matte nail polished I purchased and it does its job.  Will be purchasing another one later.</li>
            <li> I love this because I use any polish and put this on top. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m just in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this polish sooo much! I need to buy more! It comes in handy so often I use it all the time</li>
            <li> The matte efect is really great! But lasted just 3 days on my nails. Besides, with this product, my polish started to crack 3 days after aplication, since it normally lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale for 2 dollars and it works drys very fast and is a perfect thickness. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Its perfect i have only tried it a few times and i am loving this so much right now its great</li>
            <li> The only downside would be that the bottle was half the size, but it worked AMAZINGLY! It was worth it! Good price too !! :)</li>
            <li> I love having a matte finish on my nails. I don&#x27;t like the shiny look. Which is probably the first time you&#x27;ve ever heard somebody say that. Although, its a lot smaller than I expected, but it works great. I feel like my nails still chip just as often as without this top coat. So in that respect, it&#x27;s not  great product, but if you just want a nice matte finish then it&#x27;s a great top coat.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a full size bottle for the prize but didn&#x27;t realize I ordered a mini bottle which is kinda pricy. It does work really nice from what I swatched.</li>
            <li> I really like this matte. Excellent product. I thought the bottle was going to be bigger, but its still an awesome matte. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product itself.  It does exactly what it claims.  I just wish I liked the matter-look a little more.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that warned me it would be small and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. Its not the size of a normal bottle but almost sample size. But still it was easy to use, lasted about a day or two before it started to wear off. I will use it on the days when I&#x27;m going to be at a day party or something, not really for night life.</li>
            <li> I got this mini version because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product. I got it in the mail and I loved it from the first coat. It is rated the top matte top coat out there and I definitely understand why. Good size brush that covers your entire nail, super light weight/non-sticky, mattifies with one coat, and is super fast-dry. Doesn&#x27;t smear the nail polish under and works on top of most colors I&#x27;ve used (dark blue, black, red, pink). Definitely recommend it. Even this mini version has a lot of product in it.</li>
            <li> This top coat goes on very smoothly, and makes the matte look GREAT! The only hitch about this product is that I didn&#x27;t read the guide saying that it isn&#x27;t a full sized bottle (totally my fault), so I was a tad disappointed that it is NOT the full sized bottle - a small sample version - but I would gladly pay $4.99 again because it&#x27;s such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s really works and it&#x27;s better than opi matte color I like chalk ok naked glaze better and it&#x27;s like a top coat</li>
            <li> It also dulls the color and causes the mani to chip faster than normal.  Pay attention to sizing...I didnt realize I was getting such a tiny bottle for the price.  It is not the average size of a nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> This topcoat looks good, isn&#x27;t streaky, and is priced well. I would definitely recommend this product, and the main reason why it got as low as 3 stars is because people were not happy with the size. Well.... The seller does state that the product size is .325 ounces (Usually polishes are about .5 ounces and that&#x27;s what people tend to expect!).</li>
            <li> I got this to use for a comic book nail design, works really well. Looks nice and flat. I read about this particular one in a nail blog, so it is supposed to be a fairly good matte top coat. I&#x27;ve never tried any other matte top coats but I still really like this one.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can turn any of my polishes into matte with this, the price was a bit better than some of the other brands I saw, and nail salons use this brand so I was sold. I just tried it last night but I am very happy with how my nails look now! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a perfect matte polish. Looked at many reviews and decided to purchase this one because others I found were on the pricey side and I didn&#x27;t want to waste as much money if I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the outcome. I was totally happy when I used it. Its leaves ur polish looking totally matte, dried evenly without any streaks and didn&#x27;t take long to dry. I am truly happy that I didn&#x27;t spend big bucks on other brands.  If your looking for a great matte polish that you can apply to any of the nail polishes you already have, get this one.  Absolutely no shine once its dried. Will definitely buy another one</li>
            <li> makes a nice matte finish, WARNING: container is much smaller than regular china glaze polishes. the matte coat is very matte, can make some colors look a little dry/ powdery but it does what it says. drys quick and looks great in contrast to shiny glossy colors.</li>
            <li> This product works very well i definitely will use it a lot. Only need one coat and it looks beautiful</li>
