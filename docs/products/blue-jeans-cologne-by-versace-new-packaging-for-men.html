            <li>Sappy but true.</li>
            <li>This perfum smells too sweet</li>
            <li>Cool stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a very manly, sexy aroma without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>bought this as a present for my boyfriend he loved</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good on my husband, this fragrance is a definite buy I guarantee you will like.</li>
            <li>am very well satisfied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and the scent lasts longer than any other cologne I have.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, its not to strong or to light its subtle and sexy I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Blue Jeans is a Nice Cheap Cologne for Men</li>
            <li>and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good clean masculine scent that is not overly muscular</li>
            <li>With a very, very hot weather, I&#x27;ve tested this perfume persistence in the outdoors temperature (30-34C) and under air conditioner temperature (17-22C).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Good price, delivered at home,  fresh  sweet-spicy (maybe cinnamon) stay for long on my skin.</li>
            <li>My thanks to all involved!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that stays on strong on body&amp;clothes, lasts onto the next day, and more of a club/bar going out cologne, then this is not it.  </li>
            <li>I like colognes that smell fresh and crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, this cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li>Has the same amazing smell that u remember.</li>
            <li>This cologne is great for everyday use and for all occasions.  </li>
            <li>Nice and lasting smell!</li>
            <li>currenly use it as car fresh</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if Amazon sent the real Blue Jeans by Gianni Versace.  </li>
            <li>women back then really liked it...</li>
            <li>I love the soft smell of this cologne...</li>
            <li>I wear regular Versace when I go somewhere nice.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend it for people that like a fresh smell</li>
            <li>complimentary by the woman</li>
            <li>I hit the right product and received it fast!!</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>My husband has a very sensitive skin, but this is the only one he uses and loved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but powerful but also light enough for women to wear too.</li>
            <li>The bottle was intact, full, and still had its cap on, that&#x27;s all I really cared about.</li>
            <li>great perfume that denotes a male couple in daily use fragrance both day and evening</li>
            <li>A Classic!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>very fast congratulate</li>
            <li>IT IS A SCENT MY HUSBAND HAS PURCHASED MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND RECEIVES COUNTLESS COMPLIMENTS ON.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for several years now and even to-date it smells better then</li>
            <li>AMAZON BETTER TAKE THIS BACK AND GIVE ME MY MONEY!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Blue Jeans in the morning.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Blue is one of my favorites and definitely my favorite Versace Cologne.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne since 2001, when I first found it in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It is not a fake product, but talking about its container it leaves a lot to be desired...  </li>
            <li>Smells great and last long</li>
            <li>My search for an oriental perfume lasting more than 48 hours continues.</li>
            <li>My hubby mentioned he used to love this back in the day.</li>
            <li>Perfect product name since it goes well on casual Friday.  </li>
            <li>when I grabbed it for the first time the bottle fell down, the good is that it&#x27;s made of a very resistent glass and didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>I bought Blue jeans back in 1998, and ever since it has been my safe go-to perfume.&lt;br /&gt;crisp, intriguing, and unique.</li>
            <li>Happy late, thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t take long to get here either:)</li>
            <li>It does stay on close quite well especially jackets or jeans, I often use those multiple times before washing them and friends still manage to smell this sensational fragrance on me.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the quick deliver of this item.</li>
            <li>After training him to only use one spray (he&#x27;s a multi-sprayer), this cologne is just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a milder Armani Black mixed lightly with Izzy Miyake.    </li>
            <li>Suggest purchasing the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; for personal use to save a little money if you don&#x27;t care about the top (or save the top from one of your bottles to reuse) or gift canister.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>A lot of people are unfamiliar with it, but are very intrigued once they smell it</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>it is a gift for my BF&#x27;s birthday, and he really loves it and use it every day with me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have been wearing pricey colognes my whole working career.</li>
            <li>the package came ups fast and very well reccomended</li>
            <li>I got the product from Amazon and sprayed it on myself and it smelled really soapy.</li>
            <li>But that really didn&#x27;t matter to me since I don&#x27;t need or even want the cannister.  </li>
            <li>Im really desapointed</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and not the real thing</li>
            <li>Makes me smell good at least thats what a women told me once</li>
            <li>It is clean and just a little sweet - but very manly!</li>
            <li>Wish the scent would not dissipate as quickly as it does but for the price, you\ can spritz many times over the course of the day knowing you can just buy a new bottle for less than 20 bucks on Amazon whenever you run out!</li>
            <li>of course the price remained the same as my original order.</li>
            <li>I have had more poeple give compliments on this cologne than any other in my life.</li>
            <li>nice smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>the blue jeans is for a special night out.</li>
            <li>This is the true blue juice!</li>
            <li>More or less body spray.  </li>
            <li>Stays on your body more than on your clothes, and it won&#x27;t be noticeable the next day or even several hours from the time you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Genuine product and delivered quickly as per usual.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This has gotten none so far, which is unusual.</li>
            <li>It smells very husky and masculine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to last all night but not too strong where people are rolling down the windows in the car to let you know they are gagging.</li>
            <li>live in Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li>so I compared it with the new one.</li>
            <li>got it for my new guy</li>
            <li>I always purchase a new bottle when I finish.</li>
            <li>My husband complained and said the knock off was better than the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Everybody loves the smell&amp; it last on clothes I had on days ago ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, remember, there&#x27;s no second chance to create a _first impression</li>
            <li>I first came across Blue Jeans by Versace years ago, by a friend who had it on.</li>
            <li>This brings back many memories EDT, so my score is due to this.</li>
            <li>Appropriate for business casual but more geared toward a blue jeans and</li>
            <li>Something cool about it is that when I go outside, the perfume&#x27;s scent seems to increase, so when you use public transport (bus, train), you are well</li>
            <li>This is the first perfume my Dad gave me far back 1997.</li>
            <li>I have seen Versus Blue Jeans in the store and have been anxious to buy it, I found it on this website and am pleased with the delivery, fast and at the time they said it would arrive, it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m don&#x27;t see myself using fragrances that makes me smell like my grandma, but on the other hand, I don&#x27;t want to walk by to a cemetery and awake those who rest in peace with such a strong and penetrable smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft fragance for any time you wish</li>
            <li>Years later found it for very affordable price on web.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is just old.</li>
            <li>The smell never gets old and I get compliments all of the time about it.</li>
            <li>Its not too masculine (brut)</li>
            <li>I remember this from the early 90s.</li>
            <li>i always order this for my son at christmas  he has worn v. blue jeans since high school and is 30 now  and still loves it gets lots of complements</li>
            <li>so I bought another one when my first one was empty.  </li>
            <li>As expected fast shipment !</li>
            <li>different to what I normally wear.</li>
            <li>It must have actually broke free because the cannister lid was missing and part of the box had been cut out and taped over.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think it compares to CK&#x27;s (very old school)</li>
            <li>it draws me to him like no other perfume does.</li>
            <li>My other 8 years old grandson wants me to order one for him also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old female.</li>
            <li>Versace/Versus Blue Jean is an old and inexpensive cologne, so for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve noticed (a positive thing) that under hot weather, it is a little bit stronger, so you will be well differentiated from those around you smelling like wet</li>
            <li>, it took me a long time to find a new scent I would buy online (sifting through reviews not just on amazon).</li>
            <li>exotic and yet subtle!</li>
            <li>Classic cologne,and last all day long.</li>
            <li>should not even get one star, read all the reviews, made sure that the right product was ordered, and they still sent a knock off of what I specifically ordered, this is absolute crap, shame on amazon for deceiving the public and ripping people off.</li>
            <li>and I still received an imitation rather than the real thing.....</li>
            <li>Its my favorite fragance, i can purchase other and other and other</li>
            <li>Then you should look for the expensive ones like (Versace Pour homme), which i bought too but very rarely wear, due to its strong and long lasting</li>

            <li> I love the smell of Blue Jeans in the morning.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Blue is one of my favorites and definitely my favorite Versace Cologne.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since 2001, when I first found it in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> It is not a fake product, but talking about its container it leaves a lot to be desired...  </li>
            <li> Smells great and last long</li>
            <li> My search for an oriental perfume lasting more than 48 hours continues.</li>
            <li> My hubby mentioned he used to love this back in the day.</li>
            <li> Perfect product name since it goes well on casual Friday.  </li>
            <li> when I grabbed it for the first time the bottle fell down, the good is that it&#x27;s made of a very resistent glass and didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I bought Blue jeans back in 1998, and ever since it has been my safe go-to perfume.&lt;br /&gt;crisp, intriguing, and unique.</li>
            <li> Happy late, thanks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to get here either:)</li>
            <li> It does stay on close quite well especially jackets or jeans, I often use those multiple times before washing them and friends still manage to smell this sensational fragrance on me.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quick deliver of this item.</li>
            <li> After training him to only use one spray (he&#x27;s a multi-sprayer), this cologne is just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a milder Armani Black mixed lightly with Izzy Miyake.    </li>
            <li> Suggest purchasing the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; for personal use to save a little money if you don&#x27;t care about the top (or save the top from one of your bottles to reuse) or gift canister.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> A lot of people are unfamiliar with it, but are very intrigued once they smell it</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> it is a gift for my BF&#x27;s birthday, and he really loves it and use it every day with me</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have been wearing pricey colognes my whole working career.</li>
            <li> the package came ups fast and very well reccomended</li>
            <li> I got the product from Amazon and sprayed it on myself and it smelled really soapy.</li>
            <li> But that really didn&#x27;t matter to me since I don&#x27;t need or even want the cannister.  </li>
            <li> Im really desapointed</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and not the real thing</li>
            <li> Makes me smell good at least thats what a women told me once</li>
            <li> It is clean and just a little sweet - but very manly!</li>
            <li> Wish the scent would not dissipate as quickly as it does but for the price, you\ can spritz many times over the course of the day knowing you can just buy a new bottle for less than 20 bucks on Amazon whenever you run out!</li>
            <li> of course the price remained the same as my original order.</li>
            <li> I have had more poeple give compliments on this cologne than any other in my life.</li>
            <li> nice smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> the blue jeans is for a special night out.</li>
            <li> This is the true blue juice!</li>
            <li> More or less body spray.  </li>
            <li> Stays on your body more than on your clothes, and it won&#x27;t be noticeable the next day or even several hours from the time you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Genuine product and delivered quickly as per usual.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This has gotten none so far, which is unusual.</li>
            <li> It smells very husky and masculine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to last all night but not too strong where people are rolling down the windows in the car to let you know they are gagging.</li>
            <li> live in Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li> so I compared it with the new one.</li>
            <li> got it for my new guy</li>
            <li> I always purchase a new bottle when I finish.</li>
            <li> My husband complained and said the knock off was better than the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Everybody loves the smell&amp; it last on clothes I had on days ago ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, remember, there&#x27;s no second chance to create a _first impression</li>
            <li> I first came across Blue Jeans by Versace years ago, by a friend who had it on.</li>
            <li> This brings back many memories EDT, so my score is due to this.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for business casual but more geared toward a blue jeans and</li>
            <li> Something cool about it is that when I go outside, the perfume&#x27;s scent seems to increase, so when you use public transport (bus, train), you are well</li>
            <li> This is the first perfume my Dad gave me far back 1997.</li>
            <li> I have seen Versus Blue Jeans in the store and have been anxious to buy it, I found it on this website and am pleased with the delivery, fast and at the time they said it would arrive, it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m don&#x27;t see myself using fragrances that makes me smell like my grandma, but on the other hand, I don&#x27;t want to walk by to a cemetery and awake those who rest in peace with such a strong and penetrable smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft fragance for any time you wish</li>
            <li> Years later found it for very affordable price on web.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just old.</li>
            <li> The smell never gets old and I get compliments all of the time about it.</li>
            <li> Its not too masculine (brut)</li>
            <li> I remember this from the early 90s.</li>
            <li> i always order this for my son at christmas  he has worn v. blue jeans since high school and is 30 now  and still loves it gets lots of complements</li>
            <li> so I bought another one when my first one was empty.  </li>
            <li> As expected fast shipment !</li>
            <li> different to what I normally wear.</li>
            <li> It must have actually broke free because the cannister lid was missing and part of the box had been cut out and taped over.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think it compares to CK&#x27;s (very old school)</li>
            <li> it draws me to him like no other perfume does.</li>
            <li> My other 8 years old grandson wants me to order one for him also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old female.</li>
            <li> Versace/Versus Blue Jean is an old and inexpensive cologne, so for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve noticed (a positive thing) that under hot weather, it is a little bit stronger, so you will be well differentiated from those around you smelling like wet</li>
            <li> , it took me a long time to find a new scent I would buy online (sifting through reviews not just on amazon).</li>
            <li> exotic and yet subtle!</li>
            <li> Classic cologne,and last all day long.</li>
            <li> should not even get one star, read all the reviews, made sure that the right product was ordered, and they still sent a knock off of what I specifically ordered, this is absolute crap, shame on amazon for deceiving the public and ripping people off.</li>
            <li> and I still received an imitation rather than the real thing.....</li>
            <li> Its my favorite fragance, i can purchase other and other and other</li>
            <li> Then you should look for the expensive ones like (Versace Pour homme), which i bought too but very rarely wear, due to its strong and long lasting</li>
            <li> Persistence:&lt;br /&gt;This perfume last for a long time in your skin without actually choking or giving the sensation that you drank it instead of applying it to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last too long</li>
            <li> Such a grear men&#x27;s cologne I will buy this as long as its made</li>
            <li> It smells a little like Versace Blue Jeans, but Versus is not the same;  there is no holding, lasting scent like Versace Blue Jeans</li>
            <li> the cap on the cylinder packaging is a little wobbly and won&#x27;t completely keep put.</li>
            <li> the smell does wonder that it  does justice,  even a little go a long way I have this in my collection since early 2000 and will continue to buy the Cologne</li>
            <li> very affordable price for a cologne that is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> He had been in search of it for a long time</li>
            <li> I will buy this cologne for as long as I can find it...</li>
            <li> , their scent remains long hours keeping the smell.</li>
            <li> Oh, the bottle must be pretty tough to have survived the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little like cologne but last as long as Axe body spray.  </li>
            <li> , i could have bought it at Ross Dress for less store and pay only 19.99.</li>
            <li> the same  perfume picture,  but milder odor than the previous one had these.</li>
            <li> poooooor quality it does not original blue jeans.</li>
            <li> Eternity with a subtle touch of powder freshness creating a new scent that belongs to anyone&#x27;s collection.  </li>
            <li> On time with absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> ITS BY VERSUS AND ITS NOT REAL...</li>
            <li> My go-to daily scent for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Will working retail a few years back</li>
            <li> in between we were forced to buy some other scent (due to the fact that we live in europe and could not find it)</li>
            <li> The can is now made of a very weak material, in fact, even when the package came with the air filled plastic bag, all the cans (4) came with small dents on them, and 1 of those, which I will keep for myself, was not adjusted making the lid be always loose...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other fragrances but the quality of this</li>
            <li> and it wont overpower you or other people&#x27;s desks or food.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews that said to beware that an imitation may be sent rather than what is ordered.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT RIGHT...</li>
            <li> We used to buy it when he was stationed in California, but hard to find back home in Illinois.  </li>
            <li> More people besides you will notice that you are using perfume, but no to the point of being annoying to anyone.</li>
            <li> yea it comes off as confusing in the initial spray but after 10 mins and it settles down the scent</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and its a scent too sharp and overbearing!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the expensive colognes I have</li>
            <li> Even by me after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> OMG just got this product delivered a few hours ago</li>
            <li> I gave it to him for Xmas and head has worn it everyday since.</li>
            <li> This scent by Versace has that distinct smell that you never get sick of and always draws you in.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about if it was original or fake.</li>
            <li> At least, the other 3 will be a gift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied this cologne. ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne for the past couple years.</li>
            <li> Not sexy in anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost unfair to review colognes, because everyone has different tastes.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten tired of it</li>
            <li> Its very subtle and not overpowering</li>
            <li> I received a fake version made by \\&quot;Versus\\&quot; instead of Versace.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with that!</li>
            <li> Smells expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this cologne.</li>
            <li> It is for casual wear and for every day.</li>
            <li> and i recommend it for casual and semi-formal uses.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s always versus now</li>
            <li> Very disappointing..</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that Amazon did this to me too.  </li>
            <li> , man was I wrong!!!!...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cologne smells very good. I like the protective case it has because I have a cluttered dresser.  I&#x27;ve dropped it before and since I had it in the aluminum case, it didn&#x27;t break the glass.</li>
            <li> I hit the right product and received it fast!!</li>
            <li> this was exactly what i was looking for, great turn around time and in good conditions. I appreciate it. thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. This colone is the best. My husband has a very sensitive skin, but this is the only one he uses and loved. Will be odering more soon</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, we all wear cologne because either it attracts the ladies or because we want to cover up our stink. This cologne is great for both. It&#x27;s strong enough to last all night but not too strong where people are rolling down the windows in the car to let you know they are gagging. It&#x27;s a light fruity smell with a bit of a deeper musk. Appropriate for business casual but more geared toward a blue jeans and tshirt kind of rugged man. I dress more preppy, but this suits me just fine. Oh, and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT FRAGRANCE FOR MEN. VERSUS IS A DESIGNER FRAGRANCE, A DESIGNER I HAVE SEEN ON MANY ITEMS, SO IT IS NOT A KNOCK OFF OF ANY KIND.  IT IS A SCENT MY HUSBAND HAS PURCHASED MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND RECEIVES COUNTLESS COMPLIMENTS ON.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend as a surprise. He was looking for it all over. i love when he puts it on.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling man&#x27;s cologne and this was the best price I found it.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased Versace&#x27;s Blue Jeans... Personally, I think it compares to CK&#x27;s (very old school) Eternity with a subtle touch of powder freshness creating a new scent that belongs to anyone&#x27;s collection.  I have found Blue Jeans will last the day without reapplication and believe it is a scent for all age groups and fits any occasion.  At Amazon&#x27;s price, it is a great value.  4.2 stars..</li>
            <li> Nice and lasting smell! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, it brings a lot of memories. It is for casual wear and for every day.</li>
            <li> On time with absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - great price!</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, this cologne is amazing. I keep getting it. Never do I meet people or have friends that use it. Yet girls will always ask what scent I have. one went out and bought it for her man! Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied this cologne. ...</li>
            <li> should not even get one star, read all the reviews, made sure that the right product was ordered, and they still sent a knock off of what I specifically ordered, this is absolute crap, shame on amazon for deceiving the public and ripping people off.</li>
            <li> Over all good product , quick shipping , smell works great for just about any situation weather it&#x27;s jeans or a suit , haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product .worth the prize ...</li>
            <li> always a great gift for the price</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews that said to beware that an imitation may be sent rather than what is ordered. Very disappointed that Amazon did this to me too.  I paid special attention to what I ordered to be sure I wasn&#x27;t getting a knock-off and I still received an imitation rather than the real thing.....of course the price remained the same as my original order. From now on I will be sure to listen to all of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since 1998 and just went through my 2nd bottle.  Compliments galore when I wear it.  I&#x27;m glad I found it at one of my favorite online merchants at a great price.</li>
            <li> This cologne was a birthday gift for my brother. He had been in search of it for a long time so I decided to look for it here and I found it. He was so surprised and happy! Didn&#x27;t take long to get here either:)</li>
            <li> I tried Versace Blue Jeans Cologne for the 1st time in 2004 and have loved it since.  I think it has a very pleasant smell to it, and I have received numerous compliments about it as well.  A lot of people are unfamiliar with it, but are very intrigued once they smell it, that is how I got hooked.  It has a very unique scent that is pleasant, comforting, and definitely starts a conversation.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but doesn&#x27;t live-up to the hype. Smells too sweet, reminds me of Stetson or something. I know a cologne is a winner when I get multiple compliments regarding it. This has gotten none so far, which is unusual.</li>
            <li> Well balanced fragance for morning specially for the weekends.....</li>
            <li> Very good! thank you...</li>
            <li> More or less body spray.  Smells a little like cologne but last as long as Axe body spray.  currenly use it as car fresh</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at a casino gift shop and liked the fragrance very much.  It was exspensive.  I looked on Amazon and found it for 1/2 the price so I bought another one when my first one was empty.  Great product, great price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh, clean smell. A Classic!! Have been using this for several years now and even to-date it smells better then most colognes that are out there.</li>
            <li> This scent by Versace has that distinct smell that you never get sick of and always draws you in. Girls love it. I love it. Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Soft fragance for any time you wish</li>
            <li> Everybody loves the smell&amp; it last on clothes I had on days ago ;)</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes i wear. been wearing it for over 10 years...since i was 14 and love it, girls love it. one of those signature scents.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT RIGHT... I ORDERED THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND IT CAME TODAY. ITS NOT VERSACE...ITS BY VERSUS AND ITS NOT REAL... IM SO UPSET. AMAZON BETTER TAKE THIS BACK AND GIVE ME MY MONEY!</li>
            <li> Came in a box and it smells great</li>
            <li> Smells great. A bit pricey but if you&#x27;re into designer perfume, this makes an instant buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas after he requested it.  After training him to only use one spray (he&#x27;s a multi-sprayer), this cologne is just fine.</li>
            <li> Very loud .But makes good car fresh .&lt;br /&gt;Stays on untill you take a shower the next day.I don&#x27;t care for that.</li>
            <li> This item sucked.  My husband could never use it because the sprayer stopped working after he used it once.</li>
            <li> I bought Blue jeans back in 1998, and ever since it has been my safe go-to perfume.&lt;br /&gt;crisp, intriguing, and unique.</li>
            <li> Feels like a Lana del Rey song. But seriously, I love this EDT. Has always been one of my favorites. Just like blue jeans, &#x27;Blue Jeans&#x27; never goes out of style...</li>
            <li> THIS WAS FAST AND SURE SHIPPING, SO I LIKE TOO MUCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOHNNY</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last too long but it smells good.</li>
            <li> My cologne arrive in well-protected packaging and in perfect, new condition. I&#x27;ve worn Blue Jeans years ago, and now I&#x27;m wearing it again. I just love the scent! My thanks to all involved!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance. I love this!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling cologne that ever have.</li>
            <li> it is a gift for my BF&#x27;s birthday, and he really loves it and use it every day with me</li>
            <li> Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Versace Versace Versace quality of the product great, usage everyday,would recommend to any one because it has an exquisite aroma to it</li>
            <li> Its alright nothing compares to Versace man or Eros</li>
            <li> Genuine product and delivered quickly as per usual.</li>
            <li> Smells great at a great price. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> when my husband and i started dating 6 years ago i already loved his blue jeans versace. in between we were forced to buy some other scent (due to the fact that we live in europe and could not find it) it never was quite the same. i love the smell of it. it draws me to him like no other perfume does. love it!!!</li>
            <li> excellent seller. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Great present, love the smell... not to strong, not too soft, just perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> Whenever my dear husband puts on Blue Jeans - I say to him \\&quot;Come here and kiss me\\&quot;.  Sappy but true.</li>
            <li> I was dissappointed because i ordered two (2) of this cologne because I click on $16 dollars and some cents so i put in two, when i got my order it was only one and i paid $28 for 1 bottle, i could have bought it at Ross Dress for less store and pay only 19.99. This is price 19.99 at Ross, so when i saw so many prices choice I choose and click on the $16 something, but i was charge more than it was advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband complained and said the knock off was better than the real thing.  He said he did not like the smell of it,  It did not have the same fragrance as the knock off.  Should have gotten the knock off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product i recommend it</li>
            <li> I always purchase this cologne for my dad, brother and special friends in my life. Always Classic, The first &amp; best</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my boyfriend and he loved it. I even love the smell! I would recommend this to any male</li>
            <li> the gianni versace blue jeans is a 1st. class cologne  as befits the name of the maker. this is not an every day kind of thing. the blue jeans is for a special night out. exotic and yet subtle!</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if Amazon sent the real Blue Jeans by Gianni Versace.  I received a fake version made by \\&quot;Versus\\&quot; instead of Versace.  Then I couldn&#x27;t get in touch with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Blue Jeans in the morning.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember a time when I got an aftersmell (just like aftertaste) so I was intrigued. It&#x27;s kind of a milder Armani Black mixed lightly with Izzy Miyake.    I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it, it took me a long time to find a new scent I would buy online (sifting through reviews not just on amazon).</li>
            <li> This perfum smells too sweet I hate it.</li>
            <li> my boy is smelling good loved that this is his first cologne, girls are going gaga over him now lol</li>
            <li> Its my favorite fragance, i can purchase other and other and other</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance, my brother is very happy, lasting quality, very satisfied with the product, received in excellent condition, so I rated it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quick deliver of this item. thank you amazon. I bought this item for my husband and he loves wearing it and I love the smell on him. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, I took achance on it and love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great this was the best back in the 90&#x27;s I luv it</li>
            <li> Makes me smell good at least thats what a women told me once</li>
            <li> sweet smelling Cologne , perfect packaging the bottle itself is an I grabber . the smell does wonder that it  does justice,  even a little go a long way I have this in my collection since early 2000 and will continue to buy the Cologne well recommended seller hope to do business with again soon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better colognes that I own. The thing I love about it most, is that it literally lasts me the whole day. On average I work an 8-8.5 hour shift (morning to afternoon) and this cologne never loses its smell. A VERY good choice.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have had more poeple give compliments on this cologne than any other in my life.</li>
            <li> already know for those who like they flavor turned  all the way up without the over kill cant wait to see it</li>
            <li> Good price and very nice ascent.</li>
            <li> good afternoon, I feel comfortable with the seller of this fragrance, its smell simepre liked and also offer plenty of variety, very good presentation, prices and deliveries are excellent. I&#x27;ve had other fragrances but the quality of this is very good. Happy late, thanks</li>
            <li> I buy this for my teen boys, it;s perfect and excellent sent. They are so proud to receive it.Packaging is perfect for the guys.Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was in like 7th grade and it was under the Versace name. I still get compliments on it all the time. Great scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing smell, for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as described. Beats hitting up the mall if you aren&#x27;t in a pinch.  Lovin&#x27; Amazon Smile :-)!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cologne and a GREATER value!!!.... I use 2 wear it years ago and I thought it was discontinued, man was I wrong!!!!...</li>
            <li> The price was so good I had to buy it. $20.00 And that included shipping !!!!</li>
            <li> I got one of these and am about to get another. Cool stuff. I was skeptical about if it was original or fake.</li>
            <li> great item will buy again smells great</li>
            <li> This is the true blue juice! yea it comes off as confusing in the initial spray but after 10 mins and it settles down the scent is ahead turner love it one of a kind nothing else smells Like it</li>
            <li> Blue is one of my favorites and definitely my favorite Versace Cologne. The price is steep but I love the fragrance, it&#x27;s like aroma therapy for me...ha ha ha It&#x27;s like walking into the Yankee Candle store and Bath and Body Works or a gourmet coffee shop like starbucks.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Got it in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Persistence:&lt;br /&gt;This perfume last for a long time in your skin without actually choking or giving the sensation that you drank it instead of applying it to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Dominican Republic. With a very, very hot weather, I&#x27;ve tested this perfume persistence in the outdoors temperature (30-34C) and under air conditioner temperature (17-22C). Something cool about it is that when I go outside, the perfume&#x27;s scent seems to increase, so when you use public transport (bus, train), you are well covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage:&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere and trail of the perfume are well balanced. More people besides you will notice that you are using perfume, but no to the point of being annoying to anyone. Again, I&#x27;ve noticed (a positive thing) that under hot weather, it is a little bit stronger, so you will be well differentiated from those around you smelling like wet monkeys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal taste:&lt;br /&gt;For me, this scent works perfectly. I&#x27;m don&#x27;t see myself using fragrances that makes me smell like my grandma, but on the other hand, I don&#x27;t want to walk by to a cemetery and awake those who rest in peace with such a strong and penetrable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well balanced. You smell like a man and the combination of this scent and your personal odor might just create the perfect signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, remember, there&#x27;s no second chance to create a _first impression_ so try to make your best at the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells awsome !!!! Love it on my hubby</li>
            <li> I love this scent, my lady loves this scent. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the expensive colognes I have but it sure gets the compliments. Many great scents out there to choose but my lady loves me in this one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Legit product at an amazingly low price.</li>
            <li> I bought a cologne I used to wear in 95. The nostalgia &amp; the memories were overwhelming. Versace blue jeans..memories..I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I first came across Blue Jeans by Versace years ago, by a friend who had it on. I loved it. Years later found it for very affordable price on web. Received it in good time, but, no one can smell it. Even by me after a few minutes. Very disappointing.. Maybe it is just old.</li>
            <li> esta colonia llega en mal estado del envase casi se rompe la colonia</li>
            <li> nice perfume fast service</li>
            <li> Never switching. This is IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have been wearing pricey colognes my whole working career. This is a \\&quot;Bugati Veyron\\&quot; for the price of a Corvette.</li>
            <li> Love this product can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. It has a very manly, sexy aroma without being overpowering. One bottle lasts him several months. Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Good cuality great perfume.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!!!!! This fragrance is a defiant buy!!  Buy it now!!!! I hope it is always on the market.  I very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. I hope the Versus/Versace issue has been resolved. People think Versus is a knock-off, but it is actually a brand of Versace. **Google is our friend**</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance whether for work or play</li>
            <li> Amazing smell! Bought this becausr my father use to buy it. Has the same amazing smell that u remember.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> agradable, para diario no es penetrante al contrario suave</li>
            <li> Feeling fresh again :). I got two this time so there&#x27;s not fighting over it!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. I absolutely love this fragrance. Very sexy, smells amazing. Ladies will lolve this on their man.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, its not to strong or to light its subtle and sexy I absolutely love it. Also for those questioning the Versus part, versus is a company owned by versace and the label starts versus versace and thats because it is both. This fragrance is authentic!</li>
            <li> En realidad el producto no llegado a mis manos, no me percate que los perfumes son un problemas para despacharlos a otros paises. Necesito una soluci&amp;oacute;n pronto</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Good stuff.. From am to pm</li>
            <li> This is a unique scent that brings fond memories to me. Glad it&#x27;s still available now in a cheaper format.</li>
            <li> My go-to daily scent for a few years now. 1 spray on the wrists, rub together, rub the wrists on neckline and it creates a fantastic scent that lasts for most of the day and doesn&#x27;t overpower. I get compliments on it quite often.</li>
            <li> I love it. been wearing it since 1998..... Before I met  my wife... women back then really liked it... and my wife says she likes it....So I guess it&#x27;s good to go...</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. I would buy this again and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice smelling cologne</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite scents, i have been using it for years, it&#x27;s light and sweet, everyone comments on how much they like it too.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne for the past couple years. The smell never gets old and I get compliments all of the time about it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time when I was younger, But they stopped making it under versace name.  I had no idea that this was the same stuff.  Smells just like it should, and at a way better price.  Would recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> As expected fast shipment ! Nice sofa cent not overpowering , my son loves it</li>
            <li> Nice for every day use.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Smell very good!!</li>
            <li> great smell decent price and a metal canister you can use to store a small circular w/e in lol. i was looking for i guess you could call it a signature scent and thought i would give this a try. it has more then met my expectations this is actually my 2nd time ordering now and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good clean masculine scent that is not overly muscular</li>
            <li> get a lot of compliments on this. good stuff</li>

            <li> Love this cologne when my husband wears it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since 2001, when I first found it in Hawaii. Since then I have only found it online and once in Saudi Arabia. I have never gotten tired of it and I get some great compliments from women. Most have never been exposed to it before. And the best part, I have only gone through 2 bottles in six years(I was deployed in the Army for a year). I will buy this cologne for as long as I can find it...</li>
            <li> I love the soft smell of this cologne...I haven&#x27;t see it for years...I got this for my husband for his birthday!  I will start buying more of it now that I know it is still available!</li>
            <li> The scent of this Spray is awesome my boyfriend has never had this and as a gift I purchased this and he absolutly loved it.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, calidad excelente, entregado en los tiempos estipulados, muy buen vendedor, lo recomiendo para futura o futuras compra o compras.</li>
            <li> bought this as a present for my boyfriend he loved it wanted to jump him everytime he showered and put it on. :)</li>
            <li> Blue Jeans is a Nice Cheap Cologne for Men</li>
            <li> This product is exquisite, made in Monza-Italy, sweet and delicious. It is not a fake product, but talking about its container it leaves a lot to be desired...  I used to buy it 10 years ago and as I still have the can of my last one so I compared it with the new one. The can is now made of a very weak material, in fact, even when the package came with the air filled plastic bag, all the cans (4) came with small dents on them, and 1 of those, which I will keep for myself, was not adjusted making the lid be always loose... when I grabbed it for the first time the bottle fell down, the good is that it&#x27;s made of a very resistent glass and didn&#x27;t break. At least, the other 3 will be a gift and I will keep the ugliest one, in all the Blue Jeans EDT is a GREAT, sweet, awesome product, but Amazon did not care about sending a product in a spoiled can... Not happy with that!</li>
            <li> good morning&lt;br /&gt;  the excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. It&#x27;s a not too strong, it&#x27;s a fresh smell like if you just got out of the shower. I buy it to my husband every time he&#x27;s running out of it, the quality for that price is what keeps me buying it over and over.</li>
            <li> Nice and good smiling and good delivery</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy on Father&#x27;s Day! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I wear regular Versace when I go somewhere nice. For just lounging you can&#x27;t beat the price. The scent is distinctive and manly, but more of a spring summer scent.</li>
            <li> This came to me very quickly. I love how it smells and so does my wife. 4 more words required</li>
            <li> nice smell and long lasting. my husband loves it, best for the winter because its forte. loves it, loves it</li>
            <li> Excellent. Exactly what I expected and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Versus Blue Jean was a gift for my son, the order came on time it was packaged well and my son loved it.</li>
            <li> the product arrived safely&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> love it and delivery was on  time and its a good buy</li>
            <li> the same  perfume picture,  but milder odor than the previous one had these.</li>
            <li> great got it in time smell great can&#x27;t wait to wear it the package came ups fast and very well reccomended</li>
            <li> Me encanta ese perfume, asi que encontrarlo en internet a buen precio para mí es una dicha. Gracias por todo...</li>
            <li> Classic cologne,and last all day long.</li>
            <li> This cologne came on time and smells great. It smells very husky and masculine. Really attractive bottle and I love the designs and engravings. The only think though is the cap on the cylinder packaging is a little wobbly and won&#x27;t completely keep put. But I love the cologne because of its smell.</li>
            <li> This brings back many memories EDT, so my score is due to this. But undoubtedly has a very pleasant smell ..</li>
            <li> Everything went as planned. Good product and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I smelled it in a store and had it sprayed on a tester strip and it smelled pretty good. I got the product from Amazon and sprayed it on myself and it smelled really soapy. Not a bad smelling soap, just like a strong soapy smell. But I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m a 20 year old female. I was buying this for my boyfriend&#x27;s dad. For the price and the brand it&#x27;s a good deal. The people in my house like it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very strong cologne. .I don&#x27;t recommend it for people that like a fresh smell</li>
            <li> Smells great and last long</li>
            <li> This cologne is great for everyday use and for all occasions.  Its very subtle and not overpowering so you can wear it to work or restaurant and it wont overpower you or other people&#x27;s desks or food.  Its not too masculine (brut) and it&#x27;s pleasant.  Stays on your body more than on your clothes, and it won&#x27;t be noticeable the next day or even several hours from the time you put it on.  If you are looking for something that stays on strong on body&amp;clothes, lasts onto the next day, and more of a club/bar going out cologne, then this is not it.  Then you should look for the expensive ones like (Versace Pour homme), which i bought too but very rarely wear, due to its strong and long lasting scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Versace/Versus Blue Jean is an old and inexpensive cologne, so for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the quality of the product is good and I highly recommend it, just continue like delivering quality products and competitive.</li>
            <li> very affordable price for a cologne that is hard to find in stores. the fragrance of this cologne is one of the best.</li>
            <li> lo recomiendo muy bueno y excelente lo mejor en producto la mejor compra buen servicio y envio del mismo excelente</li>
            <li> para todo aquel que le gusten los perfumes esta es una opción excelente, llego sin problema y muy bien envuelto</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and its a scent too sharp and overbearing! Not sexy in anyway. It may work for some, but a no here!</li>
            <li> Great stuff sweet smell works anytime of day.!</li>
            <li> Excellent, as expected</li>
            <li> Always awesome great for work environment</li>
            <li> Perfect and Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good on my husband, this fragrance is a definite buy I guarantee you will like. It&#x27;s light but powerful but also light enough for women to wear too. Try it.</li>
            <li> I have seen Versus Blue Jeans in the store and have been anxious to buy it, I found it on this website and am pleased with the delivery, fast and at the time they said it would arrive, it did. I am going to use this cologne for special occassions, definately worth the price if you are looking for a great smelling cologne for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This is my fav cologne for my husband.  We used to buy it when he was stationed in California, but hard to find back home in Illinois.  Thank you for the great price!  Definitely will order again and again!</li>
            <li> Order this every year for my son-in-law. He loves it and the can it comes in. Smells very nice on him.</li>
            <li> i like the scent of this product and i recommend it for casual and semi-formal uses. the only thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t last for long you will get about 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, it&#x27;s a good warm weather cologne and seems to last all day.  Perfect product name since it goes well on casual Friday.  Oh, the bottle must be pretty tough to have survived the packaging.  It was sent in a UPS box, it was the only thing being sent and there were no peanuts in the box, so the thing was out of the cannister and had been rolling around in an obviously mistreated box.  It must have actually broke free because the cannister lid was missing and part of the box had been cut out and taped over.  But that really didn&#x27;t matter to me since I don&#x27;t need or even want the cannister.  The bottle was intact, full, and still had its cap on, that&#x27;s all I really cared about.</li>
            <li> This is the first perfume my Dad gave me far back 1997. I Love it for its unique scent. I think its good for nights. Also its perfect for blends,u know just like using two different perfumes together and creating a distinctive good smell. I Love the bottle and everything about it. It is a very good choice for a date night.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like Versace Blue Jeans, but Versus is not the same;  there is no holding, lasting scent like Versace Blue Jeans - I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever buy Versus again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift my step dad moved away, but he&#x27;s always loved this cologne.  He had no complaints it smells good. I like colognes that smell fresh and crisp and clean. This one would be something like that.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this fragrance for years.  It is clean and just a little sweet - but very manly!</li>
            <li> OMG just got this product delivered a few hours ago and I must say this smells so great. I got it for my husband but I&#x27;m thinking about keeping it for me...lol I wonder if they make this for women.</li>
            <li> Great scent all day smell&lt;br /&gt;Very complimentary by the woman&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s a great addition to my&lt;br /&gt;Cologne Collection</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, one of the best sense that I&#x27;ve worn in years this is the best place to find it.</li>
            <li> Such a grear men&#x27;s cologne I will buy this as long as its made</li>
            <li> This is a GOOD Smelling Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice projection and lasts a good while at 4-6hrs MAX.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy again for the price I got it for on Amazon at around $20. You can NOT beat that price !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for another satisfied purchase.</li>
            <li> i loved it smells very clean</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so good, just what I wanted, I am satisfied with the purchase. It is of good quality, recommend and is at a good price</li>
            <li> I remember this from the early 90s. I liked it so much that I started wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;Just got it for my new guy and he likes it, too. Not overpowering and very unique. Lovely scent!</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell unbeatable price. Wish the scent would not dissipate as quickly as it does but for the price, you\ can spritz many times over the course of the day knowing you can just buy a new bottle for less than 20 bucks on Amazon whenever you run out!</li>
            <li> Desde Venezuela confirmo que este producto es excelente. entregas eficaz. Muchas gracias.. espero volver a realizar compras a este vendedor.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> I might get another one of these do like this!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite cologne to wear, night or day. My wife enjoys the smell of it, too, so I consider that a win. It&#x27;s almost unfair to review colognes, because everyone has different tastes.</li>
            <li> am very well satisfied</li>
            <li> I recommend was excellent buy</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites.  Great for both winter and summer wear!</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic!  Will always be one of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li> Bought for my fiance.  Classic fragrance, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This has been the scent my husband has worn for years. I love the way it smells! Wouldn&#x27;t want him to change it!</li>
            <li> el articulo es justo lo que esperaba, el articulo se encontraba en perfecto estado y sin detalles, lo recomiendo 100%, excelente</li>
            <li> great perfume that denotes a male couple in daily use fragrance both day and evening, their scent remains long hours keeping the smell. recommended</li>
            <li> The package came fine, no damage. I started using it right away, the smell is great but It seem that I will be adding it to my collection as an afternoon perfume. My search for an oriental perfume lasting more than 48 hours continues.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance and nicely priced. Shipping speed was good.</li>
            <li> im completely satisfied with the product. i would recommend it to a lot of people and i would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> My hubby mentioned he used to love this back in the day. I&#x27;m glad I found it. I gave it to him for Xmas and head has worn it everyday since. Lol</li>
            <li> buena fragancia y todo muy bien en el envio muy sastifecho con la compra... recomendado para otras ocaciones y compras</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho la colonia es una de mis preferidas, siempre que tengan la oportunidad se las voy a comprar.</li>
            <li> Smells good. different to what I normally wear. nice change.</li>
            <li> Im really desapointed i was not that I&#x27;ve spected, poooooor quality it does not original blue jeans.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Excellent product. Original. Nice Smell. Everything ok</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne on the market..</li>
            <li> Smells so good! My boyfriend loves it! Also 15$ cheaper than the stores!</li>
            <li> Great seller. Recommended 100%</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff keep me smelling good all day</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s always versus now and not the real thing but it still smells great. That is all for now</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for many years and receive compliments often, this is my signature smell and works if I am in jeans to tuxedo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  I ordered this for  my grandson.  My other 8 years old grandson wants me to order one for him also.  I will soon purchase another one for him.</li>
            <li> perfecto. recomendado</li>
            <li> I own about 15 colognes and Blue Jeans is honestly one of my favorites. It&#x27;s great and the scent lasts longer than any other cologne I have. I always purchase a new bottle when I finish.</li>
            <li> It is not the original one</li>
            <li> Good price, delivered at home,  fresh  sweet-spicy (maybe cinnamon) stay for long on my skin. Smells expensive.</li>
            <li> Sounds great and the wife loves it!</li>
            <li> OMG!!! When I smelled this I fell in love with it, and it smells so wonderful on my boyfriend! I took a chance and ordered it because I liked the bottle and the canister it comes in, plus it&#x27;s by Versace and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!! This is a great gift for any man, young or old !!! :~)</li>
            <li> Will working retail a few years back I happen to smell this cologne on one of the McClain shipment works, and that was the spark of my obsession with this scent. I absolutely love the smell. Before going out I always put two sprays on neck and one on my wrist. People always tell me I smell good, hours after I put it on. It does stay on close quite well especially jackets or jeans, I often use those multiple times before washing them and friends still manage to smell this sensational fragrance on me. This vendor was quick and and the product well packaged!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Outstanding delivery time.  Will buy again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> love it for the price</li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good:) love it when my bf wears it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I get compliments everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I smelled this cologne on someone once and I loved it so I bought it for my husband. When we received it my husband put it on and we decided immediately that it was not for him. I suppose that fragrances smell different on different people, but it was not something that I cared for! This is only an opinion. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this cologne. You would have to smell it for yourself to decide if it is right for you!</li>
            <li> A very nice, fresh fragrance and one of my favorites. I wish they made it in an After-shave form in a cologne non-spray!</li>
            <li> My husband now wears this cologne and we both love it! We are very satisfied with our Amazon purchase! It was shipped quickly and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these for myself as well as 1 for a gift and plan on additional purchases as gifts going into the holidays.  Suggest purchasing the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; for personal use to save a little money if you don&#x27;t care about the top (or save the top from one of your bottles to reuse) or gift canister.  Not the best as far as \\&quot;longevity\\&quot; with regard to the sent lasting but for the cost a good product.</li>
            <li> I love it and will re order again</li>
            <li> good product, thank you very much, excelnte came very fast congratulate</li>
            <li> Great fragance...i liked</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
