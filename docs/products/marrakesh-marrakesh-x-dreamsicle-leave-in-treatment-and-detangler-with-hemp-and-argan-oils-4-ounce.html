            <li>My favorite detangler, smells so good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not overbearing (dreamsicle scent).</li>
            <li>so my hair gets tangles very easily even if I condition it.</li>
            <li>It has this warm, spicy, exotic smell to it that is not overpowering and lingers in the hair for hours.</li>
            <li>Dreamsicle is my favorite scent but they all smell nice.</li>
            <li>I had to have it, It still smells wonderful and makes my hair feel soft but after a while, it make me look like I have dandruff.  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a detangler that did more than just help me brush it out.</li>
            <li>I think the argan oil is what made this detangler work, so I&#x27;m leery - sooo many ingredients have changed.</li>
            <li>and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, use enough and</li>
            <li>Not only did it work perfectly as a detangler, but as a bonus.....</li>
            <li>It really hydrates the hair which is great.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy, the curls are softer, and it looks thicker (has more body?).</li>
            <li>I love this product it gives you the silky hair (not greasy) that you are looking for.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li>and away the best product I have used to keep my hair soft, shiny, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice - original</li>
            <li>pretty good not a lot of product for the price</li>
            <li>i even noticed significant growth!</li>
            <li>is spicy and exotic and strong</li>
            <li>And plus, it detangles and it is much more easy to brush my hair than before (now brushing</li>
            <li>I have healthy fine,</li>
            <li>One of the most important things is that it has helped to stop my hair from breaking off in my comb and brush.</li>
            <li>The scent - Dreamsicle - is a lovely, light citrusy scent, and yes I will be trying the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair healthy looking and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, doesn&#x27;t take much, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product originally at a party and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have heard from my friends that they make other products that are excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>10 spays to get tangles out bottle used up very quickly</li>
            <li>It easily detangles my hair.  </li>
            <li>helps make my hair easy to detangle and comb out after washing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it keeps her hair soft and tangle free (or close to it).</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the product really very much.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling full, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It works as well as one of your favorite de-tanglers (which is great right there) but for me, the smell is what has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair: fine, wavy, shoulder length, colored (henna), curls in humid weather, frizzes if I brush it when dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and it seems to help dry your hair nicely with a good shine.</li>
            <li>This may not mean much to those of you blessed with great hair, but I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that tangled easily and broke if I looked at it</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you don&#x27;t need a ton of it</li>
            <li>She woke up with no ball of hair knotted in the back of her head which is like so great for me..</li>
            <li>I also really, really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny, frizz free and radiant.</li>
            <li>and it stays smooth until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li>is fun:).</li>
            <li>I have wavy, lightly curly hair that tends to look unkempt if I don&#x27;t use all sorts of products in it.</li>
            <li>travel spray bottle in my handbag since it&#x27;s great for last-minute moments such as rainy day hair and as a skin moisturiser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spray coats the hair shafts and easily helps the special detangled brush I bought to untangle her hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the product I have been searching for all my life,  I really like it and give it 6 stars!!!</li>
            <li>it smells lovely, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I had received the product as a gift originally.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, it seems!</li>
            <li>In the original formula argan oil is the 5th ingredient.</li>
            <li>I hope to see &amp;#34;The Original scent&amp;#34; soon with A Prime.</li>
            <li>Product works super well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>(more often if I&#x27;m in hot and humid climates)</li>
            <li>The best parts, are I can use a lower heat setting on the iron, 375, and it is much easier to get my hair smooth than any other product I have used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try this new formula, and if it isn&#x27;t as effective</li>
            <li>This stuff works great but be careful you don&#x27;t get any on your floor.</li>
            <li>nice smell and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I was sure to use up the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I tested some samples and will buy the full sizes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great...not greasy, and it really frees up tangles better than anything we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>3A curly hair and a cabinet full of hair products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad- sorta like men&#x27;s musk.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair soft and strong.  </li>
            <li>It is a great detangler for fine hair and isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li>Dreamsicle smells wonderful, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li>Very pretty scent..</li>
            <li>My hair was looking and feeling dry even with using good products.</li>
            <li>try to avoid brushing my hair when it is dry, because it gets frizzy (and not in a good \\&quot;Ms.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be more natural than it is.</li>
            <li>I had always been looking for a good product to keep my long hair from snarling after washing, with a few hits and many more misses.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted &amp;#34;The Original Scent&amp;#34; but my Amazon Prime did not carry this scent.</li>
            <li>gnarly hair, tangles appear right after combing them out...</li>
            <li>I can brush right through it, no problem and it leaves my hair smelling like, well, dreamy.</li>
            <li>I actually love my natural texture now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a pleasant scent (and as someone who has sensitive skin and steers away from perfumes, I&#x27;m VERY sensitive and particular about scents).</li>
            <li>One of the best leave in hair moisturizers I have ever used... never leaves hair dull or sticky and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>A bit thinker than expected but a very good leave-in that does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>Much much better then others that promises the same.</li>
            <li>A great product for long hair because it can be sprayed only on the ends where it needs it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worried about some of the ingredients that are listed as toxic; including this:&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane (D5) is rated 3 out of 10 (10 being most toxic) in the Skin Deep database powered by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  </li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m pleased with it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the first spray spits out versus spraying out.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I was looking to get done.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well..</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>I have been using Marrakesh for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I also love that they use more natural ingredients and not so many harmful chemicals that other products (such as the overpriced</li>
            <li>I just spray this on (and it does not take much) and my brush goes right through my hair.  </li>
            <li>She has very fine and very long hair (she wants hair as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s) that very easily tangles.  </li>
            <li>My only problem with this product is that very often it stops being able to pump the product out.</li>
            <li>I spray it in my hair liberally before bed, twist my hair into a loose bun, and when I wake up, I have perfectly smooth, shiny, healthy hair with soft waves -- there is no residue or build up.  </li>
            <li>my hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>And when blow-drying my hair out this morning I found this new formula left a &#x27;tacky&#x27;, greasy residue on the palms of my hands and hair instead of the smooth, silky, and slippery feel of the original.</li>
            <li>so well, I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using my conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>I have long straight fine hair that gets super tangled when I wash it</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t 100% love the smell, but the function of the product is too good to hold that against it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: If you want a more even application, and not spray small gobs onto your hair, spray it into the palms of your hands and lightly rub them together, then rake them through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this without doing a ton of research, purely to use as a detangler.</li>
            <li>Amazon, change your photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried the new formula this morning and found this product to be about 60% as effective as the original, so definitely not as effective at detangling and softening.</li>
            <li>fast fast fast shipping ever was in shock..</li>
            <li>doesnt detangle very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I ran out and really could see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>the real test was this morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get the hype over this product.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I don&#x27;t really even style.</li>
            <li>this is really a miracle product, i will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels much stronger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that it softens my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair has no joke grown at least a good 3+ inches</li>
            <li>actually just bought a bottle of pure argan oil because I&#x27;m now convinced that this is the oil in the original formula that conditioned without weight.</li>
            <li>It really works great not only as a detangler, but also to tame the flyaways.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and flat.</li>
            <li>I liked the fragrance (wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming and behaved well enough w/other products) but overall, the product didn&#x27;t really do much in the way of offering extra conditioning or shine, to the point wherein I&#x27;d purchase it again, especially online.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good but it only lasts for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>All in all the oils &amp; soft orange scent really detangled much of my hair matts..</li>
            <li>Nice, but didn&#x27;t detangle my blonde, mildy wavy wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>I was losing a lot of hair from trying to untangle the mess, but not any more.  </li>
            <li>- dreamsicle is a lighter scent that smells like orange creamsicles - high tide smells tropical.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommened</li>
            <li>I had high hopes given the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous other products but nothing works as effectively as this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It helps to smooth it out without becoming to heavy or flat.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and CLEAN after using this product, and I&#x27;m still debating on whether to return the 3 bottles</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I received a deal for a bottle that contained double the normal amount which makes the product worth it either way.  </li>
            <li>I normally have to use a lot of conditioner when I wash my hair and spray with a conditioner or detangler.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been growing out my fine, fully-highlighted blonde hair on this product and it is now only 3 inches away from my hips.</li>
            <li>My wife refuses to live without this product.</li>
            <li>I am new to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying the new hair cleaning method, which I heard about on Pintrest.</li>
            <li>And I live it Miami,</li>
            <li>I also love the smell, but that will be an individual thing for everyone that tries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>My hair is colored often and this makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I found it to be pretty similar to any of the wal mart stuff I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>We use this spray to get out the daily tangles from my eight year olds long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have not used a hair iron in over a year, and rarely blow dry, which might have sped up</li>
            <li>Let me say I have long very very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for something to keep the frizz away on my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I would say it has a natural oil smell.</li>
            <li>and it was so soft and moisturized, I was SMILING.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for me but used it on my 4year old</li>
            <li>it does not grease out your hair, but makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft &amp; the gnarls are gone.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been on a mission to grow my hair out long (for the first time ever).</li>
            <li>It far outperformed my expectations.</li>
            <li>soft..</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>i bleached my hair three times in two months and it made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li>and so I sprayed this detangler on, left it for a few minutes while getting dressed, and was able to run a comb through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even a full blown matted bird nest mess of hair can be combed out without breakage or pain.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and very wavy, it makes combing a breeze</li>
            <li>I just bought 3 bottles of this stuff and noticed immediately that the label is different from what is pictured and the Dreamsicle I normally purchase.</li>
            <li>In the new formula it is the 21st ingredient.</li>
            <li>after several months I thought it was time to try something new.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my dry hair at night for \\&quot;gee-whiz\\&quot; not thinking it would really do anything, as I bought it as part of a sampler</li>
            <li>/&gt;The actual product does leave your hair very soft and I feel like it is nourishing my hair.</li>
            <li>have very long, thick, fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Since many shampoos actually strip your hair of your natural oils, its really not good.</li>
            <li>My hair stays really soft for several days even if I don&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave a film on hair, actually conditions the hair, not heavy though</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take more than five squirts because my hair is thin all over my head.</li>
            <li>My thin, frizzy, curly hair is more manageable when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it while my hair is still wet right after the shower,  then blow dry, use an iron  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need any other product.</li>
            <li>If you do not usually dry your hair you can put this on your hair and just comb through</li>
            <li>If you have fine, limp hair BE CAREFUl - one or two sprays is PLENTY!  </li>
            <li>I recently transitioned my hair from straight to its natural tight curls.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and only need to use a small amount!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my hair seems to really like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle, but for the amount per use, I can see it lasting for half a year or more.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair that&#x27;s a few inches below my shoulders and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the pump breaking down or the product becoming thicker and getting stuck in the pump</li>
            <li>I no longer fear the pain associated with washing my hair, and it remains soft and manageable when dry and styled!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from getting crazy tangled and even controls the frizz amazingly.</li>

            <li> The smell is nice and not overbearing (dreamsicle scent).</li>
            <li> so my hair gets tangles very easily even if I condition it.</li>
            <li> It has this warm, spicy, exotic smell to it that is not overpowering and lingers in the hair for hours.</li>
            <li> Dreamsicle is my favorite scent but they all smell nice.</li>
            <li> I had to have it, It still smells wonderful and makes my hair feel soft but after a while, it make me look like I have dandruff.  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a detangler that did more than just help me brush it out.</li>
            <li> I think the argan oil is what made this detangler work, so I&#x27;m leery - sooo many ingredients have changed.</li>
            <li> and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, use enough and</li>
            <li> Not only did it work perfectly as a detangler, but as a bonus.....</li>
            <li> It really hydrates the hair which is great.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy, the curls are softer, and it looks thicker (has more body?).</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives you the silky hair (not greasy) that you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li> and away the best product I have used to keep my hair soft, shiny, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice - original</li>
            <li> pretty good not a lot of product for the price</li>
            <li> i even noticed significant growth!</li>
            <li> is spicy and exotic and strong</li>
            <li> And plus, it detangles and it is much more easy to brush my hair than before (now brushing</li>
            <li> I have healthy fine,</li>
            <li> One of the most important things is that it has helped to stop my hair from breaking off in my comb and brush.</li>
            <li> The scent - Dreamsicle - is a lovely, light citrusy scent, and yes I will be trying the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair healthy looking and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, doesn&#x27;t take much, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product originally at a party and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have heard from my friends that they make other products that are excellent as well.  </li>
            <li> 10 spays to get tangles out bottle used up very quickly</li>
            <li> It easily detangles my hair.  </li>
            <li> helps make my hair easy to detangle and comb out after washing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it keeps her hair soft and tangle free (or close to it).</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product really very much.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling full, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It works as well as one of your favorite de-tanglers (which is great right there) but for me, the smell is what has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair: fine, wavy, shoulder length, colored (henna), curls in humid weather, frizzes if I brush it when dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and it seems to help dry your hair nicely with a good shine.</li>
            <li> This may not mean much to those of you blessed with great hair, but I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that tangled easily and broke if I looked at it</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you don&#x27;t need a ton of it</li>
            <li> She woke up with no ball of hair knotted in the back of her head which is like so great for me..</li>
            <li> I also really, really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, frizz free and radiant.</li>
            <li> and it stays smooth until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li> is fun:).</li>
            <li> I have wavy, lightly curly hair that tends to look unkempt if I don&#x27;t use all sorts of products in it.</li>
            <li> travel spray bottle in my handbag since it&#x27;s great for last-minute moments such as rainy day hair and as a skin moisturiser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spray coats the hair shafts and easily helps the special detangled brush I bought to untangle her hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the product I have been searching for all my life,  I really like it and give it 6 stars!!!</li>
            <li> it smells lovely, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I had received the product as a gift originally.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, it seems!</li>
            <li> In the original formula argan oil is the 5th ingredient.</li>
            <li> I hope to see &amp;#34;The Original scent&amp;#34; soon with A Prime.</li>
            <li> Product works super well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> (more often if I&#x27;m in hot and humid climates)</li>
            <li> The best parts, are I can use a lower heat setting on the iron, 375, and it is much easier to get my hair smooth than any other product I have used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try this new formula, and if it isn&#x27;t as effective</li>
            <li> This stuff works great but be careful you don&#x27;t get any on your floor.</li>
            <li> nice smell and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I was sure to use up the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I tested some samples and will buy the full sizes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great...not greasy, and it really frees up tangles better than anything we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> 3A curly hair and a cabinet full of hair products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad- sorta like men&#x27;s musk.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair soft and strong.  </li>
            <li> It is a great detangler for fine hair and isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> Dreamsicle smells wonderful, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Very pretty scent..</li>
            <li> My hair was looking and feeling dry even with using good products.</li>
            <li> try to avoid brushing my hair when it is dry, because it gets frizzy (and not in a good \\&quot;Ms.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be more natural than it is.</li>
            <li> I had always been looking for a good product to keep my long hair from snarling after washing, with a few hits and many more misses.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted &amp;#34;The Original Scent&amp;#34; but my Amazon Prime did not carry this scent.</li>
            <li> gnarly hair, tangles appear right after combing them out...</li>
            <li> I can brush right through it, no problem and it leaves my hair smelling like, well, dreamy.</li>
            <li> I actually love my natural texture now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It works well and has a pleasant scent (and as someone who has sensitive skin and steers away from perfumes, I&#x27;m VERY sensitive and particular about scents).</li>
            <li> One of the best leave in hair moisturizers I have ever used... never leaves hair dull or sticky and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> A bit thinker than expected but a very good leave-in that does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> Much much better then others that promises the same.</li>
            <li> A great product for long hair because it can be sprayed only on the ends where it needs it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worried about some of the ingredients that are listed as toxic; including this:&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane (D5) is rated 3 out of 10 (10 being most toxic) in the Skin Deep database powered by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  </li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m pleased with it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the first spray spits out versus spraying out.</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I was looking to get done.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well..</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I also love that they use more natural ingredients and not so many harmful chemicals that other products (such as the overpriced</li>
            <li> I just spray this on (and it does not take much) and my brush goes right through my hair.  </li>
            <li> She has very fine and very long hair (she wants hair as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s) that very easily tangles.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is that very often it stops being able to pump the product out.</li>
            <li> I spray it in my hair liberally before bed, twist my hair into a loose bun, and when I wake up, I have perfectly smooth, shiny, healthy hair with soft waves -- there is no residue or build up.  </li>
            <li> my hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> And when blow-drying my hair out this morning I found this new formula left a &#x27;tacky&#x27;, greasy residue on the palms of my hands and hair instead of the smooth, silky, and slippery feel of the original.</li>
            <li> so well, I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using my conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> I have long straight fine hair that gets super tangled when I wash it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t 100% love the smell, but the function of the product is too good to hold that against it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: If you want a more even application, and not spray small gobs onto your hair, spray it into the palms of your hands and lightly rub them together, then rake them through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this without doing a ton of research, purely to use as a detangler.</li>
            <li> Amazon, change your photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried the new formula this morning and found this product to be about 60% as effective as the original, so definitely not as effective at detangling and softening.</li>
            <li> fast fast fast shipping ever was in shock..</li>
            <li> doesnt detangle very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and really could see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> the real test was this morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype over this product.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I don&#x27;t really even style.</li>
            <li> this is really a miracle product, i will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels much stronger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that it softens my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair has no joke grown at least a good 3+ inches</li>
            <li> actually just bought a bottle of pure argan oil because I&#x27;m now convinced that this is the oil in the original formula that conditioned without weight.</li>
            <li> It really works great not only as a detangler, but also to tame the flyaways.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and flat.</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance (wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming and behaved well enough w/other products) but overall, the product didn&#x27;t really do much in the way of offering extra conditioning or shine, to the point wherein I&#x27;d purchase it again, especially online.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good but it only lasts for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> All in all the oils &amp; soft orange scent really detangled much of my hair matts..</li>
            <li> Nice, but didn&#x27;t detangle my blonde, mildy wavy wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> I was losing a lot of hair from trying to untangle the mess, but not any more.  </li>
            <li> - dreamsicle is a lighter scent that smells like orange creamsicles - high tide smells tropical.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommened</li>
            <li> I had high hopes given the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other products but nothing works as effectively as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It helps to smooth it out without becoming to heavy or flat.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and CLEAN after using this product, and I&#x27;m still debating on whether to return the 3 bottles</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I received a deal for a bottle that contained double the normal amount which makes the product worth it either way.  </li>
            <li> I normally have to use a lot of conditioner when I wash my hair and spray with a conditioner or detangler.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been growing out my fine, fully-highlighted blonde hair on this product and it is now only 3 inches away from my hips.</li>
            <li> My wife refuses to live without this product.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the new hair cleaning method, which I heard about on Pintrest.</li>
            <li> And I live it Miami,</li>
            <li> I also love the smell, but that will be an individual thing for everyone that tries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> My hair is colored often and this makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I found it to be pretty similar to any of the wal mart stuff I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> We use this spray to get out the daily tangles from my eight year olds long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have not used a hair iron in over a year, and rarely blow dry, which might have sped up</li>
            <li> Let me say I have long very very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for something to keep the frizz away on my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I would say it has a natural oil smell.</li>
            <li> and it was so soft and moisturized, I was SMILING.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for me but used it on my 4year old</li>
            <li> it does not grease out your hair, but makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft &amp; the gnarls are gone.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been on a mission to grow my hair out long (for the first time ever).</li>
            <li> It far outperformed my expectations.</li>
            <li> soft..</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> i bleached my hair three times in two months and it made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li> and so I sprayed this detangler on, left it for a few minutes while getting dressed, and was able to run a comb through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even a full blown matted bird nest mess of hair can be combed out without breakage or pain.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very wavy, it makes combing a breeze</li>
            <li> I just bought 3 bottles of this stuff and noticed immediately that the label is different from what is pictured and the Dreamsicle I normally purchase.</li>
            <li> In the new formula it is the 21st ingredient.</li>
            <li> after several months I thought it was time to try something new.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my dry hair at night for \\&quot;gee-whiz\\&quot; not thinking it would really do anything, as I bought it as part of a sampler</li>
            <li> /&gt;The actual product does leave your hair very soft and I feel like it is nourishing my hair.</li>
            <li> have very long, thick, fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Since many shampoos actually strip your hair of your natural oils, its really not good.</li>
            <li> My hair stays really soft for several days even if I don&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave a film on hair, actually conditions the hair, not heavy though</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take more than five squirts because my hair is thin all over my head.</li>
            <li> My thin, frizzy, curly hair is more manageable when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it while my hair is still wet right after the shower,  then blow dry, use an iron  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need any other product.</li>
            <li> If you do not usually dry your hair you can put this on your hair and just comb through</li>
            <li> If you have fine, limp hair BE CAREFUl - one or two sprays is PLENTY!  </li>
            <li> I recently transitioned my hair from straight to its natural tight curls.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and only need to use a small amount!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my hair seems to really like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle, but for the amount per use, I can see it lasting for half a year or more.</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair that&#x27;s a few inches below my shoulders and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the pump breaking down or the product becoming thicker and getting stuck in the pump</li>
            <li> I no longer fear the pain associated with washing my hair, and it remains soft and manageable when dry and styled!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from getting crazy tangled and even controls the frizz amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy, dry light brown hair.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid citrus scented products (my cat is with me on this) but the hint of vanilla softens it and really makes it wearable.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have not used it long enough for my hair to improve.</li>
            <li> Having baby fine, thin hair, I&#x27;ve suffered for years when coming out just washed, wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as soft to the touch as others have described.  </li>
            <li> Makes it soft and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to using a little dab of natural conditioner as a leave in treatment instead of spraying this on my toddler.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing but the product itself is good</li>
            <li> I can only smell it as I apply it on my hair, after I blow dry, the smell is no longer there, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it a lot as my hair is dry and needs extra conditioning.  </li>
            <li> but I also like using all natural on my little one...</li>
            <li> and it softens the crazy frizz of my hair and makes it smoother and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> It really does remind me of a creamsicle, albeit warmly (not overpoweringly) fragranced.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that gets tangled when I wash it</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> If you have long hair</li>
            <li> and I have noticeably less frizziness due to the dry environment I live in.</li>
            <li> , this makes it a lot easier and less painful to brush after a shower, not to mention it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Everything on the market that I have used in my 30+ years on earth has left it mediocre to DRY, from high end to low end, this was the first product to leave it unbelievably like silk.  </li>
            <li> A must for curly, course, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> A single spray or 2</li>
            <li> The only down fall is</li>
            <li> I did not have to use an entire bottle like the other products!  </li>
            <li> I like to use it even on dry hair!  </li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but I already feel my hair softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for just under a month and have been doing this baking soda process for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that worked for me after trying a half dozen other detanglers .</li>
            <li> I add a bit to it wet, then air-dry and voila</li>
            <li> Be careful of build up though you do have to watch that....</li>
            <li> you only need a few pumps</li>
            <li> I put this on after I dry my hair too, but a little goes a long way, otherwise you can make your hair too oily!</li>
            <li> Works on dry and wet hair, does NOT weigh hair down or look like there is product in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I tried numerous products which either dried the hair out, gave me headaches due to the excess silicones or</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick, about one inch below my bra strap and I use two pumps for the entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES stink as other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li> someone described Dreamsicle as smelling like cotton candy...which intrigued me compared to other reviews regarding the differences between the scents.</li>
            <li> Among other concerns is this chemical in our waterways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear it, with other products or without I have flyaway frizzes everywhere.</li>
            <li> We have recommended this product to other also.</li>
            <li> apply this to my towel dried hair along with my heat protectant and blow dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use a few squirts after my hair is semi dry but still damp.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when it arrived some of the bottles were slightly opened and product was all over the bottles :(</li>
            <li> Bought this for my &amp;#34;no fuss&amp;#34; 7 year old who has very thick, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I just needed something to help detangle that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It does something to the texture of my hair that just &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; it down without getting rid of the wave or the curls.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It does what is says, and it&#x27;s not too heavy compared to other on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and it takes a lot of sprays to get it to detangle even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I can use less of my steriod solution since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I lost about half of the product in the shipping process, what a mess.</li>
            <li> I have long thin dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything too heavy because it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I was conditioning my hair everyday just to keep it manageable.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays of this cream onto my hair, massaged in, allow me to comb out all the tangles with ease.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the weird scent, I don&#x27;t know exactly what makes it smell weird</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I can say anything negative about it, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vaguely citrusy-sweet when sprayed on wet hair, but that smell is gone by the time I&#x27;m done brushing and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> So much easier and less painful brushing my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair that tends to get tangled.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very frustrating when I have half the bottle left</li>
            <li> It does apply to hair a little thick, but once dried will lighten up.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair that gets wretchedly tangled from the hard DC water post-shower &amp; this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed that the smell doesn&#x27;t last and that the product is in such a small container.</li>
            <li> It has a weird scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird, but I&#x27;ve actually been washing my roots with baking soda and then spraying vinegar on the rest (after I&#x27;ve washed out the baking soda).</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders but not quite to my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time growing my hair, because it breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pump out of the bottle and leaves hair (MY hair anyway)  stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts at least five months since I wash my hair once per week</li>
            <li> We have been searching for a product for my daughters thick hair, and we found the answer.</li>
            <li> There are no more clumps in my hair tools!</li>
            <li> It is a little of the expensive side for the size, but I won&#x27;t mind purchasing again if keeps softening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I always have a tough time combing or brushing my hair after a shower, even with conditioner.</li>
            <li> So a little disappointing on that</li>
            <li> for the money not a great value.  </li>
            <li> I never used to use a leave-in treatment because I was afraid it would make my hair limp or greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy , 30+ years of coloring hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone with tight curls will know they are impossible</li>
            <li> With that being said, the only thing I&#x27;ll be changing is which seller I buy from AAAbeauty has had bad customer service and idiotic selling practices.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s highly unlikely that I will ever need to try anything</li>
            <li> I did not get to use this product unfortunately as I immediately returned it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work in our house.</li>
            <li> The smell drives my boyfriend crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend told me how great this treatment was so I had to try it. I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for something to keep the frizz away on my naturally wavy hair. I&#x27;m trying to keep the heat and damage to my hair to a minimum since I get it colored every 6 weeks. This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that detangles my hair and gets rid of the frizz. I add a bit to it wet, then air-dry and voila, my hair looks ah-mah-zing!</li>
            <li> for the money not a great value.  doesnt detangle very well.  10 spays to get tangles out bottle used up very quickly</li>
            <li> My stylist sold me a bottle of this initially, and then I ordered it here.  I really like the way it makes my hair feel.  I have fine, highlighted hair that&#x27;s a few inches below my shoulders and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Just makes it feel softer and healthier.  I never used to use a leave-in treatment because I was afraid it would make my hair limp or greasy-looking.  Not so with this product.  I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES stink as other reviews have said.  It&#x27;s hard to pump out of the bottle and leaves hair (MY hair anyway)  stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the scent! It has this warm, spicy, exotic smell to it that is not overpowering and lingers in the hair for hours. A single spray or 2 and it softens the crazy frizz of my hair and makes it smoother and much more manageable. It works as well as one of your favorite de-tanglers (which is great right there) but for me, the smell is what has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. I ran out and really could see and feel the difference. It is a great product and good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and am in love with it! My hair is long and thick, about one inch below my bra strap and I use two pumps for the entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my towel dried hair along with my heat protectant and blow dry afterwards. It leaves my hair silky smooth and very shiny. I am amazed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con will be the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but doesn&#x27;t smell good either. I would say it has a natural oil smell. I can only smell it as I apply it on my hair, after I blow dry, the smell is no longer there, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle, but for the amount per use, I can see it lasting for half a year or more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or oily. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and I am not looking for different options.</li>
            <li> Everything on the market that I have used in my 30+ years on earth has left it mediocre to DRY, from high end to low end, this was the first product to leave it unbelievably like silk.  I sprayed it on my dry hair at night for \\&quot;gee-whiz\\&quot; not thinking it would really do anything, as I bought it as part of a sampler, I woke up in morning and it was so soft and moisturized, I was SMILING.  This is the product I have been searching for all my life,  I really like it and give it 6 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but when it arrived some of the bottles were slightly opened and product was all over the bottles :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works well and has a pleasant scent (and as someone who has sensitive skin and steers away from perfumes, I&#x27;m VERY sensitive and particular about scents). My only problem with this product is that very often it stops being able to pump the product out. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the pump breaking down or the product becoming thicker and getting stuck in the pump but it&#x27;s very frustrating when I have half the bottle left and I can no longer spray it on my hair as I should be.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my &amp;#34;no fuss&amp;#34; 7 year old who has very thick, frizzy, wavy hair. It really works great not only as a detangler, but also to tame the flyaways. Just spray, comb, and go. Works on dry and wet hair, does NOT weigh hair down or look like there is product in the hair. Dreamsicle smells wonderful, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> A must for curly, course, dry hair.  Feels luxurious working through damp hair.  I like to use it even on dry hair!  Great product!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for me but used it on my 4year old she has curly curly knotty hair put it in yesterday the real test was this morning. She woke up with no ball of hair knotted in the back of her head which is like so great for me..I&#x27;ve yet to try it for myself but I also like using all natural on my little one...fast fast fast shipping ever was in shock..I luv when orders are on point...will be a returning customer</li>
            <li> Let me say I have long very very straight hair.  The conditioners from Earthly Body are superb.  My hair is shiny without looking oily or plastic.  I have movement in my hair.  It easily detangles my hair.  My hair stays really soft for several days even if I don&#x27;t wash it.  It smells nice - original is spicy and exotic and strong - dreamsicle is a lighter scent that smells like orange creamsicles - high tide smells tropical.  I ordered all three scents to match my moods.  I will continue to use the conditioning and stying products daily.  I can even get my hubby to use dreamsicle leave in on his hair.  All in all I love these products!</li>
            <li> Second bottle that I orders. It does what it promises. This is a must for me now and actually I don&#x27;t know how I did without it. Much much better then others that promises the same. It&#x27;s like your hair came to life in a good way....</li>
            <li> A good product but someone described Dreamsicle as smelling like cotton candy...which intrigued me compared to other reviews regarding the differences between the scents. It does not smell like cotton candy to me, it smells like an orangsicle...which makes sense given the name. A little disappointing but the product itself is good and I received a deal for a bottle that contained double the normal amount which makes the product worth it either way.  It does what is says, and it&#x27;s not too heavy compared to other on the market.  You have to know your hair, I feel, when applying the product.  My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as soft to the touch as others have described.  It does apply to hair a little thick, but once dried will lighten up.</li>
            <li> I recently transitioned my hair from straight to its natural tight curls. Anyone with tight curls will know they are impossible to comb/brush. I was conditioning my hair everyday just to keep it manageable. This product is the only thing that worked for me after trying a half dozen other detanglers . Just damp the hair and spray and like magic I can run my fingers through it. I actually love my natural texture now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> This smell is AMAZING. It feels WONDERFUL. For the price, the product is stunning. The smell drives my boyfriend crazy. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...it does not grease out your hair, but makes it feel soft. My hair is like straw and this manages it great. It was cheaper on Amazon than at my local beauty salon.</li>
            <li> My wife refuses to live without this product.</li>
            <li> it smells lovely, fresh and clean. I love how my hair feels. Be careful of build up though you do have to watch that....</li>
            <li> I had received the product as a gift originally. I ended up using the entire bottle. I have long thin hair that tends to get tangled. It helps to smooth it out without becoming to heavy or flat.</li>
            <li> A great product for long hair because it can be sprayed only on the ends where it needs it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype over this product. I have thick, coarse hair and it takes a lot of sprays to get it to detangle even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have fine curly hair that gets INCREDIBLY knotted when I wash it. I can&#x27;t use anything too heavy because it weighs my hair down. I tried this on a whim a while back and I think it&#x27;s highly unlikely that I will ever need to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Works miracles and smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my hair seems to really like it! Makes it soft and keeps the frizz down. I also really, really enjoy the smell. The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you don&#x27;t need a ton of it so I think it will last a while. Worth the price, it seems!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Worried about some of the ingredients that are listed as toxic; including this:&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane (D5) is rated 3 out of 10 (10 being most toxic) in the Skin Deep database powered by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  Among other concerns is this chemical in our waterways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not reordering any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick, fine straight hair.  I normally have to use a lot of conditioner when I wash my hair and spray with a conditioner or detangler.  This stuff is incredible.  I no longer use ANY conditioner when I was my hair.  I just spray this on (and it does not take much) and my brush goes right through my hair.  I use it with my Olivia Garden Nano Brush that I also got here on Amazon.  And!  It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and what this does for my and my daughter&#x27;s hair!  You don&#x27;t really need any other product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dreamsicle version because everyone was raving about how good the smell was. The smell is good but it only lasts for a few seconds. It definitely does not affect the smell of your hair. So a little disappointing on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product does leave your hair very soft and I feel like it is nourishing my hair. Just a little disappointed that the smell doesn&#x27;t last and that the product is in such a small container.</li>
            <li> A bit thinker than expected but a very good leave-in that does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> nice smell and leaves my hair feeling soft. helps make my hair easy to detangle and comb out after washing.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair almost beyond repair going blonde. I was looking for a detangler that did more than just help me brush it out. I was sure to use up the whole bottle before reviewing- and I would buy this again. It has a weird scent to it and a little goes a long way. It definitely helped my damaged hair and added softness/bounce. The only complaint is the weird scent, I don&#x27;t know exactly what makes it smell weird but I just walked under a cloud of perfume to mask it. It&#x27;s not bad- sorta like men&#x27;s musk. overall I&#x27;m pleased with it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair greasy.  I like it a lot as my hair is dry and needs extra conditioning.  Sometimes the first spray spits out versus spraying out.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product. Leaves my hair shiny, frizz free and radiant. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product. I have not noticed a difference in my hair. When I spray it on/distribute it thru my hair, my scalp ends up itching. Maybe I have not used it long enough for my hair to improve.</li>
            <li> gnarly hair, tangles appear right after combing them out...was at wits end. I tried numerous products which either dried the hair out, gave me headaches due to the excess silicones or they just helped matt the hair more!  tried this &amp; wow!  my hair is soft &amp; the gnarls are gone.  I did not have to use an entire bottle like the other products!  I ordered the dreamsicle &amp; it smell nice. I was losing a lot of hair from trying to untangle the mess, but not any more.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> I just bought 3 bottles of this stuff and noticed immediately that the label is different from what is pictured and the Dreamsicle I normally purchase. When I checked the ingredients I noticed that those too had drastically changed. In the original formula argan oil is the 5th ingredient. In the new formula it is the 21st ingredient. I think the argan oil is what made this detangler work, so I&#x27;m leery - sooo many ingredients have changed. I&#x27;m going to try this new formula, and if it isn&#x27;t as effective I&#x27;m returning it. What is pictured is NOT what you will receive. Amazon, change your photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried the new formula this morning and found this product to be about 60% as effective as the original, so definitely not as effective at detangling and softening. And when blow-drying my hair out this morning I found this new formula left a &#x27;tacky&#x27;, greasy residue on the palms of my hands and hair instead of the smooth, silky, and slippery feel of the original. My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and CLEAN after using this product, and I&#x27;m still debating on whether to return the 3 bottles I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually just bought a bottle of pure argan oil because I&#x27;m now convinced that this is the oil in the original formula that conditioned without weight.</li>
            <li> I have long thin dry hair. I also suffer with dandruff and scalp dermatitis. This product adds luster to the hair and helps keep the dermatitis under control. I can use less of my steriod solution since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been on a mission to grow my hair out long (for the first time ever). I&#x27;ve been trying the new hair cleaning method, which I heard about on Pintrest. Since many shampoos actually strip your hair of your natural oils, its really not good. I know it sounds weird, but I&#x27;ve actually been washing my roots with baking soda and then spraying vinegar on the rest (after I&#x27;ve washed out the baking soda). At the end of my shower I wash out the vinegar. I was looking for a detangler to add to this process, so I thought I&#x27;d try this. It works SO good. I use a few squirts after my hair is semi dry but still damp. I can brush right through it, no problem and it leaves my hair smelling like, well, dreamy. I&#x27;ve only been using this for just under a month and have been doing this baking soda process for a little over a month. My hair has no joke grown at least a good 3+ inches and it looks so healthy. Which is exactly what I was looking to get done. I plan on continuing this process and using this product. With that being said, the only thing I&#x27;ll be changing is which seller I buy from AAAbeauty has had bad customer service and idiotic selling practices. They sent me a bottle without a cap wrapped in kitchen plastic wrap. Who does that?? Weirdos... I lost about half of the product in the shipping process, what a mess.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy, dry light brown hair. This stuff is amazing. It far outperformed my expectations. I spray it in my hair liberally before bed, twist my hair into a loose bun, and when I wake up, I have perfectly smooth, shiny, healthy hair with soft waves -- there is no residue or build up.  I have tried numerous other products but nothing works as effectively as this stuff.  &amp;#34;Dreamsicle&amp;#34; smells pleasant. I will probably try another scent next time I order just out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great but be careful you don&#x27;t get any on your floor.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, doesn&#x27;t take much, lasts all day.  Really like it. Leaves hair nice and shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear it, with other products or without I have flyaway frizzes everywhere. I guess I don&#x27;t know the trick to using it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty scent..soft..I really wanted &amp;#34;The Original Scent&amp;#34; but my Amazon Prime did not carry this scent. I hope to see &amp;#34;The Original scent&amp;#34; soon with A Prime. This works pretty well..I just had one part of a hair matt that was not salvageable. All in all the oils &amp; soft orange scent really detangled much of my hair matts..for very fine hair!</li>
            <li> Was concerned about the smell after reading conflicting reviews - I personally think the product doesn&#x27;t even have a scent. It&#x27;s vaguely citrusy-sweet when sprayed on wet hair, but that smell is gone by the time I&#x27;m done brushing and let it air dry. I have thin blonde hair that gets wretchedly tangled from the hard DC water post-shower &amp; this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I gives great slip when detangling my hair.  The only down fall is I have to order it. So I tried something I thought may be equalivqant that I could buy in the store. It didn&#x27;t work. Therefore, I will be ording from amazon on a monthly basis. I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel wonderfully healthy again!</li>
            <li> Smells great and does not leave residue like most products.  I love this stuff and use it every day.  A must have.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and only need to use a small amount!</li>
            <li> If you have fine, limp hair BE CAREFUl - one or two sprays is PLENTY!  I liek it though.  I does the job.</li>
            <li> Having baby fine, thin hair, I&#x27;ve suffered for years when coming out just washed, wet hair.  Then I was introduced to this product, and knew I&#x27;d found marvelous relief!  Just a few sprays of this cream onto my hair, massaged in, allow me to comb out all the tangles with ease.  The product also has a wonderful scent.  I no longer fear the pain associated with washing my hair, and it remains soft and manageable when dry and styled!  I only wish I&#x27;d found this product years earlier.</li>
            <li> I like it because just one drop smooths my frizz and fly away hair.  When I use it to style my hair, it makes my hair behave and shinny.</li>
            <li> Awesome! We have been searching for a product for my daughters thick hair, and we found the answer. It smells great and it keeps her hair soft and tangle free (or close to it). Paired this with the knot genie brush and we don&#x27;t have any more hair brushing tears!</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy , 30+ years of coloring hair. For my kind of hair, gray underneath dye and highlights, it works great. I use it while my hair is still wet right after the shower,  then blow dry, use an iron  and it stays smooth until I wash it out.  It doesn&#x27;t take more than five squirts because my hair is thin all over my head. There is an orange fruit smell that goes away once you use the hair dryer.   The best parts, are I can use a lower heat setting on the iron, 375, and it is much easier to get my hair smooth than any other product I have used</li>
            <li> Best. Stuff. Ever. Unlike drugstore and standard salon detanglers, this doesn&#x27;t put chemicals on your hair that erode the cuticle or fade color. It smells wonderful, use enough and even a full blown matted bird nest mess of hair can be combed out without breakage or pain. Also A great gift for anyone on bed rest, with an extended illness or hospital stay.</li>
            <li> We love the product! My boyfriend has natually curly hair and it works awesome! And the aroma of coconut is amazing also. We have recommended this product to other also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I bought this without doing a ton of research, purely to use as a detangler. I have long straight fine hair that gets super tangled when I wash it and I just needed something to help detangle that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I used it for the first time this morning when I got out of the shower. Not only did it work perfectly as a detangler, but as a bonus.....my hair is super soft and shiny! AND...it&#x27;s a rainy humid day in Houston, so I figured well my hair looks and feels awesome right now but as soon as I step outside it&#x27;ll be all blah and frizzy. Well..I just got to work and looked in the mirror...GORGEOUS. It&#x27;s so light, soft, shiny and smooth. No frizz. I don&#x27;t think my hair has ever looked so good from styling at home! Oh, and I don&#x27;t really even style. I just blow dry with a round brush. It&#x27;s gorgeous. I&#x27;m a lifetime customer now!</li>
            <li> Great scent and detangles</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft.Protects during heat styling and detangles. My hair is fine and flat. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. It lasts me 2or 3 months. you only need a few pumps</li>
            <li> My hair was looking and feeling dry even with using good products. I started using this and it looks and feels super healthy!!!</li>
            <li> This spray works wonders in helping to detangle the rat&#x27;s nest that is my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very fine and very long hair (she wants hair as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s) that very easily tangles.  This spray coats the hair shafts and easily helps the special detangled brush I bought to untangle her hair.  So much easier and less painful brushing my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the product really very much. I have dark brown dry and frizzy hair and I was always looking for the products which could moisture and soften my hair. And plus, it detangles and it is much more easy to brush my hair than before (now brushing is fun:). I am going to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair so my hair gets tangles very easily even if I condition it. I bought this product originally at a party and fell in love. It keeps my hair from getting crazy tangled and even controls the frizz amazingly. I also dye my hair a lot and style it and my hair never looks damaged. It really hydrates the hair which is great. Plus it smells amazing. You only need a couple squirts too I use the product every day and one bottle lasts me two months. My hair is past my shoulders but not quite to my elbows. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair: fine, wavy, shoulder length, colored (henna), curls in humid weather, frizzes if I brush it when dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid brushing my hair when it is dry, because it gets frizzy (and not in a good \\&quot;Ms. Frizzle\\&quot; way). I also don&#x27;t have time to shampoo and condition it every morning. I bought this as a compromise. Wash my hair every day and use this on days when I don&#x27;t have time to condition it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well, I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using my conditioner at all. My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy, the curls are softer, and it looks thicker (has more body?). I also love the smell, but that will be an individual thing for everyone that tries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I wrote this review after using it for one month. It&#x27;s now 3/1, and I&#x27;ve been using it for two months. Tonight, I was combing my hair before bed, and I realized how much I love my hair! This may not mean much to those of you blessed with great hair, but I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that tangled easily and broke if I looked at it cross eyed. I have a terrible time growing my hair, because it breaks so easily. (And don&#x27;t remind me about when I got a perm last year, and rows of my hair snapped off during the process.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is softer, stronger, my waves are lifting into curls, and even my hair color is richer. I can&#x27;t guarantee that it will work this well for you after two months, but give it a try and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and after two months, five or six squirts a day, I&#x27;m only one third of the way through my bottle</li>
            <li> I am reviewing how it was received to me.  It was FROZEN and part of the cap was chipped.  I did not get to use this product unfortunately as I immediately returned it.</li>
            <li> From the others review I decided to purchase Marrakesh Leave in Treatment. It dried my hair out. Its smells good, but its not nourishing I guess.</li>
            <li> Product works super well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t 100% love the smell, but the function of the product is too good to hold that against it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives you the silky hair (not greasy) that you are looking for. I wold recomand this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and it smells nice too.  I have heard from my friends that they make other products that are excellent as well.  This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, lightly curly hair that tends to look unkempt if I don&#x27;t use all sorts of products in it. I started using this and found that it is ALL I need. I spray it on after a shower, and I have instant manageable hair. I love it. It does something to the texture of my hair that just &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; it down without getting rid of the wave or the curls. It takes the knots out instantly, too. I always have a tough time combing or brushing my hair after a shower, even with conditioner. One spray, and it&#x27;s instant detangling. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again. I don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> One of the best leave in hair moisturizers I have ever used... never leaves hair dull or sticky and leaves it soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> pretty good not a lot of product for the price</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff right here!! My daughters hair turned from ratty to gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product. i bleached my hair three times in two months and it made my hair soft and manageable. i even noticed significant growth! it smells amazing too. this is really a miracle product, i will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Just love this product. Can&#x27;t find it in my area. I use it a couple of days a week. A little goes a long way. Leaves hair so soft and it&#x27;s a great detangler. Granddaughter loves it also.</li>
            <li> I was using Moroccan Oil prior to this, and I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I had hoped for so I tried this product instead. I love everything about it! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and already see a difference. I have a lot of fine hair and I have noticeably less frizziness due to the dry environment I live in. The scent is also really nice. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Dreamsicle scent is divine! It really does remind me of a creamsicle, albeit warmly (not overpoweringly) fragranced. I usually avoid citrus scented products (my cat is with me on this) but the hint of vanilla softens it and really makes it wearable. The scent gradually fades. I carry some in a 3oz. travel spray bottle in my handbag since it&#x27;s great for last-minute moments such as rainy day hair and as a skin moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you want a more even application, and not spray small gobs onto your hair, spray it into the palms of your hands and lightly rub them together, then rake them through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been growing out my fine, fully-highlighted blonde hair on this product and it is now only 3 inches away from my hips. Note: I have not used a hair iron in over a year, and rarely blow dry, which might have sped up results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes it so smoothe and shiny! There is no greasiness (I give it about five spritzes to the ends and work it upwards). One of the most important things is that it has helped to stop my hair from breaking off in my comb and brush. There are no more clumps in my hair tools! My hair looks and feels much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts at least five months since I wash my hair once per week (more often if I&#x27;m in hot and humid climates) and I don&#x27;t need to re-apply daily. It is the only hair product I use after washing. At one point, I ran out of hair conditioner and so I sprayed this detangler on, left it for a few minutes while getting dressed, and was able to run a comb through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first product from the Earthly Body company, and I am very impressed. Their Endz and Miracle Oil products are brilliant, as well. I tested some samples and will buy the full sizes. I also love that they use more natural ingredients and not so many harmful chemicals that other products (such as the overpriced It&#x27;s A 10) have.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny. I have really long hair that gets tangled when I wash it, this makes it a lot easier and less painful to brush after a shower, not to mention it smells good too.</li>
            <li> We use this spray to get out the daily tangles from my eight year olds long, fine hair. It&#x27;s great...not greasy, and it really frees up tangles better than anything we&#x27;ve used. It adds some moisture, which is great for us.</li>
            <li> I had always been looking for a good product to keep my long hair from snarling after washing, with a few hits and many more misses.  When I found the Marrakesh, I thought it was a bit pricey, but would give it a try.  WOW!  So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far and away the best product I have used to keep my hair soft, shiny, and tangle free.  I agree with another reviewer - I have never been so happy with my hair! :)  The scent - Dreamsicle - is a lovely, light citrusy scent, and yes I will be trying the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so with the quality - I think this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> Great smell and I like what it does for my hair. It is a great detangler for fine hair and isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> Works great, smells wonderful ❗️</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on its amazon reviews and ratings.  I have dry, frizzy, wavy hair.  And I live it Miami, humidity central!  I have only used it once, but I already feel my hair softer and less frizzy.  It is a little of the expensive side for the size, but I won&#x27;t mind purchasing again if keeps softening my hair.  Also, it smells like orange sherbert ice cream!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product. Great for winter static hair. Makes my hair healthy looking and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used to use Miracle 10 as my leave in but after several months I thought it was time to try something new. I was a bit nervous about the oil in this product but it&#x27;s fine. It leaves my hair feeling full, healthy and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all. I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but I thought it would be more natural than it is. I&#x27;m going to go back to using a little dab of natural conditioner as a leave in treatment instead of spraying this on my toddler.</li>
            <li> I have healthy fine, 3A curly hair and a cabinet full of hair products.  This leave-in was middle-of-the-road for me.  I liked the fragrance (wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming and behaved well enough w/other products) but overall, the product didn&#x27;t really do much in the way of offering extra conditioning or shine, to the point wherein I&#x27;d purchase it again, especially online.  On the other hand, I can say anything negative about it, either.</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh for several years and love it.  My thin, frizzy, curly hair is more manageable when I use this product.  I would definitely recommend  this product if you use leave in conditioning products, or have frizzy hair. Dreamsicle is my favorite scent but they all smell nice.</li>
            <li> my stylist used this in my hair and I loved the way it made my hair feel and smell.  I had to have it, It still smells wonderful and makes my hair feel soft but after a while, it make me look like I have dandruff.  For this I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is great and makes your hair smell nice and all shiny! If you do not usually dry your hair you can put this on your hair and just comb through and it seems to help dry your hair nicely with a good shine. I put this on after I dry my hair too, but a little goes a long way, otherwise you can make your hair too oily!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, good product. Highly recommened</li>
            <li> Nice, but didn&#x27;t detangle my blonde, mildy wavy wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> i even use it on my dogs with curly hair, works like a charm  My hair is long and very wavy, it makes combing a breeze</li>
            <li> Pravana who?  I love the way this makes my hair soft and strong.  I always used Pravana before this...not anymore!</li>
            <li> My favorite detangler, smells so good.  Does not leave a film on hair, actually conditions the hair, not heavy though</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  The smell is nice and not overbearing (dreamsicle scent). I really like that it softens my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or greasy.  I have long hair so I use a fair amount of it. If you have long hair I suggest you get a bigger bottle then the 8 oz.</li>
            <li> OK.  I had high hopes given the reviews. I found it to be pretty similar to any of the wal mart stuff I&#x27;ve tried.  However, my hair now after 2 weeks feels drier then ever.  I think I&#x27;m going to try no-poo for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how this makes my hair feel.  It is very drying.  I even let my boyfriend try it and he said the same thing.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work in our house.</li>
            <li> Great oil, tried a friends and had to have my own.  My hair is colored often and this makes my hair very soft</li>
