            <li>Just using a light blush makes me seem &#x27;done up&#x27;  Protege has given me beautiful skin, and the service they provide is beyond excellent.</li>
            <li>I used many products but this is the best one I can say.</li>
            <li>Laminate is a every good cream.  </li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>And a couple days ago, I was in a store looking at hair color and a lady asked me what product was good.</li>
            <li>but is good can&#x27;t believe wat this cream did for me.</li>
            <li>I used to have self confidence problems because my legs are full of marks but this cream has helped me a LOT!!!</li>
            <li>and I know there are many beautiful women and men who are my friends.    </li>
            <li>and the customer care i have received  is exceptional.</li>
            <li>On top of that, great customer service.</li>
            <li>This product works and I am very glad I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because of the great reviews but for some reason it just does not work on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream has worked wonders for me, I&#x27;m very confident in my skin now.</li>
            <li>My friends and family have been noticing as well and it makes me feel great :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put Flawless first then apply this after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>You need to try this product because I promise you will love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I put on flawless first, waited 10~15 minutes before put on Luminate and</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this cream!</li>
            <li>I got a very friendly and helpful response immediately!  </li>
            <li>this is an amazing product and iwill continue to use it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>So I used this for 1 month straight twice a day with Flawless.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own, and unbiased.</li>
            <li>I am hoping the product remains effective even with the added body lotion.</li>
            <li>The consistence of the lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of a funky smell.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Product is great and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its smooth and has a pleasant odor to it.</li>
            <li>wait to see what my skin will look like in another 2 weeks - VERY HAPPY WITH THIS even if it doesn&#x27;t completely lighten my skin</li>
            <li>This is by far the best skin lightened I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>That combo seems be more effective together than either of them alone, synergistic effect.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many products from Protege Beauty and every one has delivered amazing results.  </li>
            <li>First of all I have to say their customer is probably the best ive ever experienced so far in my life!....</li>
            <li>If it seems like its still sitting on the surface of your skin just keep rubbing it in and very important to give the areas you treat with the cream some air so the friction doesn&#x27;t re-darken those areas.</li>
            <li>i already have a very light complexion....</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Makeup looks much better (and will look even better once the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; stage is over)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>customer service is outstanding and I love this company.</li>
            <li>too many five stars on my this product</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>sure you are using it at night when skin is the most receptive to absorption..</li>
            <li>I have used MANY skin lightening creams over the years.</li>
            <li>Superb is the word... didnt actually want</li>
            <li>I am absolutely IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>It has visibly lightened the area I wanted, but still could use a bit more lightening</li>
            <li>I used it in addition with kojic acid soap which made it even better.</li>
            <li>am hoping  for  better  results.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;d order again. :)</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresher and more even now.</li>
            <li>I am overjoyed, amazed, and extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>is top notch, too.  </li>
            <li>Save your money or find a better cream.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I feel so confident now.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than no change.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>glad I did</li>
            <li>Better than any I have received after an online purchase.  </li>
            <li>I tried Flawless along with Luminate starting 01/25/2015.</li>
            <li>I will continue using them and hopefully the can be totally eliminated and my face can be truly flawless.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I expect it to work better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty good</li>
            <li>As so many know it is important to take care of ourSelves.  </li>
            <li>and she said she was delighted to try something new!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and rubs in well.</li>
            <li>Cream goes on easily</li>
            <li>It took almost 2 months to see good result, but I am satisfied to have a clear and brighter looking skin now.</li>
            <li>but my face doesn&#x27;t show as many wrinkles since I&#x27;ve starting using Protege! :o)</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for several weeks now, and am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does burn a bit when you apply it but nothing huge.</li>
            <li>it will make it smooth</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I got this product free for a review but that does not change my opinion any.</li>
            <li>I received this to try out then write an honest and unpaid review abput my thoughts.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews posted here as 90% of these reviews are posted becuase Protege gave them the product for free trial / discounted.</li>
            <li>I held those spots when I had my Second child, so glad all of them are gone for good.  </li>
            <li>I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had significant if not gradual results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beauty products take a while before you can notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I love how it gives my skin an even tone and looks so much brighter!</li>
            <li>at about 1 month, by end of Feb, 2015, the scars faded significantly, and size also shrank.</li>
            <li>product works but is definitely best used in small areas.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully,its very gradual though but the result is sure.i love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not making my sensitive break out.</li>
            <li>I received a quick reply from their customer service representative Stephanie, who gave me some helpful advice to keep in mind.  </li>
            <li>I will be sure to update my review if I see more results over the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I am definitely seeing results and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>so I will be sending some before and after photos very soon!!</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for less than 2 months twice a day &amp; so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Pores have reduced a bit but skin is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try..</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product useful at all.</li>
            <li>Not only is it changing the way my skin looks, but it makes my skin silky smooth :)</li>
            <li>now she does not have reapply her makeup multiple times a day to feel good about herself.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;imperfection&amp;#34; has faded that much in 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It worth the price</li>
            <li>the other side, the Customer Service is good</li>
            <li>If you want to see quick result, then chemical products with harmful bleaching agents like hydroquinone might be your better option, but if you prefer a safe and natural way to fix your skin then I would totally recommend to give Luminate a try.</li>
            <li>If I get a pimple, I know right away that a spot will follow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with many, many lightening creams for about 8 years now, and most creams have made my melasma worse, but I use this product coupled with aloe vera and sunscreen and it works under any temperature.</li>
            <li>First of all, I received a complimentary sample for my review.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries right in leaving the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>use it twice a day, and I am almost done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>and in the day time use an SPF HIGHER than 60, wear hats, or use parasols as the Kojic Acid in the cream will make you DARKER if you don&#x27;t protect your skin.......CONSISTENCY:</li>
            <li>However for the first week, every time I put in my face, I started having burning sensation but goes away.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m consistently using the cream to reach my goal.</li>
            <li>It does what it says if used consistently and correctly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a legit product!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>After applying LUMINATE for 3 weeks as recommended, my age spots are really beginning to disappear!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of my skin care needs from ProtÃ©gÃ© Beauty from now on.</li>
            <li>I chose to cover it up with some body lotion, which I personally find more pleasing.</li>
            <li>So much!</li>
            <li>It will be exactly exactly 3 months on March 17th since I started using the cream.</li>
            <li>I have used it consistently for over a month and see no difference.  </li>
            <li>I have used it mostly regularly, before bed time on most nights.</li>
            <li>I would love my money back!!!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li>When I first received laminate it seemed to lighten the hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li>This cream really does seem to be lightening them up!</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks, positive results started to show.</li>
            <li>It was just kind of &#x27;there&#x27; and reminded me slightly of a medicinal scent.</li>
            <li>And I have seen zero difference in my skin tone, the breakouts are gone, but my pores are still just as large.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not do this on large areas.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in a few more weeks at this rate!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a few more weeks at this rate!</li>
            <li>It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For anyone with this problem I HIGHLY recommend trying this!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely feel like ive been ripped off..</li>
            <li>..can&#x27;t be real reviews...</li>
            <li>so you do not need much.</li>
            <li>Am very  greatful  for the  results  .although  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks to the creator</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li>our skin is very susceptible to all sorts of happenings..</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if those people try it for real or they just got paid for their reviews</li>
            <li>Lumimate is gentle and works.</li>
            <li>I have been trying protege luminate for about a month, nothing really changed for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Really works and incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>it really a con anyway ??</li>
            <li>I  really thought it was working and stayed with it</li>
            <li>Very please.</li>
            <li>this has really, really worked for me.</li>
            <li>This cream really work it takes time</li>
            <li>It would take years of using this products to get real results and at 30 dollars</li>
            <li>The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like light lotion, which is not a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the other name brand product out there.</li>
            <li>I love this cream b/c unlike other skin lightening that I have used has not caused me any weight gain or constipation.</li>
            <li>I have only experienced slight results with LUMINATE so far.  </li>
            <li>And I belive this will be a new bathroom staple!</li>
            <li>, I wont recommend that you used your money in this particular money.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to share this with you in case you too are as particular as I am about your looks...</li>
            <li>and I have high hopes of seeing a difference any day now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of the Protege Cosmetics since I&#x27;m over 70</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly over-priced for its quality, imagine spending $29 every two weeks</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem consistent with what is typically marketed as \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot;, but my face still has dark spots around the cheek area and did not do the job I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li>I put the luminate creme on first, before it is dry, I put the hydroquinone creme on it, right away.</li>
            <li>I wish the quantity was a little more.</li>
            <li>I really like your product so far.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very please with the results.  </li>
            <li>(will post more in a few weeks as all the reviews and the product itself says it take a bit to work).</li>
            <li>when you remember..create a regimen because you can&#x27;t see results or have a negative review if you haven&#x27;t been consistent with a product....and most of all........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend it to anybody with a normal skin, or even combination skin.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for the promised results, few more weeks according to instructions?</li>
            <li>I got better results from Topic clear and the tube is less than 3 dollars...</li>
            <li>and I can apply my regular makeup right over it.</li>
            <li>Originally i had dark acne scars and very un-even skin tone.</li>
            <li>The downside is that the product stings a bit when first applied, and the amount of this product is only two ounces for $35!</li>
            <li>They use all natural ingredients &amp; no chemicals!  </li>
            <li>I have only been using for about 2 weeks, but I am used to Protege products working for me within the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>The skin lightening hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but the change in the texture of my skin is unbelievable - SO soft and smooth now!  </li>
            <li>I had large brown spots on my cheeks &amp; after 3-4 weeks they are fading &amp; getting smaller!</li>
            <li>I can see a lot of improvement in the skin tone though it takes a little more time to lighten it  but definitely works .</li>
            <li>have not gone completely  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use even after fade marks completely are gone.</li>
            <li>After finding out about Luminate and its natural ingredients, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my before and after pictures it&#x27;s been several weeks</li>
            <li>I have used this  product for four weeks ,and I can see a big change in my  really brown spots.</li>
            <li>I researched products and based on the natural ingredients in this product</li>
            <li>I have you been trying to fade burns and scars from my old job which involves cooking--</li>
            <li>After a few more uses I started to notice a tiny difference.  </li>
            <li>a LITTLE goes a long way because the cream is rich and thick but is absorbed by the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Luminate and used it every night, after finish the first bottle I noticed the dark spot is lighter but still there so I bought the second bottle.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up completely when a friend suggested this and after a short time of using it I started feeling like my old self again!</li>
            <li>I have always suffered from dark freckles on my face since I was a child, I have tried many other things but nothing has worked for me until now.</li>
            <li>Doesnt work on first bottle and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my red skin to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>I am currently using the Protege Luminate, it takes weeks to show results but my skin is soft and brighter.</li>
            <li>At 62 years old, the age spots are really starting to appear on my chest and hands.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a sticky residue and actually made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and luxurious with a light scent.</li>
            <li>What are you using different on it?&amp;#34; I told him what I was using and it had been only three days, so far.</li>
            <li>and I have spent so much money on different products that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the product is the Jojoba smell, which probably can&#x27;t be changed given its a major ingredient in the product.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me except for turning my face dark.</li>
            <li>Will not completely remove them (you need professional treatments for that)</li>
            <li>Used half of it and did not see much difference yet.</li>
            <li>also works really well on a  very few acne scars that i have from some recent breakouts and in less than 2 wks they have lightened ,,  worth the price....</li>
            <li>However, I can see enough change in my complexion to write a good review, otherwise I would give a bad one.</li>

            <li> Just using a light blush makes me seem &#x27;done up&#x27;  Protege has given me beautiful skin, and the service they provide is beyond excellent.</li>
            <li> I used many products but this is the best one I can say.</li>
            <li> Laminate is a every good cream.  </li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> And a couple days ago, I was in a store looking at hair color and a lady asked me what product was good.</li>
            <li> but is good can&#x27;t believe wat this cream did for me.</li>
            <li> I used to have self confidence problems because my legs are full of marks but this cream has helped me a LOT!!!</li>
            <li> and I know there are many beautiful women and men who are my friends.    </li>
            <li> and the customer care i have received  is exceptional.</li>
            <li> On top of that, great customer service.</li>
            <li> This product works and I am very glad I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because of the great reviews but for some reason it just does not work on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream has worked wonders for me, I&#x27;m very confident in my skin now.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have been noticing as well and it makes me feel great :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put Flawless first then apply this after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> You need to try this product because I promise you will love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I put on flawless first, waited 10~15 minutes before put on Luminate and</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream!</li>
            <li> I got a very friendly and helpful response immediately!  </li>
            <li> this is an amazing product and iwill continue to use it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> So I used this for 1 month straight twice a day with Flawless.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own, and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I am hoping the product remains effective even with the added body lotion.</li>
            <li> The consistence of the lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of a funky smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Product is great and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its smooth and has a pleasant odor to it.</li>
            <li> wait to see what my skin will look like in another 2 weeks - VERY HAPPY WITH THIS even if it doesn&#x27;t completely lighten my skin</li>
            <li> This is by far the best skin lightened I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> That combo seems be more effective together than either of them alone, synergistic effect.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products from Protege Beauty and every one has delivered amazing results.  </li>
            <li> First of all I have to say their customer is probably the best ive ever experienced so far in my life!....</li>
            <li> If it seems like its still sitting on the surface of your skin just keep rubbing it in and very important to give the areas you treat with the cream some air so the friction doesn&#x27;t re-darken those areas.</li>
            <li> i already have a very light complexion....</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> Makeup looks much better (and will look even better once the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; stage is over)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> customer service is outstanding and I love this company.</li>
            <li> too many five stars on my this product</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> sure you are using it at night when skin is the most receptive to absorption..</li>
            <li> I have used MANY skin lightening creams over the years.</li>
            <li> Superb is the word... didnt actually want</li>
            <li> I am absolutely IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> It has visibly lightened the area I wanted, but still could use a bit more lightening</li>
            <li> I used it in addition with kojic acid soap which made it even better.</li>
            <li> am hoping  for  better  results.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;d order again. :)</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresher and more even now.</li>
            <li> I am overjoyed, amazed, and extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> is top notch, too.  </li>
            <li> Save your money or find a better cream.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I feel so confident now.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still better than no change.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> glad I did</li>
            <li> Better than any I have received after an online purchase.  </li>
            <li> I tried Flawless along with Luminate starting 01/25/2015.</li>
            <li> I will continue using them and hopefully the can be totally eliminated and my face can be truly flawless.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I expect it to work better.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li> This product works pretty good</li>
            <li> As so many know it is important to take care of ourSelves.  </li>
            <li> and she said she was delighted to try something new!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> Cream goes on easily</li>
            <li> It took almost 2 months to see good result, but I am satisfied to have a clear and brighter looking skin now.</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t show as many wrinkles since I&#x27;ve starting using Protege! :o)</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several weeks now, and am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does burn a bit when you apply it but nothing huge.</li>
            <li> it will make it smooth</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I got this product free for a review but that does not change my opinion any.</li>
            <li> I received this to try out then write an honest and unpaid review abput my thoughts.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews posted here as 90% of these reviews are posted becuase Protege gave them the product for free trial / discounted.</li>
            <li> I held those spots when I had my Second child, so glad all of them are gone for good.  </li>
            <li> I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had significant if not gradual results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beauty products take a while before you can notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives my skin an even tone and looks so much brighter!</li>
            <li> at about 1 month, by end of Feb, 2015, the scars faded significantly, and size also shrank.</li>
            <li> product works but is definitely best used in small areas.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully,its very gradual though but the result is sure.i love it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not making my sensitive break out.</li>
            <li> I received a quick reply from their customer service representative Stephanie, who gave me some helpful advice to keep in mind.  </li>
            <li> I will be sure to update my review if I see more results over the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I am definitely seeing results and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> so I will be sending some before and after photos very soon!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for less than 2 months twice a day &amp; so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Pores have reduced a bit but skin is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try..</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product useful at all.</li>
            <li> Not only is it changing the way my skin looks, but it makes my skin silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> now she does not have reapply her makeup multiple times a day to feel good about herself.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;imperfection&amp;#34; has faded that much in 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It worth the price</li>
            <li> the other side, the Customer Service is good</li>
            <li> If you want to see quick result, then chemical products with harmful bleaching agents like hydroquinone might be your better option, but if you prefer a safe and natural way to fix your skin then I would totally recommend to give Luminate a try.</li>
            <li> If I get a pimple, I know right away that a spot will follow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many, many lightening creams for about 8 years now, and most creams have made my melasma worse, but I use this product coupled with aloe vera and sunscreen and it works under any temperature.</li>
            <li> First of all, I received a complimentary sample for my review.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries right in leaving the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> use it twice a day, and I am almost done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> and in the day time use an SPF HIGHER than 60, wear hats, or use parasols as the Kojic Acid in the cream will make you DARKER if you don&#x27;t protect your skin.......CONSISTENCY:</li>
            <li> However for the first week, every time I put in my face, I started having burning sensation but goes away.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m consistently using the cream to reach my goal.</li>
            <li> It does what it says if used consistently and correctly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a legit product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> After applying LUMINATE for 3 weeks as recommended, my age spots are really beginning to disappear!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of my skin care needs from ProtÃ©gÃ© Beauty from now on.</li>
            <li> I chose to cover it up with some body lotion, which I personally find more pleasing.</li>
            <li> So much!</li>
            <li> It will be exactly exactly 3 months on March 17th since I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> I have used it consistently for over a month and see no difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used it mostly regularly, before bed time on most nights.</li>
            <li> I would love my money back!!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li> When I first received laminate it seemed to lighten the hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> This cream really does seem to be lightening them up!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, positive results started to show.</li>
            <li> It was just kind of &#x27;there&#x27; and reminded me slightly of a medicinal scent.</li>
            <li> And I have seen zero difference in my skin tone, the breakouts are gone, but my pores are still just as large.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not do this on large areas.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in a few more weeks at this rate!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a few more weeks at this rate!</li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For anyone with this problem I HIGHLY recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> but I absolutely feel like ive been ripped off..</li>
            <li> ..can&#x27;t be real reviews...</li>
            <li> so you do not need much.</li>
            <li> Am very  greatful  for the  results  .although  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks to the creator</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li> our skin is very susceptible to all sorts of happenings..</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if those people try it for real or they just got paid for their reviews</li>
            <li> Lumimate is gentle and works.</li>
            <li> I have been trying protege luminate for about a month, nothing really changed for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really works and incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> it really a con anyway ??</li>
            <li> I  really thought it was working and stayed with it</li>
            <li> Very please.</li>
            <li> this has really, really worked for me.</li>
            <li> This cream really work it takes time</li>
            <li> It would take years of using this products to get real results and at 30 dollars</li>
            <li> The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like light lotion, which is not a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other name brand product out there.</li>
            <li> I love this cream b/c unlike other skin lightening that I have used has not caused me any weight gain or constipation.</li>
            <li> I have only experienced slight results with LUMINATE so far.  </li>
            <li> And I belive this will be a new bathroom staple!</li>
            <li> , I wont recommend that you used your money in this particular money.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share this with you in case you too are as particular as I am about your looks...</li>
            <li> and I have high hopes of seeing a difference any day now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any of the Protege Cosmetics since I&#x27;m over 70</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Highly over-priced for its quality, imagine spending $29 every two weeks</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem consistent with what is typically marketed as \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot;, but my face still has dark spots around the cheek area and did not do the job I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li> I put the luminate creme on first, before it is dry, I put the hydroquinone creme on it, right away.</li>
            <li> I wish the quantity was a little more.</li>
            <li> I really like your product so far.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very please with the results.  </li>
            <li> (will post more in a few weeks as all the reviews and the product itself says it take a bit to work).</li>
            <li> when you remember..create a regimen because you can&#x27;t see results or have a negative review if you haven&#x27;t been consistent with a product....and most of all........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend it to anybody with a normal skin, or even combination skin.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the promised results, few more weeks according to instructions?</li>
            <li> I got better results from Topic clear and the tube is less than 3 dollars...</li>
            <li> and I can apply my regular makeup right over it.</li>
            <li> Originally i had dark acne scars and very un-even skin tone.</li>
            <li> The downside is that the product stings a bit when first applied, and the amount of this product is only two ounces for $35!</li>
            <li> They use all natural ingredients &amp; no chemicals!  </li>
            <li> I have only been using for about 2 weeks, but I am used to Protege products working for me within the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> The skin lightening hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but the change in the texture of my skin is unbelievable - SO soft and smooth now!  </li>
            <li> I had large brown spots on my cheeks &amp; after 3-4 weeks they are fading &amp; getting smaller!</li>
            <li> I can see a lot of improvement in the skin tone though it takes a little more time to lighten it  but definitely works .</li>
            <li> have not gone completely  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use even after fade marks completely are gone.</li>
            <li> After finding out about Luminate and its natural ingredients, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my before and after pictures it&#x27;s been several weeks</li>
            <li> I have used this  product for four weeks ,and I can see a big change in my  really brown spots.</li>
            <li> I researched products and based on the natural ingredients in this product</li>
            <li> I have you been trying to fade burns and scars from my old job which involves cooking--</li>
            <li> After a few more uses I started to notice a tiny difference.  </li>
            <li> a LITTLE goes a long way because the cream is rich and thick but is absorbed by the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Luminate and used it every night, after finish the first bottle I noticed the dark spot is lighter but still there so I bought the second bottle.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up completely when a friend suggested this and after a short time of using it I started feeling like my old self again!</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from dark freckles on my face since I was a child, I have tried many other things but nothing has worked for me until now.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work on first bottle and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my red skin to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Protege Luminate, it takes weeks to show results but my skin is soft and brighter.</li>
            <li> At 62 years old, the age spots are really starting to appear on my chest and hands.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a sticky residue and actually made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and luxurious with a light scent.</li>
            <li> What are you using different on it?&amp;#34; I told him what I was using and it had been only three days, so far.</li>
            <li> and I have spent so much money on different products that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the product is the Jojoba smell, which probably can&#x27;t be changed given its a major ingredient in the product.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me except for turning my face dark.</li>
            <li> Will not completely remove them (you need professional treatments for that)</li>
            <li> Used half of it and did not see much difference yet.</li>
            <li> also works really well on a  very few acne scars that i have from some recent breakouts and in less than 2 wks they have lightened ,,  worth the price....</li>
            <li> However, I can see enough change in my complexion to write a good review, otherwise I would give a bad one.</li>
            <li> This is the first lightener product that worked for me after trying at least four from the local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not competently gone, but it&#x27;s lighter, improving for certain.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is the dry skin you have to deal with while it&#x27;s doing it</li>
            <li> On a positive note, my sensitive acne prone skin isn&#x27;t getting any worse.</li>
            <li> This is a anecdotal evidence, not sure if this is real and reproducible.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has such high reviews?</li>
            <li> The most dramatic change can be seen on my face although it&#x27;s a slight change</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice company , but an impossible task without chemicals</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday for nearly a month when it finally ran out.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are sensitive to smells, this has a very slight smell that I can only describe as fermented seaweed which bothered me.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the product has a faint scent to it, that I found neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> a white girl with pink splotchy skin on my chest and shoulders from sun exposure and mild broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way it REALLY has to be rubbed in, or product disintegrates int pen</li>
            <li> Not only did the product lighten up the dark spots but my entire face is clearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a definite lightening of the pigmentation over time &amp; am curious to see how it will look at the end of month 3 &amp; after some sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> But not completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money trying different things and nothing worked except this.</li>
            <li> Because I have uneven skin tone and was wondering if it would get my face to a natural looking brighter/lighter skin complexion?</li>
            <li> I have some minor discoloration on one side of my face that is quite noticeable if I don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
            <li> It really seems to be a slow process for the skin lightening.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing what it does to my skin more along down the wrong.</li>
            <li> I am buying the third bottle for my dark spot and and hoping after the third bottle the dark spot will be totally vanished .</li>
            <li> use this together with other whitening lotions, this cream is the last step of the skin care.</li>
            <li> At first I was expecting the cream to give results right away which is quite unrealistic, but after using it at least twice a day (morning and night)</li>
            <li> There are several long time dark acne scars on both side of my face.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with dark spots on my face and since using this product they have shown back up on my face!</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots over my cheek for the last 5-6 years.</li>
            <li> ONLY hydro quinine  removes dark spots period.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I see is my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and have been fighting about acnes for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly but unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It is hard to evaluate a product after only having had it for a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious don&#x27;t throw away your money, this stuff will work just like a 5 dollar lotion from wal mart, except the 5 dollar lotion will have more benefits for your skin for the price payed, and this will not successfully whiten your skin or lighten dark marks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing as I expected.</li>
            <li> did not work as i expected</li>
            <li> Using Luminate for only a few weeks my face has evened out &amp; you can see my acne scars vanishing.</li>
            <li> I have dark pigmentations that appeared over my upper lip &amp; left cheek within the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> No what I expected.</li>
            <li> Once absorbed into the skin, the scent lingered faintly.</li>
            <li> and she has tried numerous ways to hide it for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Initially this caused me to break out all over my forehead and enlarged the pores on my cheeks, so I had to stop using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I anticipate that once the jar is empty, my blemishes will be gone.</li>
            <li> No real results</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars because it came as expected, can see changes on my face, will keep you posted</li>
            <li> I have a few sunspots on my face and hands and this is definitely lightening the spots.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money...!!</li>
            <li> If it works at all, it only very slightly reduces brown spots.  </li>
            <li> This product also works really slow, partly due to its natural ingredients which contrasts to hydroquinone creams like Ambi.</li>
            <li> I actually ran out of my original bottle, and I can&#x27;t afford another right now unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too</li>
            <li> MY CONCLUSION-- while Luminate didn&#x27;t work for me possibly due to thinning/aging skin, it may work for others.</li>
            <li> so i checked out some of the products that can be used to help correct the effects of the sun and came across a small family run business  called Protege (i am not a fan of big companies at all!)</li>
            <li> another 10~15 minutes before other cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> My dark acne scars, pigmentation around nose and other areas have lightened substantially.</li>
            <li> It dose not  absorbed well into the skin   </li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my face</li>
            <li> After using two bottles my dark spot became a shadow</li>
            <li> this cream is not worth 40 or 45 dollars...</li>
            <li> Does work with fading of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for two week&#x27;s now, those dark spots on my face are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned.</li>
            <li> the dark  spot  </li>
            <li> I have dark hyperpigmentation spots from acne and routinely use Luminate to correct dark spots and even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My dark sports almost gone.</li>
            <li> I then sought for a dark spot corrector that does not contain hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to lighten the dark skin areas...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to brighten your complexion, it just lightens some of your dark spots from pimples.</li>
            <li> Still have dark spots after 4 month+ use</li>
            <li> dark spots, age spots, freckles, melasma and hyperpigmentati.  </li>
            <li> I purchased their product called Luminate and am amazed at how it has lightened my skin and got rid of the dark spots on my hands and  chest and pigmentation at the side of my face.    </li>
            <li> Not worth the $45.00</li>
            <li> It truly worked on a dark spot that I wanted to lighten.</li>
            <li> I noticed dark spots less visible.</li>
            <li> It removes dark acne spots in less than a week.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s not even slight difference&lt;</li>
            <li> will show the hours later, looking seriously bad.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to eliminate a few dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Their website site is:[...]  and their products available also on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month; I am beginning to notice improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not even a little change.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> but I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to take the time to write about a few observations.</li>
            <li> Some nights, I wash up before I get in bed after it being dried up on my face for 2-3 hrs.</li>
            <li> I got this skin lightening cream because I have a few age spots that I want gone.</li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> I even tried it a few times to see if my skin could get used to it and never did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied, a customer service rep. will guide you in resolving any issues to your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I gave 3stars coz not sure if it works or not, I used it since  </li>
            <li> Used for months on spots with no meaningful results.  </li>
            <li> When I started, I used this creme alone, there was a small but, noticeable difference after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Not sure, if there is ceiling to the efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few brightening serums lately.</li>
            <li> I bought with high hopes, and am disappointed to report that it did nothing to my face.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m well over a month into using it at least 4x week</li>
            <li> for all my effort over at least four months and two jars at $25 a pop, there is no change in the skin darkening issue</li>
            <li> WORKS SLOW but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen even the slightest of signs that this stuff works and my dark spots are really not that bad..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now &amp; i have noticed a dramatic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she had a facial &amp;#34;imperfection&amp;#34; that made her feel ugly</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it was a teeny tiny tub (1oz) for 30.00 dollars!!</li>
            <li> The only con is it&#x27;s very expensive for a small jar :(</li>
            <li> I saw lightening of some badly pigmented areas within a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually sad to say that this was $30 dollars</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical it would even work.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others that the reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li> Sadly it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t benefit me.</li>
            <li> My review isn&#x27;t fake btw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating</li>
            <li> This crap is no good..</li>
            <li> I order this product, because I am desperately want to find cure to get rid of Freckles on my face.</li>
            <li> I had really bad pigmamtaion.</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> so I was a disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t wait for the result because your not gonna see any changes:(</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> I know what its like to have horrible skin.. and anyone who is looking for a &amp;#34;change your life&amp;#34; product i&#x27;m telling you this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Because of the hole in the ozone layer and the cruel rays of the sun</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this item did not do as it promised.  will not order again.  Wasted my money</li>
            <li> Ok so YES it works.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it will make your skin lighter&lt;br /&gt;YES it will make it smooth&lt;br /&gt;YES (overtime) it can fade acne scars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does burn a bit when you apply it but nothing huge. Pores have reduced a bit but skin is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I Used two jars of this cream  It dose not  absorbed well into the skin   After two jars I have to say I don&#x27;t see a lot of improvement  So I&#x27;m changing to something else</li>
            <li> Laminate is a every good cream.  I&#x27;m loving it. It took away the spots on my face. I held those spots when I had my Second child, so glad all of them are gone for good.  I will proceed to use laminate as my face cream.</li>
            <li> Comes out yellow on skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually sad to say that this was $30 dollars and I don&#x27;t even use it! It&#x27;s nothing as I expected. It&#x27;s such a tiny jar. not worth it. At all.  I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> this lightening cream don&#x27;t do  any thing my skin is the same.</li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, and I am almost done with my first bottle. My skin is getting lighter. I think I am going to get my second bottle as soon as this one is done.&lt;br /&gt;I use this together with other whitening lotions, this cream is the last step of the skin care.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my face and I like to get rid of it. I bought my first bottle of Luminate and used it every night, after finish the first bottle I noticed the dark spot is lighter but still there so I bought the second bottle. After using two bottles my dark spot became a shadow so I want continue until it goes away. I am buying the third bottle for my dark spot and and hoping after the third bottle the dark spot will be totally vanished .</li>
            <li> After having my daughter I started noticing patchy discolorations on my face soon to find out it was a condition called chloasma  caused by my pregnancy. I have literally tried everything on the market and finally found this product-AND IT WORKS!!!! I was about to give up completely when a friend suggested this and after a short time of using it I started feeling like my old self again! For anyone with this problem I HIGHLY recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> AWESOME product!!  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a 10 days but have noticed such a change in my skin!!  The skin lightening hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but the change in the texture of my skin is unbelievable - SO soft and smooth now!  The only draw back is the dry skin you have to deal with while it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; but I use a great moisturizer in the morning.  Makeup looks much better (and will look even better once the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; stage is over)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in another 2 weeks - VERY HAPPY WITH THIS even if it doesn&#x27;t completely lighten my skin (will post more in a few weeks as all the reviews and the product itself says it take a bit to work).</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using this for 2 weeks, and can see the differences. This is much better than the other name brand product out there. I will definitely continue to buy this. On top of that, great customer service. Thank you protege.</li>
            <li> With hyperpigmentation and melasma as indicated by my dermatologist, ordering this product without steroids seemed to make sense.. However, applying it to darkened areas resulted in a stinging sensation. I emailed ProtÃ©gÃ©s customer service and immediately received help from Stephanie who suggested I stop using it for a week or two and restart to see if that would resolve the stinging sensation. I was truly hoping that it would but it didn&#x27;t. So, with her communication and guidance, I immediately received a refund. MY CONCLUSION-- while Luminate didn&#x27;t work for me possibly due to thinning/aging skin, it may work for others. If you&#x27;re not satisfied, a customer service rep. will guide you in resolving any issues to your satisfaction. It&#x27;s worth a try..</li>
            <li> Even though the cream not work for my mother but for some people it may. customer service is outstanding and I love this company.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but its too expensive....They should double the the amount of product for that money...</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good I might say. It&#x27;s very effective in treating discolored pigmentation. I&#x27;ve experimented with many, many lightening creams for about 8 years now, and most creams have made my melasma worse, but I use this product coupled with aloe vera and sunscreen and it works under any temperature. The downside is that the product stings a bit when first applied, and the amount of this product is only two ounces for $35! This product also works really slow, partly due to its natural ingredients which contrasts to hydroquinone creams like Ambi. However, I can see enough change in my complexion to write a good review, otherwise I would give a bad one.</li>
            <li> This crap is no good.. I haven&#x27;t seen even the slightest of signs that this stuff works and my dark spots are really not that bad..but I absolutely feel like ive been ripped off..this cream is not worth 40 or 45 dollars...I got better results from Topic clear and the tube is less than 3 dollars...I will not purchase again...too many five stars on my this product..can&#x27;t be real reviews...</li>
            <li> Product is great and was shipped quickly.  Will order again!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Does work with fading of dark spots.  Will not completely remove them (you need professional treatments for that) but it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  Lasts quite a bit which is also a plus!</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Protege Luminate, it takes weeks to show results but my skin is soft and brighter. The cream is thick and luxurious with a light scent. I am using it on my face for sunspots and on my hands. It is working, but results take time. I would purchase it again. I got this product free for a review but that does not change my opinion any. I think you will be pleased with this product. I am.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool. I was totally skeptical it would even work. However I&#x27;m well over a month into using it at least 4x week and I&#x27;ve had significant if not gradual results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a white girl with pink splotchy skin on my chest and shoulders from sun exposure and mild broken capillaries. And I belive this will be a new bathroom staple!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that i have only been using this product for five days now and i can already see the product breaking up my hyper-pigmentation under my skin...having a c-section did something to my body that i have never had to deal with....this is an amazing product and iwill continue to use it..my knees are already three shades lighter...my elbows are gonna need some dedication but hey, what doesn&#x27;t? what i can say is this no overnight miracle BUT people...please listen....the three keys to having it work is: TIMING-make sure you are using it at night when skin is the most receptive to absorption..and in the day time use an SPF HIGHER than 60, wear hats, or use parasols as the Kojic Acid in the cream will make you DARKER if you don&#x27;t protect your skin.......CONSISTENCY: even if you forget to put it on, do so when you remember..create a regimen because you can&#x27;t see results or have a negative review if you haven&#x27;t been consistent with a product....and most of all........ PATIENCE: you have give the product time to work on a CELLULAR level..ex: i stated that the cream is breaking up the darkness UNDER the skin so i will see results on the surface when my skin cells have had time to react to the cream.  Now i know we all wish it was bigger size but a LITTLE goes a long way because the cream is rich and thick but is absorbed by the skin very quickly. If it seems like its still sitting on the surface of your skin just keep rubbing it in and very important to give the areas you treat with the cream some air so the friction doesn&#x27;t re-darken those areas. Good Luck everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> I order this product, because I am desperately want to find cure to get rid of Freckles on my face. However for the first week, every time I put in my face, I started having burning sensation but goes away. I keep using it, because i want to see the result. at the third week my face turned red..I feel this product not working for me.. I will keep searching until i find the product work for me. By the way .. I use SPF all the time. The redness in my face appeared in the third week of using this product at home ! I just communicate with the company to refund my money, I will update you when I get refund!  I just want to update that, the Company keep a promise and refund my money back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has such high reviews? I bought with high hopes, and am disappointed to report that it did nothing to my face. For those of you who are sensitive to smells, this has a very slight smell that I can only describe as fermented seaweed which bothered me.  The ingredients seem consistent with what is typically marketed as \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot;, but my face still has dark spots around the cheek area and did not do the job I was hoping it would do.  I agree with the others that the reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li> did not work as i expected</li>
            <li> complete waste of money...!!</li>
            <li> Seeing results already. It makes my skin super smooth. Will post before and after Picts soon.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two week&#x27;s now, those dark spots on my face are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned. I didn&#x27;t find this product useful at all. I have been using this regularly for over 2 months now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now but have not noticed any lightened ng as of yet but I do like it. Its smooth and has a pleasant odor to it. Goes on easy and rubs in well. I will keep using it and I have high hopes of seeing a difference any day now. A little goes a long way too so you do not need much. I received this to try out then write an honest and unpaid review abput my thoughts.</li>
            <li> No, I did not see any result yet.</li>
            <li> So I used this for 1 month straight twice a day with Flawless. I&#x27;d put Flawless first then apply this after 5 minutes. NO EFFECT NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER. Waste of time. I am returning it. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews posted here as 90% of these reviews are posted becuase Protege gave them the product for free trial / discounted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month; I am beginning to notice improvement in my skin tone. I have used MANY skin lightening creams over the years. I spend a lot of time outdoors, I have freckles, and after 72 birthdays: &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;! This product is offering me the greatest hope of improving my problem areas.</li>
            <li> Superb is the word... didnt actually want some lightening product cz i already have a very light complexion....however was traveling abroad so needed something to prevent unwanted tanning.... i must say it does what it claims....also works really well on a  very few acne scars that i have from some recent breakouts and in less than 2 wks they have lightened ,,  worth the price.... wud be buying again....</li>
            <li> I am absolutely IN LOVE with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now &amp; i have noticed a dramatic change in my skin. Originally i had dark acne scars and very un-even skin tone. Using Luminate for only a few weeks my face has evened out &amp; you can see my acne scars vanishing. I am looking forward to seeing what it does to my skin more along down the wrong. I will definitely be using Luminate for the rest of my life. Not only is it changing the way my skin looks, but it makes my skin silky smooth :) I know what its like to have horrible skin.. and anyone who is looking for a &amp;#34;change your life&amp;#34; product i&#x27;m telling you this is the product for you! and the customer care i have received  is exceptional. Please do yourself a favor &amp; purchase this product, your skin will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say their customer is probably the best ive ever experienced so far in my life!....The cream has been working great. It has visibly lightened the area I wanted, but still could use a bit more lightening so I&#x27;m consistently using the cream to reach my goal. At first I was expecting the cream to give results right away which is quite unrealistic, but after using it at least twice a day (morning and night) it noticeably started to fade the darker area I was working on. I wish I took a before photo now that you mention it but I will take a current photo and compare it to the area once the darkness is fully faded. I really like your product so far. It does what it says if used consistently and correctly. Thanks for a legit product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best skin lightened I&#x27;ve ever used. You must be consecutive with your regiment to see results. I used it in addition with kojic acid soap which made it even better. The only con is it&#x27;s very expensive for a small jar :(</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me except for turning my face dark.</li>
            <li> Am very  greatful  for the  results  .although  the dark  spot  have not gone completely  am hoping  for  better  results.  My question is do l have to use it as a makeup even  after my problem  being  solved.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to have self confidence problems because my legs are full of marks but this cream has helped me a LOT!!! Thanks to the creator this is my purchase of the year</li>
            <li> I gave 3stars coz not sure if it works or not, I used it since  3 months ago I think and I didn&#x27;t see any changes</li>
            <li> I am definitely seeing results and I am very satisfied with the product. Not only did the product lighten up the dark spots but my entire face is clearer. Thanks a lot. Will continue to use even after fade marks completely are gone. The before pic was taken 03/18/2015 and the after pic was taken 05/08/2015.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for less than 2 months twice a day &amp; so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I have dark pigmentations that appeared over my upper lip &amp; left cheek within the past couple years.  I&#x27;m noticing a definite lightening of the pigmentation over time &amp; am curious to see how it will look at the end of month 3 &amp; after some sun exposure.  But at this point, I can see that it&#x27;s definitely doing something &amp; I&#x27;d order again. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to eliminate a few dark spots on my face.  It has not done the job so I was a disappointed.  However, I used it on the age spots on my hands.  It seems to work great on those spots.</li>
            <li> I came across Luminate while looking for an OTC alternative to clindamycin phosphate. I have been using the product for several weeks now, and am very pleased with the results! I have dark hyperpigmentation spots from acne and routinely use Luminate to correct dark spots and even my skin tone. My skin looks fresher and more even now. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the product is the Jojoba smell, which probably can&#x27;t be changed given its a major ingredient in the product. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  At 62 years old, the age spots are really starting to appear on my chest and hands.  After applying LUMINATE for 3 weeks as recommended, my age spots are really beginning to disappear!  I did not think these kinds of results were possible for someone my age!  I am overjoyed, amazed, and extremely satisfied.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in a few more weeks at this rate!  The customer care with this company is top notch, too.  I had some questions, and when I sent a message to ProtÃ©gÃ© I got a very friendly and helpful response immediately!  I also like the how-tos and follow-ups that this company sends throughout your use, so helpful!  This company also has a 365 day guarantee, so there is no risk when trying out their products.  I will definitely be ordering more of my skin care needs from ProtÃ©gÃ© Beauty from now on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for these reviews! You guys look at the dates all of the review were either made in January of this year or November of last year! These people were payed to give good reviews! I&#x27;m serious don&#x27;t throw away your money, this stuff will work just like a 5 dollar lotion from wal mart, except the 5 dollar lotion will have more benefits for your skin for the price payed, and this will not successfully whiten your skin or lighten dark marks!</li>
            <li> I bought it twice and it did not work. Would not recommend this product. Save your money or find a better cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work. After I used about 4 wks. My dark sports almost gone. I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This cream started working immediately on brown age spots on my lip and cheeks. Spots are almost gone after just three weeks of use. Cream goes on easily and I can apply my regular makeup right over it. This product works and I am very glad I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had some acne scars and hyperpigmentation spots caused by the benzoyl peroxide treatment. I then sought for a dark spot corrector that does not contain hydroquinone. After finding out about Luminate and its natural ingredients, I gave it a try. It took almost 2 months to see good result, but I am satisfied to have a clear and brighter looking skin now. If you want to see quick result, then chemical products with harmful bleaching agents like hydroquinone might be your better option, but if you prefer a safe and natural way to fix your skin then I would totally recommend to give Luminate a try.</li>
            <li> It is good. Clears blemishes and acne</li>
            <li> No what I expected. ..didn&#x27;t see any result</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I had large brown spots on my cheeks &amp; after 3-4 weeks they are fading &amp; getting smaller! They use all natural ingredients &amp; no chemicals!  I&#x27;ve bought all their products since &amp; they are all very safe! I highly recommend any of the Protege Cosmetics since I&#x27;m over 70 and  I use them morning &amp; night, but my face doesn&#x27;t show as many wrinkles since I&#x27;ve starting using Protege! :o)</li>
            <li> If it works at all, it only very slightly reduces brown spots.  Used for months on spots with no meaningful results.  Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference but I will update my review in a few weeks. Update.  After a few more uses I started to notice a tiny difference.  The product seems to work but you have to be patient, it will take time.</li>
            <li> Worked faster than I thought.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to lighten the dark skin areas...</li>
            <li> I noticed dark spots less visible.</li>
            <li> First of all, I received a complimentary sample for my review. All opinions are my own, and unbiased. It is hard to evaluate a product after only having had it for a short time. Beauty products take a while before you can notice a significant difference. However, I wanted to take the time to write about a few observations. First of all, the product has a faint scent to it, that I found neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It was just kind of &#x27;there&#x27; and reminded me slightly of a medicinal scent. Once absorbed into the skin, the scent lingered faintly. I chose to cover it up with some body lotion, which I personally find more pleasing. I am hoping the product remains effective even with the added body lotion. The consistence of the lotion is nice. It is light weight and absorbs rather quickly. It does not leave a sticky residue and actually made my skin feel soft. I am thinking next time I am going to apply this at night, so that I do not have to cover up the scent with a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Somewhat works on the pimple scars but not on freckles. It doesn&#x27;t seem to brighten your complexion, it just lightens some of your dark spots from pimples. But not completely.</li>
            <li> WORKS SLOW but seems to do the job. I only saw results towards the end of the container and had been using it for a couple of months. It really seems to be a slow process for the skin lightening. But it does work.</li>
            <li> I give up I wasted too much money using this often. Still have dark spots after 4 month+ use</li>
            <li> And you can copy and paste your wonderful comment from here:  I didn&#x27;t take before and after pics. I wish I did, because it has transformed my skin. I had really bad pigmamtaion. I feel so confident now. Love this product.. So much!</li>
            <li> Have not seen a difference</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly but unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The truth and the matter is, Doesn&#x27;t work. I used twice a day, 3 months, no results. I only got my clothes stained in yellow.&lt;br /&gt;In the other side, the Customer Service is good, they returned my money as advertised, &amp;#34;no question ask, no need to return the product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, I wont recommend that you used your money in this particular money.</li>
            <li> Sadly it did not work at all. It has been 6 weeks, but I&#x27;ll continue to try it.</li>
            <li> Experienced great results within 4 weeks. Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> aking care of our Selves..bodies..minds and souls..and skin.    As so many know it is important to take care of ourSelves.  Because of the hole in the ozone layer and the cruel rays of the sun our skin is very susceptible to all sorts of happenings..dark spots, age spots, freckles, melasma and hyperpigmentati.  Whether we are women or men our skin is the same and the sun does what it does regardless of who we are!  Yes, i am vain about my looks so i checked out some of the products that can be used to help correct the effects of the sun and came across a small family run business  called Protege (i am not a fan of big companies at all!) who are in Blaine, Washington.  I purchased their product called Luminate and am amazed at how it has lightened my skin and got rid of the dark spots on my hands and  chest and pigmentation at the side of my face.    I just wanted to share this with you in case you too are as particular as I am about your looks...and I know there are many beautiful women and men who are my friends.    Their website site is:[...]  and their products available also on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with dark spots on my face and since using this product they have shown back up on my face! I am telling all of my friends about it because they are noticing the difference on my face! You need to try this product because I promise you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream and I use it on my red skin to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after I red the reviews so I thought this is the thing I was looking for but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me so I don&#x27;t know if those people try it for real or they just got paid for their reviews .anyway if you want to waist about $40 like me u could but don&#x27;t wait for the result because your not gonna see any changes:(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she had a facial &amp;#34;imperfection&amp;#34; that made her feel ugly and she has tried numerous ways to hide it for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;She has used Luminate for 3 weeks now she does not have reapply her makeup multiple times a day to feel good about herself.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;imperfection&amp;#34; has faded that much in 3 weeks and she is sooooo HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I can see a lot of improvement in the skin tone though it takes a little more time to lighten it  but definitely works . I wish the quantity was a little more.</li>
            <li> Initially this caused me to break out all over my forehead and enlarged the pores on my cheeks, so I had to stop using it for a few days. And then I started again. It will be exactly exactly 3 months on March 17th since I started using the cream. And I have seen zero difference in my skin tone, the breakouts are gone, but my pores are still just as large. This cream didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving two stars to this product solely for the beyond excellent customer service that they have to offer. They did offer me a prompt refund after my forehead broke out. But I decided to this give them cream another try after. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t benefit me.</li>
            <li> Using for 2 weeks now, no noticeable improvement. On a positive note, my sensitive acne prone skin isn&#x27;t getting any worse.</li>
            <li> I have used it consistently for over a month and see no difference.  Not worth the $45.00</li>
            <li> Lumimate is gentle and works. It has been about 4 weeks now and I see improvement. I anticipate that once the jar is empty, my blemishes will be gone. I plan to buy another jar and continue to brighten overall once the marks disappear. Excellent product!Â </li>
            <li> I have had dark spots over my cheek for the last 5-6 years. I initially tried hydroquinone creme and it did not help. I just gave up. Then I found this product on Amazon and the reviews helped me give this creme a try. The scientific literature supports the use of hydroquinone creme, with kojic acid and steroid for treating hyperpigmentation. I am not too keen on using steroids for this condition. Given the fact this creme contained kojic acid, I was motivated by reviews, price and presence of kojic acid to give this creme a go. I have used it mostly regularly, before bed time on most nights. I have seen quite bit of difference. When I started, I used this creme alone, there was a small but, noticeable difference after about 3 weeks of use. After three weeks, I decided to use this creme in conjunction with hydroquinone. That combo seems be more effective together than either of them alone, synergistic effect. This is a anecdotal evidence, not sure if this is real and reproducible. I put the luminate creme on first, before it is dry, I put the hydroquinone creme on it, right away. Some nights, I wash up before I get in bed after it being dried up on my face for 2-3 hrs. After about 3 months, the pigmentation is 70% reduced and I do not see same degree of effectiveness now. Not sure, if there is ceiling to the efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying protege luminate for about a month, nothing really changed for me. No skin lightening effects what so ever. Really disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Does not work...buyer beware!!!    ONLY hydro quinine  removes dark spots period.  I would love my money back!!! These 5 star reviews are bogus as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using almost every day for a month. No real results</li>
            <li> This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my before and after pictures it&#x27;s been several weeks I should see something but I see nothing</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews i thought let me give a try&lt;br /&gt;its been almost 4 weeks but there&#x27;s not even slight difference&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars because it came as expected, can see changes on my face, will keep you posted</li>
            <li> Used half of it and did not see much difference yet. I&#x27;ll use for 2 months and comment after.</li>
            <li> I took before pictures just to have something to compare with after a couple of weeks. So far, I&#x27;m very please with the results.  I will be buying another one for my mom.  I have received a lot of compliments on my skin so I will be sending some before and after photos very soon!!</li>
            <li> I have used this  product for four weeks ,and I can see a big change in my  really brown spots. I really like this stuff. My daughter is using it also.Thank you amazon for this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this cream. I finally found that work for me. I love how light it feels, but most of all I love how it actually reduces the sun discoloration on my skin! I use this daily. I use sunscreen every day, but some sun still seems to get through and if I use Protege LUMINATE before bed, when I wake, the day&#x27;s sun damage is all but gone. This product was received for the purpose of testing and review.</li>
            <li> good product! that&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li> since i started to use the product, i have seen some changes. I&#x27;ve used the cream on my face for my acne scarring, underarms, between my legs where they rub and around my butt. The most dramatic change can be seen on my face although it&#x27;s a slight change but it&#x27;s still better than no change. the only problem is that i haven&#x27;t taken any before and after pictures to show the necessary proof as i was so eager to start using the product but i&#x27;ll tell  any and everyone that this product works!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Took some time for me to notice my brown spot fade, but it is. Been using it on a tattoo I don&#x27;t want and it&#x27;s fading that to.ð</li>
            <li> It works beautifully,its very gradual though but the result is sure.i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream b/c unlike other skin lightening that I have used has not caused me any weight gain or constipation.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me...not seeing  results.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It truly worked on a dark spot that I wanted to lighten. Thank you for a great product!  This is the first lightener product that worked for me after trying at least four from the local stores.</li>
            <li> Does not work well.  Wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I was given this cream to try. This product is AMAZING! I love how it gives my skin an even tone and looks so much brighter! On the third day Of using it my husband noticed my skin! He said, &amp;#34;Your face is so radiant! What are you using different on it?&amp;#34; I told him what I was using and it had been only three days, so far. He said, &amp;#34;Keep it up! Whatever you&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34; And a couple days ago, I was in a store looking at hair color and a lady asked me what product was good. We started talking and she turned to me and said, &amp;#34; You have the most beautiful skin!&amp;#34; I was floored! Then I told her about this product line and she said she was delighted to try something new! I told my husband later what she said about my skin and he agreed! I&#x27;m very pleased with all of the Protege products! They&#x27;re the best!</li>
            <li> You should refund me my money back because it did not work</li>
            <li> I am a African American who has a problem with hyperpigmentation . I&#x27;ve had this problem for as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s very frustrating and I have spent so much money on different products that didn&#x27;t work for me. Every time I look in the mirror the only thing I see is my dark spots. If I get a pimple, I know right away that a spot will follow. I researched products and based on the natural ingredients in this product is the reason I decide to give it a try. Even though I just started using this product my skin is liking the product and I am looking forward to seeing the results. I just ordered the entire line of products</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because of the great reviews but for some reason it just does not work on my skin. I emailed the seller to get a refund since it has a 100% money back guarantee and will update to tell you what they said!</li>
            <li> This is the product I have found to lighten my melasma. It&#x27;s been almost 6 months but I specifically used it on one area and not another....glad I did so I could see the difference but wish I had trusted it.  I&#x27;ve spent lots of money trying different things and nothing worked except this.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work on first bottle and doesn&#x27;t last long. Highly over-priced for its quality, imagine spending $29 every two weeks and it has also gone up to $44 by the time of this review</li>
            <li> Does this product lighten your skin tone? Because I have uneven skin tone and was wondering if it would get my face to a natural looking brighter/lighter skin complexion?</li>
            <li> Amazing !! Really works and incredibly fast. Only thing I can point out that is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;, is the smell. Kind of a funky smell. However it doesn&#x27;t stick around so it it really a con anyway ?? Nope. Will purchase again~</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> My holy grail skin lightening cream! It removes dark acne spots in less than a week. I applied it twice a day, morning and night, and the results are AMAZING! I actually ran out of my original bottle, and I can&#x27;t afford another right now unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> When I first received laminate it seemed to lighten the hyper pigmentation on my face. I  really thought it was working and stayed with it religiously&lt;br /&gt;. I learned the hard way it REALLY has to be rubbed in, or product disintegrates int pen I eraser-like stumbles or the yellow color will show the hours later, looking seriously bad.&lt;br /&gt;But for all my effort over at least four months and two jars at $25 a pop, there is no change in the skin darkening issue I have.&lt;br /&gt;I will see a dermatologist which is what I should have done.  It&#x27;s a nice company , but an impossible task without chemicals</li>
            <li> Great product. Very please.</li>
            <li> Actually I used this cream for about (1) week didn&#x27;t see any results so I stopped.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Does not work and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Product gave me rashes but they refunded my money.It was great I would recommend someone to buy if you not allergic to anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two months now, and my skin has been improving rapidly. My dark acne scars, pigmentation around nose and other areas have lightened substantially. My review isn&#x27;t fake btw. This cream has worked wonders for me, I&#x27;m very confident in my skin now. Just using a light blush makes me seem &#x27;done up&#x27;  Protege has given me beautiful skin, and the service they provide is beyond excellent. Better than any I have received after an online purchase.  I&#x27;ll recommend it to anybody with a normal skin, or even combination skin. It dries after a minute or so after application so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off! Perfect. In every way. Love!</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and have been fighting about acnes for the past 30 years. There are several long time dark acne scars on both side of my face. I tried Flawless along with Luminate starting 01/25/2015. After about 2 weeks, positive results started to show. at about 1 month, by end of Feb, 2015, the scars faded significantly, and size also shrank. I just finished 6 weeks of treatment now. I am very happy with the result. I will continue using them and hopefully the can be totally eliminated and my face can be truly flawless.  Thank you for a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them twice/day.  I put on flawless first, waited 10~15 minutes before put on Luminate and another 10~15 minutes before other cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this skin lightening cream because I have a few age spots that I want gone. This cream really does seem to be lightening them up! The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not making my sensitive break out.</li>
            <li> I have a few sunspots on my face and hands and this is definitely lightening the spots.</li>
            <li> Crap. Been using this for 2 months and NO difference. Not even a little change. What a waste</li>
            <li> I have you been trying to fade burns and scars from my old job which involves cooking-- this has really, really worked for me. After a couple weeks of just using once a day (not twice as suggested) it got to the point where I could not even see where I should put the cream because it faded my scars so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution though --&lt;br /&gt;Do not do this on large areas. After I saw it working on my scars I tried to even out a tan. Bad idea. I broke out in a red pimply rash. I even tried it a few times to see if my skin could get used to it and never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works but is definitely best used in small areas.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It goes on smoothly and dries right in leaving the skin soft and supple. I saw lightening of some badly pigmented areas within a few days. I see improvement daily with this product. I will reorder this item until I achieve flawless skin!</li>
            <li> Finally my skin is getting brighter after using it for over a month.  I expect it to work better.</li>
            <li> This cream really work it takes time but is good can&#x27;t believe wat this cream did for me. It worth the price I wi buy again I&#x27;m happy with the results</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help heal a hypo trophic scar that I received after having surgery. I was shocked that it was a teeny tiny tub (1oz) for 30.00 dollars!! I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results at all and I used it everyday for nearly a month when it finally ran out. It would take years of using this products to get real results and at 30 dollars a pop I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I am seeing the change on my skin tone. I didn&#x27;t have the picture before. I used many products but this is the best one I can say.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few brightening serums lately. No luck. I have some minor discoloration on one side of my face that is quite noticeable if I don&#x27;t wear make up. After one week of using this cream is already giving me some hope. It&#x27;s not competently gone, but it&#x27;s lighter, improving for certain. This product has a potential. I will continue using it. The only downside is this cream is not creamy, it looks and feels more like light lotion, which is not a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream! I have always suffered from dark freckles on my face since I was a child, I have tried many other things but nothing has worked for me until now. My freckles have drastically lightened and I have only been using this for three weeks! I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a few more weeks at this rate! My friends and family have been noticing as well and it makes me feel great :) Thank you Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products from Protege Beauty and every one has delivered amazing results.  I have only experienced slight results with LUMINATE so far.  I have only been using for about 2 weeks, but I am used to Protege products working for me within the first couple of weeks.  I realize that some products take longer than others, though, so I guess we will see.  The customer service, however, is the best on Amazon.  I received a quick reply from their customer service representative Stephanie, who gave me some helpful advice to keep in mind.  I will continue to use this for a couple more weeks.  Hey, I am guaranteed a refund if it doesn&#x27;t work, so I have nothing to lose.  I will be sure to update my review if I see more results over the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the promised results, few more weeks according to instructions?</li>
