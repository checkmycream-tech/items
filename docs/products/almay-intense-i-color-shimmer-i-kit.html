    <ol>
            <li>I got this and am happy with the color.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy to have to go get a brush/applicator to use.</li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow it blends very nice!</li>
            <li>I wore them for a wedding, which was awesome, but wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable for work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality good</li>
            <li>I love these pre-arranged color packs!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product because it gave colors that went together, along with where to apply them.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, and do go well together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but it looks better in the palette than on my eyes.</li>
            <li>very important - Almay is excellent for even a slight allergy to some powders.</li>
            <li>Like all shadows it does run so my whole face winds up with sparkles on it, but it is still gorgeous</li>
            <li>The colors look great and last all day, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Looks great on my blue eyes, as it describes.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors!</li>
            <li>Too my surprise it really bought out my eyes!!</li>
            <li>only kind of gal.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too dark because I&#x27;m fair skinned..</li>
            <li>The colors blend well and are pretty together.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color pattern and I use it several times per week.  </li>
            <li>Product came in time and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-These colors are really formal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye shadow!  </li>
            <li>Then you have to clean it unless you want to have mixed colors.</li>
            <li>I only wish the top light pink color was just a bit darker or had more sparkle to it as you can&#x27;t even see it on my pale skin</li>
            <li>and I love how by the end of the day the blue and grey/silver have mixed to form a new color.</li>
            <li>I am normally a lipstick/eyeliner/mascara/blush</li>
            <li>She hadn&#x27;t used these colors before, but says they apply just as smooth as her other Almay products.</li>
            <li>The case is solid and the colors are pretty well packed in.  </li>
            <li>The little brush dirties easily so the colors mush together on the brush</li>
            <li>It always stays fresh looking all day long and into the evening with no creasing or smudging, and at 64 I have no droopy eyelid look either!  </li>
            <li>I love the dark blue shade, though I use it as a liner rather than a cease shade.</li>
            <li>Especially if you don&#x27;t really know what you are doing.</li>
            <li>This set for blue eyes makes them really pop</li>
            <li>I have used brown or more dramatic darks for a long time, and these lights turn out to be pretty, long lasting, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>First time I had worn eye shadow outside of Halloween and the such.  </li>
            <li>Decent shades for blue eyes, though I suppose any eye color could use them.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t use much of the dark blue middle shade and it still has the same effect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long lasting, blends well</li>
            <li> only I just use the second color; the other two I do not need.</li>
            <li> and you get dark blue mixed in with the pink.</li>
            <li> It is a great product paired with the Lorac base!  </li>
            <li> I wind up using the pink and gray on my lids, and the navy as a liner.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful not to create a bruise</li>
            <li> These color combinations are also getting harder to find in stores, which is why I searched and ordered through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the way, I&#x27;m pale, blue eyed, blonde hair - I just find it hard to pull off dark eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li> I am 64 and always use a light application of Lorac base on my eyelids (upper and lower both) before application of this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> crease color is REALLY dark.</li>
            <li> so it feels like a waste.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they didn&#x27;t do the usual applicator with a sponge on each end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m not great with makeup application.</li>

            <li> Really pretty colors! I have used brown or more dramatic darks for a long time, and these lights turn out to be pretty, long lasting, easy to apply. I wind up using the pink and gray on my lids, and the navy as a liner.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and my teenage daughter...and we both like it! The colors blend well and are pretty together.</li>
            <li> color lasts all day. only I just use the second color; the other two I do not need. very important - Almay is excellent for even a slight allergy to some powders.</li>
            <li> I love these pre-arranged color packs!  This is my favorite color pattern and I use it several times per week.  The colors look great and last all day, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Looks great on my blue eyes, as it describes. I use it with the Almay I-Color Volumizing Mascara for Blue Eyes along with the Maybeline Espresso Unstoppable eyeliner. I only wish the top light pink color was just a bit darker or had more sparkle to it as you can&#x27;t even see it on my pale skin so it feels like a waste. The little brush dirties easily so the colors mush together on the brush and you get dark blue mixed in with the pink. Like all shadows it does run so my whole face winds up with sparkles on it, but it is still gorgeous and I love how by the end of the day the blue and grey/silver have mixed to form a new color.</li>
            <li> I received a lot of compliments when I wore this eye shadow for a wedding last year.  First time I had worn eye shadow outside of Halloween and the such.  I am normally a lipstick/eyeliner/mascara/blush only kind of gal.  It definitely made my blue eyes sort of pop.  I actually don&#x27;t use much of the dark blue middle shade and it still has the same effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m not great with makeup application. I liked this product because it gave colors that went together, along with where to apply them. The colors are nice, and do go well together. Just a couple words of warning:&lt;br /&gt;-The crease color is REALLY dark. Especially if you don&#x27;t really know what you are doing. I had to be careful not to create a bruise situation.&lt;br /&gt;-These colors are really formal. I wore them for a wedding, which was awesome, but wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable for work.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t use the applicator, I use eyeshadow brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m pale, blue eyed, blonde hair - I just find it hard to pull off dark eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li> Promptly delivered. Quality good</li>
            <li> I love the dark blue shade, though I use it as a liner rather than a cease shade. Decent shades for blue eyes, though I suppose any eye color could use them.</li>
            <li> Product came in time and is exactly what I wanted. Long lasting, blends well and I bought 2 others in different colors. Definitely makes your eyes pop and brings out the color of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this eye shadow it blends very nice! I was worried it would be too dark because I&#x27;m fair skinned..Too my surprise it really bought out my eyes!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but it looks better in the palette than on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Almay color combination eye shadow for about four years.  I am 64 and always use a light application of Lorac base on my eyelids (upper and lower both) before application of this eye shadow.  It always stays fresh looking all day long and into the evening with no creasing or smudging, and at 64 I have no droopy eyelid look either!  It is a great product paired with the Lorac base!  These color combinations are also getting harder to find in stores, which is why I searched and ordered through Amazon.  I highly recommend this eye shadow!  Hopefully, Almay will continue to produce this shadow combo!</li>
            <li> This set for blue eyes makes them really pop - I always get compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I got this and am happy with the color. I wasn&#x27;t happy to have to go get a brush/applicator to use. The one it comes with is only on one side of the stick, so you can use it for 2 colors. Then you have to clean it unless you want to have mixed colors. Also it started separating and so before it broke I got a make up brush and use that instead. Not sure why they didn&#x27;t do the usual applicator with a sponge on each end.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for the wife, she loves the colors and go well with and accent her blue eyes.  The case is solid and the colors are pretty well packed in.  She hadn&#x27;t used these colors before, but says they apply just as smooth as her other Almay products.</li>
