    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the excellent customer service</li>
            <li>This Water Flosser works and cleans great!</li>
            <li>Excellent product  </li>
            <li>After 14 months of excellent use the control button on the handle started sticking which cut off the water flow.</li>
            <li>With service like this I can fully understand the excellent rating given for this seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested the water pick idea to me and I researched the best brands.</li>
            <li>well thus you get the best pressure output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>customer service was impressive.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>am very happy with my purchase, about 2 months into using it.</li>
            <li>could just as well be a mechanical dial for me, but it also works perfectly the way it is.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is choose the level that works best for you.</li>
            <li>Best water flosser that I have used.  </li>
            <li>this one by Matwave is over all the best of the three.  </li>
            <li>This is great!  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;ABSOLUTELY AWESOME water flosser.</li>
            <li>Again, AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>It does massage your gums and make them healthier - my dentist is VERY happy.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service!  </li>
            <li>and we were very happy with it</li>
            <li>WELL pleased with my Cleanpro Water Flosser AND the Mat wave Technologies company!!!</li>
            <li>My dentist is happy and so am I.</li>
            <li>But I tried it and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great touch pad and magnetic holder for the pic.</li>
            <li>and they were great.  </li>
            <li>The magnetic wand holder is also very handy.  </li>
            <li>The best, tried many.</li>
            <li>a PLEASANT experience.</li>
            <li>It has been a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>It seemed in my case to be a product of good intentions and inferior execution.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the money I payed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with mouthwash and had good results</li>
            <li>I emailed Matwave once to ask a question and their customer service is superior.</li>
            <li>9-tips and accessory should be a good configuration for family use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Size wise</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works just as good as a water pik</li>
            <li>The reviews were good, so I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Matwave Flosser does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good unit.</li>
            <li>The assortment of tips are good for our couples&#x27; use, very easy operation with touch-pad and magnetic handle.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>Hence - fill with warm water before use.</li>
            <li>Liked the design:  controls, tank, cord and magnet.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the look and design of the product.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the design and functionality of the device.  </li>
            <li>The unit worked very well based on my wifeâ€™s comments as a very experienced water flosser user.</li>
            <li>that are nicely tucked away under the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The design</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  nice unit -- compact, quite with nice</li>
            <li>Nice appearance on countertop.</li>
            <li>While I am still a rookie user, I have found great success with this unit.</li>
            <li>I own many..</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, has a nice size reservoir, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space and has a great design.  </li>
            <li>This model seemed to be a good value from reading reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>touch/disaply thing works perfect, but it&#x27;s really nothing special.</li>
            <li>Most people will love it more than the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure.  </li>
            <li>It is not as noisy and holds more water.</li>
            <li>However, once you look into them closely, most flossers are alike, tanks, handles</li>
            <li>pleased with this product and would&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this model.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I purchase one, such a great investment!</li>
            <li>There is better .keep</li>
            <li>Love the magnetic seating of the power handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better waterpik.  </li>
            <li>It seems simpler in design and more robust.  </li>
            <li>#34;just been to the dentist&amp;#34; kind of clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very impressed with its magnetic handle mount, which is easy to get on and put back.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this flosser after reading all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants really good clean results!</li>
            <li>for me this is perfect, as I can also use it in Europe on 220V, a detail that other brands stubbornly refuse to help us out with, just because they can choose not to.</li>
            <li>and it actually feels GOOD!</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>and you cannot change it yourself easily, as it&#x27;s a custom connector...</li>
            <li>The highest pressure will cut diamonds, so it has industrial purposes beyond just keeping your teeth clean &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>A beautiful and solid unit!</li>
            <li>I love this (I use a full tank alone)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an oral irrigator!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon shipment was fast, product looked nice.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the flossers fit in the top of the reservoir and the top keeps the reservoir covered when not in use so</li>
            <li>The CSR I dealt with, Jason, was so kind and helpful and VERY expedient in helping me resolve my problem.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with the product, I had a problem it was sorted immediately , new unit without charge at no cost to me or shipping.the people of Matwave</li>
            <li>He is right, there are many models on Amazon, but I do not just want to get one on top of the list, no two leafs are identical, right?</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that the company gives the purchaser a two year warranty with free new replacement.  </li>
            <li>it stays clean.  </li>
            <li>We have used several brands and this is by FAR the best ever!</li>
            <li>It certainly tickles the gums but I am sure I will get used to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this water flosser because of the large water capacity.</li>
            <li>Directions are clear and it is a nice looking unit.  </li>
            <li>I will return it and go with the tried and true Waterpik.</li>
            <li>nothing to complain, works perfect after  months at least.</li>
            <li>It holds more water and the controls are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>However, unless the water tub is completely full it leaks around the o ring.</li>
            <li>two year warranty makes this device a worthy purchase versus portable hand held units (two were purchased)</li>
            <li>For the cost, it does an adequate job.</li>
            <li>I wanted to add that I love the magnetic handle holder feature and that the extra tips are neatly stored in the lid, unlike most others.</li>
            <li>Delivery was real fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful pulsating water jet stream gives my teeth and gums that &amp;</li>
            <li>I put a weight on top to force the tub to seat into the o ring completely.</li>
            <li>A larger reservior would be nice, but they all seem to come with this size.</li>
            <li>Better then most other products...</li>
            <li>Water Flosser met my expectations and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I wish the tipe was bent at right angle.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Much handier than my old WaterPik. Power more than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>Very large tank.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it might not be powerful enough, but the pulsing at high is actually more than I use!</li>
            <li>Lowest pressure will gently caress even the most sensitive gums without discomfort (I was HYPER-sensitive at first.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more at the next checkup!  </li>
            <li>I could not get it to seal on a consistent basis and it leaked all over my counter.  </li>
            <li>Some models&#x27; design has kept the same for many years.</li>
            <li>big water tank, magnetic handle, no overheating problems, many accessory tips</li>
            <li>Then he actually followed the email up with a phone call to make sure the situation had been rectified to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>If you look to the poorer ratings(as I always do) to gage a product, be aware of the design flaw and take your chances</li>
            <li>done, MatWave - thanks!</li>
            <li>So far so good, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>is high tech and looks super on my&lt;br /&gt;bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>And, by-the-way, I also had occasion to deal with the service department on a small issue and this was actually a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>and I definitely feel like it is doing my teeth and gums good to use it daily.</li>
            <li>wanted and positive</li>
            <li>The feature that I like the most is the capability that we could use it continuously for a long period of time with sharing the tips within the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He was able to advise me of how to remedy the minor problem in an email.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is large.  </li>
            <li>The modulated pulsation&lt;br /&gt;of 800 to 1600 plus a large water tank was</li>
            <li>They shipped a new unit right away.  </li>
            <li>the display is really basic, just shows bars that light up red to tell you how strong you set it.</li>
            <li>I really like the system.  </li>
            <li>They were very helpful and emailed me a picture.  </li>
            <li>I just pick up the whole unit and dump out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like they really do care.</li>
            <li>really care about the client</li>
            <li>The magnetic handle mount is very user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Matwave V-20B works really well.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>even if I flush it with clear water right after use.</li>
            <li>I would and, in fact, do reccomend this lovely little machine to any and everybody.</li>
            <li>The device has no noise at all when it runs empty, once you load water in tank, it starts to shoot out water jet stream and makes that pumping sound , it took me couple of days to learn how to control it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not provide as much pressure as my old Water-Pik</li>
            <li>handling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no real cons, but some things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li>the button is maybe easier to push than a normal On/Off (because it&#x27;s horizontal)?</li>
            <li>You could not ask for a nicer more cooperative person to deal with and the new unit arrived after a few days........</li>
            <li>There are no instructions in the manual on how to put a new one on.  </li>
            <li>As a new user of water flossing I did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>minor thing I wanted to point out though, the tip holder design on the back of tank cover is nice, but at the first, I found some tips did not fit snugly,</li>
            <li>The gentleman told me to send a $15.00 dollar shipping fee and they would send a new unit and I could keep the old one.</li>
            <li>Built quality is solid with apparently very detailed designs around the whole unit - my opinion as an amateur designer.</li>
            <li>The pressure is strong, tried once on high setting and that caused me gum bleed, thus, tune it down to mid range and kept that setting since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had a Waterpic and the other main brand that I can&#x27;t remember the name of right now and</li>
            <li>and I just pick the whole thing up and dump any extra water in the sink, then I run it for 2 seconds to purge the line of any water.  </li>
            <li>means the product should last longer or much longer than two years.  </li>
            <li>Had been using another flosser for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of years that did the job but was loud, boxy and&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has been performing as described</li>
            <li>The real flosser is smaller then it appeared on the picture, just fit my small counter space.</li>
            <li>I have thought my tooth brushing and flossing work were enough, and was surprised to see how much food particles got flushed out while using the device even after my regular brush and floss.</li>
            <li>I am not removing the water reservoir, but use a cup to empty remaining water and then use cup to fill remainder with hot water.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the water pressure is quite as strong as the watepik, however, I have only used it once.</li>
            <li>I have only used one so far.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik only worked 10 weeks then completely died.</li>
            <li>The water travels an apparently shorter path.  </li>
            <li>The magnetic holder on the base for the wand is a really helpful and convenient feature as is the 10 varying levels of water stream adjustment, from mild to strong.</li>
            <li>The net result is that I am finding the extra cleaning action that I was seeking.</li>
            <li>Not as much power as I expected, will be purchasing a different unit soon.</li>
            <li>not very loud, but not dead silent.</li>
            <li>It is a little loud but have set it on a towel and it isn&#x27;t quite as loud.  </li>
            <li>Works great and awl less expensive than the others on the market!</li>

            <li> Love the magnetic seating of the power handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better waterpik.  </li>
            <li> It seems simpler in design and more robust.  </li>
            <li> #34;just been to the dentist&amp;#34; kind of clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very impressed with its magnetic handle mount, which is easy to get on and put back.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this flosser after reading all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants really good clean results!</li>
            <li> for me this is perfect, as I can also use it in Europe on 220V, a detail that other brands stubbornly refuse to help us out with, just because they can choose not to.</li>
            <li> and it actually feels GOOD!</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> and you cannot change it yourself easily, as it&#x27;s a custom connector...</li>
            <li> The highest pressure will cut diamonds, so it has industrial purposes beyond just keeping your teeth clean &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> A beautiful and solid unit!</li>
            <li> I love this (I use a full tank alone)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an oral irrigator!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon shipment was fast, product looked nice.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the flossers fit in the top of the reservoir and the top keeps the reservoir covered when not in use so</li>
            <li> The CSR I dealt with, Jason, was so kind and helpful and VERY expedient in helping me resolve my problem.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product, I had a problem it was sorted immediately , new unit without charge at no cost to me or shipping.the people of Matwave</li>
            <li> He is right, there are many models on Amazon, but I do not just want to get one on top of the list, no two leafs are identical, right?</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that the company gives the purchaser a two year warranty with free new replacement.  </li>
            <li> it stays clean.  </li>
            <li> We have used several brands and this is by FAR the best ever!</li>
            <li> It certainly tickles the gums but I am sure I will get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this water flosser because of the large water capacity.</li>
            <li> Directions are clear and it is a nice looking unit.  </li>
            <li> I will return it and go with the tried and true Waterpik.</li>
            <li> nothing to complain, works perfect after  months at least.</li>
            <li> It holds more water and the controls are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> However, unless the water tub is completely full it leaks around the o ring.</li>
            <li> two year warranty makes this device a worthy purchase versus portable hand held units (two were purchased)</li>
            <li> For the cost, it does an adequate job.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add that I love the magnetic handle holder feature and that the extra tips are neatly stored in the lid, unlike most others.</li>
            <li> Delivery was real fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful pulsating water jet stream gives my teeth and gums that &amp;</li>
            <li> I put a weight on top to force the tub to seat into the o ring completely.</li>
            <li> A larger reservior would be nice, but they all seem to come with this size.</li>
            <li> Better then most other products...</li>
            <li> Water Flosser met my expectations and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> I wish the tipe was bent at right angle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Much handier than my old WaterPik. Power more than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> Very large tank.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it might not be powerful enough, but the pulsing at high is actually more than I use!</li>
            <li> Lowest pressure will gently caress even the most sensitive gums without discomfort (I was HYPER-sensitive at first.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more at the next checkup!  </li>
            <li> I could not get it to seal on a consistent basis and it leaked all over my counter.  </li>
            <li> Some models&#x27; design has kept the same for many years.</li>
            <li> big water tank, magnetic handle, no overheating problems, many accessory tips</li>
            <li> Then he actually followed the email up with a phone call to make sure the situation had been rectified to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> If you look to the poorer ratings(as I always do) to gage a product, be aware of the design flaw and take your chances</li>
            <li> done, MatWave - thanks!</li>
            <li> So far so good, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> is high tech and looks super on my&lt;br /&gt;bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> And, by-the-way, I also had occasion to deal with the service department on a small issue and this was actually a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> and I definitely feel like it is doing my teeth and gums good to use it daily.</li>
            <li> wanted and positive</li>
            <li> The feature that I like the most is the capability that we could use it continuously for a long period of time with sharing the tips within the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was able to advise me of how to remedy the minor problem in an email.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is large.  </li>
            <li> The modulated pulsation&lt;br /&gt;of 800 to 1600 plus a large water tank was</li>
            <li> They shipped a new unit right away.  </li>
            <li> the display is really basic, just shows bars that light up red to tell you how strong you set it.</li>
            <li> I really like the system.  </li>
            <li> They were very helpful and emailed me a picture.  </li>
            <li> I just pick up the whole unit and dump out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like they really do care.</li>
            <li> really care about the client</li>
            <li> The magnetic handle mount is very user-friendly.</li>
            <li> Matwave V-20B works really well.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> even if I flush it with clear water right after use.</li>
            <li> I would and, in fact, do reccomend this lovely little machine to any and everybody.</li>
            <li> The device has no noise at all when it runs empty, once you load water in tank, it starts to shoot out water jet stream and makes that pumping sound , it took me couple of days to learn how to control it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not provide as much pressure as my old Water-Pik</li>
            <li> handling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no real cons, but some things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> the button is maybe easier to push than a normal On/Off (because it&#x27;s horizontal)?</li>
            <li> You could not ask for a nicer more cooperative person to deal with and the new unit arrived after a few days........</li>
            <li> There are no instructions in the manual on how to put a new one on.  </li>
            <li> As a new user of water flossing I did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li> minor thing I wanted to point out though, the tip holder design on the back of tank cover is nice, but at the first, I found some tips did not fit snugly,</li>
            <li> The gentleman told me to send a $15.00 dollar shipping fee and they would send a new unit and I could keep the old one.</li>
            <li> Built quality is solid with apparently very detailed designs around the whole unit - my opinion as an amateur designer.</li>
            <li> The pressure is strong, tried once on high setting and that caused me gum bleed, thus, tune it down to mid range and kept that setting since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a Waterpic and the other main brand that I can&#x27;t remember the name of right now and</li>
            <li> and I just pick the whole thing up and dump any extra water in the sink, then I run it for 2 seconds to purge the line of any water.  </li>
            <li> means the product should last longer or much longer than two years.  </li>
            <li> Had been using another flosser for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of years that did the job but was loud, boxy and&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has been performing as described</li>
            <li> The real flosser is smaller then it appeared on the picture, just fit my small counter space.</li>
            <li> I have thought my tooth brushing and flossing work were enough, and was surprised to see how much food particles got flushed out while using the device even after my regular brush and floss.</li>
            <li> I am not removing the water reservoir, but use a cup to empty remaining water and then use cup to fill remainder with hot water.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the water pressure is quite as strong as the watepik, however, I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> I have only used one so far.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik only worked 10 weeks then completely died.</li>
            <li> The water travels an apparently shorter path.  </li>
            <li> The magnetic holder on the base for the wand is a really helpful and convenient feature as is the 10 varying levels of water stream adjustment, from mild to strong.</li>
            <li> The net result is that I am finding the extra cleaning action that I was seeking.</li>
            <li> Not as much power as I expected, will be purchasing a different unit soon.</li>
            <li> not very loud, but not dead silent.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud but have set it on a towel and it isn&#x27;t quite as loud.  </li>
            <li> Works great and awl less expensive than the others on the market!</li>
            <li> Not sure why the water line must be built in, since that certainly has to be a lifetime issue.</li>
            <li> The waterpik replacement price is ~$19 for the hose assembly, so we will see how long the Matwave last.</li>
            <li> After a few frequent trips to dentist office, my dentist suggested me to use water flosser on daily basis, he has a waterpik model in his clinic but also said there are plenty on the market that I can check out.</li>
            <li> It turned out that the power cord had somehow become loose in the bottom as we moved it daily, oops!</li>
            <li> I have some caps/crowns and it&#x27;s rather difficult to get them clean with brushing and traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at all the food particles I was missing just brushing and flossing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and this was one of the very few options on a normal price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The switches are behind a smooth panel, so less risk of water getting inside that way.  </li>
            <li> Also like the water tank capacity, that is bigger than any other models&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It is loud, but I am not sure how any company can get around the noise without jumping through a lot of hoops and charging a ton of money for the unit.</li>
            <li> The water container is very easy to lift off and refill and place back on the base.</li>
            <li> The magnetic clip is less likely to break than the plastic holder on the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> The voltage transformer is in a wall-wart (which does take up more space on the A/C outlet), rather than in the base of the unit, which lets the main unit have a smaller base, and avoids having high voltage near the water.  </li>
            <li> The product was carefully boxed and packaged.</li>
            <li> Really no reason to consider it a pro or</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth water flosser in the past five years or so.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the waterpik due to the wand/hose assembly always needing replacement.</li>
            <li> can do all voltages nowadays, just not these guys, so they can sell them overpriced in other parts of the world.</li>
            <li> later I notice these tip slots have designations, each slot is marked, but if you did not notice, you tend to place the tips randomly which may cause mismatch.</li>
            <li> Among them, Matwave V20 looked different, at least, the touch-control design is in line with up to date electronics operation method.  </li>
            <li> The o-ring can&#x27;t wear out if you don&#x27;t wear it down taking the tank on and off.  </li>
            <li> It seems the &amp;#34;leader&amp;#34; -  Water Pic - has gone down in quality based upon the reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After less than 3 weeks use the o-ring on the valve broke.  </li>
            <li> I use this on a lower setting then the water pics I previously owned.</li>
            <li> I run about a half of a tank of water with two DROPS of bleach through the machine (and</li>
            <li> Having read previous reviews,  I wanted to give Cleanpro V-20</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;-plenty of power (I use it at around half power</li>
            <li> It broke after less than six months.</li>
            <li> The first three units were all from Waterpic but all broke in about one year due to the same water leakage issue between tubing and base.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I&#x27;ve got the pressure up to half</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over one week.  </li>
            <li> I even take this little jewel with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I had gotten tired of using cordless models that used batteries up quickly or rechargeable ones that failed to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> The problem with the reservoir not mating well with the base is true.</li>
            <li> but I usually use it with plain water.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that when it is plugged in, I hear a faint whine coming from the plug.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product from the chair at the dental office Friday afternoon, it was on my doorstep around noon on Sunday, and in the midst of heavy snowfall!</li>
            <li> The advance in technology in the past does not seem to affect these guys at all.</li>
            <li> I look forward to an extended longevity, at least two years, with this unit.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s just a power adapter, its a $2 piece and almost every damn product</li>
            <li> This is not an improvement on the Water Pic as the water pressure is also weak.</li>
            <li> In the box there is an extra spare rubber cap that seals between water reservoir and base.</li>
            <li> I NEVER take the tank off the base, I have an empty water bottle that I fill and transfer to the tank</li>
            <li> Before going out tonight, tame down that nasty breath with the V-20B.</li>
            <li> although performing well, both failed within a years time.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of buying this, but I needed something that can also do 220V</li>
            <li> So, take a break from Command and Conquer, and go order up one of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that water at room temperature during the winter (~63 degrees) is a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> I no longer remove the reservoir from the base.</li>
            <li> :  can&#x27;t just \\&quot;leave\\&quot; the tank setting on the base, need to push it a bit firmer so it couples with the base</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the resevoir off the base.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Every shortcoming with a Waterpik is resolved by this. BUT, I sent mine back because the spray didn&#x27;t pinpoint as well. Most people will love it more than the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over one week.  I really like the system.  It works well and is easy to use.  The reservoir is large.  It comes with a variety of attachments.  I have only used one so far.  Directions are clear and it is a nice looking unit.  My only concern is that when it is plugged in, I hear a faint whine coming from the plug.  It sounds like there is constant energy use even when it is sitting idle.  Therefore, I unplug it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less than 3 weeks use the o-ring on the valve broke.  There was an extra o-ring included with the unit so I will replace it.  Hope this one lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I had to call customer service to get info about replacing the o-ring.  There are no instructions in the manual on how to put a new one on.  They were very helpful and emailed me a picture.  They also sent me another o-ring, per my request, in case the next one goes.  I no longer remove the reservoir from the base. I hope this will keep the machine serviceable for longer.  I just pick up the whole unit and dump out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the excellent customer service and because I continue to like this appliance I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowering my rating to 2 stars now. The unit stopped working altogether.  I think the problem is the transformer.  I noted the whine noise it was making, so I think it just eventually blew itself out.  Can&#x27;t say for sure.  I did like the machine.  I was asked by customer service why I was returning it.  It seems like they really do care.</li>
            <li> two year warranty makes this device a worthy purchase versus portable hand held units (two were purchased) although performing well, both failed within a years time. I look forward to an extended longevity, at least two years, with this unit.</li>
            <li> Water Flosser met my expectations and the price was right.  I&#x27;ll know more at the next checkup!  One thing to note is that water at room temperature during the winter (~63 degrees) is a bit painful.  Hence - fill with warm water before use.</li>
            <li> I use this on a lower setting then the water pics I previously owned. This Water Flosser works and cleans great! I recommend this to anyone who wants really good clean results!</li>
            <li> Liked the design:  controls, tank, cord and magnet.  Motor is louder, weaker than Waterpik but will do the job.  The power adapter makes noises when left plugged-in after some time.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product, I had a problem it was sorted immediately , new unit without charge at no cost to me or shipping.the people of Matwave really care about the client.. .totally recommended. .THANK YOU MATWAVE</li>
            <li> The best, tried many.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this flosser after reading all the good reviews.  I needed to replace my waterpik and decided to try the Matwave.  It seemed in my case to be a product of good intentions and inferior execution.  I really liked the look and design of the product.  However,  I always had difficulty storing the handle using the magnet each time, and I could NEVER get the tip to stop coming out of the handle (after trying every solution I could come up with) each time I used the flosser.  The experience turned out to be a daily exercise in frustration.</li>
            <li> Nice. Stronger pulse than your standard waterpik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the money I payed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  After 14 months of excellent use the control button on the handle started sticking which cut off the water flow. It would start working again after  sitting a while. I contacted Matwave to find out what could be done about the problem. The gentleman told me to send a $15.00 dollar shipping fee and they would send a new unit and I could keep the old one. With service like this I can fully understand the excellent rating given for this seller. You could not ask for a nicer more cooperative person to deal with and the new unit arrived after a few days........6 STARS</li>
            <li> As a new user of water flossing I did not know what to expect. This model seemed to be a good value from reading reviews and I am not disappointed. Not sure why the water line must be built in, since that certainly has to be a lifetime issue. I am not removing the water reservoir, but use a cup to empty remaining water and then use cup to fill remainder with hot water. The net result is that I am finding the extra cleaning action that I was seeking. While I am still a rookie user, I have found great success with this unit.</li>
            <li> Hey, Man Cavers! Before going out tonight, tame down that nasty breath with the V-20B. Because us guys would rather spend are money on video games then trips to the dentist. So, take a break from Command and Conquer, and go order up one of these bad boys. She&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> Every night for 5 months and it&#x27;s still working.  I NEVER take the tank off the base, I have an empty water bottle that I fill and transfer to the tank and I just pick the whole thing up and dump any extra water in the sink, then I run it for 2 seconds to purge the line of any water.  The o-ring can&#x27;t wear out if you don&#x27;t wear it down taking the tank on and off.  I&#x27;ve used it with mouthwash and had good results but I usually use it with plain water. I found the mouthwash tends to leave &amp;#34;crap&amp;#34; (highly technical term) in the system even if I flush it with clear water right after use. I run about a half of a tank of water with two DROPS of bleach through the machine (and no, not into my mouth) every couple of months just to kill any bacterial buildup. I started at the lowest setting and now use it at  3/4 of max power.  I floss, brush then use this and I&#x27;ve almost always flushed additional debris out of my mouth.  Without me saying anything, my dentist has noticed too.  So far so good, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from the chair at the dental office Friday afternoon, it was on my doorstep around noon on Sunday, and in the midst of heavy snowfall! I&#x27;m impressed. My dentist is happy and so am I. I have a lot of dental work and it&#x27;s created some food traps. My dentist suggested the water pick idea to me and I researched the best brands. I bought this model based on the 2 year warranty. It certainly tickles the gums but I am sure I will get used to it. Cheers to optimal oral health!</li>
            <li> I liked the design and functionality of the device.  However, I found it repeatedly leaked from the bottom of the reservoir at the gasket.  I tried the replacement gasket and had the same issue.  I could not get it to seal on a consistent basis and it leaked all over my counter.  I will return it and go with the tried and true Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Matwave V-20 water Flosser  for my wife. Delivery was real fast. The product was carefully boxed and packaged. This is the fourth water flosser in the past five years or so. The first three units were all from Waterpic but all broke in about one year due to the same water leakage issue between tubing and base. Since Matwave has a 2-year replacement warranty, we decide to give a try. The unit worked very well based on my wifeâ€™s comments as a very experienced water flosser user. Built quality is solid with apparently very detailed designs around the whole unit - my opinion as an amateur designer. The magnetic handle mount is very user-friendly. You don&#x27;t need to hold the unit in one hand and pull ahe handle out with another hand. In the box there is an extra spare rubber cap that seals between water reservoir and base. I emailed Matwave once to ask a question and their customer service is superior. I believe Matwave can provide a 2-year warranty means the product should last longer or much longer than two years.  Price is very reasonable. A beautiful and solid unit!</li>
            <li> Not as much power as I expected, will be purchasing a different unit soon.</li>
            <li> I prefer this flosser to the Waterpik product. It is not as noisy and holds more water.</li>
            <li> Matwave V-20B works really well. Easy to use once you get the hang of it. A water flosses was recommended by my dentist and I definitely feel like it is doing my teeth and gums good to use it daily.</li>
            <li> After a few frequent trips to dentist office, my dentist suggested me to use water flosser on daily basis, he has a waterpik model in his clinic but also said there are plenty on the market that I can check out. He is right, there are many models on Amazon, but I do not just want to get one on top of the list, no two leafs are identical, right? However, once you look into them closely, most flossers are alike, tanks, handles, I guess these are must-haves. Some models&#x27; design has kept the same for many years. The advance in technology in the past does not seem to affect these guys at all. Among them, Matwave V20 looked different, at least, the touch-control design is in line with up to date electronics operation method.  9-tips and accessory should be a good configuration for family use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shipment was fast, product looked nice. The real flosser is smaller then it appeared on the picture, just fit my small counter space. The device has no noise at all when it runs empty, once you load water in tank, it starts to shoot out water jet stream and makes that pumping sound , it took me couple of days to learn how to control it. The pressure is strong, tried once on high setting and that caused me gum bleed, thus, tune it down to mid range and kept that setting since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: big water tank, magnetic handle, no overheating problems, many accessory tips&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  can&#x27;t just \\&quot;leave\\&quot; the tank setting on the base, need to push it a bit firmer so it couples with the base well thus you get the best pressure output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using the device to see how my gum condition will be improved...</li>
            <li> Had been using another flosser for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of years that did the job but was loud, boxy and&lt;br /&gt;small parts broke over a period of time. Reviewing&lt;br /&gt;other flossers came across the &#x27;Matwave&#x27; and was&lt;br /&gt;impressed by the design especially the magnet&lt;br /&gt;cord replacement back to the unit and various&lt;br /&gt;tools that are nicely tucked away under the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The design is high tech and looks super on my&lt;br /&gt;bathroom counter.  The modulated pulsation&lt;br /&gt;of 800 to 1600 plus a large water tank was what&lt;br /&gt;I wanted and positive reviews of this product&lt;br /&gt;made me a believer.  The 2 year warranty and&lt;br /&gt;their customer service was impressive.  I am&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with this product and would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to anyone as it is truly a great&lt;br /&gt;product in every way!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended me to purchase and use water flosser, I finally bought this Matwave. I have thought my tooth brushing and flossing work were enough, and was surprised to see how much food particles got flushed out while using the device even after my regular brush and floss. My gum stopped bleeding after  a week or so. The assortment of tips are good for our couples&#x27; use, very easy operation with touch-pad and magnetic handle. Well engineered design. Great product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works great! I wish the tipe was bent at right angle.</li>
            <li> For the cost, it does an adequate job.</li>
            <li> I like the extra cleaning power and customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  nice unit -- compact, quite with nice controls.&lt;br /&gt;It does not provide as much pressure as my old Water-Pik</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once, so I may have to update this review. Size wise it requires about the same counter space as my Waterpik WP-100. I am not sure if the water pressure is quite as strong as the watepik, however, I have only used it once. I gave up on the waterpik due to the wand/hose assembly always needing replacement. The waterpik replacement price is ~$19 for the hose assembly, so we will see how long the Matwave last. It does appear to be well made and comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> It broke within one month!</li>
            <li> The pressure at the highest setting was not enough force to replace the water pik pressure that I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it because it is 110/220v compatible. Otherwise it works just as good as a water pik</li>
            <li> Having read previous reviews,  I wanted to give Cleanpro V-20 a try,  Now I have been on it for 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with its magnetic handle mount, which is easy to get on and put back.  Also like the water tank capacity, that is bigger than any other models&#x27;.  The feature that I like the most is the capability that we could use it continuously for a long period of time with sharing the tips within the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor thing I wanted to point out though, the tip holder design on the back of tank cover is nice, but at the first, I found some tips did not fit snugly, later I notice these tip slots have designations, each slot is marked, but if you did not notice, you tend to place the tips randomly which may cause mismatch.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of buying this, but I needed something that can also do 220V and this was one of the very few options on a normal price.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase, about 2 months into using it. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;-plenty of power (I use it at around half power, max is too much)&lt;br /&gt;-comes with enough tips&lt;br /&gt;-nice design&lt;br /&gt;-big reservoir, even for me who takes a lot of time (and water). I love this (I use a full tank alone)&lt;br /&gt;-nice handling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no real cons, but some things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s a bit loud. not very loud, but not dead silent. I guess all of them are.&lt;br /&gt;-the touch/disaply thing works perfect, but it&#x27;s really nothing special. the button is maybe easier to push than a normal On/Off (because it&#x27;s horizontal)? I don&#x27;t mind it, I wouldn&#x27;t mind anything else. the display is really basic, just shows bars that light up red to tell you how strong you set it. could just as well be a mechanical dial for me, but it also works perfectly the way it is. Really no reason to consider it a pro or con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first time I used it, it leaked a bit. after using it 2-3 times, the tank started seating itself the way it should and there&#x27;s no leaking anymore and all is well. nothing to complain, works perfect after  months at least. Come with a spare sealing ring, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me this is perfect, as I can also use it in Europe on 220V, a detail that other brands stubbornly refuse to help us out with, just because they can choose not to. I mean, it&#x27;s just a power adapter, its a $2 piece and almost every damn product can do all voltages nowadays, just not these guys, so they can sell them overpriced in other parts of the world. and you cannot change it yourself easily, as it&#x27;s a custom connector... yeah, so we buy matwave then, works just as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oral irrigator after reading the reviews on Amazon.  The reviews were good, so I decided to buy it.  I had gotten tired of using cordless models that used batteries up quickly or rechargeable ones that failed to hold a charge.  I am so glad I bought this model.  It is very easy to use, has a nice size reservoir, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space and has a great design.  I really like the fact that the flossers fit in the top of the reservoir and the top keeps the reservoir covered when not in use so it stays clean.  I also liked the fact that the company gives the purchaser a two year warranty with free new replacement.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an oral irrigator!!</li>
            <li> This is not an improvement on the Water Pic as the water pressure is also weak. It broke after less than six months.</li>
            <li> This water flosser makes traditional flossing obsolete! I have some caps/crowns and it&#x27;s rather difficult to get them clean with brushing and traditional flossing. But, no worries with the Mat wave Cleanpro Water Flosser! It&#x27;s powerful pulsating water jet stream gives my teeth and gums that &amp;#34;just been to the dentist&amp;#34; kind of clean. I even take this little jewel with me when I travel. The magnetic holder on the base for the wand is a really helpful and convenient feature as is the 10 varying levels of water stream adjustment, from mild to strong. All you have to do is choose the level that works best for you. And, by-the-way, I also had occasion to deal with the service department on a small issue and this was actually a pleasant experience. That&#x27;s right, you heard me.....a PLEASANT experience. The CSR I dealt with, Jason, was so kind and helpful and VERY expedient in helping me resolve my problem. He was able to advise me of how to remedy the minor problem in an email. Then he actually followed the email up with a phone call to make sure the situation had been rectified to my satisfaction. I would and, in fact, do reccomend this lovely little machine to any and everybody. WELL pleased with my Cleanpro Water Flosser AND the Mat wave Technologies company!!!</li>
            <li> Better then most other products...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a WaterPik. I&#x27;m glad I bought this water flosser because of the large water capacity. I used to run out of water with the WaterPik before I was finished. This unit gives you plenty of time with plenty of water. I also like the magnetic holder for the wand.</li>
            <li> Works great and awl less expensive than the others on the market!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for every one of these types of units on Amazon. It seems the &amp;#34;leader&amp;#34; -  Water Pic - has gone down in quality based upon the reviews. So I searched a lot to find this one as it is a no name brand. But I tried it and it works great. No issues. It is loud, but I am not sure how any company can get around the noise without jumping through a lot of hoops and charging a ton of money for the unit. - like one unit was some 200 bucks. So for that price, I will deal the noise for 5 minutes while I use the unit.</li>
            <li> Wish I brought one sooner!  I was surprised at all the food particles I was missing just brushing and flossing my teeth.  My dentist recommended I purchase one, such a great investment!</li>
            <li> Best water flosser that I have used.  I have had a Waterpic and the other main brand that I can&#x27;t remember the name of right now and this one by Matwave is over all the best of the three.  It holds more water and the controls are much easier to use.  The magnetic wand holder is also very handy.  I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have never used or owned a water pic and I am kicking myself.  This is great!  Leaves floss in the dust.  It is a little loud but have set it on a towel and it isn&#x27;t quite as loud.  I can&#x27;t seem to get the resevoir off the base.  I&#x27;ll read the directions later, maybe.  If you have never had a water pic, get one.</li>
            <li> There is better .keep searching...the lid falls in water ....would not buy againand I own many..</li>
            <li> The problem with the reservoir not mating well with the base is true. I received the flosser on Oct. 8th; by the 10th the reservoir O-ring had begun to deteriorate. It does come lubricated, but it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to prohibit abrasion of the ring. If you look to the poorer ratings(as I always do) to gage a product, be aware of the design flaw and take your chances</li>
            <li> Great touch pad and magnetic holder for the pic.</li>
            <li> Love the magnetic seating of the power handle. Much handier than my old WaterPik. Power more than adequate for my needs. Very large tank. Nice appearance on countertop.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ABSOLUTELY AWESOME water flosser. We have used several brands and this is by FAR the best ever! Nothing else comes close. I was concerned it might not be powerful enough, but the pulsing at high is actually more than I use! After a week or so, the unit stopped working and I was worried it was defective. It turned out that the power cord had somehow become loose in the bottom as we moved it daily, oops! Pushed the plug in and we were in business again!  My wife LOVES this unit and so do I. Again, AWESOME!  I wanted to add that I love the magnetic handle holder feature and that the extra tips are neatly stored in the lid, unlike most others. The water container is very easy to lift off and refill and place back on the base. There are extra o-rings for the future. We have been using this flosser daily now for 3 months. Buy one! You will love it!</li>
            <li> Matwave Flosser does a good job. However, unless the water tub is completely full it leaks around the o ring. I put a weight on top to force the tub to seat into the o ring completely. I hope this unit last longer than my Waterpik model. The Waterpik only worked 10 weeks then completely died.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Better than expected. Lowest pressure will gently caress even the most sensitive gums without discomfort (I was HYPER-sensitive at first. Medium bristle brushes hurt me). After a few weeks I&#x27;ve got the pressure up to half and it actually feels GOOD! It does massage your gums and make them healthier - my dentist is VERY happy.  The highest pressure will cut diamonds, so it has industrial purposes beyond just keeping your teeth clean &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works well. A larger reservior would be nice, but they all seem to come with this size.</li>
            <li> Good unit. Great customer service!  The wife and I use the Matwave Flosser twice a day and we were very happy with it but it stopped working after four months.  Contacted customer service and they were great.  They shipped a new unit right away.  It has been a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better waterpik.  It seems simpler in design and more robust.  The water travels an apparently shorter path.  The switches are behind a smooth panel, so less risk of water getting inside that way.  The voltage transformer is in a wall-wart (which does take up more space on the A/C outlet), rather than in the base of the unit, which lets the main unit have a smaller base, and avoids having high voltage near the water.  The magnetic clip is less likely to break than the plastic holder on the waterpik.  The spare tip holder under the cover is simpler, with fewer moving parts, and works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, MatWave - thanks!</li>
            <li> So far it has been performing as described</li>
