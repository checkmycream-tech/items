            <li>This image plate is packed with wonderful nail art.  </li>
            <li>Sinful colors is the best for this.</li>

            <li>By Cheeky wish there are Awesome and  </li>
            <li>great quality for the price, but you can&#x27;t use some full-nail images unless you have baby fingers.&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>This is great for the price</li>
            <li>Great tool to have for your very own home nail salon.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get a good stamp.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, and will not be running out of ideas anytime soon.</li>

            <li>I love this plate!</li>
            <li>I love these image plates!</li>
            <li>these do NOT come with their own</li>
            <li>, the images might look nice but don&#x27;t stamp on in the way that they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>It works great and it has so many images to choose from so that you can be creative.</li>
            <li>Its a nice plate.</li>
            <li>but i was so impressed when i got it and had a chance to play with it, the images are very clean and stamp very well.</li>
            <li>Great item to have if you love nail art my main reason for loving it is that it has a lot of images in one</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Most stamps stamp</li>
            <li>: make sure you check which Konad plates these dupe; since I already have plates M57 and M73, there goes 11 images I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you just a beginner it would be ok but for me I like the lg cheeky ones.</li>

            <li>The variety of different nail designs is huge and you can count on getting comments from everyone about how wonderful your nails are!</li>
            <li>every image I&#x27;ve tried on this plate applies just as it looks on the plate.&lt;br /&gt;-crisp images: many of the Konad dupes are perfect; some are a little fuzzier though (e.g. the sheet music)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight material makes it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>another cheap konad knock off</li>
            <li>Over all WELL WELL worth the money :)</li>
            <li>This is so cute and so much fun to work with.</li>
            <li>The plate was shipped wrapped in cheap bubble wrap &amp; in a padded envelope that was torn, and I coudl tell the plate was ruined before I even opened it, because you could feel the plate was bent.</li>
            <li>I own 2 BM,2012 New Collection of Jumbo Nail Art Image Plates.</li>
            <li>Even konad&#x27;s special stamping polish won&#x27;t work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this image plate.  I have not tried each image on this plate yet, but the images I did try worked well.  There is a variety of designs.  Some of the designs are the same designs from the Konad plates.  I like having all the images on one plate, instead of multiple smaller plates.  I hope they will make more of these mega image plates with new designs!&lt;br /&gt;I have ideas for future manicures I can&#x27;t wait to try!  Happy stamping!  :)</li>
            <li> Most stamps stamp well. One of the images on my plate (upper left corner next to \\&quot;basket ball\\&quot; stamp and \\&quot;BAR BAR BAR\\&quot; stamp)looks like it was half way done, and doesn&#x27;t look like a full image. I bought my plate for $21.99 and now the price is up $30.99. It seems to me the people selling Cheeky plates just keep raising their prices every time they have buyers. Alright quality, not spectacular. I personally would not pay more than $21.00 for any of the Cheeky plates, but it&#x27;s your call if you can&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Great tool to have for your very own home nail salon.  Easy to use and instructions are simple. Lightweight material makes it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> so when i bought this i was very worried it would just be another cheap konad knock off but i was so impressed when i got it and had a chance to play with it, the images are very clean and stamp very well. when you recive your plate there will be a few serface scrapes this is clearly not from the seller it apears to me to just be from the machine that cuts the plates it in no way affects your images. i do recommend that you buy a konad stamper and konad polish for best results. Over all WELL WELL worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Great item to have if you love nail art my main reason for loving it is that it has a lot of images in one and you don&#x27;t have to purchase 5 or 6 different plates it&#x27;s all in one. Like the others said the smaller images are to small but overall worth the money and is in big use at my house.</li>
            <li> The quality of this plate is closer to that of Konad than other brands like Bundle Monster (of which 1/3 of my plates were defective). When using the Konad stamper (**these do NOT come with their own**) the images apply neatly and crisply. The only complaint I have is that some of the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; images are scaled down so small that they wouldn&#x27;t even fit a child&#x27;s finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-smooth application: with other Konad-alternative companies, the images might look nice but don&#x27;t stamp on in the way that they&#x27;re supposed to. every image I&#x27;ve tried on this plate applies just as it looks on the plate.&lt;br /&gt;-crisp images: many of the Konad dupes are perfect; some are a little fuzzier though (e.g. the sheet music)&lt;br /&gt;-plastic backing: I was worried I would accidentally dent the metal since it is a large flat sheet, but it comes glued to a hard plastic backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-alignment: the way the images are laid out looks a little amateur--some aren&#x27;t aligned correctly, some are a little slanted, etc etc. this doesn&#x27;t affect image quality or anything of that sort though, merely an observation&lt;br /&gt;-inconsistent sizing: the 3rd row on the right includes &#x27;full-nail images&#x27;, **BUT** they are much smaller than their Konad dupes. Some are SOO small, they&#x27;re barely half the size of other full-nail images featured on the same plate. What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: great quality for the price, but you can&#x27;t use some full-nail images unless you have baby fingers.&lt;br /&gt;note: make sure you check which Konad plates these dupe; since I already have plates M57 and M73, there goes 11 images I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price but i do notice that the images are not as deep set as Konad or MASH plates. Making polish dry faster and small details not as noticible when stamped on nails. You have to work even faster.</li>
            <li> This image plate is packed with wonderful nail art.  And it is such a huge bargain.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and will not be running out of ideas anytime soon. If you are into nail stamping, you need this plate.</li>
            <li> I love this plate! It works great and it has so many images to choose from so that you can be creative. It was fast shipping, thank you guys so much i will deff be buying from you guys again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I had to mark this way down because the only thing that will pick up the images are dark black ink. Sinful colors is the best for this. Even konad&#x27;s special stamping polish won&#x27;t work. Its a nice plate. Just could have been cut deeper.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this thing was a real piece of junk and that I got ripped off. It seemed like the etchings were not deep enough to hold the polish. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that the nail art has a blue film that needs to be peeled off before using! Well once I did that it worked great! Has lots of great designs! It did take about three weeks to arrive however.</li>
            <li> Does not work,don&#x27;t waist your money!</li>
            <li> The image plate I received had a lot of scratches! the scratches were so deep that it made many of the stamps not usable! The image plate was also already peeling of the piece of plastic it was glued to. DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS A RIP-OFF!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these nail stamp boards before and was very satisfied with them.  I wanted some holiday designs so I found this board and ordered it.  It took over a month to get to me and if I had know it was coming from China I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it in the first place.  I have had poor experiences in the past ordering merchandise from China and did not want to repeat them.  When the article did finaly arrive it was damaged.  Two of the four corners are bent and one makes the four disigns in the corner unuseable.  Yes I could send it back but it took so long to get here I don&#x27;t want the hassle.  Just save your money and find one in the US if you want to order this item.  I wish Amazon would post of the page with the description of the article where it is shipped from.</li>
            <li> This is so cute and so much fun to work with. I love these image plates! The variety of different nail designs is huge and you can count on getting comments from everyone about how wonderful your nails are!</li>
            <li> I have average sized hands and these images are just too small for me to use. The plate arrived chipped. Most of the images are etched too thin and I can&#x27;t get a good stamp. I have saved this plate as an example of what a cheap crummy plates looks like to show friends interested in getting into nail art and stamping.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails. My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li> I was so excite about my first nail stamping plate after having it for a month all I can said is that is super hard to clean the images are  no to sharp as others non Konad.I love the designs but some don&#x27;t print good or either to deep or too shallow.There some design like konad but not very well done I will no recommend it. I own 2 BM,2012 New Collection of Jumbo Nail Art Image Plates. Bundle of 6 Nail Art Jumbo Image Plates (X1) with 331 Nail Art Designs  By Cheeky wish there are Awesome and  One konad for now.I used konad special polish.Maybe if you just a beginner it would be ok but for me I like the lg cheeky ones.</li>
            <li> This plate is huge!!  Has so many options to choose from.  The only thing is it was a little bent when it arrived but has not been a problem.</li>
            <li> I am completely dissatisfied with this product because it is of poor quality! Would like a full refund. Did not return it earlier because of life hardships.</li>
            <li> Daughter really loves all the designs on this.</li>
            <li> I had this on my wish list &amp; received it as a gift, but the plate came so bent I could not use it &amp; had to return it. I cannot exchange it, so I have no plate to even try the images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sept. 20, 2012, I waited a month for a new plate that was bought for me to replace the first one that I got that was bent. I finally got it today, from China &amp; the plate was bent, warped &amp; the plastic it is attached to was broken, leaving a sharp edge exposed. This is the second large plate from Cheeky that I have received that is unusable. The plate was shipped wrapped in cheap bubble wrap &amp; in a padded envelope that was torn, and I coudl tell the plate was ruined before I even opened it, because you could feel the plate was bent. One corner is so bent, it is curled under. I am so disgusted with the shape that these plates are in by time they get to us after waiting a month!!!!!</li>
