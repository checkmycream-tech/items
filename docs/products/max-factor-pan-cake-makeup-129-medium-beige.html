            <li>I received this package within 2 days, the seller was excellent, however the product itself</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how awesome the stuff covers and wears ...</li>
            <li>I used this product when I was a teenager for a photoshoot and was excellent.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and have always been very happy with the product</li>
            <li>Like champagne, Max Factor Pancake makeup is always wonderful and always welcome.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and it covers well.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on-line!  </li>
            <li>but it is good for me</li>
            <li>(It helps that I never smoked and protect my skin from the sun as I am fair.)     </li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD .</li>
            <li>I remember paying about $10 at the most in WalMart for this stuff when I was in college!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and love that I can still get it online!</li>
            <li>Tip: On clean skin which has had a good face cream, like Elizabeth Arden, apply your eye make up.</li>
            <li>No, I mean it, really beautiful WITH her makeup on.     </li>
            <li>I used this makeup for many years before they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>love pancake makeup, but</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and like a more matt look makeup.  </li>
            <li>My favorite BUT the price has more than quadrupled.  </li>
            <li>I am no longer able to purchase this makeup at any retail store.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is good, smooth and light.</li>
            <li>Oil based pancake makeups make me break out and, while I have used many liquid makeups in every price range from el cheapo to Countess Iserlyn, nothing beats this product.</li>
            <li>I love Max Factor Pan-Cake makeup.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a powder than anything, when I add water to it, it doesn&#x27;t thicken, not like the pan cake makeup I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your complextion 75% better.</li>
            <li>Love it, all most gave up on this makeup, so</li>
            <li>My complexion would look great for a 50 year old woman.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no oily face, and stays put.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was too light</li>
            <li>Love this product and I been using this product for the last 20 years and it is always good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Just putting on my makeup with a cool, clean, damp sponge revitalizes me from the inside out.</li>
            <li>This is the only makeup I&#x27;ve found that provides good coverage and doesn&#x27;t turn greasy on my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>When traveling, I never worry that it might become rancid, as some oil based foundation can do in very hot weather.</li>
            <li>This may sound ghoulish but I am now using the last of the MF pancake left from my mother who passed away 5 years ago at the age of 85, still using this product and still beautiful--</li>
            <li>I love this old timey face foundation.</li>
            <li>but, because supplies are low, it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>Turn the sponge over and go over your whole face really fast.</li>
            <li>I AM MUCH,</li>
            <li>I really like this makeup</li>
            <li>but the cost was an absolute rip- off.</li>
            <li>I was expecting full coverage, but instead it was barely any coverage.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy; it&#x27;s sheer, matte and way better than powder.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I will be researching to find a new pancake that isn&#x27;t like the movie makeup!</li>
            <li>MUCH OLDER</li>
            <li>so I gave it a high rating</li>
            <li>it would be worth going to Europe to find it, if necessary.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can buy any other makeup product that I will be comfortable with like I have been for the amount time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>MAX FACTOR PANCAKE MAKEUP IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>IF THEY DISCONTINUE IT COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>Then I started my career and ponied up $50 or so a tube/bottle for the Lancome stuff that doesn&#x27;t cover or wear nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I remembered it for some reason a while ago and went searching for it on the Internet ... found it here and ordered it, taking a  guess on the color I&#x27;d used (ahem) nearly 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>Max factor hasn&#x27;t made this stuff for a few years so the make up was old even though it was still in the original package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a feeling it might come back in a few years, re-labeled and with a whole NEW advertising campaign.</li>
            <li>Wet a small natural sponge, pat the pancake to pick up a little on one side of the sponge and smooth it all over your face, eye lids, into the hair line, pat your ears, smooth it down your neck &amp; up under your ears.</li>
            <li>I use an expensive very fine grained sponge on my Max Factor pancake.</li>

            <li> You need a small sponge.</li>

            <li> I thought I must have been getting at least 2 of the pancake makeup.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>

            <li> MAX FACTOR PANCAKE MAKEUP IS BY FAR THE BEST COVERAGE YOU CAN FIND. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I WILL DO IF THEY DISCONTINUE IT COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok just seems to work same as store bought foundation</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, it seems so dry, even on damp sponge, and it has very light coverage. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Max factor hasn&#x27;t made this stuff for a few years so the make up was old even though it was still in the original package.&lt;br /&gt;I love pancake makeup, but so not worth the price.  I will be researching to find a new pancake that isn&#x27;t like the movie makeup!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a face makeup that would cover small imperfections in my skin.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and like a more matt look makeup.  This one does everything I could ask.  My skin looks great and it covers well.</li>
            <li> My favorite BUT the price has more than quadrupled.  Too expensive.</li>
            <li> My dear friend has worn Max Factor pancake makeup for years..Of course you can&#x27;t find it in the store here in US..So she asked me to find it on the computer (which I did)..She was overjoyed to have it again.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive its all I can use and I so wish the unites states still. Had it but it is good for me</li>
            <li> Other than it is a titch orangy for me ... I love this old timey face foundation. Easy to apply, no oily face, and stays put.</li>
            <li> I could never get anything to come off on the sponge.  I was expecting full coverage, but instead it was barely any coverage.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to purchase this makeup at any retail store.  I have worn this makeup for over 50 years!  I have tried other makeups and I always break out after using them, even at my age!  Thank you for continuing to carry this.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I been using this product for the last 20 years and it is always good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Ihave used this makeup for years and it is the only one that helps my oily skin look neat and matte. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pancake makeup, sad that they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I couldn&#x27;t even get it to look like it was going on my face. Maybe it was too light and I should&#x27;ve purchased the darker shade but it was medium beige.</li>
            <li> I am 72 now and I have used this product since I was 13 and snitching it from my Mother.  My complexion would look great for a 50 year old woman. (It helps that I never smoked and protect my skin from the sun as I am fair.)     I use an expensive very fine grained sponge on my Max Factor pancake. The coverage is good, smooth and light. My makeup never looks oily and it never cakes on my face. This may sound ghoulish but I am now using the last of the MF pancake left from my mother who passed away 5 years ago at the age of 85, still using this product and still beautiful--No, I mean it, really beautiful WITH her makeup on.     Oil based pancake makeups make me break out and, while I have used many liquid makeups in every price range from el cheapo to Countess Iserlyn, nothing beats this product. The cake lasts a long time. Maybe that&#x27;s why they discontinued it. When traveling, I never worry that it might become rancid, as some oil based foundation can do in very hot weather. Just putting on my makeup with a cool, clean, damp sponge revitalizes me from the inside out. it would be worth going to Europe to find it, if necessary. I have a feeling it might come back in a few years, re-labeled and with a whole NEW advertising campaign. Like champagne, Max Factor Pancake makeup is always wonderful and always welcome.</li>
            <li> I love Max Factor Pan-Cake makeup. I have been using this product now for over 10 yrs now. I don&#x27;t think I can buy any other makeup product that I will be comfortable with like I have been for the amount time I&#x27;ve been using it. Love Max Factor and the results it gives me!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this package within 2 days, the seller was excellent, however the product itself I did not care for. This product is more of a powder than anything, when I add water to it, it doesn&#x27;t thicken, not like the pan cake makeup I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li> Max factor must bring PANCAKE back.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your complextion 75% better. For decades, I&#x27;ve used Medium Beige in the winter and Tan#1 in the summer. It is not heavy; it&#x27;s sheer, matte and way better than powder. It may have gotten a &amp;#34;heavy make-up&amp;#34; reputation 20+ years ago because people didn&#x27;t know how to apply it. You need a small sponge. Tip: On clean skin which has had a good face cream, like Elizabeth Arden, apply your eye make up. Wet a small natural sponge, pat the pancake to pick up a little on one side of the sponge and smooth it all over your face, eye lids, into the hair line, pat your ears, smooth it down your neck &amp; up under your ears. Turn the sponge over and go over your whole face really fast. Rinse the sponge. Voila. Pancake came to be known as heavy foundation, possibly prompted by competitors. It should cost around $10. but, because supplies are low, it&#x27;s more BUT one cake lasts a long time. Would everyone please ask Max Factor to manufacture it again....or, can we get someone else to make it.&lt;br /&gt; PS: Don&#x27;t drop the pancake as it&#x27;s hard to use when it crumbles.</li>
            <li> I WAS MUCH YOUNGER WHEN I USED TO BUY MAX FACTOR PAN CAKE ,,,NOW IT  I AM MUCH, MUCH OLDER IT DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD .</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described. Pretty expensive but that&#x27;s the way it goes to get this Max Factor.</li>
            <li> I used this makeup in college and after for several years. Then I started my career and ponied up $50 or so a tube/bottle for the Lancome stuff that doesn&#x27;t cover or wear nearly as well. I remembered it for some reason a while ago and went searching for it on the Internet ... found it here and ordered it, taking a  guess on the color I&#x27;d used (ahem) nearly 20 years ago. I nailed it! I had forgotten how awesome the stuff covers and wears ... it doesn&#x27;t look oily and it doesn&#x27;t require touchups, unlike the more expensive fancy stuff. I hate that it&#x27;s no longer sold in the US. I remember paying about $10 at the most in WalMart for this stuff when I was in college! Now, it&#x27;s around $25! Whatever the market will bear, I guess.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was a teenager for a photoshoot and was excellent. I was looking for it along time ago thinking will resolve my situation with some spots on my face. Well I don&#x27;t know why but it&#x27;s to sandy and doesn&#x27;t spread like before. I have to put a lot of cream on my face to make it work.</li>
            <li> I can not believe the price of this item.  I thought I must have been getting at least 2 of the pancake makeup.  I have ordered this from Drugstore.com before and it was a third of the cost.  I really like this makeup so I gave it a high rating but the cost was an absolute rip- off.</li>
            <li> Love it, all most gave up on this makeup, so glad I found it on Amazon, very expensive, but then we&#x27;re not in 1960&#x27;s anymore</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and love that I can still get it online!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and have always been very happy with the product</li>
