            <li>But it&#x27;s still nice and sparkly.</li>
            <li>; should have given me a clue that it would not be suitable on its own.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite top coat, beautiful , gold flecks are beautiful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to own both</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is too good to be true</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of silver flakes and is soo pretty!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product, I&#x27;m not even sure if I would chance it again and go buy it for retail price.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It came in a cute box.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of this from stores and the quality was a lot better than the one I purchased online.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of this.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1UJ6WVP9K4WPA]]I absolutely LOVE this topcoat.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>I have :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this top coat to see what the hype was all about...</li>
            <li>okay when it is placed over your favorite OPI polish but to me the glittery top coat is not needed.  </li>
            <li>Love the prettiness of this polish.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get noticed for sure.</li>
            <li>Okay, I LOVE this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I applied 2 coats of this on top of the China Glaze Prey</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>i love it alone too.  </li>
            <li>If you want more shine than what this has to offer, Ciate makes a shredded foil that I have seen selling at Nordstroms...</li>
            <li>I have tried it on one nail and it was ok.</li>
            <li>Get it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of a medium pink polish to see how well it would show up, and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Very cool product.</li>
            <li>that being said, the shipping was fast and the box and bottle arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>Super Pretty  Def a nice polish topper to own</li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They are still GORGEOUS when placed over a nice black polish and have an amazing shine finished off with Seche Vite topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it looks best over dark colors</li>
            <li>When I saw several reviews of this polish and beautiful swatches with it, I knew I should have it.</li>
            <li>but they seem fine to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty, especially on top of a red for the holidays.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty top coat.</li>
            <li>but the flakes are a nice size and it is a unique, pretty polish.</li>
            <li>I wear it as an accent, it looks fabulous over darker shades.</li>
            <li>have gotten many complements on the polish and am really looking forward to using it even more as the holidays approach.</li>
            <li>While the seller was great and shipped this item extremely promptly, I do not care for this top coat.</li>
            <li>I got this for just under $12 here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>A must have pair for &amp;#34;the man with the golden gun&amp;#34; by OPI!</li>
            <li>A really fun nail polish!</li>
            <li>but, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a top coat and there isn&#x27;t much that comes out</li>
            <li>but it does not look good over a silver-toned color which I tried shortly afterwards.  </li>
            <li>then a high gloss top coat to finish it all off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very pretty polish</li>
            <li>I have the yellow gold as well and a combination of both is also stunning!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>Looks absolutely gorgeous, dried quickly, and makes me feel like I&#x27;m literally dripping in gold!</li>
            <li>It requires you to paint your nails one color and then use this polish over the top of that because on nude nails it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and doesn&#x27;t really show up.</li>
            <li>The OPI colors are so beautiful all you need is an ordinary clear top coat.</li>
            <li>&amp; they&#x27;re worth the price here</li>
            <li>While pricy, I would say this polish is worth it.</li>
            <li>Really pretty great over dark colors.</li>
            <li>and I do also have &#x27;The Man with the Golden Gun&#x27; to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to be a bit more like last year&#x27;s man with the golden gun.</li>
            <li>it is soooooo beatuful, love it so much, and works with nearly all the nail colors, I will buuy it again.~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li>This top coat glides on with just the right amount of flakes with out having to put multiple coats.  </li>
            <li>It is also not &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; gold, which would imply a silver color - it is very much gold.</li>
            <li>I got quit a bit of larger flakes though others say there aren&#x27;t many?</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just because it was the first use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty picky over what nail polish I wear.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten many bigger flakes.</li>
            <li>if I had the extra cash laying around (since depending where you get it, it can be pretty pricey) since I would LOVE a backup of it.</li>
            <li>It is a gold speckle not a solid color so my fingers were more &amp;#34;Easter eggy&amp;#34; then I would care for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty package.</li>
            <li>There was a swatch at the store, so I was fully aware of how it would look.</li>
            <li>Pretty.  </li>
            <li>The white gold and silver look more like white chips of paint on my nail polish, and I was really hoping for something with a bit more sparkle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really wanted a pretty white gold top coat too.</li>
            <li>I own Guilty by Zoya(Man with the Golden Gun was discontinued by the time I got on the gold top coat bandwagon)</li>
            <li>It seems to have a good mix of large and small pieces so that your nails end up looking like a speckled egg.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s much easier to remove than a glitter polish where the glitter gets stuck on your nails.</li>
            <li>so much nicer than the craclke polishes.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a bold color,but a clear glow of soft gold an silver.</li>
            <li>I will try on full nails at my next manicure.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it on Amazon for less than the retail stores I visited.  </li>
            <li>looks more dingy/off/yellow white than sparkly/metallic white gold/silver.</li>
            <li>Apparently it didn&#x27;t sell very well, so it was available a DEEP discount.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see this online for half the price that Ulta was selling it for, when I bought this it was $16.</li>
            <li>This is not chrome at all, but a clear coat with very sparkly silver flakes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to layer over regular colors, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Although the flakes are smaller than The man with the golden gun</li>
            <li>Requires many coats to get the sparkle,  but I&#x27;m too impatient for that</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of this,as Mariah Carey was a new product.</li>
            <li>In two coats there was a nice spread of small pieces and 2-4 larger pieces.</li>
            <li>This product is waaaayyyyy over priced….i&#x27;ve bought cheaper &amp;#34;blingy&amp;#34; top coats for much much less with the same effect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and even as I had expected, especially given the cost.  </li>
            <li>Much like others have said, I was hoping for and expecting for some of the flakes to be of a larger size similar to \\&quot;Man With the Golden Gun\\&quot;, while in reality they are 90% mostly smaller flecks.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 25 year old to try.</li>
            <li>I wonder is it just so old that something has happened to it, as I cannot fathom that this is how it is supposed to look.  </li>
            <li>This wil only be worn on special occasions due ot</li>
            <li>Silly as it may sound, wearing it really feels luxurious since the polish contains real 18kt white gold and silver in a clear suspension base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is actually just bits and pieces of gold leaf floating in clear polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to try this top coat with other nail polish colors, but I&#x27;m sad that it&#x27;s not an exciting endeavor.</li>
            <li>Tell polish (a deep red black color), and each nail ended up evenly coated with fine gold flakes and several larger chunks.</li>
            <li>It leaves a mostly smooth surface, and with a thin topcoat of clear polish you can&#x27;t feel any bumps at all.</li>
            <li>If you need gold flecks on top of an existing polish, it might look okay but using alone makes your nails basically look yellow (like the yellow people get over time from not wearing base coat with nail polish), with gold flecks of all different sizes clumped on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27; so pretty, it lasts about a few weeks as well on my nails.</li>
            <li>If it follows suit with the other gold flake topcoats, soon it will be in high demand and the price will skyrocket both on Amazon and on Ebay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculous, but I feel downright special knowing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really pretty great over dark colors.</li>
            <li> and I do also have &#x27;The Man with the Golden Gun&#x27; to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to be a bit more like last year&#x27;s man with the golden gun.</li>
            <li> it is soooooo beatuful, love it so much, and works with nearly all the nail colors, I will buuy it again.~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> This top coat glides on with just the right amount of flakes with out having to put multiple coats.  </li>
            <li> It is also not &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; gold, which would imply a silver color - it is very much gold.</li>
            <li> I got quit a bit of larger flakes though others say there aren&#x27;t many?</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just because it was the first use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty picky over what nail polish I wear.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten many bigger flakes.</li>
            <li> if I had the extra cash laying around (since depending where you get it, it can be pretty pricey) since I would LOVE a backup of it.</li>
            <li> It is a gold speckle not a solid color so my fingers were more &amp;#34;Easter eggy&amp;#34; then I would care for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty package.</li>
            <li> There was a swatch at the store, so I was fully aware of how it would look.</li>
            <li> Pretty.  </li>
            <li> The white gold and silver look more like white chips of paint on my nail polish, and I was really hoping for something with a bit more sparkle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really wanted a pretty white gold top coat too.</li>
            <li> I own Guilty by Zoya(Man with the Golden Gun was discontinued by the time I got on the gold top coat bandwagon)</li>
            <li> It seems to have a good mix of large and small pieces so that your nails end up looking like a speckled egg.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s much easier to remove than a glitter polish where the glitter gets stuck on your nails.</li>
            <li> so much nicer than the craclke polishes.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bold color,but a clear glow of soft gold an silver.</li>
            <li> I will try on full nails at my next manicure.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it on Amazon for less than the retail stores I visited.  </li>
            <li> looks more dingy/off/yellow white than sparkly/metallic white gold/silver.</li>
            <li> Apparently it didn&#x27;t sell very well, so it was available a DEEP discount.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this online for half the price that Ulta was selling it for, when I bought this it was $16.</li>
            <li> This is not chrome at all, but a clear coat with very sparkly silver flakes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to layer over regular colors, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Although the flakes are smaller than The man with the golden gun</li>
            <li> Requires many coats to get the sparkle,  but I&#x27;m too impatient for that</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this,as Mariah Carey was a new product.</li>
            <li> In two coats there was a nice spread of small pieces and 2-4 larger pieces.</li>
            <li> This product is waaaayyyyy over priced….i&#x27;ve bought cheaper &amp;#34;blingy&amp;#34; top coats for much much less with the same effect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and even as I had expected, especially given the cost.  </li>
            <li> Much like others have said, I was hoping for and expecting for some of the flakes to be of a larger size similar to \\&quot;Man With the Golden Gun\\&quot;, while in reality they are 90% mostly smaller flecks.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 25 year old to try.</li>
            <li> I wonder is it just so old that something has happened to it, as I cannot fathom that this is how it is supposed to look.  </li>
            <li> This wil only be worn on special occasions due ot</li>
            <li> Silly as it may sound, wearing it really feels luxurious since the polish contains real 18kt white gold and silver in a clear suspension base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is actually just bits and pieces of gold leaf floating in clear polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to try this top coat with other nail polish colors, but I&#x27;m sad that it&#x27;s not an exciting endeavor.</li>
            <li> Tell polish (a deep red black color), and each nail ended up evenly coated with fine gold flakes and several larger chunks.</li>
            <li> It leaves a mostly smooth surface, and with a thin topcoat of clear polish you can&#x27;t feel any bumps at all.</li>
            <li> If you need gold flecks on top of an existing polish, it might look okay but using alone makes your nails basically look yellow (like the yellow people get over time from not wearing base coat with nail polish), with gold flecks of all different sizes clumped on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; so pretty, it lasts about a few weeks as well on my nails.</li>
            <li> If it follows suit with the other gold flake topcoats, soon it will be in high demand and the price will skyrocket both on Amazon and on Ebay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous, but I feel downright special knowing</li>
            <li> Personally, I found the ratio of small to large pieces in this polish pleasing</li>
            <li> it is just as gorgeous because there are tons of white gold flecks and the base is also shimmery.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that bad on its own.  </li>
            <li> You know how when your white gold kinda turns a little yellow?</li>
            <li> I put it on over a black and will probably put it over a red for the Holidays</li>
            <li> This polish does not appear as you would expect based on the coloring of the bottle - it is like tiny gold flakes in a clear polish (which is not clear, but more yellowy that anything), so it does look awful as a standalone polish.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really what I was expected for such an expensive bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> the nail polish is expensive but I believe its worth it.</li>
            <li> and I have used it a couple of times since getting it a month ago, just not exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> There are small flecks of White Gold and Silver.</li>
            <li> If you want a glittery effect, brush it on like any other glitter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only complaint, and the only reason that it received only 4 out or 5 stars would be a bit of disappointment when it comes to the size of the 18kt white gold and silver flakes.</li>
            <li> I like to use 2 coats of a dark color polish, then 2 coats of this polish and</li>
            <li> Maybe with a black or very dark colored base coat, it will look okay</li>
            <li> Ever since the big craze happened with the Zoya Guilty Pleasures polish, I&#x27;ve been dying for a white gold flake topcoat.</li>
            <li> Like to sparingly place it on the tips, for a gradient, over a shiny black.</li>
            <li> I got it for half the $30 price tag</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little box to keep your polish in tact,and it is sealed so it doesn&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> I even got another bottle to have back up when it goes extinct.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be an expensive bottle to replace when it finally does run out.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting a thick chrome shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or</li>
            <li> Not worth it :(</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t disappointed me at all.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice topcoat. Very similar to the Gwen Stefani Don&#x27;t Speak topcoat.</li>
            <li> My daughter love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> I thought this polish was actual gold / silver nail polish but it is actually just bits and pieces of gold leaf floating in clear polish. It requires you to paint your nails one color and then use this polish over the top of that because on nude nails it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and doesn&#x27;t really show up. I like it because it&#x27;s different but it wasn&#x27;t really what I was expected for such an expensive bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this online for half the price that Ulta was selling it for, when I bought this it was $16. When I got it, I was incredibly disappointed. I own Guilty by Zoya(Man with the Golden Gun was discontinued by the time I got on the gold top coat bandwagon) and I really wanted a pretty white gold top coat too. This was not it. The pieces of &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; gold were TINY glitter-like flecks that were dingy and yellow-toned... I had to use multiple coats for the polish to be noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or if the $30 Ulta polish is the same way, but I only used it twice and then put it back in the collector&#x27;s box until I decide what to do with it. I would not recommend this product, I&#x27;m not even sure if I would chance it again and go buy it for retail price.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, the shipping was fast and the box and bottle arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> This was a request from my daughter for Christmas.  I was able to get it on Amazon for less than the retail stores I visited.  It was a big hit on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It came in a cute box. It would also be a nice gift.The 18 karat gold and silver flakes were BEAUTIFUL~!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this from stores and the quality was a lot better than the one I purchased online. I heard some people mention they thought it was a dupe but for 11.00 I thought I would try it. Not worth it :(</li>
            <li> My friend got me this color for Christmas and I was expecting a thick chrome shade. This is not chrome at all, but a clear coat with very sparkly silver flakes. I used it as the stars on my galaxy nails and they are PERFECT for it. I got quit a bit of larger flakes though others say there aren&#x27;t many? Maybe it was just because it was the first use but they seem fine to me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and even as I had expected, especially given the cost.  It&#x27;s pretty and I have used it a couple of times since getting it a month ago, just not exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> the nail polish is expensive but I believe its worth it. O.P.I products are of great quality and I would recommended to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. I ordered three of these for my nieces for Christmas (shhh, don&#x27;t tell) and one for me (gotta try the product before I give it as a gift). I ended up being very impressed. I used it on top of a medium pink polish to see how well it would show up, and it looks great! I&#x27;m sure it looks even more impressive on darker polishes. It seems to have a good mix of large and small pieces so that your nails end up looking like a speckled egg. Very cool product. Can&#x27;t wait to show my husband my nails!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely GORGEOUS! A little pricey, but well worth it. It complements any polish and looks almost like snowflakes on your nails! Will buy and buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; so pretty, it lasts about a few weeks as well on my nails. I do my own nails and grow them out myself so I&#x27;m pretty picky over what nail polish I wear. This wil only be worn on special occasions due ot the fact it&#x27;s going to be an expensive bottle to replace when it finally does run out.</li>
            <li> Im so in love with this polish! it is a perfect compliment to an elegant outfit. I have the yellow gold as well and a combination of both is also stunning! definitely i would recommend this to any nail art addict!</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this. I wanted it to be a bit more like last year&#x27;s man with the golden gun. My bottle has lots of teeny tiny pieces and I haven&#x27;t gotten many bigger flakes. I know with polishes like this bottles vary but I am kinda bummed out about it. It&#x27;s still a very pretty polish and I would buy it again... if I had the extra cash laying around (since depending where you get it, it can be pretty pricey) since I would LOVE a backup of it. I will probably be alternating this polish and it&#x27;s sister the yellow gold flake polish this holiday season.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1UJ6WVP9K4WPA]]I absolutely LOVE this topcoat. Ever since the big craze happened with the Zoya Guilty Pleasures polish, I&#x27;ve been dying for a white gold flake topcoat. I was thrilled to see this polish show up as part of the O.P.I Mariah Carey 2013 Winter line. Silly as it may sound, wearing it really feels luxurious since the polish contains real 18kt white gold and silver in a clear suspension base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and the only reason that it received only 4 out or 5 stars would be a bit of disappointment when it comes to the size of the 18kt white gold and silver flakes. Much like others have said, I was hoping for and expecting for some of the flakes to be of a larger size similar to \\&quot;Man With the Golden Gun\\&quot;, while in reality they are 90% mostly smaller flecks. They are still GORGEOUS when placed over a nice black polish and have an amazing shine finished off with Seche Vite topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten many complements on the polish and am really looking forward to using it even more as the holidays approach. If you are considering purchasing, it may be a good idea to swoop this one up while it is still in the under $20 price range. If it follows suit with the other gold flake topcoats, soon it will be in high demand and the price will skyrocket both on Amazon and on Ebay.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, would like to get some for myself.</li>
            <li> This top coat glides on with just the right amount of flakes with out having to put multiple coats.  Enjoy!  I have :)</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this! It&#x27;s so fun to layer over regular colors, I use it all the time. Plus, it&#x27;s much easier to remove than a glitter polish where the glitter gets stuck on your nails. It leaves a mostly smooth surface, and with a thin topcoat of clear polish you can&#x27;t feel any bumps at all.</li>
            <li> This product is waaaayyyyy over priced….i&#x27;ve bought cheaper &amp;#34;blingy&amp;#34; top coats for much much less with the same effect. Who in the heck knows but you that the flecks are white gold and silver?</li>
            <li> I purchased this top coat to see what the hype was all about...it&#x27;s looks okay when it is placed over your favorite OPI polish but to me the glittery top coat is not needed.  The OPI colors are so beautiful all you need is an ordinary clear top coat.</li>
            <li> Love the prettiness of this polish. Like to sparingly place it on the tips, for a gradient, over a shiny black. Gorgeous. Am very pleased with the seller, well wrapped and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> This polish is a gorgeous topcoat. Although the flakes are smaller than The man with the golden gun it is just as gorgeous because there are tons of white gold flecks and the base is also shimmery. I&#x27;m glad to own both &amp; they&#x27;re worth the price here, it&#x27;s a good deal. This adds dimension to your polish and looks great. You&#x27;ll get noticed for sure. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. but, nothing special. No sparkle, shine  or depth. You have to look up close just to see it. I got it for half the $30 price tag and I still wouldn&#x27;t bother to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Okay, I LOVE this nail polish. It&#x27;s ridiculous, but I feel downright special knowing that my fingers have 18k gold on them! It goes on beautifully. I applied 2 coats of this on top of the China Glaze Prey Tell polish (a deep red black color), and each nail ended up evenly coated with fine gold flakes and several larger chunks. Looks absolutely gorgeous, dried quickly, and makes me feel like I&#x27;m literally dripping in gold! I got this for just under $12 here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s worth every penny! Snatch it up while you still can.</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought it would be. It is a gold speckle not a solid color so my fingers were more &amp;#34;Easter eggy&amp;#34; then I would care for.</li>
            <li> I think this is faked. I own both this one and one I purchased for 30 and this one is much different quality than the one I paid 30 for...just saying. Sometimes it is too good to be true</li>
            <li> While pricy, I would say this polish is worth it. It&#x27;s so pretty, especially on top of a red for the holidays. Stunning!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty top coat. There are small flecks of White Gold and Silver. I like to use 2 coats of a dark color polish, then 2 coats of this polish and then a high gloss top coat to finish it all off. Very elegant.</li>
            <li> Appearance reminded me of something a teen or tween would wear on her fingernails. Not as pictured online. I gave it to my 25 year old to try.</li>
            <li> it is soooooo beatuful, love it so much, and works with nearly all the nail colors, I will buuy it again.~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of silver flakes and is soo pretty! A must have pair for &amp;#34;the man with the golden gun&amp;#34; by OPI!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife...she said...why? So there. I bought this as a &amp;#34;novelty stocking stuffer&amp;#34; item. She hasn&#x27;t used it as yet.</li>
            <li> Really pretty great over dark colors.</li>
            <li> My new favorite top coat, beautiful , gold flecks are beautiful</li>
            <li> Cute. It&#x27;s a top coat and there isn&#x27;t much that comes out it looks best over dark colors</li>
            <li> Happy with this top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech student.I discovered this polish at my local nail supply store. Apparently it didn&#x27;t sell very well, so it was available a DEEP discount. I got it based on it&#x27;s pretty package. There was a swatch at the store, so I was fully aware of how it would look. It&#x27;s a glittery-foil like topper, perfect for darker polishes. If you want a glittery effect, brush it on like any other glitter. If you want a foil effect, dip through and find larger chunks. It was such a hit, several of my fellow students bought one also. I even got another bottle to have back up when it goes extinct.</li>
            <li> looks more dingy/off/yellow white than sparkly/metallic white gold/silver. but the flakes are a nice size and it is a unique, pretty polish.</li>
            <li> A really fun nail polish! Pairs great with any solid base coat.</li>
            <li> While the seller was great and shipped this item extremely promptly, I do not care for this top coat. The white gold and silver look more like white chips of paint on my nail polish, and I was really hoping for something with a bit more sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to try this top coat with other nail polish colors, but I&#x27;m sad that it&#x27;s not an exciting endeavor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish! It was so easy to apply. I put it on over a black and will probably put it over a red for the Holidays</li>
            <li> Love this gold gilt polish!  Great product!</li>
            <li> so much nicer than the craclke polishes.  it hides the fact that the polish may be chipping or wearing off and s gorgeous over darker or lighter colors/shades.  i love it alone too.  it as become my favorite polish!!</li>
            <li> Pretty.  Requires many coats to get the sparkle,  but I&#x27;m too impatient for that so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this,as Mariah Carey was a new product.It wasn&#x27;t a bold color,but a clear glow of soft gold an silver.It gives your nails a extra glow.It comes in it&#x27;s little box to keep your polish in tact,and it is sealed so it doesn&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> Personally, I found the ratio of small to large pieces in this polish pleasing and I do also have &#x27;The Man with the Golden Gun&#x27; to compare it to. In two coats there was a nice spread of small pieces and 2-4 larger pieces. There is also a nice shine/glittery look with out looking to gaudy. If you want more shine than what this has to offer, Ciate makes a shredded foil that I have seen selling at Nordstroms...</li>
            <li> When I saw several reviews of this polish and beautiful swatches with it, I knew I should have it. And it didn&#x27;t disappointed me at all. I wear it as an accent, it looks fabulous over darker shades.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on one nail and it was ok. I will try on full nails at my next manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty! It goes well on all colors and on its own!</li>
            <li> This polish does not appear as you would expect based on the coloring of the bottle - it is like tiny gold flakes in a clear polish (which is not clear, but more yellowy that anything), so it does look awful as a standalone polish.  If you need gold flecks on top of an existing polish, it might look okay but using alone makes your nails basically look yellow (like the yellow people get over time from not wearing base coat with nail polish), with gold flecks of all different sizes clumped on.  It&#x27;s not flattering.  I wonder is it just so old that something has happened to it, as I cannot fathom that this is how it is supposed to look.  I already removed it or else I would have snapped a picture, it&#x27;s that bad on its own.  Will update when I use it overtop of another color, but just a warning that it is not a standalone color.  Maybe with a black or very dark colored base coat, it will look okay but it does not look good over a silver-toned color which I tried shortly afterwards.  I was hoping this would be a gold polish, but I guess &amp;#34;top coat&amp;#34; should have given me a clue that it would not be suitable on its own.  It is also not &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; gold, which would imply a silver color - it is very much gold.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone&#x27;s polish collection!</li>
            <li> Super Pretty  Def a nice polish topper to own</li>
            <li> This elevated any nail polish to look like money but you don&#x27;t know why.  This gives your nails an elegance no matter what color you use under and if you mattify it oh the compliments that pour in.  Get it you will love it.</li>
            <li> You know how when your white gold kinda turns a little yellow? That&#x27;s the color you end up with. But it&#x27;s still nice and sparkly.</li>
