            <li>It is fantastic!</li>

            <li>So many uses.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I did order this oil through a special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>this is a pretty good</li>
            <li>Also great to clear up infections</li>
            <li>Great antiseptic and natural instead of putting all those strong chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use dropper.</li>
            <li>Strong scent</li>
            <li>The bottle and dropper are glass and the oil is a good high</li>
            <li>This oils is pure and of a great quality and highly concentrated so make sure you dilute it in carrier oil.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, strong,  concentrate.</li>
            <li>It quickly cleared up some poison ivy too!</li>
            <li>It has a strong medicine smell to it but is more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the bottle is huge</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great oil to have and at around $19 bucks</li>
            <li>Also, can be added to hair detangler and sprayed on lightly.</li>
            <li>tea tree is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>However, the ease of application to my toes and the penetration of the oil is superior so far to anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The quality seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li>Very useful ..</li>
            <li>Love the clean fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I use 3 to 4 drops in my laundry, mixed in coconut oil for a good acne treatment, use it as a treatment for strong odors from pets and kids, and just about everything.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil, and this one is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I have also used it in a spray bottle with water and vinegar to clean student desks in my classroom.  </li>
            <li>I like using this to clean my kitchen counters.</li>
            <li>I have so far been able to remove 3 skin tags!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product - I have purchased from other well-known brands like NOW Foods, and I can say confidently that there is no difference in quality between the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>I love oils and tea tree oil is one of the many oils I like the most due to</li>
            <li>This essential oil works great in my diffuser and is very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li>I love that Tea Tree Oil is so versatile and can be used for so many different things.</li>
            <li>I love not only the smell but the size of the bottle and the fact that I have the choice of using the dropper and being able to pour what I need.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged to prevent breakage, nice big bottle and dropper included for easy application.</li>
            <li>huge and thie ole is very concentrated</li>
            <li>but it is worth millions to my family for lice prevention.</li>
            <li>I love that this is 100% natural and undiluted.</li>
            <li>And I love that it is all natural -</li>
            <li>This is good qulaity oil, it is much larger than most essential oils, you defnately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as strong as the really high end, but you&#x27;ve got to expect</li>
            <li>It did not help me with the fungus, but I know it is good for other things.</li>
            <li>But for right now it seems to be working,</li>
            <li>While it does not have as harsh of a smell that most tea tree oil has, it is far more potent.</li>
            <li>I go through so much tea tree oil, but a huge 4 oz bottle is more than enough for me to use for quite some time.</li>
            <li>The Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree blend is quite nice and helps with minor headaches.</li>
            <li>personally love the scent of tea tree oil, it has a very earthy scent and the oil is a clear color.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I adore tea tree oil, I use it so much in a day!</li>
            <li>The oil has a very liquid like texture and is very quickly absorbed on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it for first aid, making lotions, kids shampoo, laundry disinfectant etc.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other uses for this oil but please make sure you don&#x27;t use it around your pets!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Used it on my scalp - just a few drops, and it moisturized my scalp and hair wonderfully; reduced the dry itch really well.</li>
            <li>that offers a natural healthy way to treat infections.</li>
            <li>Very strong - pure oil can cause severe skin irritations - be careful</li>
            <li>I am expecting my nail to be clear and the toe fungus gone in the next couple of months because of the good results I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get a big bottle of it for a decent price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work for dandruff, but it certainly did NOT work for nail fungus at all.</li>
            <li>The oil came very neatly packaged</li>
            <li>Seems like the real stuff.</li>
            <li>It came as described and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>and it really worked</li>
            <li>but this is still a bonafide success as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>it is real Jack of all tread.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust trying to order the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have owned aVo oils in the past and when I was offered this product during a one time promotional period I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>It was covered for the most part by my hair so it wasn&#x27;t a big enough concern to get it surgically removed</li>
            <li>There is no information packet included, all you get is the product and from what I was able to find out, there are SEVERAL different methods of applying this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended    Update:</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend AVO.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has a really high quality, which it&#x27;s 100% pure, natural with pharmaceutical</li>
            <li>The seller is very responsive to questions and the oil is natural, undiluted and steam distilled</li>
            <li>So I ordered a bottle right away and mixed it with some coconut oil to dilute.</li>
            <li>Once this bottle is empty, we&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>Sounds pretty gross to me!  </li>
            <li>I have used this oil to treat my husbands toe nail fungus and in just a couple of days nearly all of the fungus went away!</li>
            <li>and this is the first treatment that actually worked for me -</li>
            <li>Does not have the same results as my other bottle, and has a more perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li>I get every time I step outside on a sunny, hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most tea tree oil you will find is diluted, with added ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high but for the amount of things you can use this for is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>, some recommend full strength while others suggest mixing it with other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other tea tree oils in the past and this is equally as good as the others.</li>
            <li>It has multiple uses, including but not limited to: Healing sunburn, treating acne, preventing lice, and treating ringworm (and many other fungal infections).</li>
            <li>He applied the tea tree oil directly on his skin twice a day for about 3 or 4 days.  </li>
            <li>My husband has really sensitive skin and the oil did not irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is 100% natural</li>
            <li>The bottle is VERY generous and will last me</li>
            <li>All natural is the way to go and I am finding out</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>It comes with a glass dropper and in a decent 4 oz size that will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li>I am just getting into using essential oils and I purchased this hoping it was high quality.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because this was such a good price for a large quantity of product, but I must say it exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>No better than cheap OTC Tea Tree oil.  </li>
            <li>It may have been athlete&#x27;s feet because he takes a hot yoga class, and everyone in there is ringing wet with sweat and barefoot.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils</li>
            <li>got this product with a good price discount, and use it for my bad toenail and it really works, i used also for my dandruff and alots of remedies this product..</li>
            <li>Odor a little strong, but not unexpected.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised when you see just how big this bottle is!</li>
            <li>Bottle arrive with dropper broken, still able to use though.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective it will be  as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how quick the oil works, this oil is very high quality and really worked.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this oil...</li>
            <li> I love that this came with an eye dropper.</li>
            <li> So many uses.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I did order this oil through a special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good</li>
            <li> Also great to clear up infections</li>
            <li> Great antiseptic and natural instead of putting all those strong chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use dropper.</li>
            <li> Strong scent</li>
            <li> The bottle and dropper are glass and the oil is a good high</li>
            <li> This oils is pure and of a great quality and highly concentrated so make sure you dilute it in carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, strong,  concentrate.</li>
            <li> It quickly cleared up some poison ivy too!</li>
            <li> It has a strong medicine smell to it but is more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the bottle is huge</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great oil to have and at around $19 bucks</li>
            <li> Also, can be added to hair detangler and sprayed on lightly.</li>
            <li> tea tree is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> However, the ease of application to my toes and the penetration of the oil is superior so far to anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The quality seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li> Very useful ..</li>
            <li> Love the clean fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I use 3 to 4 drops in my laundry, mixed in coconut oil for a good acne treatment, use it as a treatment for strong odors from pets and kids, and just about everything.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil, and this one is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I have also used it in a spray bottle with water and vinegar to clean student desks in my classroom.  </li>
            <li> I like using this to clean my kitchen counters.</li>
            <li> I have so far been able to remove 3 skin tags!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product - I have purchased from other well-known brands like NOW Foods, and I can say confidently that there is no difference in quality between the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love oils and tea tree oil is one of the many oils I like the most due to</li>
            <li> This essential oil works great in my diffuser and is very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li> I love that Tea Tree Oil is so versatile and can be used for so many different things.</li>
            <li> I love not only the smell but the size of the bottle and the fact that I have the choice of using the dropper and being able to pour what I need.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged to prevent breakage, nice big bottle and dropper included for easy application.</li>
            <li> huge and thie ole is very concentrated</li>
            <li> but it is worth millions to my family for lice prevention.</li>
            <li> I love that this is 100% natural and undiluted.</li>
            <li> And I love that it is all natural -</li>
            <li> This is good qulaity oil, it is much larger than most essential oils, you defnately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as strong as the really high end, but you&#x27;ve got to expect</li>
            <li> It did not help me with the fungus, but I know it is good for other things.</li>
            <li> But for right now it seems to be working,</li>
            <li> While it does not have as harsh of a smell that most tea tree oil has, it is far more potent.</li>
            <li> I go through so much tea tree oil, but a huge 4 oz bottle is more than enough for me to use for quite some time.</li>
            <li> The Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree blend is quite nice and helps with minor headaches.</li>
            <li> personally love the scent of tea tree oil, it has a very earthy scent and the oil is a clear color.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I adore tea tree oil, I use it so much in a day!</li>
            <li> The oil has a very liquid like texture and is very quickly absorbed on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for first aid, making lotions, kids shampoo, laundry disinfectant etc.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other uses for this oil but please make sure you don&#x27;t use it around your pets!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Used it on my scalp - just a few drops, and it moisturized my scalp and hair wonderfully; reduced the dry itch really well.</li>
            <li> that offers a natural healthy way to treat infections.</li>
            <li> Very strong - pure oil can cause severe skin irritations - be careful</li>
            <li> I am expecting my nail to be clear and the toe fungus gone in the next couple of months because of the good results I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get a big bottle of it for a decent price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work for dandruff, but it certainly did NOT work for nail fungus at all.</li>
            <li> The oil came very neatly packaged</li>
            <li> Seems like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> It came as described and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> and it really worked</li>
            <li> but this is still a bonafide success as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> it is real Jack of all tread.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust trying to order the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have owned aVo oils in the past and when I was offered this product during a one time promotional period I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> It was covered for the most part by my hair so it wasn&#x27;t a big enough concern to get it surgically removed</li>
            <li> There is no information packet included, all you get is the product and from what I was able to find out, there are SEVERAL different methods of applying this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended    Update:</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend AVO.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a really high quality, which it&#x27;s 100% pure, natural with pharmaceutical</li>
            <li> The seller is very responsive to questions and the oil is natural, undiluted and steam distilled</li>
            <li> So I ordered a bottle right away and mixed it with some coconut oil to dilute.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle is empty, we&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> Sounds pretty gross to me!  </li>
            <li> I have used this oil to treat my husbands toe nail fungus and in just a couple of days nearly all of the fungus went away!</li>
            <li> and this is the first treatment that actually worked for me -</li>
            <li> Does not have the same results as my other bottle, and has a more perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> I get every time I step outside on a sunny, hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most tea tree oil you will find is diluted, with added ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high but for the amount of things you can use this for is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> , some recommend full strength while others suggest mixing it with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other tea tree oils in the past and this is equally as good as the others.</li>
            <li> It has multiple uses, including but not limited to: Healing sunburn, treating acne, preventing lice, and treating ringworm (and many other fungal infections).</li>
            <li> He applied the tea tree oil directly on his skin twice a day for about 3 or 4 days.  </li>
            <li> My husband has really sensitive skin and the oil did not irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is 100% natural</li>
            <li> The bottle is VERY generous and will last me</li>
            <li> All natural is the way to go and I am finding out</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> It comes with a glass dropper and in a decent 4 oz size that will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into using essential oils and I purchased this hoping it was high quality.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because this was such a good price for a large quantity of product, but I must say it exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> No better than cheap OTC Tea Tree oil.  </li>
            <li> It may have been athlete&#x27;s feet because he takes a hot yoga class, and everyone in there is ringing wet with sweat and barefoot.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils</li>
            <li> got this product with a good price discount, and use it for my bad toenail and it really works, i used also for my dandruff and alots of remedies this product..</li>
            <li> Odor a little strong, but not unexpected.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised when you see just how big this bottle is!</li>
            <li> Bottle arrive with dropper broken, still able to use though.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective it will be  as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quick the oil works, this oil is very high quality and really worked.</li>
            <li> so i know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on a long lasting issue!</li>
            <li> It also did not treat the fungus at all, only made the nail turn into a deep dark yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He will use it as a preventative everyday and it should clear up his problem eventually.  </li>
            <li> and we all had lice my mom wanted to cry because we all had long tick hair  </li>
            <li> a very long time-  </li>
            <li> Zits, Dry skin, Rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> or on your dry scalp or even for lice i remember when me and my sister came home from school</li>
            <li> I usually dip the cotton bud directly into the bottle so don&#x27;t use the cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a month of continuous use for the nail fungus, the nails instead had turned dark yellow.</li>
            <li> I use this oil mostly in my diffuser when my allergies get bad.</li>
            <li> I only received the item a few days ago.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals to dry up my skin making the fungal infection worse.  </li>
            <li> I have used this every few days for toe fungus and it did not take long to cure them.</li>
            <li> Must be something else out there other than this.</li>
            <li> other therapies break up the athlete&#x27;s foot causing it to spread.  </li>
            <li> Just got it the other day</li>
            <li> aVo, on the other hand, is 100% Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> Product arrived extremely well packaged and seems to be working well on nails.</li>
            <li> As a former educator of over 40 years, I have learned  - the hard way - how to prevent lice.</li>
            <li> The uses are endless!</li>
            <li> Just received it will use to treat toenail fungus after several weeks will let you know what the results are in the mean time</li>
            <li> If you put just a little tea tree oil in your shampoo bottle, you will not contact head lice.</li>
            <li> It smells and acts like other tea tree oils I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Not some watered down knockoff!</li>
            <li> The oil came in a dark glass bottle and included a lid, a glass dropper and the label on the oil has a small description on tea tree oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also add the oil in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add a few drop in my bath.</li>
            <li> I feel results after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Waste of money &amp; time.</li>
            <li> it killed them like there was no tommerow you can also use it for all purpose house cleaner.</li>
            <li> We use this (a few drops per bottle) in our shampoo and it keeps the kids from getting head lice at school.</li>
            <li> I also decided to use it on a few skin tags under my armpit and around my neck</li>
            <li> I placed this oil on some chigger bites I had and it stopped the itching and cleared it up in a few days.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my floor and counter cleaner.</li>
            <li> We usually make blends for our diffuser or sauna.</li>
            <li> I have been telling all of my friends and family that they need at least a 4 oz bottle of tea tree oil for just about any ailment or household chore they may have.</li>
            <li> but it seriously burnt when I applied it to one of my skin tags on the face</li>
            <li> Wish I found this earlier instead of them stupid home rememedies and antibiotics that hurt my liver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy now</li>
            <li> It was extremely shocking to see such a discoloring and it has been quite concerning that the seller advertises this product specifically for nail fungus treatment when it gave such a horrible side effect.</li>
            <li> When kids have a cold</li>
            <li> but I know one thing, Uku&#x27;s (lice) hate tea tree.  </li>
            <li> This will keep those horrible ukus away and out of my house.</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely bad for them!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best tea tra oil ive ever tried!  The bottle it comes in is huge and thie ole is very concentrated so i know it will last a long time. I really like how the bottle looks and the dropper that it comes with works great and makes it very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great antiseptic and natural instead of putting all those strong chemicals on your skin. Works great on fungal infections of all kids.</li>
            <li> I use this for many things. Zits, Dry skin, Rashes, etc. And for every&lt;br /&gt;thing i use it for, It works wonders for. Tea tree is a very good cleanser&lt;br /&gt;and renewer. Everyone should use it.</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil for various things through the years. The very best thing is for lice prevention. As a former educator of over 40 years, I have learned  - the hard way - how to prevent lice. If you put just a little tea tree oil in your shampoo bottle, you will not contact head lice. I am no scientist or doctor but after we started doing that, none of the members of my family ever got head lice again and they were rampant at the school where we were. I swear by tea tree oil for that reason. It is also soothing for scrapes and floor burn type injuries. I like to use in the laundry occasionally, too. It is a good product just to keep on hand but it is worth millions to my family for lice prevention. As my mother always said, it is no disgrace to get lice but it is a disgrace to keep them.</li>
            <li> I use Tea Tree Oil every day, so this nice big bottle is awesome.  Great quality, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree for my hair treatments and foot soaks.  This is an excellent product - I have purchased from other well-known brands like NOW Foods, and I can say confidently that there is no difference in quality between the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and quality of this product.  Using it for toenail...getting better.  My husband uses it on his itchy scalps.  Stops the problem immediately.  He will use it as a preventative everyday and it should clear up his problem eventually.  I will be being more.  The dropper is very convenient and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle! The amount of things you can do with tea tree oil is limitless! I cannot wait to try all the uses it has. I love that this is 100% natural and undiluted. Great quality.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for a rash he had on his foot.  It may have been athlete&#x27;s feet because he takes a hot yoga class, and everyone in there is ringing wet with sweat and barefoot.  Sounds pretty gross to me!  He applied the tea tree oil directly on his skin twice a day for about 3 or 4 days.  It cleared up, so we are happy.  I have also used it in a spray bottle with water and vinegar to clean student desks in my classroom.  Since it gets rid of fungus, bacteria, etc, I thought it would be great in the classroom.  *Disclaimer:  I received this product at a promotional DISCOUNT for testing and reviewing purposes.

            <li> I have used this every few days for toe fungus and it did not take long to cure them. It has a strong medicine smell to it but is more than worth it.  Highly Recommended    Update: I got accustomed to the smell so it does NOT bother me.</li>

            <li> I love oils and tea tree oil is one of the many oils I like the most due to it&#x27;s scent and healing properties. I have owned aVo oils in the past and when I was offered this product during a one time promotional period I was thrilled. The oil came very neatly packaged and I could smell the scent of the oil even before I opened the bottle. The oil came in a dark glass bottle and included a lid, a glass dropper and the label on the oil has a small description on tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the scent of tea tree oil, it has a very earthy scent and the oil is a clear color. The oil has a very liquid like texture and is very quickly absorbed on the skin. I have used this oil to treat my husbands toe nail fungus and in just a couple of days nearly all of the fungus went away! My husband has really sensitive skin and the oil did not irritate his skin. I also used this oil to treat an infected wound and about 20-30 minutes after I places 2 drops of oil on the infected skin, I began to see the oil cleaning out the wound. The infection vanished before my eyes, it was so impressive! I was shocked at how quick the oil works, this oil is very high quality and really worked. This oil is 100% natural and I do not have to worry about added pesticides, toxins or chemicals when treating infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aVo Tea Tree Oil is absolutely great! I would highly recommend this brand. The seller is very responsive to questions and the oil is natural, undiluted and steam distilled that offers a natural healthy way to treat infections. The oil can also be placed in a diffuser and smells great!</li>
            <li> This essential oil works great in my diffuser and is very relaxing and calming. One of my personal favs.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband to use on his toenail fungus and it works great! I also add the oil in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add a few drop in my bath. Will recommend to friend and family. Great buy!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Seems like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!  Use it in several homemade cleaning products!!!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil. I use it for first aid, making lotions, kids shampoo, laundry disinfectant etc. Love that I can get a big bottle of it for a decent price.</li>
            <li> It came as described and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils but I know one thing, Uku&#x27;s (lice) hate tea tree.  Anything tea tree they don&#x27;t like and stay away. Now I wish I had this about 6 months ago but wishful thinking led me here. I was offered this Tea Tree Oil from Avo for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. So I ordered a bottle right away and mixed it with some coconut oil to dilute. I treated everyone&#x27;s hair, well put it on their hair lines. This will keep those horrible ukus away and out of my house. Now to find more uses for this amazing tea tree oil. I definitely recommend this Australian Tea Tree Oil from Avo for everyone&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li> got this product with a good price discount, and use it for my bad toenail and it really works, i used also for my dandruff and alots of remedies this product..Very useful ..I love this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my product it show up in one piece😄😄😄😄</li>
            <li> This is awesome tea tree oil. It came well packaged and the build quality is outstanding. I feel results after a few uses. Great day.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Australia - I am in love with this oil.  It has totally gotten my feet under control- I have struggled with athletes foot for over 2 years and this is the first treatment that actually worked for me - The bottle is VERY generous and will last me a very long time-  And I love that it is all natural - I don&#x27;t even want to think about all the chemicals that were in the drug store athletes foot products I tried or what the side effects may be.  All natural is the way to go and I am finding out seems to work better most of the time!!!!! Lovely upscale label design - would make a nice gift too.&lt;br /&gt;Got this on a promo to try and review and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I first have to say that this bottle is a great size! It&#x27;ll definitely last me quite awhile. I love that Tea Tree Oil is so versatile and can be used for so many different things. I used it in my oil diffuser and it smells really nice! I also used it in my hair and have noticed my issue with dandruff is getting better, it also made my hair smell nice and feel soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it mixed in with my lotion and it not only made my skin feel smoother but it also made my elbows feel softer! The price is a little high but for the amount of things you can use this for is totally worth it! I would definitely recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Did not worked at all!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil, and this one is the real deal! Not some watered down knockoff!</li>
            <li> Great site, etc for the price and smells great. It appears to do as it should.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on a long lasting issue! Also the price for the amount of oil you get is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is  not working at all.  Waste of money &amp; time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is legitimate Tea tree oil.  Does not have the same results as my other bottle, and has a more perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my foot fungus problems!</li>
            <li> Bought it because I read the reviews and they mentioned it cures nail fungus....I have it on one toe, being using it for a month, did not do anything.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use (because I cannot return) and if something changes I promise to update</li>
            <li> Bottle arrive with dropper broken, still able to use though.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into using essential oils and I purchased this hoping it was high quality.  I was a little skeptical at first because this was such a good price for a large quantity of product, but I must say it exceeded my expectations.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I like the benefits of Tea Tree oil. I bought this for toe nail fungus. It did not help me with the fungus, but I know it is good for other things.</li>
            <li> So nice. A favorite oil of mine! Worked awesome in my hair mask, has a great aroma, the dropper is nice too.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve found for toenail fungus, but wash your hands thoroughly after use so you don&#x27;t get any on your face.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is a grea tproduct at this price and size, great value</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I got this product for my Aunt... She loves it.... And will buy more! Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I like using this to clean my kitchen counters. Also great to clear up infections</li>
            <li> Good product for a good price I used it for fungus until my nail and it cleared it up in no time. Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Tea Tree oil that doesn&#x27;t test on animals that I could find on the market. Smells great, not so sure if it&#x27;s doing much to my skin tags but it seriously burnt when I applied it to one of my skin tags on the face so I&#x27;d reckon that it probably kills the skin tags if you apply it religiously. I usually dip the cotton bud directly into the bottle so don&#x27;t use the cap.</li>
            <li> i love my tea tree oil and all that is can do for you and your home it helps toe fungal. or on your dry scalp or even for lice i remember when me and my sister came home from school and we all had lice my mom wanted to cry because we all had long tick hair  so she got some coconut shampoo and put some tea tree oil in it and it really worked it killed them like there was no tommerow you can also use it for all purpose house cleaner. for mold in your home. or even in your dishwasher or even in you&#x27;re washing machine the list goes on and on my mom used it when we were  kids and now i am using it for me and my family.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it for lots of things but mostly my hair and my kids hair.</li>
            <li> Stunk up the house and clothes Wife made me through this stinking stuff out in the trash. Must be something else out there other than this. Beware! this stuff is POTENT</li>
            <li> Very well packaged to prevent breakage, nice big bottle and dropper included for easy application. Love the clean fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just hope it works as promised for toenail fungus. Time will tell.......</li>
            <li> seems to be working for me I like the mixture because it is effective and to me it has a wonderful aroma.  It will take several months to see if it can do all that it sys it can do.  But for right now it seems to be working,</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised when you see just how big this bottle is! Makes it a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, I would say it&#x27;s up there. It smells and acts like other tea tree oils I have bought in the past. It&#x27;s not quite as strong as the really high end, but you&#x27;ve got to expect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> other therapies break up the athlete&#x27;s foot causing it to spread.  I can see the difference in one days use.  No harsh chemicals to dry up my skin making the fungal infection worse.  Wish I found this earlier instead of them stupid home rememedies and antibiotics that hurt my liver.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Just got it the other day and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Used it on my scalp - just a few drops, and it moisturized my scalp and hair wonderfully; reduced the dry itch really well. I highly recommend AVO.</li>
            <li> Very strong - pure oil can cause severe skin irritations - be careful</li>
            <li> The smell way super strong!! Made my eyes water so I didn&#x27;t use the product</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great! Package arrived on time. Five stars!</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent! I use it for itchy scalp, and omg! It works so well at keeping my scalp moisturized and flake-free. Plus, the bottle is huge so I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon! Very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> Nice quality tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve had other tea tree oils in the past and this is equally as good as the others. The bottle came packaged well and got here safely. It comes with a glass dropper and in a decent 4 oz size that will last me quite some time. I use this oil mostly in my diffuser when my allergies get bad. This helps me breathe easier and relax. There are plenty of other uses for this oil but please make sure you don&#x27;t use it around your pets! This oil is extremely bad for them!! Since I don&#x27;t have any dogs or cats, this is safe to have in my household. Please also use caution when using this for your skin or hair. You may need to dilute this with a carrier oil before applying. Overall this is a great oil to have and at around $19 bucks this is a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> We use this (a few drops per bottle) in our shampoo and it keeps the kids from getting head lice at school. Also, can be added to hair detangler and sprayed on lightly.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. The short version of my story goes, I had a wart on my scalp. About the size of a sunflower seed. It was covered for the most part by my hair so it wasn&#x27;t a big enough concern to get it surgically removed so I thought I&#x27;d try the tea tree oil after reading the reviews. I put a drop on the wart once in the morning and once before bed. After about two weeks the thing has all but shriveled up and fallen off. I also decided to use it on a few skin tags under my armpit and around my neck (God, you guys must think I look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame). The ones under my armpit were gone within a week. The neck tags are still there but this is still a bonafide success as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Got it on time, already in use and appears to be working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been usung this oil for four weeks now and am having a big change in my nail. I am expecting my nail to be clear and the toe fungus gone in the next couple of months because of the good results I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Quality Product!! Odor a little strong, but not unexpected.</li>
            <li> I only received the item a few days ago. Will repost my thoughts when I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it for a while. However, the ease of application to my toes and the penetration of the oil is superior so far to anything else I&#x27;ve used. Here&#x27;s to hoping it works as well on my toes!!</li>
            <li> Love this Tea Tree oil. Easy to use dropper. It works great on mosquito bites and also helps with dandruff!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, strong,  concentrate. This is a must for building a healthy, organic, medicine cabinet. The uses are endless! I am impressed with the product and they send a glass eye-dropper. Glass is non pourus (unlike plastic) and can be sterilized.</li>
            <li> We love it. The bottle is HUGE! We have been using the oil in a diffuser and in our sauna. The quality seems to be good so far. We usually make blends for our diffuser or sauna. The Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree blend is quite nice and helps with minor headaches. Once this bottle is empty, we&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I specifically got this tea tree oil as I heard that tea tree oil is great for removing skin tags. As I am aging, I find I am getting more of them. I have so far been able to remove 3 skin tags! It takes time, so you have to be patient, but it works!</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree oil. I placed this oil on some chigger bites I had and it stopped the itching and cleared it up in a few days. Great Purchase!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is a wonder-oil. It is what people call a &amp;#34;Jack of All Trades&amp;#34;. It has multiple uses, including but not limited to: Healing sunburn, treating acne, preventing lice, and treating ringworm (and many other fungal infections). I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I have been using this as a treatment for the lovely sunburn/allergic reaction I get every time I step outside on a sunny, hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most tea tree oil you will find is diluted, with added ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce. aVo, on the other hand, is 100% Tea Tree Oil. While it does not have as harsh of a smell that most tea tree oil has, it is far more potent. I now put it in my shampoo, to prevent dandruff; in my laundry detergent, to prevent mildew; and even in my homemade kitchen cleaners. It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is good qulaity oil, it is much larger than most essential oils, you defnately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.  I am a fan of tea tree oil.  This is good quality. The dropper top is very handy.</li>
            <li> Love this oil...it is real Jack of all tread.</li>
            <li> pleasant smell, seems to work well</li>
            <li> In no way do I believe this is 100% undiluted. I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for 20 years. It&#x27;s smell is off and it doesn&#x27;t work the same. I&#x27;m not happy now I don&#x27;t trust trying to order the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Quality Tea Tree Oil.  I love not only the smell but the size of the bottle and the fact that I have the choice of using the dropper and being able to pour what I need.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is excellent. It has a really high quality, which it&#x27;s 100% pure, natural with pharmaceutical grade.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is a great thing for treating acnes and I always keep one bottle at hand. I also use it as a deterrent for bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree is fantastic. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Had to change from a 4-start to 1 star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent! BUT. It does NOT WORK for nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of continuous use for the nail fungus, the nails instead had turned dark yellow. It was extremely shocking to see such a discoloring and it has been quite concerning that the seller advertises this product specifically for nail fungus treatment when it gave such a horrible side effect. It also did not treat the fungus at all, only made the nail turn into a deep dark yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for dandruff, but it certainly did NOT work for nail fungus at all.</li>
            <li> No better than cheap OTC Tea Tree oil.  Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li> Strong scent but  it is fixing my toenail issue.</li>
            <li> Just received it will use to treat toenail fungus after several weeks will let you know what the results are in the mean time I wil&lt;br /&gt; Give it 4 stars because I like the smell and the hype</li>
            <li> I love that this came with an eye dropper. So many uses.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product arrived extremely well packaged and seems to be working well on nails. It quickly cleared up some poison ivy too!</li>
            <li> tea tree oil is must in my household. I do use it for numerous purposes . I did order this oil through a special deal to try it and share my honest opinion. This oils is pure and of a great quality and highly concentrated so make sure you dilute it in carrier oil. I do use mine inside my kids shampoo and conditioner to avoid lice, which is a big problem here in Hawaii. I also put a few drops in my floor and counter cleaner. When kids have a cold I use my diffuser and it smells great and help with their congestion. this oil is form Australia and I like that! Great buy and I definitely recommend this brand, oh and it comes with a dropper lid! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smelly, but very effective on my toenails.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective it will be  as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days. One downside is you have to go on line to find instructions on dosing as none are included. There is no information packet included, all you get is the product and from what I was able to find out, there are SEVERAL different methods of applying this stuff.  Some call for it to be diluted, some recommend full strength while others suggest mixing it with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was impressed on a free fronts. I was grateful to find a non diluted tea tree oil. The amount of oil you get is a bargain for the price. I needed the oil for some fleas on my carpet. I am sensitive to chemicals. It took care of my problem after a week of treating the carpet. I will definitely buy from this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped nicely and came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> nice size and the quality is good</li>
