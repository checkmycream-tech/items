            <li> the blade is sharp, it just glides right across your face cutting through hair easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d reccommend them for normal skin, heavy beards because of the aforementioned sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They leave a rough shave and are not nearly as sharp as the Israeli made blades..</li>
            <li> As for Personna Red, they seem every bit as sharp</li>
            <li> An article on customshaving.com put Red Personna Platinum on the same “sharpness tier” as Green Gillette 7 o’clock, which always cause me irritation.</li>
            <li> With the same razor I previously performed neck shave on him between his cut and shave .</li>
            <li> It is sharp meets comfort.</li>
            <li> I shave usually twice a week, and I use the same razor about 3 times before discarding.</li>
            <li> I have tried Merker, Gilette, and Personna (American made) and plainly stated these beat them all, the shave is so close!</li>
            <li> Very sharp, just what i need for my beard type.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is tough, so I prefer sharper blades.</li>
            <li> I am going to toss the few remainders of this sample pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors but these give me the least nicks and scratches.</li>
            <li> at least it&#x27;s buying a pseudo-American product.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean they will be yours.  </li>
            <li> That’s not a good sign there.</li>
            <li> I have a thin beard with thick whiskers</li>
            <li> I would have given five stars, but I am not a fan of false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try these as wrong blades were sent.</li>
            <li> Garbage,  these are not personna reds, false advertising,  very unhappy with the transaction. .</li>

            <li> I have tried Merker, Gilette, and Personna (American made) and plainly stated these beat them all, the shave is so close! the blade is sharp, it just glides right across your face cutting through hair easily.  My skin feels great after using these blades, and I have less ingrown hairs when shaving with these.  There&#x27;s no substitute, the only blades I plan on using from here on out</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of double edge razor blades, you probably know these as the legendary Israeli Red Personnas.  Very sharp, very well-made and not prone to drawing blood like some of those ultra-sharp Japanese blades (Feather, I&#x27;m looking at you).  If you can find these at a fair price they&#x27;re very hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, just what i need for my beard type.</li>
            <li> Different razor blades work for different men, so don’t let my review completely dissuade you. My facial hair is tough, so I prefer sharper blades. An article on customshaving.com put Red Personna Platinum on the same “sharpness tier” as Green Gillette 7 o’clock, which always cause me irritation. I used a Red Personna blade (first shave) in a Merkur 37c Slant Razor and found myself tugging and pulling at two and half days of growth. That’s not a good sign there. I hear the Lab Blues are sharper though. I am going to toss the few remainders of this sample pack. Thanks anyway!</li>
            <li> After reading about several brands of razor blades I chose the blades by Persona. They are made in Israel and the workmanship is outstanding and the blades give a very close and comfortable shave. I recommend highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for the last five years. I used to use Feather brand blades, which are super sharp, but the Personna&#x27;s provide a great shave and leave a little more skin on my face.... Outstanding blade for this price range.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite safety razors. I&#x27;ve tried other razors but these give me the least nicks and scratches. yay</li>
            <li> Double-edged razor blades are far better value than the 2, 3 or 5 blade combinations on offer today, but are difficult to find in shops. They do, though, vary in quality. These Personna Israeli Red blades are very good: sharp, straight and smooth. Also cheaper than many of the alternative brands.</li>
            <li> Packaging is from Mexico, blades are from Isreal. It is sharp meets comfort. Most of the time you either get one or the other, this one gives you both.</li>
            <li> NOT Israeli RED Personnas.  I received the BLUE Israeli Personnas in the 10 pack white plastic tucks.  These are great blades however, so i give it four stars.  I would have given five stars, but I am not a fan of false advertising.  When I order Red Israeli Personnas, that is what I want to see when I open the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used razor blades for a bit over a month, but the Personna blades have been very sharp yet reasonably forgiving.  After some practice I tried a feather and when I went for some tricky bits around the chin, the Feather nicks me and the Personna doesn&#x27;t.  Perhaps I need some practice but my impression is that I could go forever using these Personna blades and never need anything else, they work well.</li>
            <li> First off, they came exactly as advertised, so absolutely no qualms with the delivery of product. It is a bit overwhelming to see 100 razors, and for such a cheap price! I shave usually twice a week, and I use the same razor about 3 times before discarding. So, this has the potential to last me around 3 years and all for $20. Mind boggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the quality, they&#x27;re every bit as good as Feather, if not better for my Sensitive Skin. Every time I tried using Feathers, my face was torn to shreads. As for Personna Red, they seem every bit as sharp and I never seem to get any cuts (besides the occasional one here or there). I&#x27;d reccommend them for normal skin, heavy beards because of the aforementioned sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My understanding is that they are made in Israel, America&#x27;s cousin, packaged and assembled in Mexico, all the while a Personna is an American company. I THINK that&#x27;s how it is, so at least it&#x27;s buying a pseudo-American product. I tend to use top of the line products, but I truly believe these are the best blades out there.</li>
            <li> Garbage,  these are not personna reds, false advertising,  very unhappy with the transaction. .</li>
            <li> My husband has no complaints. He bought a razor that these fit in and he now can shave for about a couple of years without spending a ton of money. He does recommend these.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best double edge razor I have ever used. I got a variety pack as a gift, and found these to be the sharpest, but most forgiving blades of the bunch. Each side is good for two shaves, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the right soap, (I recommend Williams Mug) these will take your shaving experience to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades to go along with my first safety razor purchase after doing a lot of research trying to figure out which blades are recommended by vets of wet shaving. I ended up finding great reviews of these blades, specifically when the country of origin is actually Israel. I have been using these blades for several weeks now and have been very pleased with the closeness I am able to achieve during each shave. I also like that each box is slipped on the backing individually so you can remove them as you go and store the rest out of the way. If you receive blades that did not originate in Israel, return them and get ones that did to ensure that you have the best experience possible with these blades.</li>
            <li> Great razors. I like them better than Feather or Wilkinsons.</li>
            <li> I have a thin beard with thick whiskers and I get 5-8 shaves from each blade.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Hopefully they stay consistent, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I did not get Israeli reds as pictured. They where the USA made counter parts. They leave a rough shave and are not nearly as sharp as the Israeli made blades..</li>
            <li> Awesome blades. I&#x27;ve experienced less skin irritation as these blades are much sharper than most others like Merkur or Gillette. These blades have made the switch from Cartridge to DE safety shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> nice smooth shave, blades last over a week.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and performance . Brought the quality of my shaved to a elite level . I performed a full twice over shave on a client who had coarse Hispanic hair. With the same razor I previously performed neck shave on him between his cut and shave .</li>
            <li> There is a difference between the Personna Reds shown in the picture and the Personna Blues that the send you.  The picture is not representative of the product received.</li>
            <li> The add on Amazon listed Israel as Country of origin. The product description listed Israel as Country of origin. I received the blade in a very timely manner via USPS in an envelope containing ten boxes of ten blades and on each box the Country of origin is Mexico. I will be returning these blades.</li>
            <li> These are my favorites and I have tried many.  That doesn&#x27;t mean they will be yours.  Just my options.</li>
            <li> relatively new to the safety razor market but I have used several different blades and without a doubt these are the best I have tried out.</li>
            <li> Good blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great price if these blades work for you. I think I like the US made &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; Personnas a bit better. Personal preference.</li>
            <li> As described. Smooth shave blade.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try these as wrong blades were sent. They were not blades from Isreal but regular personna blades made in U S. Returned item for refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, provide great shave, especially when used in my Gillette Slim.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t beleive how long the 100 pack lasts, these razors are my favorite and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are my go to blades and to find them at such a good price was Awesome.</li>
