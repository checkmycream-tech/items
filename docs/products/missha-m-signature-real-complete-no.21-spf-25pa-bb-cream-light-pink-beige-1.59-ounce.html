            <li>This smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>

            <li>i got this as a sample when i purchased a beauty product and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;the coverage is not bad, and it makes my face look very smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>Very light coverage with a good price range.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally jealous of people who can wear this without breaking out, because it would otherwise be an amazing product for me to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and covers great.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the product i amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked the coverage and texture of the cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of porcelain doll-like, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a blurry look.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best you will find out there.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best BB cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have Student Prime (which is THE BEST EVER) and my product arrived two days later, perfect and ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light too, so</li>
            <li>It is very light so for the summer I will have to find a darker BB CREAM.</li>
            <li>therefore, I am basically satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>it smudged more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s because of this cream.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of different BB creams and this MISSHA product has to be one of the best !  </li>
            <li>It has a gel-like consistency, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or TOO moisturizing like Garnier&#x27;s BB cream (which is actually more of a tinted moisturizer).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I chose it after reading many blog and customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of BB creams and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to layer so many products.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells, it&#x27;s more like a flower scent.</li>
            <li>Despite my best efforts to conserve, I finally ran out of my favorite BB cream, Missha&#x27;s M Signature in 21.</li>
            <li>Imparts a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>and it is getting better.</li>
            <li>The color IS a pretty good match, but I tend to use things that make me look a bit tanner</li>
            <li>Coverage is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Oil control was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesnt have a strong scent so those who are allergic to fragrance will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This BB cream is an excellent, matte cream that doesn&#x27;t look gray and helps brighten and smooth out the skin all day long.  </li>
            <li>The light pink color matches her skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Never seemed to easily wash off, ever.  </li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on how beautiful my skin is, which is a big deal for me as I have always struggled with acne.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your speediness and great service.</li>
            <li>It looks like one of those cheap foundation that looks muddy.  </li>
            <li>I thought this meant that it was oil free.  </li>
            <li>for color, I chose number 23, the darkest shade available for this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Mac NC-30/Estee Lauder Tawny, Smashbox Light or Light-Medium,</li>
            <li>For me, it seemed to stay on the surface of my skin and left a residue that wasn&#x27;t attractive...</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the Misha Signature Real Complete and with the seller delivery.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could find it outside of Korea without using Ebay, so I was happy I decided to check Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not stuffed , easy clean.</li>
            <li>so when I saw the product on Amazon at a much better price, I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four different BB creams and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream SPF25 suits my skin the best.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, gives the fullest coverage out of any other BB I&#x27;ve tried, smells nice (not like sunscreen as many other BB Creams do), doesn&#x27;t make me break out, good-for-your-skin ingredients, and it makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>So, I was kind of ripped off by Seoul Glamour, as I could have paid the SAME amount for more product.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to get it and try it out asap.</li>
            <li>Formula blended into my skin immediately without having a gray appearance, and helped make my skin look brighter, smoother, matte, and generally flawless in general without it being obvious I was wearing anything.  </li>
            <li>Amazing coverage that looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>I got this bb cream for my 14 year old daughter and she&#x27;s been loving it.</li>
            <li>This cc cream makes my face immediately good color, brighter and look much younger.</li>
            <li>Bought this straight from Missha website to make sure</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great makeup</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this BB Cream!</li>
            <li>By the way, the shipping was quick~ expecting it take more than 2 weeks since they ship directly from Korea</li>
            <li>My blemishes were covered and the look of my large pores were diminished and my skin had a smooth, dewy finish.</li>
            <li>but it left my skin looking nice and even.  </li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>But overall it is a great bb cream that is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash it off clean, or else there&#x27;s possibility for pimples the next day.  </li>
            <li>First off, VERY FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>It would seem I guessed at the right color.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to have a more skin friendly formulation compared to perfect cover but as far as my experience is, it has done more harm and is really a big disappointment.    </li>
            <li>it also left my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>me break out horrifically in deep cystic acne, causing more hyper-pigmentation and a trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I really love the coverage of this makeup, for asian skin</li>
            <li>The BB cream authentic Korean, big bottle,</li>
            <li>I like the sent it has when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin, gives light coverage over blemishes and dark spots, and doesn&#x27;t get greasy by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; but still have combo skin.</li>
            <li>and my face is clear and most importantly, not dry.</li>
            <li>The coverage looks very natural, and balances my oily skin a lot better than similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Good for a little girl who begins to be conscious about her apparence.</li>
            <li>The shipping is much faster than it is told in email.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t budge either, which I like, and my skin stayed smooth and matte the entire day when I wore this.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I got the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li>so much cheaper than buying this cream from the Misha store.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s pink based.  </li>
            <li>O&#x27;Loreal foundations came close, but this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>It is really working well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much too think for my liking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s light, blends well with my super pale face, and lasts all day long without getting oily.</li>
            <li>back.i docked it down two starts even though it does indeed make my skin feel soft and flawless, but i noticed that it dried out my skin at some areas, and skin started peeling off.</li>
            <li>This product was one of my first BB creams, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy--and how fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some complaints this formula can be too drying, but I found it to be more matte than drying, and I naturally have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Apply a little dab over large pores, smooth over, and your pores disappear !  </li>
            <li>I will probably keep buying this bb cream as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>use this daily, and the bottle I bought 3 months ago still seems maybe 1/3 - 1/4 full.  </li>
            <li>As long as your skin is clean and moisturized, MISSHA BB cream will work wonders for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It really did replace my moisturizer, primer, and foundation, provides SPF, reduces fine lines, and lightens dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair to light complexion, the only down point for this bb cream is that No.21 is still a little bit darker than my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I recently started wearing BB cream on a daily basis but the one that I was using, while okay, was too old</li>
            <li>I tried the new one as soon as I got it since I had doubts of its authenticity for the price they sold it at.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is a screw of and every time I take of the clear cap, the screw top comes loose.</li>
            <li>It has sheer to medium coverage which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>A very thin layer provides great coverage, so this (rather large) tube will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very cute, my last bottle last for around half a year?</li>
            <li>It is not dry, and covers the spots very well.  </li>
            <li>All of the bb creams I&#x27;ve tried are too dark, and too yellow, but this color suited my light complexion very well.</li>
            <li>This one is little bit light.  </li>
            <li>The color on the profile in Amazon is spot on and I had no trouble with conflict of color.  </li>
            <li>Seller delivered very expeditiously and I would definitely place another</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone very well, but if I have any blemishes, I need to use concealer (or an extra dot of the bb cream) over them.</li>
            <li>This product does the trick with no &#x27;heavy makeup&#x27; side effects—feels and looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical buying a foundation type product online, but I really love this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use foundation, this one included, mostly under my eyes, to hide the dark rings I seem to have been born with, and on my nose, which is chronically pink.</li>
            <li>Have tried other BB creams, and this one got it right.</li>
            <li>Comes in a tube and easy to dispense, and you&#x27;ll only need a small dot on your forehead, cheeks, and chin for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only new product I had been using at that time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually the lightest, or second lightest in most foundation color ranges, and I don&#x27;t have yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li>The least I could do is warn anyone that wants to get it through the MISSHA seller that it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The same seller offers 45 g for the same price on another listing.  </li>
            <li>This bb cream does not have a heavy fragrance like the other Missha bb cream and the texture is light.</li>
            <li>This BB creams gives me nearly eight hours of wear with minor blotting/powder touch-ups.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I used too much and didn&#x27;t use enough moisturizer, so it looked a little cakey and my face felt tight in spots.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> for color, I chose number 23, the darkest shade available for this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Mac NC-30/Estee Lauder Tawny, Smashbox Light or Light-Medium,</li>
            <li> For me, it seemed to stay on the surface of my skin and left a residue that wasn&#x27;t attractive...</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the Misha Signature Real Complete and with the seller delivery.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could find it outside of Korea without using Ebay, so I was happy I decided to check Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not stuffed , easy clean.</li>
            <li> so when I saw the product on Amazon at a much better price, I bought it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four different BB creams and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream SPF25 suits my skin the best.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, gives the fullest coverage out of any other BB I&#x27;ve tried, smells nice (not like sunscreen as many other BB Creams do), doesn&#x27;t make me break out, good-for-your-skin ingredients, and it makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> So, I was kind of ripped off by Seoul Glamour, as I could have paid the SAME amount for more product.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to get it and try it out asap.</li>
            <li> Formula blended into my skin immediately without having a gray appearance, and helped make my skin look brighter, smoother, matte, and generally flawless in general without it being obvious I was wearing anything.  </li>
            <li> Amazing coverage that looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> I got this bb cream for my 14 year old daughter and she&#x27;s been loving it.</li>
            <li> This cc cream makes my face immediately good color, brighter and look much younger.</li>
            <li> Bought this straight from Missha website to make sure</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great makeup</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> By the way, the shipping was quick~ expecting it take more than 2 weeks since they ship directly from Korea</li>
            <li> My blemishes were covered and the look of my large pores were diminished and my skin had a smooth, dewy finish.</li>
            <li> but it left my skin looking nice and even.  </li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> But overall it is a great bb cream that is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash it off clean, or else there&#x27;s possibility for pimples the next day.  </li>
            <li> First off, VERY FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> It would seem I guessed at the right color.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to have a more skin friendly formulation compared to perfect cover but as far as my experience is, it has done more harm and is really a big disappointment.    </li>
            <li> it also left my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> me break out horrifically in deep cystic acne, causing more hyper-pigmentation and a trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I really love the coverage of this makeup, for asian skin</li>
            <li> The BB cream authentic Korean, big bottle,</li>
            <li> I like the sent it has when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on the skin, gives light coverage over blemishes and dark spots, and doesn&#x27;t get greasy by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; but still have combo skin.</li>
            <li> and my face is clear and most importantly, not dry.</li>
            <li> The coverage looks very natural, and balances my oily skin a lot better than similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Good for a little girl who begins to be conscious about her apparence.</li>
            <li> The shipping is much faster than it is told in email.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t budge either, which I like, and my skin stayed smooth and matte the entire day when I wore this.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I got the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than buying this cream from the Misha store.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s pink based.  </li>
            <li> O&#x27;Loreal foundations came close, but this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> It is really working well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much too think for my liking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s light, blends well with my super pale face, and lasts all day long without getting oily.</li>
            <li> back.i docked it down two starts even though it does indeed make my skin feel soft and flawless, but i noticed that it dried out my skin at some areas, and skin started peeling off.</li>
            <li> This product was one of my first BB creams, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy--and how fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some complaints this formula can be too drying, but I found it to be more matte than drying, and I naturally have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Apply a little dab over large pores, smooth over, and your pores disappear !  </li>
            <li> I will probably keep buying this bb cream as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> use this daily, and the bottle I bought 3 months ago still seems maybe 1/3 - 1/4 full.  </li>
            <li> As long as your skin is clean and moisturized, MISSHA BB cream will work wonders for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It really did replace my moisturizer, primer, and foundation, provides SPF, reduces fine lines, and lightens dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have a fair to light complexion, the only down point for this bb cream is that No.21 is still a little bit darker than my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing BB cream on a daily basis but the one that I was using, while okay, was too old</li>
            <li> I tried the new one as soon as I got it since I had doubts of its authenticity for the price they sold it at.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is a screw of and every time I take of the clear cap, the screw top comes loose.</li>
            <li> It has sheer to medium coverage which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> A very thin layer provides great coverage, so this (rather large) tube will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very cute, my last bottle last for around half a year?</li>
            <li> It is not dry, and covers the spots very well.  </li>
            <li> All of the bb creams I&#x27;ve tried are too dark, and too yellow, but this color suited my light complexion very well.</li>
            <li> This one is little bit light.  </li>
            <li> The color on the profile in Amazon is spot on and I had no trouble with conflict of color.  </li>
            <li> Seller delivered very expeditiously and I would definitely place another</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone very well, but if I have any blemishes, I need to use concealer (or an extra dot of the bb cream) over them.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick with no &#x27;heavy makeup&#x27; side effects—feels and looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical buying a foundation type product online, but I really love this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use foundation, this one included, mostly under my eyes, to hide the dark rings I seem to have been born with, and on my nose, which is chronically pink.</li>
            <li> Have tried other BB creams, and this one got it right.</li>
            <li> Comes in a tube and easy to dispense, and you&#x27;ll only need a small dot on your forehead, cheeks, and chin for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only new product I had been using at that time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the lightest, or second lightest in most foundation color ranges, and I don&#x27;t have yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li> The least I could do is warn anyone that wants to get it through the MISSHA seller that it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li> The same seller offers 45 g for the same price on another listing.  </li>
            <li> This bb cream does not have a heavy fragrance like the other Missha bb cream and the texture is light.</li>
            <li> This BB creams gives me nearly eight hours of wear with minor blotting/powder touch-ups.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I used too much and didn&#x27;t use enough moisturizer, so it looked a little cakey and my face felt tight in spots.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it, it was smudgy and left my skin so dry that it looked cracked and scaly.</li>
            <li> I still wear a little powder with it, since I have very oily skin, and it does settle slightly into pores after several hours of wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It covers well, but not completely.</li>
            <li> and I mean REALLY.</li>
            <li> The second time I applied it, I moisturized the spots that had felt tight the first time, used a little primer, and considerably less of the BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I use this BB cream daily over my other sunscreen and under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this product written up in a magazine as a \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot;, but interested enough to try it.  </li>
            <li> The US BB creams did little for me; not enough coverage and still looked unnatural.</li>
            <li> , BE CAREFUL when purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> purchased the cream through Pink Gelee.  </li>
            <li> I still need concealer due to hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit dry on me</li>
            <li> A little dab is enough to cover blemishes but does not have a heavy make up look.</li>
            <li> I wore it this weekend and had minor breaking out, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s coincidental or due to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really hard to tell how much is left in there.  </li>
            <li> , it was too dark.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why i had this strange reaction to this product when everyone else had no problem.</li>
            <li> When I applied it, it did look dark going on, but blended into my skin within a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thick, but not too heavy (I hate feeling like I&#x27;m wearing layers of face paint).&lt;br /&gt;Totally evens out the complexion and covers most of my dark hyper-pigmentation spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided not to bother with return since the cost of shipping would already be half the price of the product.</li>
            <li> The tone is a little off for my skin—more beige while I&#x27;m quite pale—but that doesn&#x27;t seem to show up once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this in the mail, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> - literally melts and gets messy by midday even with blotting papers.</li>
            <li> (even redness from inflamed hormonal acne) without looking caked on or heavy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin slightly pale.  </li>
            <li> thing is that it is a bit hard to apply on after you shower; its actually really hard to blend in if your hands are wet or if your face still has some driplets of water while applying on the bb</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> and I was feeling icky about putting it on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use at all</li>
            <li> No refund and not able to do anything with except put in garbage.....</li>
            <li> Very heavy and does not stay on skin</li>
            <li> However it was hard for me to pick the shade, and in the end</li>
            <li> The plastic is thick, and hard</li>
            <li> So... for me at least, it MAY not be non-comedogenic.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be too dark for me, because I am always the Ivory 001 shade of foundation.  </li>
            <li> it is very hard to wash off with just water</li>
            <li> but it was still scaly and worse</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it on a daily base.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the store price, I knew the risk of it being fake.</li>
            <li> :  Sadly I had to change my star rating.  </li>
            <li> and I can not get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Nasty odor - must be expired or bad.....</li>
            <li> I was stupid and ordered this instead.</li>
            <li> I often avoid wearing foundation because I hate how I can feel it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product has a very nasty odor to it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I got this bb cream for my 14 year old daughter and she&#x27;s been loving it. The light pink color matches her skin tone perfectly. She uses it for sun protection and to cover her occasional blemishes. This bb cream does not have a heavy fragrance like the other Missha bb cream and the texture is light. A little dab is enough to cover blemishes but does not have a heavy make up look. Good for a little girl who begins to be conscious about her apparence.</li>
            <li> I want to give a try to BB cream so that I bought this one.  I have used it for one month. It is a little bit dry on me but the it basically can last for 8 hours office time. therefore, I am basically satisfied with this product.This one is little bit light.  The shipping is much faster than it is told in email.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this signature bb cream to anyone. Perfect cover is much better than this, I had ordered Missha perfect cover no.23 and it didn&#x27;t match my skin color, it was too dark. So i went on, browsed and found good comments on this product. I was stupid and ordered this instead. It was ashy and didn&#x27;t have a pinkish effect on my skin. When I applied it, it was smudgy and left my skin so dry that it looked cracked and scaly. I even tried putting on moisturizers and primer before application but it was still scaly and worse it smudged more. It looks like one of those cheap foundation that looks muddy.  After 4 days of using it, my skin started breaking out and I mean REALLY. They were not tiny but big, red achy pimples. I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s because of this cream. It&#x27;s the only new product I had been using at that time and I never had any problems with pimples. I stopped using this cream and my pimples are gone. I am not sure why i had this strange reaction to this product when everyone else had no problem. This product seems to have a more skin friendly formulation compared to perfect cover but as far as my experience is, it has done more harm and is really a big disappointment.    By the way, the shipping was quick~ expecting it take more than 2 weeks since they ship directly from Korea but it took them 8 days, thumbs up for seoulglamour.</li>
            <li> i got this as a sample when i purchased a beauty product and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;the coverage is not bad, and it makes my face look very smooth and flawless. it also left my face feeling very smooth. i absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt have a strong scent so those who are allergic to fragrance will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing i dislike about it is that it is overly water proof. it is very hard to wash off with just water alone.i also remember trying to use soap to wash my face, but when i applied my toner afterward, there were still bb cream remains.&lt;br /&gt;another thing is that it is a bit hard to apply on after you shower; its actually really hard to blend in if your hands are wet or if your face still has some driplets of water while applying on the bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: i take some of my words back.i docked it down two starts even though it does indeed make my skin feel soft and flawless, but i noticed that it dried out my skin at some areas, and skin started peeling off. :/ i tried putting on lotion and then putting on the bb cream but it just does not blend, leaving a splotch on your skin. it would probably be best if i put lotion after i put on the bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this product written up in a magazine as a \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot;, but interested enough to try it.  I was amazed when I did.  It really did replace my moisturizer, primer, and foundation, provides SPF, reduces fine lines, and lightens dark spots.  I was afraid it would be too dark for me, because I am always the Ivory 001 shade of foundation.  When I applied it, it did look dark going on, but blended into my skin within a couple of minutes.  I still wear a little powder with it, since I have very oily skin, and it does settle slightly into pores after several hours of wear.  Nothing is perfect, but this is the closest I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different BB creams and this MISSHA product has to be one of the best !  As long as your skin is clean and moisturized, MISSHA BB cream will work wonders for your skin.  Pick the right color and your skin will look flawless.  It even has what I call a \\&quot;rolling ball\\&quot; effect.  Apply a little dab over large pores, smooth over, and your pores disappear !  It&#x27;s light on the skin, gives light coverage over blemishes and dark spots, and doesn&#x27;t get greasy by the end of the night.  Just make sure to wash it off clean, or else there&#x27;s possibility for pimples the next day.  This is really a good BB cream to start off with if you&#x27;ve never tried BB cream before.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker !!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product, and with the quickness of the shipping. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until the end of May at the earliest and it arrived Mid-May, along with 4 samples. Thanks so much for your speediness and great service. I WILL be ordering from you again!</li>
            <li> This is just want I ordered and wanted.Good price and good quality. Fast delivery. I would definitely recommend to everyone this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller size at the actual store a while back. I really liked the coverage and texture of the cream so when I saw the product on Amazon at a much better price, I bought it right away. I tried the new one as soon as I got it since I had doubts of its authenticity for the price they sold it at. At a fraction of the store price, I knew the risk of it being fake. And IT IS. The color and the texture is very different from the one I bought at the store. Obviously, I bought the same color and line to compare (I know they have multiple lines of BB cream). I decided not to bother with return since the cost of shipping would already be half the price of the product. Total hassle. The least I could do is warn anyone that wants to get it through the MISSHA seller that it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product was one of my first BB creams, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy--and how fast--it made my skin look flawless.  Comes in a tube and easy to dispense, and you&#x27;ll only need a small dot on your forehead, cheeks, and chin for complete coverage.  It has a gel-like consistency, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or TOO moisturizing like Garnier&#x27;s BB cream (which is actually more of a tinted moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some complaints this formula can be too drying, but I found it to be more matte than drying, and I naturally have dry skin.  Formula blended into my skin immediately without having a gray appearance, and helped make my skin look brighter, smoother, matte, and generally flawless in general without it being obvious I was wearing anything.  It&#x27;s also very light too, so it doesn&#x27;t FEEL like you&#x27;re wearing it, which I like.  I often avoid wearing foundation because I hate how I can feel it on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t budge either, which I like, and my skin stayed smooth and matte the entire day when I wore this.  I did add a tiny bit of finishing powder to hold the cream in place, but otherwise did not use anything on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, bottom line: This BB cream is an excellent, matte cream that doesn&#x27;t look gray and helps brighten and smooth out the skin all day long.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a Korean BB cream and settled on this one because it&#x27;s supposed to be non-comedogenic.  I looked on the Missha site and saw that it had no mineral oil.  I thought this meant that it was oil free.  It&#x27;s not.  So... for me at least, it MAY not be non-comedogenic.  I wore it this weekend and had minor breaking out, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s coincidental or due to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for color, I chose number 23, the darkest shade available for this product.  It leaves my skin slightly pale.  The color IS a pretty good match, but I tend to use things that make me look a bit tanner so I&#x27;m just not used to the whitened look...  It&#x27;s kind of porcelain doll-like, if that makes sense.  It&#x27;s a match...but the effect is different than what I&#x27;m used to from American beauty products.  I&#x27;m a Mac NC-30/Estee Lauder Tawny, Smashbox Light or Light-Medium, depending on the product.  It works, though.  So I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m just about the darkest skin tone that can get away with number 23.  If you&#x27;re any darker than me, this won&#x27;t work.  Coverage is pretty good.  I still need concealer due to hyperpigmentation.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it left my skin looking nice and even.  Oil control was pretty good.  I topped with powder, which I always do.  The product lasted all day,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, BE CAREFUL when purchasing this.  I thought I was getting 45 g but when I chose a seller I didn&#x27;t realize that the size was only 20 g.  The same seller offers 45 g for the same price on another listing.  So, I was kind of ripped off by Seoul Glamour, as I could have paid the SAME amount for more product.  My fault though for not looking closely enough at the listing.  I thought all Seoul Glamour listings for the same price point were the same size.  ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Sadly I had to change my star rating.  This breaks me out.</li>
            <li> fast delivery. great product like! thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect color, beautiful packaging. The coverage is unreal, and I have red and patchy skin. Have tried other BB creams, and this one got it right.</li>
            <li> I will order more. it matches nicely with my skin tone (I have a cold tint to my skin color)</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  For me, it seemed to stay on the surface of my skin and left a residue that wasn&#x27;t attractive...Kind of a blurry look.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of BB Creams. Maybelline, Garnier, Loreal, Dr. Jart+, Marcelle... Everything! This is by far the best you will find out there. You can&#x27;t beat the price, gives the fullest coverage out of any other BB I&#x27;ve tried, smells nice (not like sunscreen as many other BB Creams do), doesn&#x27;t make me break out, good-for-your-skin ingredients, and it makes my skin look flawless. Anytime I&#x27;m using this BB Cream I get tons of compliments on how beautiful my skin is, which is a big deal for me as I have always struggled with acne. Would never dream of switching from this BB Cream; it has changed my beauty routine and boosted my confidence!</li>
            <li> This cc cream makes my face immediately good color, brighter and look much younger. And the product quickly to very good!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this cream.  It does a great job on my skin.  It would seem I guessed at the right color.  I have been using this instead of make up.  I don&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; up as I do using a foundation, concealer, powder, etc.</li>
            <li> Bought this straight from Missha website to make sure I got the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  Use a good brush to apply this foundation!  I used Tarte&#x27;s airbrush finish brush.  Worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thick, but not too heavy (I hate feeling like I&#x27;m wearing layers of face paint).&lt;br /&gt;Totally evens out the complexion and covers most of my dark hyper-pigmentation spots.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Never seemed to easily wash off, ever.  Even getting it off my hands was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Made me break out horrifically in deep cystic acne, causing more hyper-pigmentation and a trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally jealous of people who can wear this without breaking out, because it would otherwise be an amazing product for me to use.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but that&#x27;s about it. Very heavy and does not stay on skin - literally melts and gets messy by midday even with blotting papers.</li>
            <li> I use this BB cream daily over my other sunscreen and under my foundation.  It goes on smooth and covers great.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried and I chose it after reading many blog and customer reviews.  The first time I applied it, I used too much and didn&#x27;t use enough moisturizer, so it looked a little cakey and my face felt tight in spots.  The second time I applied it, I moisturized the spots that had felt tight the first time, used a little primer, and considerably less of the BB cream.  MUCH better results!  My blemishes were covered and the look of my large pores were diminished and my skin had a smooth, dewy finish. I set it with B.E. mineral veil and it lasted 8+ hours with no touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the cream through Pink Gelee.  They shipped out the item promptly and you can track the USPS package through the Amazon site. Took about 5 business days to get from the store (Southern Cali.) to me (North Cali.).  I will be buying future bottles of the BB cream from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four different BB creams and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream SPF25 suits my skin the best. I&#x27;m \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; but still have combo skin. This BB creams gives me nearly eight hours of wear with minor blotting/powder touch-ups. The colour #21 is perfect for my MAC NW20 complexion. I love the ease of BB creams and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to layer so many products. For the price, this is very good value. I will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells, it&#x27;s more like a flower scent. It has sheer to medium coverage which is exactly what I want. I have a fair to light complexion, the only down point for this bb cream is that No.21 is still a little bit darker than my skin tone. But overall it is a great bb cream that is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing BB cream on a daily basis but the one that I was using, while okay, was too old and I was feeling icky about putting it on my face everyday. So I read some reviews of BB creams and decided to go with this one as it had a lot of good feedback. First off, VERY FAST shipping! I was super excited to get it and try it out asap. And I love it!! It has great coverage. My cheeks are a bit red as well as some areas of my nose and after I put a pea size amount on with a foundation brush, the redness is gone and my face is clear and most importantly, not dry. The coverage on this is amazing and from the reviews I read, it&#x27;s known for its great coverage quality. Do not hesistate to buy this. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I really love the coverage of this makeup, for asian skin it&#x27;s perfect. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it either. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is a screw of and every time I take of the clear cap, the screw top comes loose. Other than that its a great makeup and I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the Misha Signature Real Complete and with the seller delivery. The BB cream authentic Korean, big bottle, so much cheaper than buying this cream from the Misha store. The quality of the product i amazing. However it was hard for me to pick the shade, and in the end it shade No 21 was a bit lighter than my skin tone ( I am in Mac NW20 skin tone). So now I am ordering the same cream but in shade No 23. Hopefully it will work perfect with my skin tone. Recommend this product everyone</li>
            <li> This is by far the best BB cream I have ever used.  Its consistency is light, yet the coverage is superb!!!!!  The color on the profile in Amazon is spot on and I had no trouble with conflict of color.  Seller delivered very expeditiously and I would definitely place another order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical buying a foundation type product online, but I really love this one.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s pink based.  All of the bb creams I&#x27;ve tried are too dark, and too yellow, but this color suited my light complexion very well. I&#x27;m usually the lightest, or second lightest in most foundation color ranges, and I don&#x27;t have yellow undertones.  This is also the only bb cream I&#x27;ve seen that isn&#x27;t made with sulfates, and parabens.&lt;br /&gt;It covers well, but not completely. It evens out my skin tone very well, but if I have any blemishes, I need to use concealer (or an extra dot of the bb cream) over them. The coverage looks very natural, and balances my oily skin a lot better than similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  I apply it over a moisturizer, and that makes blending it a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, and the bottle I bought 3 months ago still seems maybe 1/3 - 1/4 full.  The plastic is thick, and hard so it&#x27;s really hard to tell how much is left in there.  I&#x27;m purchasing a second bottle now just in case.  I will probably keep buying this bb cream as long as it&#x27;s available.  $20 for 4 months of coverage is a steal compared to the stuff I used to buy from Sephora.</li>
            <li> It covers my freckles. It is very light so for the summer I will have to find a darker BB CREAM. I like the sent it has when you first put it on. The scent does fade away. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Despite my best efforts to conserve, I finally ran out of my favorite BB cream, Missha&#x27;s M Signature in 21. It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s light, blends well with my super pale face, and lasts all day long without getting oily. I didn&#x27;t think I could find it outside of Korea without using Ebay, so I was happy I decided to check Amazon. I have Student Prime (which is THE BEST EVER) and my product arrived two days later, perfect and ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> This product has a very nasty odor to it! I was not able to use at all and I can not get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Nasty odor - must be expired or bad..... No refund and not able to do anything with except put in garbage.....</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. It can cover the spot and make the face whitened. Not stuffed , easy clean.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage that looks and feels natural. Covers up imperfections (even redness from inflamed hormonal acne) without looking caked on or heavy. Imparts a healthy glow. Great price. No mineral oil (compared to the regular Missha M BB cream people fawn over). What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I have been using Missha BB cream and had no problem. Since I ran out of mine that I bought in Japan, I ordered one from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this product, my face is breaking out! I stopped using it for 3 days now and it is getting better.</li>
            <li> ...and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for in every foundation/concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried. O&#x27;Loreal foundations came close, but this is the real thing. The tone is a little off for my skin—more beige while I&#x27;m quite pale—but that doesn&#x27;t seem to show up once it&#x27;s on. A very thin layer provides great coverage, so this (rather large) tube will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use foundation, this one included, mostly under my eyes, to hide the dark rings I seem to have been born with, and on my nose, which is chronically pink. The US BB creams did little for me; not enough coverage and still looked unnatural. This product does the trick with no &#x27;heavy makeup&#x27; side effects—feels and looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is really working well on my skin.  It helps my skin look good and glow.  Very light coverage with a good price range.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of Missha BB Cream, I like it a lot. It is not dry, and covers the spots very well.  The bottle is also very cute, my last bottle last for around half a year? But I don&#x27;t use it on a daily base.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this in the mail, but was sadly disappointed. It&#x27;s much too think for my liking and I feel like I have a mask on.</li>
