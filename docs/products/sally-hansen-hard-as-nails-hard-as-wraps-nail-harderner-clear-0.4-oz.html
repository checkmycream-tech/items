            <li>My girlfriend loves it as a top coat as well its very strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li>Top Coat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t sit around for 30 minutes without touching something.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the color I used, but since its not chipped, I dont want to remove it, so make sure you like your color before applying this amazing topcoat!!!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x60;t looking for a top coat, just a nail hardener.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot , it make my nails look better and also stronger .</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>I use it to strengthen my nails because they crack after playing many years of sports.</li>
            <li>Not at all what I was hoping it would be but works okay for what it says.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I always enjoyed Sally Hansen products because they work so well.  </li>
            <li>I love to do my nails.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Nothing else has worked alone, or in combination better.</li>
            <li>Either way, there are cracks in the top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>this is good stuff here,i use it right after my nail  apts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for a strengthener/protectant...</li>
            <li>My paint tends to chip easily</li>
            <li>I now use this for two coats and then finish with a seche vite fast drying top coat and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>ive been using this polish for about two months and from day one I could tell how strong it makes my nails.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for about 2 weeks and my nails have grown and are strong.  </li>
            <li>Its appearance is fine on the nails.</li>
            <li>It goes on really easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>they had paint on) and it dried very quickly and it just feels awesome.</li>
            <li>Costs a bit more, and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I went out and bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>I take off my color nail polish and clean up my nails.</li>
            <li>like wearing colorful nail polish, but even the best of brands chips after a few days.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be even more durable than it is -- it&#x27;s a &#x27;good&#x27; product, just not as super-duper, indestructible as I expected.</li>
            <li>Even with the best clear top coats, they STILL chip after a few days.</li>
            <li>This top coat really stays on.</li>
            <li>I use it alone when I am between giving myself full color manicures.</li>
            <li>is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I finish up with Seche Vite top coat, which hardens and quickly dries the whole manicure.  </li>
            <li>Super sparkly and shiny.</li>
            <li>Its not a huge deal for me since i use the essie good to go to top it all</li>
            <li>I do my own French Manicures on my real nails and this is my top coat.</li>
            <li>But with the quick dry, its good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing a new one once the bottle is done and for the price i couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li>And after opening it, I immediately put a coat on top of my new manicured acrylics(yes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip and it really strengthens your nails!!</li>
            <li>It bonded to my nails like super glue and when it began to crack and peel, my nails cracked and peeled right off with the polish.</li>
            <li>My nails rarely chip using this product.</li>
            <li>I have a dollar store clear top coat that lasts longer than this thing did.</li>
            <li>And I just wanted to try it, to see what the fuss was about and see if it was actually worth the money.</li>
            <li>I found it peeled very easily and quickly for it being similar to a nail wrap.</li>
            <li>seemed the right move.</li>
            <li>and when I stopped them, my nails were very soft and ripped easily.  </li>
            <li>Just realize you can not out on too many coats or it takes a full day to dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product very much.</li>
            <li>i wanted to make sure that i added an extra  front line of defense.</li>
            <li>I bought it at CVS for double the AMAZON PRICE, since I love this product i decided to write a review and buy it also from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is a little strong and pulls the top of my nail off when removed.  </li>
            <li>My nails are brittle and break all the time, I have been using acrylic nails for over 14 years off and on, they have ruined my natural nails so much, my nails do not grow since they break easily.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use a quick-dry top coat on top of Hard</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, especially because I&#x27;ve been trying to stop biting my nails and need something to strengthen them up.</li>
            <li>This works great for my nails that are pretty thin to begin with.  </li>
            <li>and I can do it in the comfort of my own home in half an hour.</li>
            <li>I use a 100% pure acetone tub.</li>
            <li>My nails feel much stronger and have quit breaking.</li>
            <li>really, warning, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Nails are very shiny with it on.</li>
            <li>WHat can anyone really say about a polish type nail hardner?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it really does harden like they describe it.</li>
            <li>or maybe I wash my hands too much.</li>
            <li>Drys up fast though</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that actually works on my natural nail to keep from flaking and breaking.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product, when i did was not satissfied it chipped off on the second day.</li>
            <li>There are other products by this brand that are a better choice.</li>
            <li>To me it works just like any other top coat.</li>
            <li>I usually do 2 decent coats of it on my nails and it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves your nails nice and hard.  </li>
            <li>This top coat doesn&#x27;t wear down with all of the soaps and antibacterial!</li>
            <li>This comes in many different colors, but I use the clear because I don&#x27;t like drawing extra attention to my nails.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product but not a great to me as others thought.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good just not great.  </li>
            <li>Without this product I was breaking nails right and left.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m doing instead is painting my nails the color I want, letting the color dry really well, painting on the clear Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps, and then following up about a minute later with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Strength / Diamond Flash (best quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li>My nails are usually brittle but with this thing they look healthy and feel protected.</li>
            <li>I usually give myself a day or two of nothing whatsoever on my nails to keep them healthy and allow them to &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>thought it was going to be better than the usual</li>
            <li>When it starts to get chippy and peel off is when I finally take it off with nail polish remover and then give myself one day to let my nails &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34; again and then go back to doing a full color manicure on myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of tough to remove with nail polish remover, too...</li>
            <li>After reading previous reviews, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t clear when you look at it</li>
            <li>but when you apply it it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Then I use this polish as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>After all the filing, soaking, moisturing, and dealing w/ cuticles I polish with a clear polish.</li>
            <li>and so far I have seen no improvement.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have too much bubbling; only on my pinky</li>
            <li>My nails are natural so they split &amp; crack.  </li>
            <li>When I have finished my manicure its just like I have been to the salon to have it done except far cheaper</li>
            <li>This product is perfect as a base coat to help strengthen nails or alone to help your nails look manicured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But even as a clear top coat, it is not good at all.</li>
            <li>For a long time and after spending money on trying other top coats, I finally found one that works.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for a similar style of acrylic gel polish.</li>
            <li>No base coat, no color and no top coat.</li>
            <li>I have long nails and since there real i need to take care of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative thing is you need a fast drying top coat since this takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li>Also useful to protect other things, such as my dog&#x27;s ID tags.</li>
            <li>Only thing I do not like about the product is it takes a pretty long time to dry completely.</li>
            <li>When used as a base coat, it causes the top colour to lift off quite easily.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d tried this product so buying it on here for less than instore</li>
            <li>So I end up layering on the polish like every other day until there&#x27;s too much build up.</li>
            <li>Not hard,soft,does not work; Sally Hansen advertises this,and other super-nail hardeners, and treatments, and the company often does not honestly represent their product(s)to the public.this price,for this,is very high only because of the huge media-blitz costs.</li>
            <li>Hard As Wraps isn&#x27;t cheap - I get it on sale at my local drugstore, CVS, or Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly work as described and a little pricey since it doesn&#x27;t deliver on it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>This clear polish is my god sent to keeping my nails long and in one piece.</li>
            <li>Over the days it had been through showers, several sinks full of dishes, baths for the kids, 2 kickboxing classes wearing boxing gloves (that usually results in chips and/or breaks)and other day to day stuff, I really put it through its paces.  </li>
            <li>I used this Hard as Nails, Hard as Wraps and there is no difference between this one and a regular clear top coat nail polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks I see healthy nail growing from the cuticles, but the upper part of each nail bed is dried and cracked where the \\&quot;Hard as Wraps\\&quot; was painted on, and I know it will continue to peel off until it grows</li>

            <li> Even with the best clear top coats, they STILL chip after a few days.</li>
            <li> This top coat really stays on.</li>
            <li> I use it alone when I am between giving myself full color manicures.</li>
            <li> is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I finish up with Seche Vite top coat, which hardens and quickly dries the whole manicure.  </li>
            <li> Super sparkly and shiny.</li>
            <li> Its not a huge deal for me since i use the essie good to go to top it all</li>
            <li> I do my own French Manicures on my real nails and this is my top coat.</li>
            <li> But with the quick dry, its good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be purchasing a new one once the bottle is done and for the price i couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> And after opening it, I immediately put a coat on top of my new manicured acrylics(yes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip and it really strengthens your nails!!</li>
            <li> It bonded to my nails like super glue and when it began to crack and peel, my nails cracked and peeled right off with the polish.</li>
            <li> My nails rarely chip using this product.</li>
            <li> I have a dollar store clear top coat that lasts longer than this thing did.</li>
            <li> And I just wanted to try it, to see what the fuss was about and see if it was actually worth the money.</li>
            <li> I found it peeled very easily and quickly for it being similar to a nail wrap.</li>
            <li> seemed the right move.</li>
            <li> and when I stopped them, my nails were very soft and ripped easily.  </li>
            <li> Just realize you can not out on too many coats or it takes a full day to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product very much.</li>
            <li> i wanted to make sure that i added an extra  front line of defense.</li>
            <li> I bought it at CVS for double the AMAZON PRICE, since I love this product i decided to write a review and buy it also from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is a little strong and pulls the top of my nail off when removed.  </li>
            <li> My nails are brittle and break all the time, I have been using acrylic nails for over 14 years off and on, they have ruined my natural nails so much, my nails do not grow since they break easily.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a quick-dry top coat on top of Hard</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, especially because I&#x27;ve been trying to stop biting my nails and need something to strengthen them up.</li>
            <li> This works great for my nails that are pretty thin to begin with.  </li>
            <li> and I can do it in the comfort of my own home in half an hour.</li>
            <li> I use a 100% pure acetone tub.</li>
            <li> My nails feel much stronger and have quit breaking.</li>
            <li> really, warning, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> Nails are very shiny with it on.</li>
            <li> WHat can anyone really say about a polish type nail hardner?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it really does harden like they describe it.</li>
            <li> or maybe I wash my hands too much.</li>
            <li> Drys up fast though</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that actually works on my natural nail to keep from flaking and breaking.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, when i did was not satissfied it chipped off on the second day.</li>
            <li> There are other products by this brand that are a better choice.</li>
            <li> To me it works just like any other top coat.</li>
            <li> I usually do 2 decent coats of it on my nails and it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves your nails nice and hard.  </li>
            <li> This top coat doesn&#x27;t wear down with all of the soaps and antibacterial!</li>
            <li> This comes in many different colors, but I use the clear because I don&#x27;t like drawing extra attention to my nails.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product but not a great to me as others thought.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good just not great.  </li>
            <li> Without this product I was breaking nails right and left.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m doing instead is painting my nails the color I want, letting the color dry really well, painting on the clear Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps, and then following up about a minute later with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Strength / Diamond Flash (best quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li> My nails are usually brittle but with this thing they look healthy and feel protected.</li>
            <li> I usually give myself a day or two of nothing whatsoever on my nails to keep them healthy and allow them to &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> thought it was going to be better than the usual</li>
            <li> When it starts to get chippy and peel off is when I finally take it off with nail polish remover and then give myself one day to let my nails &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34; again and then go back to doing a full color manicure on myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of tough to remove with nail polish remover, too...</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t clear when you look at it</li>
            <li> but when you apply it it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Then I use this polish as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> After all the filing, soaking, moisturing, and dealing w/ cuticles I polish with a clear polish.</li>
            <li> and so far I have seen no improvement.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much bubbling; only on my pinky</li>
            <li> My nails are natural so they split &amp; crack.  </li>
            <li> When I have finished my manicure its just like I have been to the salon to have it done except far cheaper</li>
            <li> This product is perfect as a base coat to help strengthen nails or alone to help your nails look manicured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But even as a clear top coat, it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> For a long time and after spending money on trying other top coats, I finally found one that works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for a similar style of acrylic gel polish.</li>
            <li> No base coat, no color and no top coat.</li>
            <li> I have long nails and since there real i need to take care of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative thing is you need a fast drying top coat since this takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Also useful to protect other things, such as my dog&#x27;s ID tags.</li>
            <li> Only thing I do not like about the product is it takes a pretty long time to dry completely.</li>
            <li> When used as a base coat, it causes the top colour to lift off quite easily.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I&#x27;d tried this product so buying it on here for less than instore</li>
            <li> So I end up layering on the polish like every other day until there&#x27;s too much build up.</li>
            <li> Not hard,soft,does not work; Sally Hansen advertises this,and other super-nail hardeners, and treatments, and the company often does not honestly represent their product(s)to the public.this price,for this,is very high only because of the huge media-blitz costs.</li>
            <li> Hard As Wraps isn&#x27;t cheap - I get it on sale at my local drugstore, CVS, or Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly work as described and a little pricey since it doesn&#x27;t deliver on it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> This clear polish is my god sent to keeping my nails long and in one piece.</li>
            <li> Over the days it had been through showers, several sinks full of dishes, baths for the kids, 2 kickboxing classes wearing boxing gloves (that usually results in chips and/or breaks)and other day to day stuff, I really put it through its paces.  </li>
            <li> I used this Hard as Nails, Hard as Wraps and there is no difference between this one and a regular clear top coat nail polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks I see healthy nail growing from the cuticles, but the upper part of each nail bed is dried and cracked where the \\&quot;Hard as Wraps\\&quot; was painted on, and I know it will continue to peel off until it grows</li>
            <li> I used 2 layers of polish, a layer of hard as wraps, quick dry, another coat of hard as wraps, and quick dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional so in comparison to other products on the market</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;-- Not really worth the price, as clear top-coats give the same effect.</li>
            <li> It makes them shiny and pretty but not as hard as I would like them.</li>
            <li> bubbling, not slick, and forever drying, even when it did dry - it still chipped like any other cheep nail polish</li>
            <li> I now have ten nails broken off to the quick, and as the polish-damaged nail beds grow out, the nails break off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried \\&quot;Hard as Nails Hard as Wraps\\&quot; on my basically healthy nails.</li>
            <li> If you shake it, your manicure will dry with tiny bubbles in it.</li>
            <li> I discontinued use of this product after only 3 or 4 tries because the result was the same no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> As Wraps is thick and gel-like, really protecting your nails from the elements of daily life, like dishwashing, cleaning, and housework.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for the health of your nail, but it&#x27;ll remove gel and polish quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that the chemicals aren&#x27;t binding to each other properly</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails that peel and break easily.</li>
            <li> and I am now at the point that they have stayed on so long that I will have to soak them off as growing out.</li>
            <li> Super thick formula that kept my nail color and design in tact for a while but half way through the bottle it became gloppy and inconsistent and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I have begun using it on my teen age girls because one is a nail biter and the other is so active she breaks her nails with her daily activities, but I am hoping for same results as I have had.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little time consuming, but I think in the long run it&#x27;ll actually save me time from having to fix and redo chipped  and pealing nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically can only get away with this for 2 days at the longest before I start to have issues with my nails.</li>
            <li> I work in retail and between breaking down shipment, cash registers and rough wear and tear and the chipping is incredibly low.</li>
            <li> I expected this to give my nails that hardcoat protection</li>
            <li> but that should be expected since it&#x27;s Acrylic gel and Nylon.</li>
            <li> This does help keep your nails harder.</li>
            <li> I dabble it carefully ..</li>
            <li> I was curious about this polish</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product it just a mess.&lt;br /&gt;After applying you cannot touch anything for at least 15 minutes, and even then the top coat is still pliable for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like the other review said, if you don&#x27;t, the gel will smudge.</li>
            <li> This product is inferior,as many other blitz-mediaed Hansen products,steer clear;find other companies,\\&quot;had experience with this brand, got burned\\&quot;. &gt;:(</li>
            <li> I wash my hands, or use antibacterial, over 100 times a day due to my job as a nurse.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that can keep me from ending up a chipped mess in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I found despite using lots of glue and various coats of base coats and top coats as well as other acrylic gel products they still kept coming off after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if this makes my poor fragile nails any harder, they are still breaking and splitting, but it&#x27;s a good base and topper.</li>
            <li> Definitely do not shake the bottle - roll it slowly between your palms.  </li>
            <li> Works well as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> What I need for my electric bass playing.</li>
            <li> When used as a top coat, it causes the base colour to bubble.</li>
            <li> I have to file my nails down now because they just don&#x27;t break any longer.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money I use it as a base coat and it made my manicure last 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It is slightly wearing off at the tips of the nails, but not chipping so its isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Hard as nails helped me to keep them long without the expense of the gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to dry and don&#x27;t use thick layers or you will get bubbles.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of applying two coats, and removing and reapplying every three days, I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and fragile; breaking every time they would grow out.</li>
            <li> After a few days my nail polish was chipping.</li>
            <li> I was getting gel manicures and was tired of paying the price, plus they only lasted 2 weeks for me.  </li>
            <li> Kinda peels away after a few applications/days.</li>
            <li> Peels off within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am quite heavy handed</li>
            <li> I have very thin, soft nails that always split and peel.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product when searching for a topcoat, I thought it&#x27;d be low rated and cruddy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to get off, though, beware of that.</li>
            <li> My nails usually chip after a day, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> and before you know it no more nails.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but I just had to with this product.</li>
            <li> Acrylic is making my nails weak - a few weeks with this product and they are getting stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> Hard</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;Hard as Wraps\\&quot; is extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> it is really hard as nail wraps my wife loves.</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s &#x27;em hard.</li>
            <li> I use two coats of Fiberglass: http://www.sallybeauty.com/fiberglass-nail-wrap/SBS-108510,default,pd.html , followed by polish, then two coats of Hard as Wraps, followed by two coats of Seche Vite: http://www.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Fast-Nail-Ounce/dp/B00150LT40 .</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails, and no real success in getting stronger nails until I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> You will wind up with dents in your nails if too thick</li>
            <li> It leaves a thick acrylic wrap on your nails n</li>
            <li> I started using this as a less expensive alternative to OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy.</li>
            <li> Seriously hardens the base polish or your natural nails.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible that I just had bad luck.</li>
            <li> It did make my nails hard and difficult to break.</li>
            <li> I only use Sally on my nails as a base.</li>
            <li> the coats were not great.</li>
            <li> so no more broken nails!!</li>
            <li> My nails are very weak.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a &#x27;fake nail&#x27; look without getting acrylic, this will not provide this look.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It stays on for days, but the tips of my nails being chipping after 2-3 days :(</li>
            <li> I use OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy Maintenance as a base coat (one or two coats) and this as the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; coat.  </li>
            <li> Instead, the base coat seemed to create a &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> i add this bad boy on!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The polish was actually terrific. It did make my nails hard and difficult to break. It is easy to apply and dries relatively quickly. I had gel manicures for a while and when I stopped them, my nails were very soft and ripped easily.  Hard as nails helped me to keep them long without the expense of the gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails, and no real success in getting stronger nails until I tried this product.  After a few weeks of applying two coats, and removing and reapplying every three days, I can tell a difference.  I do keep my nails clipped short, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, when i did was not satissfied it chipped off on the second day. still on the look out for a good nail gel</li>
            <li> bubbling, not slick, and forever drying, even when it did dry - it still chipped like any other cheep nail polish</li>
            <li> Great product ,  purchase , and seller!! Excellent buy!!😃👍👍</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better.  Reliable product, fast-dry, protects my nails, and is long-lasting.  Costs a bit more, and well worth it.  Also useful to protect other things, such as my dog&#x27;s ID tags.</li>
            <li> Hard As Wraps isn&#x27;t cheap - I get it on sale at my local drugstore, CVS, or Rite-Aid.  But it works like a charm.  I use OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy Maintenance as a base coat (one or two coats) and this as the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; coat.  I finish up with Seche Vite top coat, which hardens and quickly dries the whole manicure.  Hard As Wraps is thick and gel-like, really protecting your nails from the elements of daily life, like dishwashing, cleaning, and housework.  I won&#x27;t use anything else as my \\&quot;polish\\&quot; coat.  This comes in many different colors, but I use the clear because I don&#x27;t like drawing extra attention to my nails.  Don&#x27;t be fooled either, the color on this is \\&quot;Clear/Top Coat\\&quot;.  If you don&#x27;t use a quick-dry top coat on top of Hard As Wraps, it will smudge and ding if you do anything before it dries in 30-60 minutes&#x27; time.  But if you use a quick-dry topcoat, you&#x27;re good to go after 2 minutes.    Definitely do not shake the bottle - roll it slowly between your palms.  If you shake it, your manicure will dry with tiny bubbles in it.</li>
            <li> I got it to make my nails grow and so far I have seen no improvement. I am still holding how but I would not suggest you buy it. Just go to a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It works great. It leaves your nails nice and hard.  Super sparkly and shiny. I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well as a base and top coat. Have used it now for over two months and it still works well- no clumping or bubbling. Good add-on choice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, especially because I&#x27;ve been trying to stop biting my nails and need something to strengthen them up. Unfortunately, this product it just a mess.&lt;br /&gt;After applying you cannot touch anything for at least 15 minutes, and even then the top coat is still pliable for about 30 minutes. Meaning if you bump something there becomes a smudge/divot in the coat. I don&#x27;t know about you but I can&#x27;t sit around for 30 minutes without touching something.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and fragile; breaking every time they would grow out. Now that my nails have gotten stronger i wanted to make sure that i added an extra  front line of defense. So when im done with my two coats of color i add this bad boy on! It definitely makes my nails &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; and for once i dont worry about breaking a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is you need a fast drying top coat since this takes a while to dry. Its not a huge deal for me since i use the essie good to go to top it all of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing a new one once the bottle is done and for the price i couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> I expected this to give my nails that hardcoat protection but I am disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t. It makes them shiny and pretty but not as hard as I would like them.</li>
            <li> I started using this as a less expensive alternative to OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy. It&#x27;s pretty good for a strengthener/protectant...I think it&#x27;s doing its job. It stays on for days, but the tips of my nails being chipping after 2-3 days :( So I end up layering on the polish like every other day until there&#x27;s too much build up. It&#x27;s kind of tough to remove with nail polish remover, too...but that should be expected since it&#x27;s Acrylic gel and Nylon.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t clear when you look at it but when you apply it it goes on clear. This is worth the money I use it as a base coat and it made my manicure last 2 weeks it was just like going to the nail salon without leaveing your house!</li>
            <li> This polish is amazing! I have very thin, soft nails that always split and peel. ive been using this polish for about two months and from day one I could tell how strong it makes my nails. My nails have finally, after years, have grown. I love them!</li>
            <li> I can say this is one of the best nail wraps I had ever used.  I can rate this product as outstanding, because I was in the mountains for 1 week and when I returned my nails still  looked good and was as strong as day 1.....:-)</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product when searching for a topcoat, I thought it&#x27;d be low rated and cruddy. But i read the reviews and I was intrigued. My paint tends to chip easily so I thought this was perfect. I received it 2 days after I purchased it(yay)! And after opening it, I immediately put a coat on top of my new manicured acrylics(yes they had paint on) and it dried very quickly and it just feels awesome. So happy with this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I used 2 layers of polish, a layer of hard as wraps, quick dry, another coat of hard as wraps, and quick dry.  It had been 5 days, and NO CHIPS.  It is slightly wearing off at the tips of the nails, but not chipping so its isn&#x27;t noticeable.  My nails usually chip after a day, no matter what I do. Over the days it had been through showers, several sinks full of dishes, baths for the kids, 2 kickboxing classes wearing boxing gloves (that usually results in chips and/or breaks)and other day to day stuff, I really put it through its paces.  The only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the color I used, but since its not chipped, I dont want to remove it, so make sure you like your color before applying this amazing topcoat!!!!</li>
            <li> I like Sally Hansen products. This does help keep your nails harder. I would recommend it to anyone. It has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> Perfect over any color!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be even more durable than it is -- it&#x27;s a &#x27;good&#x27; product, just not as super-duper, indestructible as I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I keep buying it again and again. It doesn&#x27;t chip and it really strengthens your nails!!</li>
            <li> I do my own French Manicures on my real nails and this is my top coat. My nails rarely chip using this product. It puts an extra 5 days on the life of my manicure. I only have to redo my nails when the manicure grows away from the nail bed. It is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first because it says on package top coat. I wasn&#x60;t looking for a top coat, just a nail hardener.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot , it make my nails look better and also stronger . I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a lie. I used this Hard as Nails, Hard as Wraps and there is no difference between this one and a regular clear top coat nail polish. This is what this is but with a different name. But even as a clear top coat, it is not good at all. After a few days my nail polish was chipping. I have a dollar store clear top coat that lasts longer than this thing did. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having gel polish! 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My nails are very weak. I&#x27;ve used this polish for 2 weeks now. My nails feel much stronger and have quit breaking. I use it in combination with the Sally Hansen miracle polish.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to dry and don&#x27;t use thick layers or you will get bubbles. I love this polish. Seriously hardens the base polish or your natural nails. Just ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Good buy. I only use Sally on my nails as a base.</li>
            <li> For a long time and after spending money on trying other top coats, I finally found one that works. This top coat really stays on. I put it on 4 days ago, and not a sign of chipping today. I wash my hands often and even do dishes, not a chip. My nails are usually brittle but with this thing they look healthy and feel protected. I&#x27;m glad I was recommended this product. Won&#x27;t try anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> The polish wears off within a couple of days, even with 2 coats of it so my nail tips start to split again</li>
            <li> still peals off a bit but seems to be working</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t paint my nails without it. Makes regular polish last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it alone when I am between giving myself full color manicures. I have very thin nails that peel and break easily. I am also the type of person that if I don&#x27;t have something on my nails and either of these things start to happen I start to pick at them and before you know it no more nails. I am either peeling them or biting at them. This clear polish is my god sent to keeping my nails long and in one piece. When I am done with a color manicure (I do them myself at home) I take off my color nail polish and clean up my nails. I usually give myself a day or two of nothing whatsoever on my nails to keep them healthy and allow them to &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34;. I typically can only get away with this for 2 days at the longest before I start to have issues with my nails. Then I use this polish as a clear nail polish. No base coat, no color and no top coat. I use it alone. It goes on thick and dries fast. It&#x27;s beautifully glossy/shiny all on it&#x27;s own. I usually do 2 decent coats of it on my nails and it lasts quite a while. When it starts to get chippy and peel off is when I finally take it off with nail polish remover and then give myself one day to let my nails &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34; again and then go back to doing a full color manicure on myself.</li>
            <li> this is good stuff here,i use it right after my nail  apts. to extend the time between polishing no chips,cracks what soever for atleast 2 to 3 weeks ,great buy</li>
            <li> This product is perfect as a base coat to help strengthen nails or alone to help your nails look manicured.&lt;br /&gt;I use this under Orly, Ulta, and Sally Hansen polishes and I have not seen a difference with it based on what polishes are used.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a &#x27;fake nail&#x27; look without getting acrylic, this will not provide this look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product online because, like most everyone else, buying it in store can be expensive. And I just wanted to try it, to see what the fuss was about and see if it was actually worth the money. It definitely is. It can be a little time consuming, but I think in the long run it&#x27;ll actually save me time from having to fix and redo chipped  and pealing nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing colorful nail polish, but even the best of brands chips after a few days. Even with the best clear top coats, they STILL chip after a few days. What I&#x27;m doing instead is painting my nails the color I want, letting the color dry really well, painting on the clear Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps, and then following up about a minute later with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Strength / Diamond Flash (best quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used). Like the other review said, if you don&#x27;t, the gel will smudge. But with the quick dry, its good to go. I&#x27;m on day 6 - no smudges, no chips, even through washing dishes and pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to get off, though, beware of that. I use a 100% pure acetone tub. You stick your nail in it, there&#x27;s a pre-soaked sponge. It&#x27;s not great for the health of your nail, but it&#x27;ll remove gel and polish quickly. I&#x27;d suggest using a growth or health treatment to restore the nails in between polishes.</li>
            <li> Not hard,soft,does not work; Sally Hansen advertises this,and other super-nail hardeners, and treatments, and the company often does not honestly represent their product(s)to the public.this price,for this,is very high only because of the huge media-blitz costs.This product is inferior,as many other blitz-mediaed Hansen products,steer clear;find other companies,\\&quot;had experience with this brand, got burned\\&quot;. &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Shiny top coat. However it still chips after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I tried \\&quot;Hard as Nails Hard as Wraps\\&quot; on my basically healthy nails. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, \\&quot;Hard as Wraps\\&quot; is extremely hard.  It bonded to my nails like super glue and when it began to crack and peel, my nails cracked and peeled right off with the polish. I immediately removed the polish, which took some time, as it really is solid stuff.  I now have ten nails broken off to the quick, and as the polish-damaged nail beds grow out, the nails break off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks I see healthy nail growing from the cuticles, but the upper part of each nail bed is dried and cracked where the \\&quot;Hard as Wraps\\&quot; was painted on, and I know it will continue to peel off until it grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So really, warning, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Acrylic is making my nails weak - a few weeks with this product and they are getting stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent it is really hard as nail wraps my wife loves.</li>
            <li> I am a man and i use this product proudly. I use it to strengthen my nails because they crack after playing many years of sports. Does what its supposed to. My girlfriend loves it as a top coat as well its very strong</li>
            <li> I was getting gel manicures and was tired of paying the price, plus they only lasted 2 weeks for me.  I saw this product on Amazon and said &amp;#34;what have I got to loose&amp;#34;  This product is amazing.  I do my own manicures now and they last and last.  Without this product I was breaking nails right and left.  I am so happy I found this. I have to file my nails down now because they just don&#x27;t break any longer. Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised.  Also, I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but I just had to with this product.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon I bought it at CVS for double the AMAZON PRICE, since I love this product i decided to write a review and buy it also from Amazon. My nails are brittle and break all the time, I have been using acrylic nails for over 14 years off and on, they have ruined my natural nails so much, my nails do not grow since they break easily.  i have been using this product for about 2 weeks and my nails have grown and are strong.  I have begun using it on my teen age girls because one is a nail biter and the other is so active she breaks her nails with her daily activities, but I am hoping for same results as I have had.  I recommend this product the price( compared to what I paid at CVS $9.00) is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This product is a little strong and pulls the top of my nail off when removed.  I didn&#x27;t expect that so it weakened my nails.  I can no longer use.</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s &#x27;em hard. What I need for my electric bass playing. A bit of gloss but what can you do. Good for the ladies. I dabble it carefully .. I&#x27;m a male bassist, wear it to harden the nails, not look &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;. However, can see ladies favoring this. It works.</li>
            <li> works great! I reccommend two coats and if you want color, apply after. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with gelish polish. Overall 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product very much. Its appearance is fine on the nails. It goes on really easily and smoothly. After a day or so, the product lifts off the nails. It has to be removed with polish remover or you can actually peel off the entire layer of covering from where it lifts. Neither method is good for your nails. I discontinued use of this product after only 3 or 4 tries because the result was the same no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> Super thick formula that kept my nail color and design in tact for a while but half way through the bottle it became gloppy and inconsistent and took forever to dry. the coats were not great. Maybe this needs a thinner formula because i need a polish to not clump up because I have longer nails.</li>
            <li> Gread product and great value</li>
            <li> Not all that impressive. Kinda peels away after a few applications/days. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There are other products by this brand that are a better choice.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was hoping it would be but works okay for what it says. However, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Peels off within a few days. Dries fast. Nails are very shiny with it on. Doesn&#x27;t exactly work as described and a little pricey since it doesn&#x27;t deliver on it&#x27;s claims. It is okay. I will use it, I just won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This works great for my nails that are pretty thin to begin with.  Applying even one coat of this stuff and my nails felt instantly stronger.  I liked it so much I went out and bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li> I always enjoyed Sally Hansen products because they work so well.  This is an item that lives up to it&#x27;s description.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!! I wash my hands, or use antibacterial, over 100 times a day due to my job as a nurse. This top coat doesn&#x27;t wear down with all of the soaps and antibacterial! Only thing I do not like about the product is it takes a pretty long time to dry completely.</li>
            <li> WHat can anyone really say about a polish type nail hardner?&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was going to be better than the usual Sally Hansen&lt;br /&gt;Hard-as-nails,  but its just the same to me.&lt;br /&gt;-- Not really worth the price, as clear top-coats give the same effect.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product.I love to do my nails. I have long nails and since there real i need to take care of them. I always do my weekly rutine to try and keep my nails looking nice. After all the filing, soaking, moisturing, and dealing w/ cuticles I polish with a clear polish. I was curious about this polish so i decided to give it a try. It worked out perfectly it really does harden like they describe it. This was a great buy. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for a similar style of acrylic gel polish. It nice for designer nail too, I would defentley buy this product again.  :)</li>
            <li> To me it works just like any other top coat. It doesn&#x27;t last two weeks like it says it will. It does harden the nail while it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that actually works on my natural nail to keep from flaking and breaking. This is fantastic! Just realize you can not out on too many coats or it takes a full day to dry. You will wind up with dents in your nails if too thick</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that can keep me from ending up a chipped mess in a few hours. I use two coats of Fiberglass: http://www.sallybeauty.com/fiberglass-nail-wrap/SBS-108510,default,pd.html , followed by polish, then two coats of Hard as Wraps, followed by two coats of Seche Vite: http://www.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Fast-Nail-Ounce/dp/B00150LT40 . Nothing else has worked alone, or in combination better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if this makes my poor fragile nails any harder, they are still breaking and splitting, but it&#x27;s a good base and topper.</li>
            <li> Read all the comments but decided to buy it anyway. I have only tried it once so it&#x27;s possible that I just had bad luck. I didn&#x27;t have too much bubbling; only on my pinky but the bubbles are so tiny no one but the wearer would notice. Instead, the base coat seemed to create a &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; look. It&#x27;s possible that the chemicals aren&#x27;t binding to each other properly or maybe I wash my hands too much. Either way, there are cracks in the top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails are natural so they split &amp; crack.  It was the first time I&#x27;d tried this product so buying it on here for less than instore seemed the right move. This product does help but for me drying time is a must. This just took longer than I like. Would recommend to anyone not in a time crunch.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered as promised, but thats where the joy stopped. The polish did not work as advertised and didn&#x27;t work when applied as instructed. It doesnt prevent chipping of nails, neither does it harden the nails. When used as a base coat, it causes the top colour to lift off quite easily.When used as a top coat, it causes the base colour to bubble.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  It&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> I use this with the dashing diva French manicure wraps as an alternative. I found despite using lots of glue and various coats of base coats and top coats as well as other acrylic gel products they still kept coming off after a few days. I now use this for two coats and then finish with a seche vite fast drying top coat and the results are amazing. The tips stay on longer than ever and I am now at the point that they have stayed on so long that I will have to soak them off as growing out. This product is great to give nails strength. I am quite heavy handed so know it will have been through the mill. When I have finished my manicure its just like I have been to the salon to have it done except far cheaper and I can do it in the comfort of my own home in half an hour. For the price I think this is an excellent product. My sister has already booked me to do her nails for her wedding day.</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews, I was excited to try this product. It is a good product but not a great to me as others thought. I&#x27;m a professional so in comparison to other products on the market it&#x27;s good just not great.  I found it peeled very easily and quickly for it being similar to a nail wrap.</li>
            <li> I work in retail and between breaking down shipment, cash registers and rough wear and tear and the chipping is incredibly low. I&#x27;m on day 4 and one nail chipped. Also helps strengthen my nails so no more broken nails!!</li>
            <li> I love this product . It leaves a thick acrylic wrap on your nails n they grow ! Must have . Drys up fast though</li>
