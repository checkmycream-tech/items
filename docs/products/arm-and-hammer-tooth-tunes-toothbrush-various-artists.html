            <li>daughter happy to brush her teeth&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great idea</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase for my daughter.</li>
            <li>My kids just sit there with the tooth brush in their mouths listening to the music and not brushing.  :P  </li>
            <li>She just laughed when she opened it because it was her 16th birthday</li>
            <li>The product was good.</li>
            <li>Anything that will get her to brush more often, and longer is a good thing!</li>
            <li>It would be great if they would add some more song selections...</li>
            <li>kids love it!</li>
            <li>Would be nice if the head was exchangeable.</li>
            <li>she is a 1direction fan she loved it and finds her self wanting to brush her teeth more often</li>
            <li>Quite amusing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter brushes more because of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am sure it was the correct battery.  </li>
            <li>She loved this toothbrush and I would order more for her friends soon as she is ready.</li>
            <li>Music could be a bit louder but other than it, it was the best gift on her birthday.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a huge 1D fan</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, hope they come out with more songs to choose from by the time she needs a new one.</li>
            <li>picture is worth a thousand words.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>She no longer complains about brushing her teeth and runs right in to do it as soon as I ask.  </li>
            <li>and we were suppose to be a little more sophisticated, but she still loves it.</li>
            <li>The item came very fast .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d be elated to get exactly</li>
            <li>THIS WELL MAKE THEM WANT TO BRUSH SIMPLY BY PLAYING THE SONG ON THE BRUSH. :)</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I paid more than $20 for this one, but Walmart was out of this specific one my niece wanted.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how the toothbrush works or how much my daughter likes it.  </li>
            <li>We got my son got a the Gangnum Style musical toothbrush made by &#x27;Brush Buddies&amp;#34; (competitor of Tooth Tunes) and the volume is MUCH louder and the overall quality of the toothbrush seems better.</li>
            <li>My daughter (6) has brushed her teeth twice with it and has fun with it.</li>
            <li>Not very loud but still exciting</li>
            <li>#34;What Makes You Beautiful&amp;#34; and was sent a totally different song (&amp;#34;One Thing&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Just to be clear you don&#x27;t hear the song playing until you put the bristles on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s that old saying &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another old saying is &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li>My 13 year old loves it.</li>
            <li>Getting my 7 year old niece to brush her teeth isn&#x27;t a fight</li>
            <li>Interesting concept, but considering you really should change toothbrushes every 6 months or so, this is really expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was kind of expensive though.</li>

            <li> It is very difficult  to hear the music.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s that old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be elated to get exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another old saying is &amp;#34;a picture is worth a thousand words.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Interesting concept, but considering you really should change toothbrushes every 6 months or so, this is really expensive. Would be nice if the head was exchangeable.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter who has already been to two One Direction concerts.  She just laughed when she opened it because it was her 16th birthday and we were suppose to be a little more sophisticated, but she still loves it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter.  She no longer complains about brushing her teeth and runs right in to do it as soon as I ask.  Totally worth the money, hope they come out with more songs to choose from by the time she needs a new one.</li>
            <li> kids love it! sounds good and seems to do the trick to motivate the kids to brush for 2 mins!</li>
            <li> Music could be a bit louder but other than it, it was the best gift on her birthday. She brushed her teeth all weekend.  Happy Mom.</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my daughter she is a 1direction fan she loved it and finds her self wanting to brush her teeth more often</li>
            <li> The item came very fast . I bought this for my neice only to be told it was at walmart and for a third of what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a huge 1D fan so I bought this toothbrush as a stocking stuffer.  Just to be clear you don&#x27;t hear the song playing until you put the bristles on your teeth.  Then the vibrations are heard as a song.  Quite amusing.  My 13 year old loves it.</li>
            <li> IF YOUR KIDS ARE DIE HARD 1 DIRECTION FANS THIS IS A MUST GET. ESPEICALY IF THEY DON&#x27;T WANT TO BRUSH THERE TEETH THIS WELL MAKE THEM WANT TO BRUSH SIMPLY BY PLAYING THE SONG ON THE BRUSH. :)</li>
            <li> Not very loud but still exciting</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept, and my daughter likes it (in theory) - but the volume on the toothbrush is SO LOW it&#x27;s very hard to hear the song playing while you brush.  We got my son got a the Gangnum Style musical toothbrush made by &#x27;Brush Buddies&amp;#34; (competitor of Tooth Tunes) and the volume is MUCH louder and the overall quality of the toothbrush seems better.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughter look forward to brushing her teeth.  It would be great if they would add some more song selections...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how the toothbrush works or how much my daughter likes it.  I do know that I ordered &amp;#34;What Makes You Beautiful&amp;#34; and was sent a totally different song (&amp;#34;One Thing&amp;#34;).  So, buyer beware that apparently when ordering Tooth Tunes, you may be getting some random selection of songs.</li>
            <li> My daughter brushes more because of the toothbrush. I will tell my friends about the product. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I confused a music toothbrush with an electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a toothbrush that plays music. It was expensive, especially since the bristles don&#x27;t move and I&#x27;ll have to replace it in a few months. My daughter (6) has brushed her teeth twice with it and has fun with it. She&#x27;s happy so that&#x27;s great. What I will do is let her brush her teeth in the morning with this one, and I&#x27;ll get her another electric toothbrush for evening (I was replacing the kids toothbrushes) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: daughter happy to brush her teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: price, non-electric bristles, no head replacement</li>
            <li> My niece likes One Direction products. She loved this toothbrush and I would order more for her friends soon as she is ready.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was practically dead.  When I tried replacing the batteries, it was totally dead.  I tried several brands of battery - none worked.  I am sure it was the correct battery.  My daughter is hugely disappointed.  (I have 4 and got each of them different toothbrushes... all turned out to be an epic fail.</li>
            <li> My lil cuzin loves it!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great idea but it totally back fired.  My kids just sit there with the tooth brush in their mouths listening to the music and not brushing.  :P  Great idea but did not work out for our family.  My kids are 7 and 9</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for my daughter. Anything that will get her to brush more often, and longer is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;That&#x27;s What Makes You Beautiful&amp;#34; but got &amp;#34;One Thing&amp;#34; instead.  Not good.</li>
            <li> The product was good. Getting my 7 year old niece to brush her teeth isn&#x27;t a fight anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It was kind of expensive though. They are only around $8 at Walmart. I paid more than $20 for this one, but Walmart was out of this specific one my niece wanted.</li>
