            <li>and I love the spf 50.  </li>

            <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li>and I like Dermalogica with SPF very much.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have clear container to know when to buy next. ..</li>
            <li>my husband uses, and he is very particular.  </li>

            <li>no hydration and much older than I am.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>It was recommended to and for me by a professional....</li>
            <li>Not heavy</li>
            <li>It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old.</li>
            <li>how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired,</li>
            <li>Worth the price, a little goes a long way, essentially for my skin during the summer.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A little pricey but it has a nice smell and leaves skin feeling very smooth, healthy and looking more toned, too. Great sunscreen protection but it&#x27;s NOT waterproof - you have to reapply if you&#x27;re swimming or wear waterproof SPF.</li>
            <li> Recommended by an esthetician when getting a facial and I like Dermalogica with SPF very much.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this cream.  It feels lightweight and not greasy.  It has excellent UV cover too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Just slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Best price, arrived fast!</li>
            <li> I went to a spa and had a facial done using this product line. I liked it so I decided to buy off Amazon since it was a little cheaper. It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old. It broke my face out BAD, through out the day no matter how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired, no hydration and much older than I am. I used it for about 3 weeks. Needless to say I returned, I am not happy with this product at all. For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to and for me by a professional....and it is amazing...been using for 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> what size is the bottle?  The one with SPF 30 says the size but the one with SPF 50 doesn&#x27;t say the size of the bottle???</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 years now.  Worth the price, a little goes a long way, essentially for my skin during the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this for my daily sunscreen.  Until now it has been 30 SPF and now it&#x27;s 50 SPF. More protection from the sun!!</li>
            <li> great product, non greasy feel and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> great light product for combination to oil skin.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery! Thx!</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my def to keep list. Nourishing but still works on my mixed skin. Love the warm feeling it gives on application, texturizes the skin beautifully and has SPF 50. Could not do without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> Great product greater product line!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Need very little of product.  Super-rich.  No sunburn even when at beach all day!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> This SPF is great.  Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is highly recommended, where I live, so it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband uses, and he is very particular.  I would buy this again, for us both.</li>
            <li> Not too thick. No white face. Would be nice to have clear container to know when to buy next. .. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product absorbs into my skin. I&#x27;ve tried other facial lotions with sunsceen that leave my face looking  ashen.</li>
            <li> Great customer service ! Very happy with it and product :)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It is not greasy at all yet feels great, is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had not tried the SPF 50. It&#x27;s a little thinner than the 35.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Great for all ages and skin types. Love this moisturizer!  Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for years and my skin is great for and I am 81 years old.</li>
            <li> Good protection, absorbs well into the skin, does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> What a delightful fresh scent and light feeling; worth every cent! Not heavy; primes perfectly for next steps.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, hydrating and the sunscreen strength  is perfect.</li>
            <li> use everyday..making dark spots disappear love it..best price around</li>
            <li> Improved my skin tone. Its moisturizing but light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping ease! A+++++++</li>
            <li> I love this SPF 50 moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t  leave that greasy/chalky feeling.  It also has a clean smelling scent.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a facial when I wear it!  (That&#x27;s what my aesthetician uses!)  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. not oily or greasy by any means, but I feel I need to up the dose to 2 pumps to get the coverage I prefer. and I love the spf 50.  also it doesn&#x27;t smell like sun block products.  this alone is much appreciated.</li>
