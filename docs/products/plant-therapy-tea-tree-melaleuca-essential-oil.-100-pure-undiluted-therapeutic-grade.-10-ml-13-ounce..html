            <li>Its the best remedy and a very practical gift to give to any one.</li>
            <li>so I started doing my own research and came across forums recommending tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product along with another brand of tea tree oil (the Desert Essence brand wasn&#x27;t noticeably effective).  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to do... but smells really really nice.</li>
            <li>All good things take time, but using this for over a month or so now, my acne has subsided for the most part.</li>

            <li>The smell is very strong but I have gotten used to it.  </li>

            <li>A couple of cautions to keep in mind; tea tree oil is toxic for dogs and cats, so make sure anything you have used it with (i.e. cotton balls, spray solutions, etc.) are kept where the fur babies can&#x27;t get at it</li>
            <li>After some research on tea tree oil, I have found that it has so many uses.</li>
            <li>And the company even sends a courtesy email to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I did a search and saw many people saying they did a tea tree oil spray</li>
            <li>I massage the oil over them and my nails are enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li>my skin seems to be doing better.</li>
            <li>This product would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so runny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also excellent as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal, especially for the skin.  </li>
            <li>once or twice a week I put some drops on top of my toothbrush and/or floss it in.</li>
            <li>It has been driving me nuts that nothing worked....until this magic potion arrived.</li>
            <li>and I love that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>need to learn more uses for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are many more uses for Tea Tree Oil, so we will keep on experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;Overview:</li>
            <li>More than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It has that tea tree smell that I love.  </li>
            <li>So many uses</li>
            <li>LOVE this brand of oils.</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of Tea Tree Oil, but I can understand it&#x27;s an acquired smell for others.</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be completely satisfied</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use many otc skin products.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and results I get from cleaning</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I thought of it as the better alternative.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>SO AS YOU CAN SEE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Decided to switch over to the tea tree oil and see if that worked any better.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using it until the nail (hopefully) grows out healthy and will then probably use it once a week or so as a preventative.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of the numerous wonderful benefits of tea tree oil</li>

            <li>I like the one from Thursday Plantation much better, though it is pricier</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Tea Tree Essential Oil is an excellent quality oil.</li>
            <li>I have come to love Tea Tree and all the many uses&#x27;s</li>

            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I know about it now</li>

            <li>The next best thing was tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but I bought this more for its antiseptic, antifungal and antibacterial properties.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that more description be given or pictures of the dropper.  </li>
            <li>I already knew so many benefits of Tea Tree Oil and is a must in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would buy from them again :).  </li>
            <li>I love associating smells with memories.</li>
            <li>was pleased with product.</li>
            <li>The smell is as potent as it gets for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading about the many benefits of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells great!</li>
            <li>She has healthy skin growing now after just three applications.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars but the European dropper isn&#x27;t all that wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great product use the oil for a face wash and works great also has many other uses</li>
            <li>I had bought it originally to use it for skin tags and now I make my own ear mite treatment with this for my dog (poisonous for cats), age spots, fever blisters, oil diffuser, etc.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of it, but it is very strong and can see why some people might not like it.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product,  exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>Used it for some fungal issues, which were dealt with quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li>Great quality product at a fantastic price.....will come back for more oils!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good for headaches,the flu has recently gone around our house that came with a headache...</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Essential Oil is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>the odor produced is very high which suggests a good extraction method without degrading a lot the oil itself.</li>
            <li>Totally good essential oil, i am very glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I might get a couple drops too many now and then, but I&#x27;m not doing precise measuring.  </li>
            <li>Great for the natural pharmacy</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is fabulous, works for so many infections, fungal and otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great natural way to get rid of itchy bug bites.  </li>
            <li>Works great and natural.</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping and great results.</li>
            <li>After reading many details and reviews, I ordered it and was excited to use it on myself for some blemish issues.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product!</li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it dries up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Company has a great product selection and I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>It is literally an all-around useful product with great results.</li>
            <li>However, the aroma is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, but it dissipates within a day or so.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is offensively strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but I can handle it considering the results you get from it.</li>
            <li>Seems to be strong and undiluted as advertised.</li>
            <li>Strong smell, but</li>
            <li>Really, really strong stuff.</li>
            <li>odor is STRONG and I send my fiance screaming from the room whenever I use it.</li>
            <li>It had a strong turpentine smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but nothing overbearing and what you would expect from a tree oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is indeed strong but that&#x27;s tea tree for you -</li>
            <li>Really, really strong sent.</li>
            <li>I do like it - even if the scent is initially strong upon application.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t always been consistent but the results are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>People will make fun of you for your strong smell!</li>
            <li>I got the Cinnamon Bark and Lavender oils from this brand and both smell fine</li>
            <li>If you just need to pour this out into your hands or an applicator of some sort, this product is fine for you.  </li>
            <li>and after a couple of days, it clears quickly!  </li>
            <li>and I bet you will be amazed how quickly things heal up!</li>
            <li>The euro dropper takes a little getting used to, but all in all this product has been great!</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my scalp due to the dryness I was experiencing, it works like a charm, I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Also great for my Chinese crested skin.  </li>
            <li>i miss it with my daily moisturizer to put on my face, it feels great.</li>
            <li>I use it in my 2nd rinse cycle of washing cloth diapers and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Add two drops of the oil on the Qtip/cottonball and lightly apply it around ON the tag.</li>
            <li>Great essential oil!</li>
            <li>Try not to add too much if you are making your own hair products (my mistake).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic).  </li>
            <li>This is an unbiased review as I was not given a free sample in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter got diagnosed with Molluscum contagiosum and the dices said no treatment available.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil that I ordered is a fantastic buy for the price.</li>
            <li>because I already opened it &amp; it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Great tea tree oil for a variety of different uses.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic..</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I caught him and he turned wild and got me good.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li>Sure is pure!</li>
            <li>The smell is REALLY strong but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>Prescription ointments have worked best for me in the past.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>but make sure to educate yourself first.  </li>
            <li>Great for treating wounds, minor wounds.</li>
            <li>Okay first I ordered peppermint oil from this company and now the tea tree . . .</li>
            <li>Exactly as specified, so many uses I could write a book.</li>
            <li>So useful!</li>
            <li>I mix this in with my foot cream and it keeps the skin from thickening and my feet are super smooth.</li>
            <li>Clean tag area with soapy water.</li>
            <li>Amazing, it instantly numbed it, much better then clove oil.</li>
            <li>I guess a prior kind was junk because this is potent.</li>
            <li>Face feels so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I keep this in my home for scrapes, cuts and bruises, also when I have had minor dental issues, it works very well as a rinse until you can see a dentist, three drops to warm water, rinse, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>- I usually keep a bottle on-hand at home and work for quick application, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Nothing too special about it.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Make sure to dilute properly, it seems to be very strong.</li>
            <li>It is no longer discolored and the cuticle is not black anymore - it is healthy!</li>
            <li>This is very high quality, potent oil.  </li>
            <li>Just great- no problems expected</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be a great quality and was just what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>True tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>My order arrived as promised and the product is full strength, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for about a week or more, and i have to say i have not broken out since.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy essential oils are always good.</li>
            <li>It comes in an amber colored glass bottle with a stopper at the top to help control how much comes out at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone that says tea tree oil removes warts or skin tags is full of it.  </li>
            <li>She read somewhere that it was good to use as a pimple reducer, but made them swell up and turn red</li>
            <li>No effect after using full bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, got rid of my dandruff in short order and all that stuff.</li>
            <li>If it was good enough for them it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>So I thought I really had nothing to lose to try this product before I sought a more rigorous means of healing.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, though.</li>
            <li>I found that the Tea Tree oil smells so strongly that she is much more cautious and doesn&#x27;t get near my arm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell is strong at first, since I wasn&#x27;t used to it, but</li>
            <li>Product is great and is pure tea tree essential oils.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve got other oils from this brand that were great, but this tea tree oil just doesn&#x27;t seem quite as concentrated as others she has used.</li>
            <li>I decided to see what other uses and discovered it was great for acne or scars.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the euro dropper at first, but it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd tea tree oil brand that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s definitely the best.</li>
            <li>It has helped her tremendously</li>
            <li>Shippment was quick &amp; the description fits the product.  </li>
            <li>It dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I rub the oil on twice a day and it quickly absorbs into the nail.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face, and pimples disappear really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick Shipment, product as described, and works.  </li>
            <li>shipped relatively quick, and the oil itself</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne and it dries it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>For my mild yet persistent surface redness and dryness it looked like I had used rubbing alcohol on it.</li>
            <li>Im happy with this bottle and packaging BECAUSE it doesnt come out too fast, there is some home party brand out there that will charge you twice to triple the price for the same thing, but the problem with their brand is the bottles and plastic stoppers</li>
            <li>Dabbing a bit on mild acne breakouts works well too.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil really does a great job of healing and we use it for both human and animal applications.</li>
            <li>With hormonal issues, I can&#x27;t be free of breakouts, but this essential oil has been keeping my face much more beautiful than when I was using other agents as written.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cheap for acne flareups.  </li>
            <li>: Cheap, Works exactly as described, virtually painless, no scarring or discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One drop is more than enough as the smell is kind of intense, it may even make your eyes water a bit.</li>
            <li>This product is PURE and STRONG.</li>
            <li>, they are soooo big and loose that the oils POUR out, this is perfect, I can tape out a drop or two, or use a clean Qtip to get it out.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong when you first put it on, but within a few minutes it fades to a sweet lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product but as others have indicated, it needs new packaging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the pleasant smell I expected.</li>
            <li>I received this quickly and felt it was worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a very natural and refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>This really helped the keloid I had on my ear!!</li>
            <li>It must be diluted first!</li>
            <li>He puts this on his toenails .. pretty strong smelling at first but fades.</li>
            <li>Anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil should take note of the VERY pungent smell as well, but I love this oil and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a dropper so the oil would come out a little smoother, but it is great.</li>
            <li>The oil inside seems fine, but I&#x27;ve found buying a bigger bottle with an eyedropper works better.</li>
            <li>I know this stuff is pure and potent because you can really feel that cooling tingline effect where you Apply</li>
            <li>I have used others that I liked a little bit better.</li>
            <li>Overall this tea tree oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but put up with it because it works so well.  </li>
            <li>making my own personal Christmas gifts</li>
            <li>I took a while for my body to adjust to it, but now my body odor is practically gone, so the oil is worth it for that</li>
            <li>Definitely useful around the house (cleaning).  </li>
            <li>Having heard that tea tree is a natural antibacterial agent, and that people use it on ear piercings, I got the idea that I may be able to use it to control my infected sinus pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased about 20 essential oils from this company and in every case the product was powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>I went to my massage therapist today who makes her own essential oil mixes and asked her if she knew what Tea Tree oil was supposed to sell</li>
            <li>The service was quick and the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Super fast processing and shipping!</li>
            <li>On time, super, we use it for healing, cuts and sores.&lt;br /&gt;Right sizes to add to first aid bag for the car</li>
            <li>And the best part was that the area surrounding the tag turned very rough and red...</li>
            <li>It is amazing how it takes a raw, sore cyst and makes it feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my sons toenail fungus and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li>this stuff tamp&#x27;s it right</li>
            <li>It is affordable and is just the right size.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different TT oils and this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>so, i pretty much got free one day shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have a normal dropper, or one of those glass rods attached to the top.   </li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is great for acne and other cuts/abrasions to help with the healing process and I would highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li>toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a legitimate medical website that stated pure Tea Tree oil has been found effective in fighting toenail fungus - it said 60% of people will see results within 6 months if used twice a day.</li>
            <li>I use a q-tip which works perfectly because you only need a little dab.</li>
            <li>Its pure and inexpensive!</li>
            <li>It smells strong, not unpleasant, I&#x27;m sure it is what it claims to be, if you put some in a plastic cup with a little water it will melt the cup within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>I only used the oil twice and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This has been great on my red, flakey, open eczema rashes.</li>
            <li>Sure the smell is strong, kind of like sandalwood mixed with eucalyptus, but there are a lot of whining babies on these reviews complaining about the smell and missing the miraculous anti fungus, bacterial and virual properties it has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll admit the euro dropper is strange but if you hold it upside down and have 2 seconds of patience, a perfect drop will fall out.</li>
            <li>so you cant just put some on your finger and on your face, it was very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>The seller got the product to me very fast.</li>
            <li>and it dries them very fast.</li>
            <li>Nice, high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>I use it in shampoo, I normally start with about 3-5 drops per full shampoo bottle to test it.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li>but I knew ahead of time exactly how the item was.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything to prevent her or us from ever getting it.  </li>
            <li>and so far she has been lice free.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to try this.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>You have to invert it multiple times to get drops on your skin and sometimes it would pour out more than intended.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for removing skin tags!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using directly on my skin for some type of bizarre rash that keep recurring.</li>
            <li>By the second day, the rash is gone, so Tea Tree is working much better than hydrocortisone</li>
            <li>felines just got their first flea outbreak of the summer</li>
            <li>(Actually, my homemade deodorant works better than any store bought deodorant I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>This oil came exactly is described.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to purchase it :)</li>
            <li>ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS HOW IT IS DISPENCED FROM BOTTLE, WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HAD A DROPPER.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, I was using it to try to eliminate a skin tag on my arm, it is a pretty tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>This oil is an absolute miracle!</li>
            <li>Product received was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>it is really a versatile product!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I did this again for the next 4 days, twice a day, and now my nose is bump free!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>and it really does the job!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as advertised-a 10 mL bottle of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I got</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work consistently.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, well packaged and is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and expect to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li>I love your essential oils.  </li>
            <li>shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I use it in a hot bath and it has&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li>The smell is obviously tea tree which is invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you know tea tree, it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like roses.</li>
            <li>There is no cure, so diet changes and homeopathic remedies are usually the best result since doctors only want to put you on extended doses of antibiotics.</li>
            <li>Most recently, I ordered some to combine with sulphur and vaseline to heal a fungal infection/wound on one of our horses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong, and you either love it or not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way too much time pouring over items in the pharmacy, trying to find some sort of skin cream/wash/cloth that effectively combats acne and skin problems, usually with mixed results at best.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a lot like strong PineSol, but a little more pure.  </li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with other products to make my own deodorant, soap, and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If you are into natural remedies, this is definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>very effective while also leaving my skin feeling smooth and much less dry.  </li>
            <li>I put a dab on problem areas at night and by the next morning they are significantly reduced!</li>
            <li>After battling for over 3 months with sudden onset adult acne (the cystic kind</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I was overall, pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what the label says, 100% pure undiluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>pure , undiluted,  I recommend your getting  it and keeping it in your home or first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil along with other items the inside of the package was great but the outside wasn&#x27;t so hot.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I was a little put off by the smell as I wasn&#x27;t familiar with how potent it should be.</li>
            <li>At first the smell is a bit much, but it goes away after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>So happy to finally have found something that works!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, for any other HS sufferers, I am also taking 90mg of zinc every day.</li>
            <li>If, on the other hand, you are trying to put this directly on a cut or something, good luck.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it if you live in tropical or subtropical regions for anti fungus / ant bacterial issues related to warm climates.</li>
            <li>In my case, it took five months of on-and-off inconsistent application and more recently, only one month of application once to twice daily to see amazing results in my recently torn, traumatized nail.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to see if it would help with small skin irritations and it has been very good; my husband noticed that he was starting to get a fever blister</li>
            <li>love it, it&#x27;s exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>The item arrived really quickly and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>and I love every single one.</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I bought this purely for the use of removing skin tags.</li>
            <li>Just remember it is pure oil</li>
            <li>For this to work well the oil must be pure and it has worked wonders with this brand.</li>
            <li>This is pure tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I used this tea tree oil in conjunction with 100% pure, organic aloe vera gel, to heal a sebacious cyst.  </li>
            <li>but I think i will just face the fact that all things won&#x27;t work for certain people.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve been using a bit of pure aloe vera with it also.</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li>personal favorite combination of essential oils is:  6 drops tea tree oil, 8 drops sweet orange oil, 10 drops vanilla oil.  </li>
            <li>Being new to using Essential Oil&#x27;s, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out, but now I&#x27;m cluing in.</li>
            <li>I use this for fungus on my toe nail ,cold sore ,fleas bite ,and many others too many to names it all ,love melaleuca tea tree oil ,my first experience with tea tree oil is from the direct sale tea tree oil ,but I like the Amazon prices</li>
            <li>This one is very high quality.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s really 100% pure (who can, anyway?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use Clove OIl which helps a little but is not too effective.</li>
            <li>I use it for cleaning and topical uses (properly diluted) and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and the shipping was very prompt</li>
            <li>It really helped</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser desight really helps apply it efficiently too.</li>
            <li>Much faster than any product I&#x27;ve used which is made specifically for fighting zits, and faster than just washing alone.  </li>
            <li>i received free 2-day shipping from amazon prime, and even so, it came the NEXT day.</li>
            <li>It saved me much embarassment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for foot baths and also put it straight on my feet and toenails.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I used all sorts of dandruff shampoos and none really worked.</li>
            <li>However, the spout on this bottle doesn&#x27;t really work like a &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It smells to me like a walk in the woods after a gentle rain.</li>
            <li>I received my package fast and the products are not damaged at all.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to use tea tree oil either</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was ready to give up until I read reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>You have to figure out how much to apply.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a spa, very relaxing and calming.  </li>
            <li>I also tried it on a couple eczema spots that I have, it did help it stop itching but didn&#x27;t really improve the look of the skin</li>
            <li>Used this product on removing skin tags, worked very well.</li>
            <li>It really is undilutd.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t help for me, its very liquidy</li>
            <li>But it worked and worked fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very controlled, drop-by-drop.  </li>
            <li>After much research we decided to try this.</li>
            <li>A smelly modern version of snake oil, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say if this product would have taken that skin tag off if I had kept applying the oil a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>... works really well for her..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does not remove skin tags.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with tension headaches and the smell</li>
            <li>so it really did workand</li>
            <li>I really like this tea tree oil by Plant Therapy.  </li>
            <li>After reading much hype about the benefits if tea tree oil, I purchased this product based on the ratings.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing,</li>
            <li>I use Tea Tree oil very often since I am a type 1 diabetic using an insulin pump and a continuous monitoring system.</li>
            <li>I forget to use it on a regular basis like we were supposed to, but my son applies it and it smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The way this bottle is designed way too much came out and I finished the whole bottle in one week.</li>
            <li>Thanks Plant Therapy Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>just as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li>and it is far better than the similar product that the doctor prescribed.</li>
            <li>Always be sure to check the properties and warnings even for natural products like essential oils.</li>
            <li>When I use it regularly the bump is nearly gone and the piercing seems to be healing better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is definitely very strong, but I was already expecting that from previous reviews.</li>
            <li>That may seem like a small thing, but this bottle is very small and the liquid very potent, so that&#x27;s more important than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>a big plus was the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>to the design of the bottle, you will find that the fluid pours slowly at first and speeds up really quickly as the bottle drains.</li>
            <li>My first bottle went through quick because I didn&#x27;t realize this and dumped the last 1/3 of it on my foot in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>I like the tea tree oil bought from them more than the other brands.  </li>
            <li>Using a bit of this before going to bed cleared up the irritations and red bumps on my face a significant amount overnight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is truly an amazing product  and I highly recommend it to people with toenail fungus that had to go through all kinds of trouble to hide and cover it up.</li>
            <li>For someone who regularly uses essential oils I&#x27;m sure this is probably a well known &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; but for me... not so much.</li>
            <li>is my first time buying it, but it works well on my acne and skin problems so far.</li>
            <li>squeeze all the discharge out of the pit and then add a couple drops of tea tree oil directly in to the hole (or as my horrified wife said, &amp;#34;directly in to your head!&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>, I usually don&#x27;t mind that kind of thing</li>
            <li>I have to complete the treatment first</li>
            <li>I just decided that I would live with it!</li>
            <li>This new batch was rancid!</li>
            <li>Needless-to-say, within a month my fungus was healed and my new nail started to grow very rapidly.</li>
            <li>The top is odd...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent price for the amount.</li>
            <li>THE SCENT IS A LITTLE STRONG AT FIRST, BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality (from what I can tell)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li>I have dark skin and these areas were always very light and would never heal to match my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled a little better, but cant have everything.</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops in my shampoo and conditioner for that fresh, clean feel.</li>
            <li>I add it to my conditioner , and  mix with other oil for moisture and to help easy my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I suggest using this at night or when you won&#x27;t be around other people for a couple hours or so as the strong scent lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Hard to say how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Not diluted like so many other products so this lasts a long time and is strong enough for all needs.</li>
            <li>This product really helped, did not hurt my ears (as other versions have in the past) and is very nice.  </li>
            <li>lt worked well, fingernails clear and toes much improved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use it now for a few days which i don&#x27;t think is enough time to really give an accurate statement as to if it works well or not.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li>If you have the same issue as me, it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li>It will not last long because the oil pretty much pours out, it doesn&#x27;t drop out like most essential oil products</li>
            <li>Not sure if this works for skin tags but definitely smell good.</li>
            <li>Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks, and the nail seems to be growing out healthy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cover my whole face though, just a small dab on top of the pimples and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried buying high heels with covered toes, wearing socks and shoes to every function (I live in Hawaii and a lot of us go barefoot in people&#x27;s homes).</li>
            <li>good product, i haven&#x27;t bought alot of different brands of tea tree oil, just this and one other, and they were both the same to me.</li>
            <li>The oil is %100 pure and has a very distinct smell that does take a little getting use to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it can be a little strong but easily diluted with other oils.</li>
            <li>In 3 days it had healed faster and today it is almost all covered with new skin.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I could live with the dropper.</li>
            <li>because of inventory issues they DID NOT replace the item, they just made a refund and told me to make a new order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night, and it has been keeping new blemishes away for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li>We have just moved into a new house and we have tons of spiders.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all for skin tags and smells like you live in a pine forest.</li>
            <li>CANNOT live without tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating for a couple of reason, this is hard to find locally and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Finally, 100% pure oil!</li>
            <li>I use it only for cleaning products, so I&#x27;m not very concerned about the quality, more the scent.</li>
            <li>One bottle has lasted me about a month so far, but I just started using it more heavily.  </li>
            <li>I have used this oil for 9 days, nightly, straight from the bottle with no other dilution.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It comes at a very reasonable price too, which is an extra bonus.  </li>
            <li>Now as soon as I put tea tree it stops and gets dry very fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few skin tags in not so fun places, and within days they fell right off.</li>
            <li>Removed skin tag completely in 2 days!  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend had a ringworm that had grown pretty big</li>
            <li>You have to be patient, but in 5 weeks it was completely gone!  </li>
            <li>I had a pretty big one on my neck.</li>
            <li>I have used tea tree oil in the past, but this smells and feels much more concentrated.</li>
            <li>small bottle of magic tea tree stuff.</li>
            <li>Seeing that I am using other products (vitamin E and Missha), I can still say that after adding the tea tree oil to my regimen, it has made a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have used other essential oil brands that cost much more</li>
            <li>but the tea tree oil is a HUGE let down.</li>
            <li>I use this for my new acne and old acne spots...</li>
            <li>The first bottle of tea tree oil I bought was from a local herbal shop &amp; it must have been diluted because this is far stronger.</li>
            <li>You can dilute or use full strength but this is for external use only.</li>
            <li>Slight smell but fine, ordered 2 bottles so far, will continue as well.</li>
            <li>It does work well for burning in a burner and for using (sparringly) in bath products, it does not smell as nice as some others that I have used in the past, but overall it does have the medicinal qualities I need</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of the afflictions, but it&#x27;s sure soothing.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a natural tick and flea repellant for my dog and so far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li>tree oil has a sharp, slightly sweet, medicinal smell.  </li>
            <li>This pure tree oil is much different and the result was immediate.</li>
            <li>It and the pure melaleuca oils are the only thing I have found that work.</li>
            <li>I use 3 drops of the PlantTherapy tea tree mixed with 6-7drops of pure argan.</li>
            <li>the applicator is just a flat top with a hole with a tube that goes down into the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This tea tree oil was of very good quality and didn&#x27;t smell absolutely abhorrent like one that I got at a drugstore once.</li>
            <li>The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones.</li>
            <li>I tried other products, including &#x27;drawing salve&#x27; but nothing worked as quickly as this.</li>
            <li>, I use it for my dry itchy scalp and it works wonders,I also make my own body scrubs with other essential oils and tea tree is one the oils I use.</li>
            <li>This oil will clear up your acne and help it heal.</li>
            <li>With blemish free skin in my not so distant future, I can deal with that.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was suppose to clear up athletics foot.  </li>
            <li>clearly a sign of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the cyst, it minimized it so much that a doctor said it was not well-defined enough to remove it</li>
            <li>this will keep the bugs off/away from the plants the natural way</li>
            <li>I was trying to find natural alternatives</li>
            <li>He loves it &amp; uses it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I use this for face wash and all natural dandruff control.</li>
            <li>and it is natural</li>
            <li>So far, I have applied it once and the anti-fungal properties seem to be helping.</li>
            <li>I apply directly to my skin, then the lotion after it dries.</li>
            <li>, I applied it directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li>and it had worked well thus far.</li>
            <li>So far it is working well</li>
            <li>ordered this product in early April 2015 and have tried to apply it twice a day</li>
            <li>I have been using it for eight days and the blemish is healing and almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>The area scabbed up a bit and once the scab feel off, I could see my natural skin color peaking through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you want a natural product.</li>
            <li>Granted, they were very sore the last couple days, the product did what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two weeks, 2 times a day it is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>It came in a padded envelope and the container was completely sealed.</li>
            <li>but I find the benefits far out weigh the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product was sent professionally and I received it within days.</li>
            <li>It runs out a bit too fast so get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>and I am 34 yrs old)</li>
            <li>I got this bottle of tea tree oil because I&#x27;d heard it is a natural way to fight mold and mildew.  </li>
            <li>I used it daily like it said but nothing really helped by using this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m amazed how I&#x27;ve cured things naturally.  </li>
            <li>Been using it on my scalp and so far it&#x27;s working to reduce flaking.</li>
            <li>and they company actually sent me a whole bottle at no cost.  </li>
            <li>Next time I use this it will be without the water so that I can really get the smell.</li>
            <li>I apply it 3-4 times a day directly on the cyst, and it is working wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t need fake reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for skin tags and it&#x27;s working slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>In little time I have notice that the infected area is slowing returning to its original color.</li>
            <li>I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face with Missha Super Aqua anti trouble wash, use the  matching toner (I used Missha&#x27;s acne care alone for over a month with fewer new breakouts</li>
            <li>There are some complaints about a dropper, but my bottle has a little plastic insert on the inside that just stops it from pouring much like what you see on a hot sauce bottle.    </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a few skin tags</li>
            <li>I mix a few drops with my shampoo during the week to help clean my scalp and prevent dandruff.</li>
            <li>The bottle is small, but one to two drops on a cotton ball is more than enough.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way and it has many uses.</li>
            <li>High quality essential oil in a user-friendly bottle.</li>
            <li>Came as subscripted high quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li>If  you need a little bit of Tree Oil and need to hit a spot about the size of a Quarter or larger this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li>, the nails on my big toes had some time ago developed a layer in the middle that always had something growing under it, from a time when I didn&#x27;t really take care of my feet at all.  </li>
            <li>I barely have used any of it so far.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to work, and the warts looked worse before they got better, but now they are completely gone!  </li>
            <li>(twice if I can remember) and the left toe is growing out normally, I&#x27;d say to 70%.</li>
            <li>Pure Essential Oils supplied the Tea Tree (Melaleuca) Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>Definitely 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>I do find that I am sensitive to the smell if I apply too much, and have to be careful not to cause a headache.</li>
            <li>Not sure what what tea tree this came from sure wasn&#x27;t Earl Grey.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only sampled the odor of tea tree oil in products that are blending serval &amp;#34;ingredients.&amp;#34; I expected a fresh, invigorating aroma..</li>
            <li>Finally, after all those expensive products I used to buy, now I&#x27;m sticking with this product for GOOD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, so a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>I have toe nail fungus on two of my toes on both feet; both are on the exact same second toe from the big toe.</li>
            <li>I have had no other breakouts.  </li>
            <li>no other fongal cream works on me, after using it for a week</li>
            <li>For its small size, it should have just shriveled up and fallen off (or have been easy enough to pluck off).  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again as I need it, but so far no black mold returning</li>
            <li>Pretty strong but bit expensive.</li>
            <li>Mix with distilled water, shake before applying with a small spray bottle or dab with clean cotton squares.  </li>
            <li>Granted, it smells like pure gasoline and WILL sting your eyes and nose with fumes alone if you use it around those areas, so be careful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for simple topical fungus.</li>
            <li>Before this purchase I was skeptical about whether some homeopathic solution could do better than high grade pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;This would only work with high quality tea tree oil, so I will definitely be using this brand again.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was larger, but I can&#x27;t knock them for that as it clearly states the size in the description.</li>
            <li>Upon observing that nail fungus treatments nearly all had this in them, I decided to use it independently.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get severe shaving irritations on my nech, upper lip area, and near the cornsers of my mouth and</li>
            <li>I used this specific product on a wart that my 8 year old nephew had for about 3 years on his index finger.  </li>
            <li>Only used it once so far so can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
            <li>The item came before expected delivery date and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make a toner out of the oil for daily prevention after my face is cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better or worse than others.  </li>
            <li>I heard that Tea Tree oil on the temples was useful for getting rid of headaches, even migraines, I put a few drops on each of his temples and rubbed it in</li>
            <li>I used tea tree oil for the kind of breakout that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager  - weird, rashy type of breakout.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bonus that I don&#x27;t have to dilute it or worry about it irritating me even more.</li>
            <li>certain we&#x27;ll find loads of other uses, too, but if that&#x27;s all it ever does...</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I have been looking for at such a reasonable price over what I can find in my small rural town.</li>
            <li>, she handed me a pure 100% bottle of cold fused tea tree oil and I smelled it, it smelled tons better than this brand.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say, other than it is what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>I did order other diluted tree oil before and it did not help much for fungus in nails.</li>
            <li>and these oils compare very well with those produced by other companies.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 bottles of this so far to treat my reoccurring foot... trouble... and can attest that this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the next day I had a red welt near a spot I had placed it</li>
            <li>, it does not dry out your face, leave any sticky/oily feeling</li>
            <li>and once I put a little of this (mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier) it cleared right up.</li>
            <li>We also mix this with other essential oils aromatically for certain outcomes.</li>
            <li>So far I still have ten fingers and ten toes, but my skin seems the same.</li>
            <li>Skin tags reduced dramatically after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>I have read online that the medicines for toenail fungus are pretty harsh on your liver and they are often ineffective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt this isn&#x27;t 100% pure essencial oil, but from what I previous believed</li>
            <li>Not sure if I am bold enough to try that but will definitely try on scars.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this option over the other home remedies you might consider to avoid the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Further exploring online lead me to discover that Vicks VapoRub had been used successfully by some people as well as tea tree oil - and neither had bad side effects.  </li>
            <li>Bought it hoping to clear up some dry itchy skin...</li>
            <li>Have you ever gone to bed with a clear face, only to wake up the next morning with a big red spot glaring back at you in the mirror??  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the money, I was a bit skeptical at first as well but just try it.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this product, I have had no new acne and the old ones</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li>I went through this little bottle of Tea Tree Oil fast.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, yet reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is a good or bad thing, but I prefer it.</li>
            <li>It seems to stop the flare-up, which means less antibiotics for more serious flare-ups.  </li>

            <li> The uses have been great</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is great for bumps, although it stings if the skin is exposed.  </li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> so great shipping time in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tea Tree oil because I read it was great for adding to water and cleaning sponges.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Internet a great place for the good and bad.....buyer beware.</li>
            <li> A handy oil to have around!</li>
            <li> Nice product, but keep it away from your cats!</li>
            <li> I successfully held oral thrush at bay whilst waiting for my doc to return from vacation by rinsing with 2 drops of tea tree and two drops of cinnamon oils TID.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> This is great for killing mold, bacteria, and viruses, plus it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> Some really nice stuff!</li>
            <li> &quot; I looked at many before I decided on this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with the choice.</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff works great for athletes feet, its a really good product and smells like pinesol.  </li>
            <li> Good product, great results, good price.</li>
            <li> It kills funguses, bacteria, viruses in your home and leaves a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Being so strong, the scent does linger for a bit, so I find it best to use well before going out, or at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I will not worry about using it all because I have found a great place to get more!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it seemed like a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good quality and one of the cheapest I found.  </li>

            <li> Its a good product it would work better if there was a dropper inside either way</li>

            <li> Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..</li>
            <li> Nice feel on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Its the best remedy and a very practical gift to give to any one.</li>
            <li> so I started doing my own research and came across forums recommending tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with another brand of tea tree oil (the Desert Essence brand wasn&#x27;t noticeably effective).  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to do... but smells really really nice.</li>
            <li> All good things take time, but using this for over a month or so now, my acne has subsided for the most part.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. :)</li>
            <li> I think it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Including instructions on how to use it with the shipping would be nice too.</li>
            <li> it does smell nice though.</li>

            <li> I use this when I wash my hair for scout treason and it works it is a very strong smell of the tree oil</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong but I have gotten used to it.  </li>

            <li> So far, it is working great!</li>

            <li> better than any I have used</li>
            <li> One of the best essential oils in my collection.</li>
            <li> You should always dilute this oil, like most oils.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> I cant say I love the taste</li>

            <li> I will buy again. :)</li>
            <li> A couple of cautions to keep in mind; tea tree oil is toxic for dogs and cats, so make sure anything you have used it with (i.e. cotton balls, spray solutions, etc.) are kept where the fur babies can&#x27;t get at it</li>
            <li> After some research on tea tree oil, I have found that it has so many uses.</li>
            <li> And the company even sends a courtesy email to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I did a search and saw many people saying they did a tea tree oil spray</li>
            <li> I massage the oil over them and my nails are enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li> my skin seems to be doing better.</li>
            <li> This product would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so runny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also excellent as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal, especially for the skin.  </li>
            <li> once or twice a week I put some drops on top of my toothbrush and/or floss it in.</li>
            <li> It has been driving me nuts that nothing worked....until this magic potion arrived.</li>
            <li> and I love that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> need to learn more uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there are many more uses for Tea Tree Oil, so we will keep on experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;Overview:</li>
            <li> More than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It has that tea tree smell that I love.  </li>

            <li> LOVE this brand of oils.</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of Tea Tree Oil, but I can understand it&#x27;s an acquired smell for others.</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be completely satisfied</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use many otc skin products.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and results I get from cleaning</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I thought of it as the better alternative.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> SO AS YOU CAN SEE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Decided to switch over to the tea tree oil and see if that worked any better.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it until the nail (hopefully) grows out healthy and will then probably use it once a week or so as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the numerous wonderful benefits of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil for my foot bath to keep me healthy after a pedicure and for my dogs feet as well.</li>
            <li> I like the one from Thursday Plantation much better, though it is pricier</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Tea Tree Essential Oil is an excellent quality oil.</li>

            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I know about it now</li>
            <li> My wife uses the oils mostly.</li>
            <li> seems one of the better ones I&#x27;ve bought for the affordable price though I can&#x27;t tell for sure</li>
            <li> Since tea tree oil has so many uses, I will continue to keep a bottle of this in my cabinet at all times.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but I bought this more for its antiseptic, antifungal and antibacterial properties.</li>

            <li> I already knew so many benefits of Tea Tree Oil and is a must in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would buy from them again :).  </li>
            <li> I love associating smells with memories.</li>
            <li> was pleased with product.</li>
            <li> The smell is as potent as it gets for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about the many benefits of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells great!</li>
            <li> She has healthy skin growing now after just three applications.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the European dropper isn&#x27;t all that wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Great product use the oil for a face wash and works great also has many other uses</li>
            <li> I had bought it originally to use it for skin tags and now I make my own ear mite treatment with this for my dog (poisonous for cats), age spots, fever blisters, oil diffuser, etc.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of it, but it is very strong and can see why some people might not like it.  </li>
            <li> Loved this product,  exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> Used it for some fungal issues, which were dealt with quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li> Great quality product at a fantastic price.....will come back for more oils!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very good for headaches,the flu has recently gone around our house that came with a headache...</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Essential Oil is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> the odor produced is very high which suggests a good extraction method without degrading a lot the oil itself.</li>
            <li> Totally good essential oil, i am very glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I might get a couple drops too many now and then, but I&#x27;m not doing precise measuring.  </li>
            <li> Great for the natural pharmacy</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is fabulous, works for so many infections, fungal and otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great natural way to get rid of itchy bug bites.  </li>
            <li> Works great and natural.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping and great results.</li>
            <li> After reading many details and reviews, I ordered it and was excited to use it on myself for some blemish issues.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product!</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> and it dries up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Company has a great product selection and I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> It is literally an all-around useful product with great results.</li>
            <li> However, the aroma is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, but it dissipates within a day or so.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is offensively strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but I can handle it considering the results you get from it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be strong and undiluted as advertised.</li>
            <li> Strong smell, but</li>
            <li> Really, really strong stuff.</li>
            <li> odor is STRONG and I send my fiance screaming from the room whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> It had a strong turpentine smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but nothing overbearing and what you would expect from a tree oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is indeed strong but that&#x27;s tea tree for you -</li>
            <li> Really, really strong sent.</li>
            <li> I do like it - even if the scent is initially strong upon application.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t always been consistent but the results are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> People will make fun of you for your strong smell!</li>
            <li> I got the Cinnamon Bark and Lavender oils from this brand and both smell fine</li>
            <li> If you just need to pour this out into your hands or an applicator of some sort, this product is fine for you.  </li>
            <li> and after a couple of days, it clears quickly!  </li>
            <li> and I bet you will be amazed how quickly things heal up!</li>
            <li> The euro dropper takes a little getting used to, but all in all this product has been great!</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my scalp due to the dryness I was experiencing, it works like a charm, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Also great for my Chinese crested skin.  </li>
            <li> i miss it with my daily moisturizer to put on my face, it feels great.</li>
            <li> I use it in my 2nd rinse cycle of washing cloth diapers and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Add two drops of the oil on the Qtip/cottonball and lightly apply it around ON the tag.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil!</li>
            <li> Try not to add too much if you are making your own hair products (my mistake).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic).  </li>
            <li> This is an unbiased review as I was not given a free sample in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter got diagnosed with Molluscum contagiosum and the dices said no treatment available.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil that I ordered is a fantastic buy for the price.</li>
            <li> because I already opened it &amp; it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil for a variety of different uses.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic..</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I caught him and he turned wild and got me good.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> Sure is pure!</li>
            <li> The smell is REALLY strong but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> Prescription ointments have worked best for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> but make sure to educate yourself first.  </li>
            <li> Great for treating wounds, minor wounds.</li>
            <li> Okay first I ordered peppermint oil from this company and now the tea tree . . .</li>
            <li> Exactly as specified, so many uses I could write a book.</li>
            <li> So useful!</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my foot cream and it keeps the skin from thickening and my feet are super smooth.</li>
            <li> Clean tag area with soapy water.</li>
            <li> Amazing, it instantly numbed it, much better then clove oil.</li>
            <li> I guess a prior kind was junk because this is potent.</li>
            <li> Face feels so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my home for scrapes, cuts and bruises, also when I have had minor dental issues, it works very well as a rinse until you can see a dentist, three drops to warm water, rinse, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> - I usually keep a bottle on-hand at home and work for quick application, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Nothing too special about it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Make sure to dilute properly, it seems to be very strong.</li>
            <li> It is no longer discolored and the cuticle is not black anymore - it is healthy!</li>
            <li> This is very high quality, potent oil.  </li>
            <li> Just great- no problems expected</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be a great quality and was just what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> True tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> My order arrived as promised and the product is full strength, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for about a week or more, and i have to say i have not broken out since.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy essential oils are always good.</li>
            <li> It comes in an amber colored glass bottle with a stopper at the top to help control how much comes out at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone that says tea tree oil removes warts or skin tags is full of it.  </li>
            <li> She read somewhere that it was good to use as a pimple reducer, but made them swell up and turn red</li>
            <li> No effect after using full bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, got rid of my dandruff in short order and all that stuff.</li>
            <li> If it was good enough for them it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> So I thought I really had nothing to lose to try this product before I sought a more rigorous means of healing.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, though.</li>
            <li> I found that the Tea Tree oil smells so strongly that she is much more cautious and doesn&#x27;t get near my arm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong at first</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is strong at first, since I wasn&#x27;t used to it, but</li>
            <li> Product is great and is pure tea tree essential oils.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got other oils from this brand that were great, but this tea tree oil just doesn&#x27;t seem quite as concentrated as others she has used.</li>
            <li> I decided to see what other uses and discovered it was great for acne or scars.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the euro dropper at first, but it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tea tree oil brand that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s definitely the best.</li>
            <li> It has helped her tremendously</li>
            <li> Shippment was quick &amp; the description fits the product.  </li>
            <li> It dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I rub the oil on twice a day and it quickly absorbs into the nail.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face, and pimples disappear really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick Shipment, product as described, and works.  </li>
            <li> shipped relatively quick, and the oil itself</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and it dries it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> For my mild yet persistent surface redness and dryness it looked like I had used rubbing alcohol on it.</li>
            <li> Im happy with this bottle and packaging BECAUSE it doesnt come out too fast, there is some home party brand out there that will charge you twice to triple the price for the same thing, but the problem with their brand is the bottles and plastic stoppers</li>
            <li> Dabbing a bit on mild acne breakouts works well too.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil really does a great job of healing and we use it for both human and animal applications.</li>
            <li> With hormonal issues, I can&#x27;t be free of breakouts, but this essential oil has been keeping my face much more beautiful than when I was using other agents as written.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for acne flareups.  </li>
            <li> : Cheap, Works exactly as described, virtually painless, no scarring or discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One drop is more than enough as the smell is kind of intense, it may even make your eyes water a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is PURE and STRONG.</li>
            <li> , they are soooo big and loose that the oils POUR out, this is perfect, I can tape out a drop or two, or use a clean Qtip to get it out.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong when you first put it on, but within a few minutes it fades to a sweet lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product but as others have indicated, it needs new packaging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the pleasant smell I expected.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and felt it was worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a very natural and refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> This really helped the keloid I had on my ear!!</li>
            <li> It must be diluted first!</li>
            <li> He puts this on his toenails .. pretty strong smelling at first but fades.</li>
            <li> Anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil should take note of the VERY pungent smell as well, but I love this oil and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a dropper so the oil would come out a little smoother, but it is great.</li>
            <li> The oil inside seems fine, but I&#x27;ve found buying a bigger bottle with an eyedropper works better.</li>
            <li> I know this stuff is pure and potent because you can really feel that cooling tingline effect where you Apply</li>
            <li> I have used others that I liked a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Overall this tea tree oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but put up with it because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> making my own personal Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> I took a while for my body to adjust to it, but now my body odor is practically gone, so the oil is worth it for that</li>
            <li> Definitely useful around the house (cleaning).  </li>
            <li> Having heard that tea tree is a natural antibacterial agent, and that people use it on ear piercings, I got the idea that I may be able to use it to control my infected sinus pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased about 20 essential oils from this company and in every case the product was powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> I went to my massage therapist today who makes her own essential oil mixes and asked her if she knew what Tea Tree oil was supposed to sell</li>
            <li> The service was quick and the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Super fast processing and shipping!</li>
            <li> On time, super, we use it for healing, cuts and sores.&lt;br /&gt;Right sizes to add to first aid bag for the car</li>
            <li> And the best part was that the area surrounding the tag turned very rough and red...</li>
            <li> It is amazing how it takes a raw, sore cyst and makes it feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my sons toenail fungus and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li> this stuff tamp&#x27;s it right</li>
            <li> It is affordable and is just the right size.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different TT oils and this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> so, i pretty much got free one day shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have a normal dropper, or one of those glass rods attached to the top.   </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is great for acne and other cuts/abrasions to help with the healing process and I would highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a legitimate medical website that stated pure Tea Tree oil has been found effective in fighting toenail fungus - it said 60% of people will see results within 6 months if used twice a day.</li>
            <li> I use a q-tip which works perfectly because you only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> Its pure and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> It smells strong, not unpleasant, I&#x27;m sure it is what it claims to be, if you put some in a plastic cup with a little water it will melt the cup within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I only used the oil twice and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This has been great on my red, flakey, open eczema rashes.</li>
            <li> Sure the smell is strong, kind of like sandalwood mixed with eucalyptus, but there are a lot of whining babies on these reviews complaining about the smell and missing the miraculous anti fungus, bacterial and virual properties it has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit the euro dropper is strange but if you hold it upside down and have 2 seconds of patience, a perfect drop will fall out.</li>
            <li> so you cant just put some on your finger and on your face, it was very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The seller got the product to me very fast.</li>
            <li> and it dries them very fast.</li>
            <li> Nice, high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use it in shampoo, I normally start with about 3-5 drops per full shampoo bottle to test it.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> but I knew ahead of time exactly how the item was.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try anything to prevent her or us from ever getting it.  </li>
            <li> and so far she has been lice free.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to try this.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> You have to invert it multiple times to get drops on your skin and sometimes it would pour out more than intended.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for removing skin tags!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using directly on my skin for some type of bizarre rash that keep recurring.</li>
            <li> By the second day, the rash is gone, so Tea Tree is working much better than hydrocortisone</li>
            <li> felines just got their first flea outbreak of the summer</li>
            <li> (Actually, my homemade deodorant works better than any store bought deodorant I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> This oil came exactly is described.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase it :)</li>
            <li> ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS HOW IT IS DISPENCED FROM BOTTLE, WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HAD A DROPPER.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, I was using it to try to eliminate a skin tag on my arm, it is a pretty tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> This oil is an absolute miracle!</li>
            <li> Product received was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> it is really a versatile product!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did this again for the next 4 days, twice a day, and now my nose is bump free!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> and it really does the job!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as advertised-a 10 mL bottle of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I got</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work consistently.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packaged and is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and expect to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I love your essential oils.  </li>
            <li> shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I use it in a hot bath and it has&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li> The smell is obviously tea tree which is invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you know tea tree, it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like roses.</li>
            <li> There is no cure, so diet changes and homeopathic remedies are usually the best result since doctors only want to put you on extended doses of antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Most recently, I ordered some to combine with sulphur and vaseline to heal a fungal infection/wound on one of our horses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong, and you either love it or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way too much time pouring over items in the pharmacy, trying to find some sort of skin cream/wash/cloth that effectively combats acne and skin problems, usually with mixed results at best.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a lot like strong PineSol, but a little more pure.  </li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with other products to make my own deodorant, soap, and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If you are into natural remedies, this is definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> very effective while also leaving my skin feeling smooth and much less dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a dab on problem areas at night and by the next morning they are significantly reduced!</li>
            <li> After battling for over 3 months with sudden onset adult acne (the cystic kind</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I was overall, pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what the label says, 100% pure undiluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> pure , undiluted,  I recommend your getting  it and keeping it in your home or first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil along with other items the inside of the package was great but the outside wasn&#x27;t so hot.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was a little put off by the smell as I wasn&#x27;t familiar with how potent it should be.</li>
            <li> At first the smell is a bit much, but it goes away after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So happy to finally have found something that works!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, for any other HS sufferers, I am also taking 90mg of zinc every day.</li>
            <li> If, on the other hand, you are trying to put this directly on a cut or something, good luck.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it if you live in tropical or subtropical regions for anti fungus / ant bacterial issues related to warm climates.</li>
            <li> In my case, it took five months of on-and-off inconsistent application and more recently, only one month of application once to twice daily to see amazing results in my recently torn, traumatized nail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to see if it would help with small skin irritations and it has been very good; my husband noticed that he was starting to get a fever blister</li>
            <li> love it, it&#x27;s exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> The item arrived really quickly and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I love every single one.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I bought this purely for the use of removing skin tags.</li>
            <li> Just remember it is pure oil</li>
            <li> For this to work well the oil must be pure and it has worked wonders with this brand.</li>
            <li> This is pure tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I used this tea tree oil in conjunction with 100% pure, organic aloe vera gel, to heal a sebacious cyst.  </li>
            <li> but I think i will just face the fact that all things won&#x27;t work for certain people.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been using a bit of pure aloe vera with it also.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> personal favorite combination of essential oils is:  6 drops tea tree oil, 8 drops sweet orange oil, 10 drops vanilla oil.  </li>
            <li> Being new to using Essential Oil&#x27;s, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out, but now I&#x27;m cluing in.</li>
            <li> I use this for fungus on my toe nail ,cold sore ,fleas bite ,and many others too many to names it all ,love melaleuca tea tree oil ,my first experience with tea tree oil is from the direct sale tea tree oil ,but I like the Amazon prices</li>
            <li> This one is very high quality.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s really 100% pure (who can, anyway?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use Clove OIl which helps a little but is not too effective.</li>
            <li> I use it for cleaning and topical uses (properly diluted) and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and the shipping was very prompt</li>
            <li> It really helped</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser desight really helps apply it efficiently too.</li>
            <li> Much faster than any product I&#x27;ve used which is made specifically for fighting zits, and faster than just washing alone.  </li>
            <li> i received free 2-day shipping from amazon prime, and even so, it came the NEXT day.</li>
            <li> It saved me much embarassment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for foot baths and also put it straight on my feet and toenails.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I used all sorts of dandruff shampoos and none really worked.</li>
            <li> However, the spout on this bottle doesn&#x27;t really work like a &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It smells to me like a walk in the woods after a gentle rain.</li>
            <li> I received my package fast and the products are not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to use tea tree oil either</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was ready to give up until I read reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> You have to figure out how much to apply.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a spa, very relaxing and calming.  </li>
            <li> I also tried it on a couple eczema spots that I have, it did help it stop itching but didn&#x27;t really improve the look of the skin</li>
            <li> Used this product on removing skin tags, worked very well.</li>
            <li> It really is undilutd.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help for me, its very liquidy</li>
            <li> But it worked and worked fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very controlled, drop-by-drop.  </li>
            <li> After much research we decided to try this.</li>
            <li> A smelly modern version of snake oil, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say if this product would have taken that skin tag off if I had kept applying the oil a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ... works really well for her..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not remove skin tags.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with tension headaches and the smell</li>
            <li> so it really did workand</li>
            <li> I really like this tea tree oil by Plant Therapy.  </li>
            <li> After reading much hype about the benefits if tea tree oil, I purchased this product based on the ratings.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing,</li>
            <li> I use Tea Tree oil very often since I am a type 1 diabetic using an insulin pump and a continuous monitoring system.</li>
            <li> I forget to use it on a regular basis like we were supposed to, but my son applies it and it smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The way this bottle is designed way too much came out and I finished the whole bottle in one week.</li>
            <li> Thanks Plant Therapy Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> just as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> and it is far better than the similar product that the doctor prescribed.</li>
            <li> Always be sure to check the properties and warnings even for natural products like essential oils.</li>
            <li> When I use it regularly the bump is nearly gone and the piercing seems to be healing better.  </li>
            <li> The smell is definitely very strong, but I was already expecting that from previous reviews.</li>
            <li> That may seem like a small thing, but this bottle is very small and the liquid very potent, so that&#x27;s more important than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> a big plus was the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> to the design of the bottle, you will find that the fluid pours slowly at first and speeds up really quickly as the bottle drains.</li>
            <li> My first bottle went through quick because I didn&#x27;t realize this and dumped the last 1/3 of it on my foot in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> I like the tea tree oil bought from them more than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Using a bit of this before going to bed cleared up the irritations and red bumps on my face a significant amount overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is truly an amazing product  and I highly recommend it to people with toenail fungus that had to go through all kinds of trouble to hide and cover it up.</li>
            <li> For someone who regularly uses essential oils I&#x27;m sure this is probably a well known &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; but for me... not so much.</li>
            <li> is my first time buying it, but it works well on my acne and skin problems so far.</li>
            <li> squeeze all the discharge out of the pit and then add a couple drops of tea tree oil directly in to the hole (or as my horrified wife said, &amp;#34;directly in to your head!&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> , I usually don&#x27;t mind that kind of thing</li>
            <li> I have to complete the treatment first</li>
            <li> I just decided that I would live with it!</li>
            <li> This new batch was rancid!</li>
            <li> Needless-to-say, within a month my fungus was healed and my new nail started to grow very rapidly.</li>
            <li> The top is odd...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent price for the amount.</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS A LITTLE STRONG AT FIRST, BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality (from what I can tell)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li> I have dark skin and these areas were always very light and would never heal to match my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled a little better, but cant have everything.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my shampoo and conditioner for that fresh, clean feel.</li>
            <li> I add it to my conditioner , and  mix with other oil for moisture and to help easy my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I suggest using this at night or when you won&#x27;t be around other people for a couple hours or so as the strong scent lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Hard to say how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Not diluted like so many other products so this lasts a long time and is strong enough for all needs.</li>
            <li> This product really helped, did not hurt my ears (as other versions have in the past) and is very nice.  </li>
            <li> lt worked well, fingernails clear and toes much improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use it now for a few days which i don&#x27;t think is enough time to really give an accurate statement as to if it works well or not.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li> If you have the same issue as me, it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li> It will not last long because the oil pretty much pours out, it doesn&#x27;t drop out like most essential oil products</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works for skin tags but definitely smell good.</li>
            <li> Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks, and the nail seems to be growing out healthy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cover my whole face though, just a small dab on top of the pimples and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried buying high heels with covered toes, wearing socks and shoes to every function (I live in Hawaii and a lot of us go barefoot in people&#x27;s homes).</li>
            <li> good product, i haven&#x27;t bought alot of different brands of tea tree oil, just this and one other, and they were both the same to me.</li>
            <li> The oil is %100 pure and has a very distinct smell that does take a little getting use to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it can be a little strong but easily diluted with other oils.</li>
            <li> In 3 days it had healed faster and today it is almost all covered with new skin.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I could live with the dropper.</li>
            <li> because of inventory issues they DID NOT replace the item, they just made a refund and told me to make a new order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night, and it has been keeping new blemishes away for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> We have just moved into a new house and we have tons of spiders.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all for skin tags and smells like you live in a pine forest.</li>
            <li> CANNOT live without tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating for a couple of reason, this is hard to find locally and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Finally, 100% pure oil!</li>
            <li> I use it only for cleaning products, so I&#x27;m not very concerned about the quality, more the scent.</li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted me about a month so far, but I just started using it more heavily.  </li>
            <li> I have used this oil for 9 days, nightly, straight from the bottle with no other dilution.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It comes at a very reasonable price too, which is an extra bonus.  </li>
            <li> Now as soon as I put tea tree it stops and gets dry very fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few skin tags in not so fun places, and within days they fell right off.</li>
            <li> Removed skin tag completely in 2 days!  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend had a ringworm that had grown pretty big</li>
            <li> You have to be patient, but in 5 weeks it was completely gone!  </li>
            <li> I had a pretty big one on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil in the past, but this smells and feels much more concentrated.</li>
            <li> small bottle of magic tea tree stuff.</li>
            <li> Seeing that I am using other products (vitamin E and Missha), I can still say that after adding the tea tree oil to my regimen, it has made a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have used other essential oil brands that cost much more</li>
            <li> but the tea tree oil is a HUGE let down.</li>
            <li> I use this for my new acne and old acne spots...</li>
            <li> The first bottle of tea tree oil I bought was from a local herbal shop &amp; it must have been diluted because this is far stronger.</li>
            <li> You can dilute or use full strength but this is for external use only.</li>
            <li> Slight smell but fine, ordered 2 bottles so far, will continue as well.</li>
            <li> It does work well for burning in a burner and for using (sparringly) in bath products, it does not smell as nice as some others that I have used in the past, but overall it does have the medicinal qualities I need</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of the afflictions, but it&#x27;s sure soothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a natural tick and flea repellant for my dog and so far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> tree oil has a sharp, slightly sweet, medicinal smell.  </li>
            <li> This pure tree oil is much different and the result was immediate.</li>
            <li> It and the pure melaleuca oils are the only thing I have found that work.</li>
            <li> I use 3 drops of the PlantTherapy tea tree mixed with 6-7drops of pure argan.</li>
            <li> the applicator is just a flat top with a hole with a tube that goes down into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This tea tree oil was of very good quality and didn&#x27;t smell absolutely abhorrent like one that I got at a drugstore once.</li>
            <li> The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones.</li>
            <li> I tried other products, including &#x27;drawing salve&#x27; but nothing worked as quickly as this.</li>
            <li> , I use it for my dry itchy scalp and it works wonders,I also make my own body scrubs with other essential oils and tea tree is one the oils I use.</li>
            <li> This oil will clear up your acne and help it heal.</li>
            <li> With blemish free skin in my not so distant future, I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was suppose to clear up athletics foot.  </li>
            <li> clearly a sign of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the cyst, it minimized it so much that a doctor said it was not well-defined enough to remove it</li>
            <li> this will keep the bugs off/away from the plants the natural way</li>
            <li> I was trying to find natural alternatives</li>
            <li> He loves it &amp; uses it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I use this for face wash and all natural dandruff control.</li>
            <li> and it is natural</li>
            <li> So far, I have applied it once and the anti-fungal properties seem to be helping.</li>
            <li> I apply directly to my skin, then the lotion after it dries.</li>
            <li> , I applied it directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li> and it had worked well thus far.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well</li>
            <li> ordered this product in early April 2015 and have tried to apply it twice a day</li>
            <li> I have been using it for eight days and the blemish is healing and almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> The area scabbed up a bit and once the scab feel off, I could see my natural skin color peaking through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you want a natural product.</li>
            <li> Granted, they were very sore the last couple days, the product did what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two weeks, 2 times a day it is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> It came in a padded envelope and the container was completely sealed.</li>
            <li> but I find the benefits far out weigh the smell.  </li>
            <li> This product was sent professionally and I received it within days.</li>
            <li> It runs out a bit too fast so get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> and I am 34 yrs old)</li>
            <li> I got this bottle of tea tree oil because I&#x27;d heard it is a natural way to fight mold and mildew.  </li>
            <li> I used it daily like it said but nothing really helped by using this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed how I&#x27;ve cured things naturally.  </li>
            <li> Been using it on my scalp and so far it&#x27;s working to reduce flaking.</li>
            <li> and they company actually sent me a whole bottle at no cost.  </li>
            <li> Next time I use this it will be without the water so that I can really get the smell.</li>
            <li> I apply it 3-4 times a day directly on the cyst, and it is working wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t need fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for skin tags and it&#x27;s working slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li> In little time I have notice that the infected area is slowing returning to its original color.</li>
            <li> I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with Missha Super Aqua anti trouble wash, use the  matching toner (I used Missha&#x27;s acne care alone for over a month with fewer new breakouts</li>
            <li> There are some complaints about a dropper, but my bottle has a little plastic insert on the inside that just stops it from pouring much like what you see on a hot sauce bottle.    </li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a few skin tags</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with my shampoo during the week to help clean my scalp and prevent dandruff.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but one to two drops on a cotton ball is more than enough.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way and it has many uses.</li>
            <li> High quality essential oil in a user-friendly bottle.</li>
            <li> Came as subscripted high quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li> If  you need a little bit of Tree Oil and need to hit a spot about the size of a Quarter or larger this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li> , the nails on my big toes had some time ago developed a layer in the middle that always had something growing under it, from a time when I didn&#x27;t really take care of my feet at all.  </li>
            <li> I barely have used any of it so far.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to work, and the warts looked worse before they got better, but now they are completely gone!  </li>
            <li> (twice if I can remember) and the left toe is growing out normally, I&#x27;d say to 70%.</li>
            <li> Pure Essential Oils supplied the Tea Tree (Melaleuca) Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> Definitely 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> I do find that I am sensitive to the smell if I apply too much, and have to be careful not to cause a headache.</li>
            <li> Not sure what what tea tree this came from sure wasn&#x27;t Earl Grey.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only sampled the odor of tea tree oil in products that are blending serval &amp;#34;ingredients.&amp;#34; I expected a fresh, invigorating aroma..</li>
            <li> Finally, after all those expensive products I used to buy, now I&#x27;m sticking with this product for GOOD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, so a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I have toe nail fungus on two of my toes on both feet; both are on the exact same second toe from the big toe.</li>
            <li> I have had no other breakouts.  </li>
            <li> no other fongal cream works on me, after using it for a week</li>
            <li> For its small size, it should have just shriveled up and fallen off (or have been easy enough to pluck off).  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again as I need it, but so far no black mold returning</li>
            <li> Pretty strong but bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Mix with distilled water, shake before applying with a small spray bottle or dab with clean cotton squares.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it smells like pure gasoline and WILL sting your eyes and nose with fumes alone if you use it around those areas, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for simple topical fungus.</li>
            <li> Before this purchase I was skeptical about whether some homeopathic solution could do better than high grade pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;This would only work with high quality tea tree oil, so I will definitely be using this brand again.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was larger, but I can&#x27;t knock them for that as it clearly states the size in the description.</li>
            <li> Upon observing that nail fungus treatments nearly all had this in them, I decided to use it independently.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get severe shaving irritations on my nech, upper lip area, and near the cornsers of my mouth and</li>
            <li> I used this specific product on a wart that my 8 year old nephew had for about 3 years on his index finger.  </li>
            <li> Only used it once so far so can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
            <li> The item came before expected delivery date and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make a toner out of the oil for daily prevention after my face is cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better or worse than others.  </li>
            <li> I heard that Tea Tree oil on the temples was useful for getting rid of headaches, even migraines, I put a few drops on each of his temples and rubbed it in</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil for the kind of breakout that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager  - weird, rashy type of breakout.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bonus that I don&#x27;t have to dilute it or worry about it irritating me even more.</li>
            <li> certain we&#x27;ll find loads of other uses, too, but if that&#x27;s all it ever does...</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I have been looking for at such a reasonable price over what I can find in my small rural town.</li>
            <li> , she handed me a pure 100% bottle of cold fused tea tree oil and I smelled it, it smelled tons better than this brand.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say, other than it is what is advertised.  </li>
            <li> I did order other diluted tree oil before and it did not help much for fungus in nails.</li>
            <li> and these oils compare very well with those produced by other companies.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 bottles of this so far to treat my reoccurring foot... trouble... and can attest that this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the next day I had a red welt near a spot I had placed it</li>
            <li> , it does not dry out your face, leave any sticky/oily feeling</li>
            <li> and once I put a little of this (mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier) it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> We also mix this with other essential oils aromatically for certain outcomes.</li>
            <li> So far I still have ten fingers and ten toes, but my skin seems the same.</li>
            <li> Skin tags reduced dramatically after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> I have read online that the medicines for toenail fungus are pretty harsh on your liver and they are often ineffective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt this isn&#x27;t 100% pure essencial oil, but from what I previous believed</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am bold enough to try that but will definitely try on scars.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this option over the other home remedies you might consider to avoid the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Further exploring online lead me to discover that Vicks VapoRub had been used successfully by some people as well as tea tree oil - and neither had bad side effects.  </li>
            <li> Bought it hoping to clear up some dry itchy skin...</li>
            <li> Have you ever gone to bed with a clear face, only to wake up the next morning with a big red spot glaring back at you in the mirror??  </li>
            <li> definitely worth the money, I was a bit skeptical at first as well but just try it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product, I have had no new acne and the old ones</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I went through this little bottle of Tea Tree Oil fast.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, yet reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is a good or bad thing, but I prefer it.</li>
            <li> It seems to stop the flare-up, which means less antibiotics for more serious flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> Along with other essential oils and witch hazel, this repellent worked wonderfully, and I do not have to worry about wrecking my kidneys with DEET!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t given up but no positive results so far.</li>
            <li> Will find other all natural product to use this for.</li>
            <li> Within the night, the bump had gone down considerably!</li>
            <li> Now we have an adorable little Pom puppy with baby teeth like tiny pointed razors and she often missed her toys when we are playing and tags my thin skin arm drawing blood.  </li>
            <li> This tea tree oil dried it up right away and calmed down the rash</li>
            <li> I am still not sure what it was, but am thankful that it is now gone thanks to this tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know</li>
            <li> Long story short:  </li>
            <li> a sensitive area down south.</li>
            <li> She gave me a prescription for Ketoconazole, which has the potential for a whole lot of negative side effects including liver damage.  </li>
            <li> If you apply it to dry skin it dries it out even further and produced no visible beneficial medicinal effects.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting really dry scalp along my hairline</li>
            <li> WOW it dried up my husband staff infection he got on his back from the college gym!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil in general, but this one was a little bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> but my left toe is in worse shape than the right</li>
            <li> I mix it with other essential oils to make personal care products.</li>
            <li> Son developed a fungus on thumbs due to wet football gloves.</li>
            <li> When you do find it locally it has been mixed with other things, not what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It does have a very strong scent, but it&#x27;s not a scent that I find unpleasant, though some may.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and how they package them and the plastic insert in the bottle so this doesnt spill everywhere and isnt too hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from really bad dandruff post partum and was kind of &amp;#34;desperate&amp;#34; to find something that would &amp;#34;heal me&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Love putting it in my cold air humidifier.</li>
            <li> Should have all lasted longer if they are 100%concentrated as stated when you purchase from them, which I will not be doing, even though price was okay, product was disappointing</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had grown pretty self conscious about this</li>
            <li> so will use it for that so as not a complete loss.  </li>
            <li> I got it to keep my stretched lobes from getting funky (yes even when washed out)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with toenail fungus for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I apply moisturizer, then apply this over it, and do that every morning and night, and have been doing this for 2 weeks, and my skin has improved (my skin&#x27;s not completely healed, but it has been improved nonetheless).</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil for my cartilage piercing infection, and this along with sea salt soaks fixed the issue completely in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of a long time keloid on my earlobe.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a cartilage piercing in my ear that is taking a long time to heal.  </li>
            <li> I warned my husband and so he is extra careful with his bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over less expensive ones thinking it would be of better quality.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand because I have other essential oils from them</li>
            <li> I decided to write this \\&quot;review\\&quot; because after receiving my package, and coming back to the page, I realized that the one review for this product was written by someone from the company (They&#x27;ve also reviewed all the other \\&quot;Plant Therapy\\&quot; products)</li>
            <li> I use this product for my skin and for various other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do some research to see what other kinds of ailments this oil &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m totally sold.</li>
            <li> I have found other stores carrying 15 ml. of tea tree oil for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have used it for other things as well, such as ringworm and nail growth.</li>
            <li> and I think the tea tree oil helped dry it out faster</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that mentioned that it should not be used alone since it may dry out your skin</li>
            <li> , the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
            <li> We use a few drops of tea tree oil mixed with white vinegar and keep it in a spray bottle in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Long term use and dedicated daily applications will no doubt promote faster results but the oil stings slightly</li>
            <li> HAS HELPED CLEAR UP A FINGER NAIL PROBLEM I HAD, NOT SURE IF IT WAS FUNGUS</li>
            <li> but I have not had any adverse reactions, and if you&#x27;re looking for a solid source of Tea Tree Oil, no frills, additives or premium grade (I&#x27;m guessing this is average)</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the dispenser is not very accurate.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the product arriving with a loose cap and 25% of the oil leaked into the packaging, I believe the product will eventually aid in shrinking or removing skin tags.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using 2x a day its only 1/3 down.</li>
            <li> Tired of paying high prices when something this basic works.</li>
            <li> Now after each wash I apply the mixture and my dry scalp is all gone!</li>
            <li> It will dry up any pimples you&#x27;ve got too!</li>
            <li> Nothing goes to waste and it helps the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a really really big black skin tag and this stuff took it away in 4 works.</li>
            <li> Last week I added a small drop to acne and notice the bumps peeling the next day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp</li>
            <li> My husbands skin tag was gone after about a week and a half to two weeks and any little pimple we get, we put the tea tree oil on it and it&#x27;s noticibly smaller the next day!</li>
            <li> 3 days later, the cystic breakout is almost non-existent and dried out, where you can almost peel off the dry skin</li>
            <li> The protruding cysts have diminished down to flat spots (some of these have diminished within a day), pain and redness is gone</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle would be a little larger.</li>
            <li> Such power in a little bottle.  </li>
            <li> was well spent....</li>
            <li> Wet a Qtip or cottonball, you want it damp not soaking wet&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this seller, they don&#x27;t pay attention to what they pack!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is too much waste with the current dropper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has helped my recent body odor problems (I dab a bit under my arms at after i shower everyday instead of using deodorant when i don&#x27;t need an antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> , I read that tea tree oil helps (after trying EVERY known home remedy and spent hundreds of dollars purchasing acne treatments).  </li>
            <li> Allegedly, that&#x27;s how my grandmother removed her skin tags.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, it still upholds are the benefits and just doesn&#x27;t smell how I expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW DAYS NOW, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.</li>
            <li> I have been having terrible problems with itchy ears and the doctor finally told me to try tea tree oil, but get a good quality.  </li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with applying just once a day, right????</li>
            <li> If I sleep on that side I get a nasty red bump near the opening of the piercing, and applying this tea tree oil with a q-tip has helped significantly!  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about it other than that.</li>
            <li> I think the bottle may have been broken as there was no eye dropper to apply so it didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to see results.</li>
            <li> The right toenail is 98% healed except for a small chip that flaked off (nail is still weak).</li>
            <li> A few drops of this on any irritated spot in the morning usually has it clear within a day.  </li>
            <li> I like the dropper lid, which keeps me from wasting it, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found a recipe on Pinterest for extremely cracked feet and Tea Tree oil and Almond oil is used.  </li>
            <li> I also have been finding other ways to use this oil to help combat my acne.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other brands, so</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll end up using a bottle a month, but I don&#x27;t use shampoo, so the costs could cancel each other out.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and I only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had this small keloid on the back of my head (neckline) for about two years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil the past week on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> no thanks!</li>
            <li> Like other readers, I didn&#x27;t care for the drip-spout</li>
            <li> When I feel a flare-up starting, I use a small amount of this oil.  </li>
            <li> I also have small flesh colored moles on my face that have gotten significantly smaller.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle of tea tree oil, but it will last you forever.</li>
            <li> I use other brands of tea tree oil that don&#x27;t make me gage.  </li>
            <li> The dispensing mechanism, on the other hand, is a disaster.  </li>
            <li> I asked the makers to provide other benefits and got NO answer.</li>
            <li> Other seems to have a stronger smell-</li>
            <li> i would purchase it again and would try other products from manufacturer</li>
            <li> The tags dry up and hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> it has a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks &amp; is super oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for...and much less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my bottle did not come with any sort of instructions, but I found a few ideas on the internet (which are always 100% correct/true) and my sister-in-law also always 100% right.  </li>
            <li> I read about the odd odor in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I didnt care for the bottle and found that TTO can be purchased other places for less for what we use it for.</li>
            <li> I believe it slightly reduce the pain due the swelling of acne.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the dropper.</li>
            <li> Some people either love the smell or hate it...</li>
            <li> this stuff smells but that would be ok if it worked, it is worthless</li>
            <li> I get a few dry little scabs on the spots when I wake, but the Vitamin E oil gets rid of that.  </li>
            <li> My only advice, is use a very little amount!</li>
            <li> Bought this to treat skin tags on my neck and it does shrink them down.</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t drip out when you hold it upside down, it pours down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Small skin tags dry up if used&lt;br /&gt;twice</li>
            <li> Would recommend using either a few hours before you have to be somewhere or overnight due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is way too harsh to use undiluted, so I&#x27;ve been using a few drops mixed with water in a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I immedietly applied it to the red spot,which appeared to be some type of &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; and by the next morning the ugly red spot was hardly visible and by the next day was completly gone!!  </li>
            <li> Ran out in less the two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have skin tags less than a millimeter in diameter.</li>
            <li> it was gone in less than a week.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my feet feeling moisturized and tingling slightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a bit of an odd odor</li>
            <li> Seems to be working since discoloration is less after one month.</li>
            <li> ignore previous review made in error).</li>
            <li> Did this for about a month and noticed a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle at CVS 5 times the size for half the price.  </li>
            <li> but people could tell because the cuticle around the nail was also discolored and black.</li>
            <li> I applied it three times a day and in less than a month, it was gone.</li>
            <li> I applied it diligently 2 to 3 times a day for a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I used this diluted as a spray to get rid of black mold on window</li>
            <li> I used this on some skin tags on my legs &amp; they were gone in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> After 8 days of treatment it is less than 1/2</li>
            <li> The cuticle is a little dark</li>
            <li> Nixed my slight cold so fast!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fresh like tea tree oil should, instead it is quite musky and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I, reluctantly, decided to try this brand, since I was tired of paying the extreme prices for essential oils.  </li>
            <li> My acne spots are slowly fading and NO new one is coming out from my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for little about a week</li>
            <li> This little bottle of tea tree oil just did what seven years of pharmaceuticals couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a little longer.</li>
            <li> has a little smell but isn&#x27;t noticeable after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> I call this my \\&quot;little bottle from the fountain of youth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just add a little to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with a little argan oil.</li>
            <li> so when he started scratching I put a little on his skin and it soothed his skin and</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Euro dropper&amp;#34; is something that I am not familiar with.  </li>
            <li> The way to address the bottle problem is to take out the plastic insert and use a little make up brush to apply the oil to your toe nails.</li>
            <li> The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, and though the dropper is a little annoying, you can use a q-tip to apply.</li>
            <li> I had used that dirty college showers and had this really itchy athletes foot between my little toe</li>
            <li> Using antibiotics for a long period of time is not good for you.</li>
            <li> Use it as a toner water + few drops.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of the oil in water plus some drops of lavender oil.  </li>
            <li> I spray her hair everyday with it</li>
            <li> i know) and come off in a few days.</li>
            <li> One way i use this is by adding a few drops to my grapeseed oil, mix together, and then apply to my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but thats how much it dried out.)</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin and also put a few drops on my yoga mat while practicing Bikram.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 applications and the skin tags are drying up and halfway dead.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff a few times a week works well.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me, clearing them up in a few days.  </li>
            <li> however, at this point it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> When I wake, I would apply Vitamin E oil, let it set for a few hours, then wash it off.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s deadly to them.</li>
            <li> , i did not find this product harsh at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> (if it is, it would be messy).</li>
            <li> I have quite a few I want to try.</li>
            <li> I tried on a pimple and it dried it up in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I would put in on my skin tags everyday for 3 months, 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> Itch immediately stopped and it dried up.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks of repeated application and it does smell odd but beats having to make trip to the doctors office!  </li>
            <li> However, I should have listened to other reviews, the dropper sucks.</li>
            <li> Soldiers in World War II were given tea tree oil in their standard issue first aid kits for burns, cuts, scratches, tropical infections and as insect repellent.</li>
            <li> i watch a lot of youtube videos and as some of them suggested, i fill a small spray bottle with purified water and put about 6-8 little drops of the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> The left toenail was traumatized back in July when I had to go on a trip and used fake toenails - I tore off the fake toenail and it took the fungus nail partially with it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and less painful than doing the liquid nitrogen at the doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It might seem bad at first, but it&#x27;s actually not that bad once you become a regular user.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and am prone to getting cystic breakouts that are not only ugly but take forever to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab on a pimple at bedtime and it is gone in no time!</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 weeks and have seen very little improvement.</li>
            <li> I can also see how this would help clear your sinuses and chest if you had a cold</li>
            <li> Really really small amount of oil.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size discourage you from making the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was pain</li>
            <li> I use the tea tree oil anytime I have acne or a small cut.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but smells awful</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove small skin tags...applied twice a day and after one week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed as I&#x27;d been looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> a small rash</li>
            <li> and i like the small bottle, makes it portable</li>
            <li> The puss and the smell goes away for at least a few days anytime</li>
            <li> I dont know why tea tree oil is not more mainstream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think of this product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be concerned that it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would meet the testimonial standard and it failed.</li>
            <li> I have small skin tags, I thought it would be no problem to take care of.</li>
            <li> no more scratching.</li>
            <li> Very harsh- even wish a small drop on your skin that&#x27;s been airing out for a while.</li>
            <li> As with other reviews which enticed me to use, I found adding to the shampoo was worse.</li>
            <li> It smelled so strong and awful that it made me nauseous</li>
            <li> Strong smell, terribly designed dropper, takes patience</li>
            <li> yes it works but takes time an with the tags under my arm pits it is hard to get to butgot it done, You have to be patient as it is not an overnight thing,</li>
            <li> The Rx medicine prescribed by vets is hard on the liver</li>
            <li> The bottle spout is just too hard to use.</li>
            <li> Since this is one of those oils that the FCC doesn&#x27;t care about, it&#x27;s hard sometimes to find this in an undiluted form (because people will find profit in anything they want).</li>
            <li> I applied this product to a skin tag on the side of my neck and the smell is hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> Then a few weeks later, I left sunscreen on my face overnight and woke up with horrible zits.  </li>
            <li> so it had to heal by secondary intent.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the odor, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> But it was healing slowly.  </li>
            <li> so I am taking it slow.</li>
            <li> It works slowly so don&#x27;t expect results overnight.</li>
            <li> and it continued to slowly grow.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Is actually working on my very difficult nail fungus on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I had minor acne that drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> I was so embarrassed by my ugly toenails that I tried to cover them up with thick blue nail polish for years</li>
            <li> Seriously tho</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird for someone that has never used it before (like me), but nothing bad enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> Also, my pimples doesn&#x27;t get ugly or big.</li>
            <li> The oil smells like a land fill, after only 2 uses the ugly colors on my toe nails have vanished, will keep using but not indoors because the smell tends to lurk for a while.</li>
            <li> and now I have completely gotten rid of the annoying fungus.</li>
            <li> Hard to control drop amount you want!</li>
            <li> At least some companies still care about customer service! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I got this for my acne, and it slowly disapears!</li>
            <li> I have a Cocker Spaniel with a skin fungus that is very hard to fight.</li>
            <li> Bacteria is what causes the redness and swelling to be much worse.  </li>
            <li> I used this every night for 3 weeks until I got tired of using it because nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I always had an appreciation for all the uses of tea tree oil but was disappointed sometimes it takes so long to start working.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, packaging ensured the glass wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> A little painful.</li>
            <li> I just started my 11 year old son on it for horrible acne</li>
            <li> (sorry if that was t.m.i.</li>
            <li> so my skin wasn&#x27;t itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but it did nothing for me, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I use this for an incurable chronic infection flare-up.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Instead of spending tons of $ on expensive dandruff shampoos, I have been adding this to my home made herbal hair mask</li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply the oil with it.  </li>
            <li> I am blind in one eye.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product and their customer service!  </li>
            <li> and this sadly, almost smelled industrial.</li>
            <li> Decided that I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance of being one, in a very small percentage, that would have any bad reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> instead I watched this stuff dry that horrible thing up before my eyes!</li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS by the way</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well on my skin tags as I had hoped, but my son felt a cold sore coming on</li>
            <li> and it stopped the cold sore.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible skin problems for the past seven years.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad the worst smell I have ever smelled and it does not even work what a waste of money</li>
            <li> Burn me so badly.</li>
            <li> I had a bad area on my hand from either my cat&#x27;s teeth or hind claws.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> I almost bought the &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; stuff but the reviews were so bad I bought this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having some bad flare-ups, so I decided to try out this method.</li>
            <li> I cut away all the jagged parts and pieces and it was totally ugly.</li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to :(</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was soooo disappointed as I hoped this was the cure for my skin issues.</li>
            <li> Also, it stinks!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> application was annoying with the product because it does not have a dropper.</li>
            <li> Although I hate the smell, this oil worked wonders on my ezcema.</li>
            <li> Also, the oil has a very unpleasant odor associated to the product.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use on my scalp because the smell is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is a terrible disorder where you get really bad cysts around apocrine sweat glands or subaceous glands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make a home-made mosquito and bug repellent.  </li>
            <li> After a week, I hated it -</li>
            <li> I got it to use it in my face steamer but hated the smell</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I like what the product does and it works, yet the smell is awful!!!!</li>
            <li> It is horrible --smells like spoiled olive oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible but it works</li>
            <li> It smells horrible</li>
            <li> This smells awful!  </li>
            <li> It is terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the Tea Tree oil, I have been using it on my psoriasis and it has helped.</li>
            <li> better than any I have used and the shipping was very prompt..thank you</li>
            <li> True tea tree oil. I use it for acne and it helps.</li>
            <li> Nice, high quality essential oil. Used in a face serum. Will find other all natural product to use this for.</li>
            <li> excellent product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have a collection of essential oils and almost all of them are from Plant Therapy.  I would recommend any of their products!  I bought this one for it&#x27;s antibacterial, antifungal properties.  I found a recipe on Pinterest for extremely cracked feet and Tea Tree oil and Almond oil is used.  So far, it is working great!</li>
            <li> Used it on acne which seemed to help.  However, the aroma is a bit strong.  Otherwise, it seemed like a good product.</li>
            <li> One of the best essential oils in my collection. I use it in my shampoo for my dry/itchy scalp. I also use this on my sons toenail fungus and it clears it right up. It can also be used for acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it in shampoo, I normally start with about 3-5 drops per full shampoo bottle to test it. It is very strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution! You should always dilute this oil, like most oils. If you accidentally get it on your skin, I would wash it off asap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this oil at all,..I heard so many good thing about it,..that&#x27;s why I try.&lt;br /&gt;But living me w scare on my face. Burn me so badly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! And it&#x27;s been amazing for my acne. I just apply it mixed in with my facial lotion. My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> Knowing that it treats acne, I just didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this oil until I gave up using prescribed antibiotics and non-prescribed drying agents at drug stores.  With hormonal issues, I can&#x27;t be free of breakouts, but this essential oil has been keeping my face much more beautiful than when I was using other agents as written.  If you have the same issue as me, it&#x27;s worth trying.  Using antibiotics for a long period of time is not good for you.</li>
            <li> Loved this product,  exactly what i wanted.  It&#x27;s really good quality and one of the cheapest I found.  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I had been using a well-known marketed brand that you purchase from home parties.  I, reluctantly, decided to try this brand, since I was tired of paying the extreme prices for essential oils.  This oil works just as well as the over-priced brand.  I will be purchasing more essential oils from this company. My order arrived as promised and the product is full strength, as advertised.  So happy!!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tea tree oil brand that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s definitely the best. I mix this in with my foot cream and it keeps the skin from thickening and my feet are super smooth. I also mix it with jojoba oil and use it on my scalp. It has a strong smell, but it dissipates within a day or so.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying it for skin tags, forget it. It doesn&#x27;t work, even dabbing some on three &amp; four times every day, nothing has changed. Keep  your money.</li>
            <li> I have had a fungus in my big toe for (believe you me) 5 years. I have tried all sorts of over the counter fungus treatments and was prescribed medicine by my doctor. Nothing worked. I just decided that I would live with it! Then, I did some research on best fungus treatment and up came Tea Tree Oil. I bought this brand because I have other essential oils from them and I love every single one. Needless-to-say, within a month my fungus was healed and my new nail started to grow very rapidly. I am very pleased with this product and harbor no reservations in recommending it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I cant say I love the taste but I do like the results.I have been using it on the corners of my mouth.Nothing has stopped the cracks until now</li>
            <li> The oil inside seems fine, but I&#x27;ve found buying a bigger bottle with an eyedropper works better. If  you need a little bit of Tree Oil and need to hit a spot about the size of a Quarter or larger this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li> I use this for my new acne and old acne spots... it works wonder! My acne spots are slowly fading and NO new one is coming out from my face. Finally, after all those expensive products I used to buy, now I&#x27;m sticking with this product for GOOD. The only downside was the smell but it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for my daughter because she&#x27;s infested with lice. I mixed this with coconut oil and it&#x27;s good for killing lice because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product~ ^^&lt;br /&gt;--will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I decided to write this \\&quot;review\\&quot; because after receiving my package, and coming back to the page, I realized that the one review for this product was written by someone from the company (They&#x27;ve also reviewed all the other \\&quot;Plant Therapy\\&quot; products) Tsk, Tsk.  There really isn&#x27;t much to say, other than it is what is advertised.  It&#x27;s high quality (from what I can tell) Tea Tree Oil in an amber bottle.  My one gripe is the \\&quot;euro style dropper.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s an inset dropper in the mouth of the bottle, and I&#x27;m nervous about inverting it and having it all pour out. I&#x27;d much rather have a normal dropper, or one of those glass rods attached to the top.   It&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t need fake reviews.</li>
            <li> this is a good product to use in the garden if you do not want to use chemicals or pesticides.  this will keep the bugs off/away from the plants the natural way</li>
            <li> I was told this would help remove warts...wrongg</li>
            <li> Upon observing that nail fungus treatments nearly all had this in them, I decided to use it independently.  It really helped, the nails on my big toes had some time ago developed a layer in the middle that always had something growing under it, from a time when I didn&#x27;t really take care of my feet at all.  It took a while, but now there&#x27;s just a sliver left on one side which I anticipate shall be gone soon.  This tea tree oil was of very good quality and didn&#x27;t smell absolutely abhorrent like one that I got at a drugstore once.</li>
            <li> This product has proven great as aroma therapy for me but I purchased it for my husband to use (diluted 1:10) on his feet for neuropathy.  It is a great product for many problems because the aroma therapy gives the room such a happy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We both love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually stumbled onto this product by accident and it is far better than the similar product that the doctor prescribed.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with other products to make my own deodorant, soap, and sunscreen. It worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This really helped the keloid I had on my ear!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of removing some of my skin tags. Tried it for a week and nothing happened only left me with a funky smell. I guess I will try longer but I don&#x27;t think it will work if it hasn&#x27;t done anything yet.</li>
            <li> My order came promptly. I will buy again. :)</li>
            <li> I know this stuff is pure and potent because you can really feel that cooling tingline effect where you Apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get severe shaving irritations on my nech, upper lip area, and near the cornsers of my mouth and this stuff tamp&#x27;s it right down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps great at soothing mesquito bites, and acne too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser desight really helps apply it efficiently too. Nothing goes to waste and it helps the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> We bought this to get rid of my daughter&#x27;s warts.  It took awhile to work, and the warts looked worse before they got better, but now they are completely gone!  Much cheaper and less painful than doing the liquid nitrogen at the doctor&#x27;s.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I went through this little bottle of Tea Tree Oil fast.  I bought it for it&#x27;s anti-microbial properties in both cleaning supplies and skin care.  It works great, although I wish it had a true dropper rather than the plastic drip top. I think if I could have measured drops easier it would have lasted longer.  The smell reminds me of cleaning products my grandmother used to use, which makes me wonder if she used tea tree oil based products?  It&#x27;s a little strong, and you either love it or not.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but put up with it because it works so well.  A couple of cautions to keep in mind; tea tree oil is toxic for dogs and cats, so make sure anything you have used it with (i.e. cotton balls, spray solutions, etc.) are kept where the fur babies can&#x27;t get at it and it&#x27;s not for ingestion by humans either.  Always be sure to check the properties and warnings even for natural products like essential oils.</li>
            <li> After some research on tea tree oil, I have found that it has so many uses. It&#x27;s a good product to have on hand. I also received it in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree scent from this oil. I use it only for cleaning products, so I&#x27;m not very concerned about the quality, more the scent.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil came just as described. Wish it was dropper style instead of inverted but I knew ahead of time exactly how the item was. Great Buy for your money! And the company even sends a courtesy email to make sure you are satisfied. At least some companies still care about customer service! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! I had a really really big black skin tag and this stuff took it away in 4 works. I was only applying it once a day so I bet if I had doubled up on it then it would have gone away sooner. Happy!</li>
            <li> Love it. Really strong smell. Use it as a toner water + few drops. Works awesome. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> making my own personal Christmas gifts and this is a great selections for medicinal purposes.  Must remember to keep some for myself....</li>
            <li> I had no intention on getting tea tree oil. I looked up skin tag removers for my husband and then I saw this is an option. After reading many details and reviews, I ordered it and was excited to use it on myself for some blemish issues. All I can say is I am soooooo happy I found this product! My husbands skin tag was gone after about a week and a half to two weeks and any little pimple we get, we put the tea tree oil on it and it&#x27;s noticibly smaller the next day! At first the smell is a bit much, but it goes away after about 10 minutes. Definitely not worth giving it 4 stars. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I mix it with other essential oils to make personal care products.I like the Melaleuca kind tea tree oil; it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the packaging isn&#x27;t. It will not last long because the oil pretty much pours out, it doesn&#x27;t drop out like most essential oil products</li>
            <li> Snake oil, does not work at all.Not for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I mix 1/4 of a bottle in with my shampoo.  This is an essential product in everyone&#x27;s household.</li>
            <li> Really really small amount of oil. Ran out in less the two weeks. Nothing too special about it. I&#x27;d suggest buying a bigger one unless you plan on only using it for a very short time.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just as described. Thank you! AAA+++</li>
            <li> Totally good essential oil, i am very glad i bought it. I have used it as an antibacterial and i rather say that is really good for everything. It has resolved all my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because my daughter had the case of the lice.  I did a search and saw many people saying they did a tea tree oil spray and it kept the lice away.  I was willing to try anything to prevent her or us from ever getting it.  I put a few drops of the oil in water plus some drops of lavender oil.  I spray her hair everyday with it and so far she has been lice free.  I also have been finding other ways to use this oil to help combat my acne.  I mix a drop of it with my moisturizer.  I would definitely purchase the oil from this company again.</li>
            <li> This item US using for my nails. I massage the oil over them and my nails are enjoying it. I wish the bottle would be a little larger.</li>
            <li> I got this product to heal my nose piercing. I have been using it for about a month. It instantly helped my piecing but my nose just does not want to heal. I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s an awesome thing to have. It will last awhile to. I barely have used any of it so far. It&#x27;s a decent price for the amount.</li>
            <li> Bought this to treat skin tags on my neck and it does shrink them down. Would probably be gone now if I did it every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use in a homemade shampoo to fight dandruff.  Tea tree oil is an excellent anti-fungal/anti-bacterial.  Fungus is what causes dandruff.  Well, it works.  No more dandruff.  Then a few weeks later, I left sunscreen on my face overnight and woke up with horrible zits.  I put some tea tree oil on a Q-tip and dabbed it on the zits the next night.  The zits weren&#x27;t gone, but the redness and swelling was greatly reduced.  Much faster than any product I&#x27;ve used which is made specifically for fighting zits, and faster than just washing alone.  Bacteria is what causes the redness and swelling to be much worse.  Now about this product specifically.  I didn&#x27;t like the euro dropper at first, but it&#x27;s fine now.  I might get a couple drops too many now and then, but I&#x27;m not doing precise measuring.  I haven&#x27;t used other brands, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better or worse than others.  One bottle has lasted me about a month so far, but I just started using it more heavily.  I suppose I&#x27;ll end up using a bottle a month, but I don&#x27;t use shampoo, so the costs could cancel each other out.  Good product, great results, good price.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  Is actually working on my very difficult nail fungus on my feet.  I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing sandals again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back to the basics for me. Tired of paying high prices when something this basic works. Essential oils are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Also great for my Chinese crested skin.  Make sure to dilute dilute dilute!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend when she got her piercing to help her out. It has helped her tremendously she said and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Oh my holly stink bomb! I got this for a couple skin tags and I think it&#x27;s starting to work but I think it&#x27;s working because the smell would drive anything away. I have to put this on at bedtime...there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m putting it on and going out in public!</li>
            <li> I just felt there wasn&#x27;t enough oil in the very tiny bottle....I don&#x27;t feel my money was well spent....This oil has a very nice smell and make your skin feel calm....</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. It acts  just as described. It kills funguses, bacteria, viruses in your home and leaves a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> The smell is offensively strong. It&#x27;s not the pleasant smell I expected. My hubby forbade me to use it. Now it sits in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy 100% Pure Essential Oils supplied the Tea Tree (Melaleuca) Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade and it is excellent.  I used it as part of the formula to make Tea Tree Oil mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I have skin tags less than a millimeter in diameter. I used this every night for 3 weeks until I got tired of using it because nothing happened.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have a lot of skin tags on my face. I only applied it to four of them.  The biggest one already fell off in the middle of the night. Apply only to the tag twice a day. The tags dry up and hurt a little.  This means it&#x27;s about to fall off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I had minor acne that drove me crazy. All I had to do was put some of this on it and it was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li> love it, it&#x27;s exactly what i expected. i miss it with my daily moisturizer to put on my face, it feels great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make a home-made mosquito and bug repellent.  Along with other essential oils and witch hazel, this repellent worked wonderfully, and I do not have to worry about wrecking my kidneys with DEET!  Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to try this.  It has a very strong odor but I can deal with it.  Removed skin tag completely in 2 days!  Applied 3 times a day  works great on pimples too  great stuff. Who knew?</li>
            <li> Son developed a fungus on thumbs due to wet football gloves. Application of tea tree oil over a week removed any sign. Highly recommended for simple topical fungus.</li>
            <li> I use it in my 2nd rinse cycle of washing cloth diapers and it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great for acne but I keep forgetting to bring it upstairs with me to try.</li>
            <li> Arrived In time. And served the purpose. Would have liked, I&#x27;d it was a plastic bottle, so can squeeze for perfect drop.</li>
            <li> My Brother turned me on to this stuff, then did some research and wanted to try it out.  Will use it for awhile and do a follow up review.  Smells great!!</li>
            <li> Very strong and works well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for about a week or more, and i have to say i have not broken out since. my skin has already been improving. i watch a lot of youtube videos and as some of them suggested, i fill a small spray bottle with purified water and put about 6-8 little drops of the tea tree oil. i then  shake, and spray on my face. i either do this and pat it into my face, or i spray onto a cotton pad and wipe my face with it. my skin seems to be doing better. a big plus was the super fast shipping! i received free 2-day shipping from amazon prime, and even so, it came the NEXT day. so, i pretty much got free one day shipping.</li>
            <li> This product really works! My mother had recommended it for me so I decided to try it. My boyfriend had a ringworm that had grown pretty big so I applied this oil to it. Only one application and it was gone in less than a week. The smell is strong but I can handle it considering the results you get from it.</li>
            <li> The euro dropper takes a little getting used to, but all in all this product has been great! It&#x27;s strong, so a little bit goes a LONG way. It does have a very strong scent, but it&#x27;s not a scent that I find unpleasant, though some may. Being so strong, the scent does linger for a bit, so I find it best to use well before going out, or at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Works great on tags. I had a tag on my forehead that came out of nowhere! It saved me much embarassment. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what steps i took to get rid of the tag:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean tag area with soapy water. Don&#x27;t irritate the tag&lt;br /&gt;2. Wet a Qtip or cottonball, you want it damp not soaking wet&lt;br /&gt;3. Add two drops of the oil on the Qtip/cottonball and lightly apply it around ON the tag. NOT the skin surrounding it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put a bandaid over it and repeat the steps three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will start drying and basically wither away(gross i know) and come off in a few days. Mine came off after 2days. Just pick at it and it should painlessly come off. The tips on how to do this were from my own research online and via YouTube tips. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I placed my order - it shipped and arrived on time.  No complaints! Using this to make dish soap.  Smells wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described. Not much to say about it other than that. Seems to be strong and undiluted as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is everything that I expected. I just wish it was larger, but I can&#x27;t knock them for that as it clearly states the size in the description. If you are looking for tea tree oil, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work.  No instructions came with it.  I had to look on line and it did nothing for me.  Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your skin!</li>
            <li> I had a bad area on my hand from either my cat&#x27;s teeth or hind claws.  He got outside and as always been an indoor cat unless  slips out the door.&lt;br /&gt;Someone knocked on the door and Mother opened it and ut he went.  I caught him and he turned wild and got me good.  I cleaned all the areas involved with soap and water,  All were healed nicely but one.  It was quite deep and had a flap of skin on it which I did remove so it had to heal by secondary intent.  I cleansed with H2O2 and used triple antibiotic ointment on it covered with a bandaid.  But it was healing slowly.  After my tree tea oil arrived I did the cleansing routine but used tree tree oil on the bandaid.  In 3 days it had healed faster and today it is almost all covered with new skin.  Great product and thank you.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time this product was not for me so I don&#x27;t know how effect it was</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly. Strong smell, but I think that&#x27;s just how tea tree oil is. Worked for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for little about a week and i already see a difference in my skin. I have moderate acne and am prone to getting cystic breakouts that are not only ugly but take forever to get rid of. One way i use this is by adding a few drops to my grapeseed oil, mix together, and then apply to my face as a moisturizer. (grapeseed oil has alot of skin benefits btw. its not pore-cloggging.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days ago, I started to use the tea tree oil by itself by putting onto a cotton ball and applying it to my smaller breakouts, including the cystic one on my cheek. 3 days later, the cystic breakout is almost non-existent and dried out, where you can almost peel off the dry skin (sorry if that was t.m.i. but thats how much it dried out.) I was doing this method multiple times a day, instead of picking at it,  so I believe that it helped with the breakout clearing up faster.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for my psoriasis. It helped but did not heal.  I found that vaseline worked just as well.  Prescription ointments have worked best for me in the past. I was trying to find natural alternatives and so that&#x27;s why i bought this.  Anyone have recommendations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application was annoying with the product because it does not have a dropper. the applicator is just a flat top with a hole with a tube that goes down into the bottle.  You have to invert it multiple times to get drops on your skin and sometimes it would pour out more than intended.  This product would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so runny.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy! The ONLY oils I will use. LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I used it 2/day for a week, hoping to get rid of my skin tags. No progress/change whatsoever. Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very strong smell. I find it to be a very natural and refreshing smell. I&#x27;ve used it for foot baths and also put it straight on my feet and toenails. I have athletes foot (peeling, cracking, itching, burning) and the fungus is also under 4 of my toenails. This product leaves my feet feeling moisturized and tingling slightly. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of the afflictions, but it&#x27;s sure soothing.</li>
            <li> yes it works but takes time an with the tags under my arm pits it is hard to get to butgot it done, You have to be patient as it is not an overnight thing,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great oil- very effective on toe fungus and smells great too..</li>
            <li> Shippment was quick &amp; the description fits the product.  My boyfriend needed this oil for his clients &amp; essential oils he makes.  He loves it &amp; uses it frequently.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Super strong in a good way! The first bottle of tea tree oil I bought was from a local herbal shop &amp; it must have been diluted because this is far stronger. Which means it works better! I always had an appreciation for all the uses of tea tree oil but was disappointed sometimes it takes so long to start working. Not anymore. This is truly undiluted.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size discourage you from making the purchase. A little goes a very long way and it has many uses.</li>
            <li> I use this for face wash and all natural dandruff control. It also works to stimulate the scalp.  This one is very high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I had read reviews on this working on skin tags. My husband used this about 3 times a day for 5 days and his skin tags were gone!&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of an odd odor so it might not work for some people to wear out.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy products!  I use this tea tree oil all the time!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for perfect</li>
            <li> affordable, versatile, a must for your organic medicine cabinet&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you live in tropical or subtropical regions for anti fungus / ant bacterial issues related to warm climates.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. Very good quality and I like the smell as well( i like woodsy, medicinal smells).</li>
            <li> I used this specific product on a wart that my 8 year old nephew had for about 3 years on his index finger.  I applied a drop every day and covered it it with a Bandaid that he wore for eight hours every day.  You have to be patient, but in 5 weeks it was completely gone!  Great quality product at a fantastic price.....will come back for more oils!</li>
            <li> I use 10 drops of tea tree oil, 10 drops of rosemary oil and 1\2 cup of coconut oil for my scalp. I used all sorts of dandruff shampoos and none really worked. This works for me. I treat bout every two weeks and the dandruff and itching stay at bay.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil for my homemade cleaning products.  It has antibacterial properties and can also eliminate mold that can grow in your home (showers, windows, etc).  The smell is a lot like strong PineSol, but a little more pure.  It dissipates quickly.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils. I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know that it&#x27;s 100% pure. I tried five different brands. The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones. The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> Product is great and is pure tea tree essential oils. However, the spout on this bottle doesn&#x27;t really work like a &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34;. Instead, it works like a pourer. Either way, the product inside is quality and I guess I could live with the dropper.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is great. I use it on my skin and also put a few drops on my yoga mat while practicing Bikram.</li>
            <li> Its a good product it would work better if there was a dropper inside either way I do recommend it</li>
            <li> I did order other diluted tree oil before and it did not help much for fungus in nails. This pure tree oil is much different and the result was immediate. This took care of the fungus problem and I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This tea tee oil is very strong and aromatic. It&#x27;s also excellent as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal, especially for the skin.  I do find that I am sensitive to the smell if I apply too much, and have to be careful not to cause a headache.</li>
            <li> Great product use the oil for a face wash and works great also has many other uses</li>
            <li> I have an space between my upper teeth that get&#x27;s gunk caught in it and infected. I also may or may not have had tooth pain caused by a cavity. Not sure if it was pain transference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use Clove OIl which helps a little but is not too effective. But couldn&#x27;t find it. So on a lark, I took this tea tree oil and rubbed it on the gum and on the tooth. Amazing, it instantly numbed it, much better then clove oil. Then when I woke up in the morning the infection and pain were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now once or twice a week I put some drops on top of my toothbrush and/or floss it in. No infection since then. Oh and freshens up the mouth too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it in my Dandruff Shampoo to boost it, and haven&#x27;t&#x27; had dandruff in ages.</li>
            <li> I bought this purely for the use of removing skin tags. I had a pretty big one on my neck. It is now gone. It took the entire bottle over a process of a couple weeks, but it worked.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for removing skin tags! The smell is fine, and though the dropper is a little annoying, you can use a q-tip to apply. I also soaked the pad of a bandage to expedite the process. I highly recommend this option over the other home remedies you might consider to avoid the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Using for toe nail fungus. Seems to be working since discoloration is less after one month.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. It is the only thing that stops my itching and helps heal my horrid rash. It has been driving me nuts that nothing worked....until this magic potion arrived. I am so very glad I found it and I love that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cheaper kind fron Walgreens for years and I&#x27;ve tried this item just to see how different it would be...Let me just say I&#x27;m very glad that I tried it!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have legions of skin tags and have been looking for something to take care of them, short of constant visits to have them medically removed. This product is it. I tried other products, including &#x27;drawing salve&#x27; but nothing worked as quickly as this. It also does wonders on pimples. I read about the odd odor in other reviews. I don&#x27;t find it offensive. It smells to me like a walk in the woods after a gentle rain. There were also comments about a troublesome dropper. I didn&#x27;t have a dropper. I use a q-tip which works perfectly because you only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started learning about essential oils, and building my supply.  The price was good and it is a good product,</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I use it as a (very effective) antiseptic on me as well as my dog, who has allergies that cause his skin to be irritated from scratching.  Mix with distilled water, shake before applying with a small spray bottle or dab with clean cotton squares.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for its anti-bacterial function. I use the tea tree oil anytime I have acne or a small cut. I will have to say it does a great job for acne and it is natural so I can&#x27;t be more satisfied. Just a little dab on a pimple at bedtime and it is gone in no time! If it weren&#x27;t for the odor I would apply during the day, but it is strong and not the most pleasant smell. If you are into natural remedies, this is definitely worth the try! Just remember it is pure oil so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a quality product .  It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I need to learn more uses for it.  The comments helped.</li>
            <li> I have a Cocker Spaniel with a skin fungus that is very hard to fight. The Rx medicine prescribed by vets is hard on the liver so when I heard tea tree oil might help, I decided to try it. So far, I have applied it once and the anti-fungal properties seem to be helping. Long term use and dedicated daily applications will no doubt promote faster results but the oil stings slightly so I am taking it slow. If you have a pet with skin allergies, yeast or insect bites I suggest trying this remedy. You can dilute or use full strength but this is for external use only. Take precautions to keep your pet from licking the oil.</li>
            <li> I like what the product does and it works, yet the smell is awful!!!! I wish it smelled a little better, but cant have everything.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to have an eye dropper to make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works for skin tags but definitely smell good.</li>
            <li> Being new to using Essential Oil&#x27;s, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out, but now I&#x27;m cluing in. I purchased this to see if it would help with small skin irritations and it has been very good; my husband noticed that he was starting to get a fever blister so put a tiny drop on it and the Tea Tree Oil knocked that fever blister out in one treatment. It&#x27;s also very good for headaches,the flu has recently gone around our house that came with a headache... I heard that Tea Tree oil on the temples was useful for getting rid of headaches, even migraines, I put a few drops on each of his temples and rubbed it in and it helped the headache quite a bit. I&#x27;m sure that there are many more uses for Tea Tree Oil, so we will keep on experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;Overview: Quality product. More than met my expectations. Well packaged. Arrived very quickly. What have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> Thank you. I received my package fast and the products are not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has that tea tree smell that I love.  It is affordable and is just the right size.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I just started using tea tree oil after researching it.  I put a dab on problem areas at night and by the next morning they are significantly reduced!</li>
            <li> Helps relieve the itchiness of psoriasis on my scalp. I added a few drops to my shampoo. So many uses</li>
            <li> Use essential oils for my cleaning business. LOVE this brand of oils. They are priced fairly and smell amazing. I will continue to use them</li>
            <li> The order arrived timely and sealed well, so no leakage. I personally love the smell of Tea Tree Oil, but I can understand it&#x27;s an acquired smell for others. I&#x27;m using directly on my skin for some type of bizarre rash that keep recurring. It relieves itching almost instantly and I can see improvement in the rash by the next day. By the second day, the rash is gone, so Tea Tree is working much better than hydrocortisone and I only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My felines just got their first flea outbreak of the summer and it&#x27;s been working great to keep the fleas off (of me, that is). Pleased with my purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, packaging ensured the glass wasn&#x27;t broken. I use the oil to make cloth wipes for my baby. Great product.</li>
            <li> A must addition to any medical kit.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy essential oils are always good. I&#x27;ve never had any complaints about any oils that I got from them. It comes in an amber colored glass bottle with a stopper at the top to help control how much comes out at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil has a sharp, slightly sweet, medicinal smell.  Since it&#x27;s antibacterial, it&#x27;s perfect to add to homemade foot creams and homemade deodorants.  (Actually, my homemade deodorant works better than any store bought deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite combination of essential oils is:  6 drops tea tree oil, 8 drops sweet orange oil, 10 drops vanilla oil.  The smell is kind of strong when you first put it on, but within a few minutes it fades to a sweet lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use that combination in all of my homemade products, and I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Good product to have on hand and a fair price.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad the worst smell I have ever smelled and it does not even work what a waste of money</li>
            <li> Did not do anything in my opinion.  No difference what so  ever  And the smell some people did not like it at all</li>
            <li> Very potent. Great for the natural pharmacy</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this essential oil for numberous offlictions (check online).  This is good quality oil and I would recommend.  Some don&#x27;t like the european dropper, but it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different TT oils and this is my new favorite. Need I say more! You&#x27;ll be completely satisfied</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s great! I apply directly to my skin, then the lotion after it dries. It has been helping with my acne, along with using salicylic acid and sulfur soap.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil! Have used this for a variety of things and almost in need of some more! Will for sure buy again!</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband who has to wear steel toe boots all day. He puts this on his toenails .. pretty strong smelling at first but fades.</li>
            <li> This oil came exactly is described.  It was a great price. I used to create a spray for lice treatment and prevention.</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil for the kind of breakout that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager  - weird, rashy type of breakout.  I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use many otc skin products.  This tea tree oil dried it up right away and calmed down the rash so my skin wasn&#x27;t itchy and uncomfortable.  Use with caution, I&#x27;ve read tea tree oil is toxic if taken internally so I used this as a topical treatment.  Also great to use in homemade soaps and homemade organic  bug sprays.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was very Pleased! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and it is the best prices around and strength.  I love the smell and results I get from cleaning I get when I use this strength.  I highly recommend this product.  I will buy it again myself.</li>
            <li> The item arrived really quickly and I was pleasantly surprised. I have acne from using a lot of benzoyl peroxide and was struggling to get rid of them. Ever since I started using this product, I have had no new acne and the old ones are shrinking. It works slowly so don&#x27;t expect results overnight. The smell is definitely very strong, but I was already expecting that from previous reviews. Great product, great service!  I&#x27;ll be ordering from Plant Therapy again once I run out</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is fabulous, works for so many infections, fungal and otherwise.  It&#x27;s a great product, and you can get it so cheap here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Came on time as was what it was advertised to be. Good for the purpose it was purchased for. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what the label says, 100% pure undiluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I have skin tags and I thought this would work, but it did not I trying to use it in my shampoo for my itchy scalp maybe it will work for that.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for hair as well as tag mole removal. Smells awsome. Homeopathic is the way to go</li>
            <li> Sure is pure! Try not to add too much if you are making your own hair products (my mistake).</li>
            <li> Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..it&#x27;s fantastic).  Very happy with the oil quality.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t make the mistake that I did. I was suffering from really bad dandruff post partum and was kind of &amp;#34;desperate&amp;#34; to find something that would &amp;#34;heal me&amp;#34;.  I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with salicylic acid because I am nursing my baby. I really didn&#x27;t want to use tea tree oil either but I thought of it as the better alternative. I didn&#x27;t do my homework as I should of and didn&#x27;t dilute it in my shampoo, I applied it directly to my scalp. Big mistake. For someone who regularly uses essential oils I&#x27;m sure this is probably a well known &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; but for me... not so much. It smelled so strong and awful that it made me nauseous and I had to take another shower to get it out. I literally washed my hair 5 times and could still smell it a bit when I got out. So, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and find it works as advertised. Delivered on time as stated. Will recommend this product and company.&lt;br /&gt;(Please ignore previous review made in error).</li>
            <li> I had this small keloid on the back of my head (neckline) for about two years. I&#x27;ve gone to a dermatologist for treatment (steroid shot) and that didn&#x27;t work. I tried removing the hair folical from the area with tweezers and that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to give up until I read reviews about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day since April and the keloid is just about gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an unbiased review as I was not given a free sample in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did nothing for my hair and face except make it stink and burn my face.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a dropper so the oil would come out a little smoother, but it is great. Works well for my uses.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this tea tree oil and I love it. The smell is something to get used to but the benefits outweigh the smell. I use this product for my skin and for various other things and it had worked well thus far. I will definitely continue to purchase it :)</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but smells awful</li>
            <li> I RATED THE PRODUCT 5 STARS BECAUSE WITH IT WORK FOR SKIN PROBLEM AND MY WIFE&#x27;S TOE FUNGUS SO AS YOU CAN SEE I LOVE IT AND I WOULD RECOMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH SKIN PROBLEMS AND FUNGS</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for treatment of a fungal toenail.  I had been to my physician to see what she would recommend.  She gave me a prescription for Ketoconazole, which has the potential for a whole lot of negative side effects including liver damage.  I did fill the Rx and then thoroughly read the med sheet which came with it.  Decided that I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance of being one, in a very small percentage, that would have any bad reaction to this product.  So I declined to take this Rx.  Further exploring online lead me to discover that Vicks VapoRub had been used successfully by some people as well as tea tree oil - and neither had bad side effects.  Since I had some Vicks in the house, I started off by rubbing it onto the nail twice a day and covering with a bandage to prevent it from getting on clothes, etc.  Did this for about a month and noticed a slight improvement.  Decided to switch over to the tea tree oil and see if that worked any better.  It did.  Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks, and the nail seems to be growing out healthy.  I rub the oil on twice a day and it quickly absorbs into the nail.  Some people have complained about the odor, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I will continue using it until the nail (hopefully) grows out healthy and will then probably use it once a week or so as a preventative.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is a great anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, however gave it 4 stars because of the smell and no instructions. You have to figure out how much to apply. Cant go wrong with applying just once a day, right????</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil in the past, but this smells and feels much more concentrated. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> HAS HELPED CLEAR UP A FINGER NAIL PROBLEM I HAD, NOT SURE IF IT WAS FUNGUS OR WHAT BUT KEPT SPLITTING IN MIDDLE. SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT IS VERY STRONG, NOT TO PLEASANT, I USE AT NIGHT. ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS HOW IT IS DISPENCED FROM BOTTLE, WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HAD A DROPPER.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this seller, they don&#x27;t pay attention to what they pack!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and received oregano oil instead, it was packed in a bubble wrap bag labeled tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;And because of inventory issues they DID NOT replace the item, they just made a refund and told me to make a new order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night, and it has been keeping new blemishes away for about 3 months now. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the numerous wonderful benefits of tea tree oil so I wanted to try it out for myself.  I enjoy the smell of it, but it is very strong and can see why some people might not like it.  It reminds me of a spa, very relaxing and calming.  I can also see how this would help clear your sinuses and chest if you had a cold, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m rushed to try that out because it means getting sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this tea tree oil on mosquito bites and am happy to say it helped stop the itch!  I put about a drop on my finger and rubbed it on several itchy mosquito bites and the itch went away almost immediately.  Definitely a great natural way to get rid of itchy bug bites.  I also tried it on a couple eczema spots that I have, it did help it stop itching but didn&#x27;t really improve the look of the skin but we will see if it helps over time!</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil for my foot bath to keep me healthy after a pedicure and for my dogs feet as well.</li>
            <li> So disappointing! I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for years and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this brand. This new batch was rancid! It is horrible --smells like spoiled olive oil. Would not recommend item or seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using the tea tree oil and rosemary oil for about three days now. I put in on at night after I get out of the shower, I use about 4 to 5 drops,I put it on a cotton pad and rub it in. The reason I started using this product is because I have mild/moderate acne. So far it is working well, it does not dry out your face, leave any sticky/oily feeling and it dries up very quickly. definitely worth the money, I was a bit skeptical at first as well but just try it.</li>
            <li> I like the one from Thursday Plantation much better, though it is pricier (hence why I went for this one)If you want a very strong good quality oil, then go for \\&quot;Thursday Plantation\\&quot; but this one is ok I guess.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I have been looking for at such a reasonable price over what I can find in my small rural town. I will not worry about using it all because I have found a great place to get more!</li>
            <li> Used this product on removing skin tags, worked very well.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Tea Tree Essential Oil is an excellent quality oil. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I add a drop to my shampoo every time I wash my hair...the scent is an acquired taste.  Nice feel on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove small skin tags...applied twice a day and after one week...nothing...no change in skin tags whatsoever.  I went to Walmart &amp; bought Equate wart remover with Salicylic acid and that did the trick.  Dab on the skin tag. ..I have used 3 applications and the skin tags are drying up and halfway dead.  The acid stings like heck though.  Anyone that says tea tree oil removes warts or skin tags is full of it.  You need acid to remove these things.  I had a pimple and I think the tea tree oil helped dry it out faster so will use it for that so as not a complete loss.  I may use this on cuts although I swear by Neosporin only for cuts.</li>
            <li> I have come to love Tea Tree and all the many uses&#x27;s I have been finding for it, I have more than one bottle at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Check out all the benefits of this God given oil you may find you need it as well as I do.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, and pimples disappear really quickly.  it has a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  I don&#x27;t cover my whole face though, just a small dab on top of the pimples and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Use it during winter time in shower, I put couple of drops around my shower walls &amp; allow it to evaporate. Its anti viral &amp; anti bacterial essence prevents my family and I from catching cold through out the winter. Its the best remedy and a very practical gift to give to any one.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product when I&#x27;m not feeling to good so I use it in the Wintertime with all the germs are out!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Love putting it in my cold air humidifier.</li>
            <li> This oil will clear up your acne and help it heal. It&#x27;s strong at first but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I always suffered from herpes and it would expand and spread every time. Now as soon as I put tea tree it stops and gets dry very fast!</li>
            <li> Love the product but as others have indicated, it needs new packaging.  The bottle spout is just too hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very potent.  The only drawback is the dispenser is not very accurate.  Next time I will use a dropper.  I bought this product to use in a home made lotion for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  Only used it once so far so can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
            <li> I like the tea tree oil bought from them more than the other brands.  It really is undilutd.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, I was using it to try to eliminate a skin tag on my arm, it is a pretty tiny bottle. I got a bottle at CVS 5 times the size for half the price.  I still have the skin tag but it is getting pretty small after about 6 weeks of once daily use. I understand I should use it more often than once per day, but that just not seem to ever happen for me!</li>
            <li> Adds oomph to shampoo!</li>
            <li> It has a tingle on the skin. I did like it and do use it. The smell was not to my liking but is not totally off putting.</li>
            <li> This oil is an absolute miracle! I&#x27;ve had a few skin tags in not so fun places, and within days they fell right off. I highly recommend this to everyone. Saves time, money, and embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. Really, really strong stuff. I guess a prior kind was junk because this is potent. I got it to keep my stretched lobes from getting funky (yes even when washed out) but this stuff a few times a week works well. And surprisingly well on athlete&#x27;s foot. I kinda didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but it&#x27;s better than the cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality tea tree oil - I usually keep a bottle on-hand at home and work for quick application, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible but it works</li>
            <li> I bought this for my acne treatment but it didn&#x27;t help for me, its very liquidy so you cant just put some on your finger and on your face, it was very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for skin tags, don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil the past week on a daily basis. I have to admit that it has exceeded my expectations the odor produced is very high which suggests a good extraction method without degrading a lot the oil itself. It helps a lot with my allergies at night.</li>
            <li> The item came before expected delivery date and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Product received was exactly as shown. Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Smells bad. Is that what tea tree oil is supposed to smell like? I also think my daughter is allergic to it . She read somewhere that it was good to use as a pimple reducer, but made them swell up and turn red</li>
            <li> The seller got the product to me very fast. It was exactly what I expected and it works extremely well. I love this oil.</li>
            <li> Met expectations. would order again.</li>
            <li> I see no change in a week and it doesn&#x27;t smell that good either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with toenail fungus for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve gone to the podiatrist only for him to tell me he could prescribe medication for it but I&#x27;d need to come in for regular blood draws as the medicine affects the liver...no thanks! I was so embarrassed by my ugly toenails that I tried to cover them up with thick blue nail polish for years but people could tell because the cuticle around the nail was also discolored and black. I&#x27;ve also tried buying high heels with covered toes, wearing socks and shoes to every function (I live in Hawaii and a lot of us go barefoot in people&#x27;s homes). I even had to throw on socks when the door bell rang so people wouldn&#x27;t see my toes...it was that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product in early April 2015 and have tried to apply it twice a day but I haven&#x27;t always been consistent but the results are AMAZING.  I have toe nail fungus on two of my toes on both feet; both are on the exact same second toe from the big toe. The right toenail is 98% healed except for a small chip that flaked off (nail is still weak). It is no longer discolored and the cuticle is not black anymore - it is healthy! The left toenail was traumatized back in July when I had to go on a trip and used fake toenails - I tore off the fake toenail and it took the fungus nail partially with it. I cut away all the jagged parts and pieces and it was totally ugly. It is now August and I&#x27;ve been applying this product maybe once a day (twice if I can remember) and the left toe is growing out normally, I&#x27;d say to 70%. The cuticle is a little dark but my left toe is in worse shape than the right toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a legitimate medical website that stated pure Tea Tree oil has been found effective in fighting toenail fungus - it said 60% of people will see results within 6 months if used twice a day. In my case, it took five months of on-and-off inconsistent application and more recently, only one month of application once to twice daily to see amazing results in my recently torn, traumatized nail. Like other readers, I didn&#x27;t care for the drip-spout so I took it out and use a regular angled eye-dropper to put a tiny half-drop along the toenail cuticle on each foot. You don&#x27;t even need to squeeze the eyedropper - the oil comes out onto the skin and saturates the cuticle and nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly an amazing product  and I highly recommend it to people with toenail fungus that had to go through all kinds of trouble to hide and cover it up. I&#x27;m going to do some research to see what other kinds of ailments this oil &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m totally sold.</li>
            <li> Got this for a fungus plagued toenail and skin tags. It is taking care of my nail when the prescribed stuff didn&#x27;t do a thing...so very good there. Skin tags are getting smaller, one is gone, probably not using it enough. Slight smell but fine, ordered 2 bottles so far, will continue as well. People use this for all kinds of stuff and I&#x27;m so glad I know about it now</li>
            <li> Quick Shipment, product as described, and works.  This is my second order for tea tree oil and I&#x27;ll continue buying here when the need arises!</li>
            <li> I have had terrible skin problems for the past seven years. I would get blemishes on my skin that although they didn&#x27;t hurt, had the color of a wound. I have dark skin and these areas were always very light and would never heal to match my natural skin tone. I tried a lot of OTC meds and they didn&#x27;t work. I tried going to different dermatologists but that didn&#x27;t resolve anything and the meds they prescribed never worked. Needless to say I had grown pretty self conscious about this so I started doing my own research and came across forums recommending tea tree oil. That was the best advice ever! I have been using it for eight days and the blemish is healing and almost completely gone. The area scabbed up a bit and once the scab feel off, I could see my natural skin color peaking through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell isn&#x27;t great. It smells like a mix of Pine Sol and turpentine. With blemish free skin in my not so distant future, I can deal with that. Before this purchase I was skeptical about whether some homeopathic solution could do better than high grade pharmaceuticals. This little bottle of tea tree oil just did what seven years of pharmaceuticals couldn&#x27;t. I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for swollen feet and ankles. Several drops in coconut oil applied at night.</li>
            <li> Using a bit of this before going to bed cleared up the irritations and red bumps on my face a significant amount overnight. Granted, it smells like pure gasoline and WILL sting your eyes and nose with fumes alone if you use it around those areas, so be careful. There are some complaints about a dropper, but my bottle has a little plastic insert on the inside that just stops it from pouring much like what you see on a hot sauce bottle.    I bought this because the Bert&#x27;s Bees acne treatment just wasn&#x27;t working at all for my skin. Would recommend using either a few hours before you have to be somewhere or overnight due to the smell. The bottle is small, but one to two drops on a cotton ball is more than enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fresh like tea tree oil should, instead it is quite musky and unpleasant. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed as I&#x27;d been looking forward to using it. I got the Cinnamon Bark and Lavender oils from this brand and both smell fine but the tea tree oil is a HUGE let down. Buy a different brand for this oil.</li>
            <li> When my skin gets blemishes, I add 2-3 drops of this tea tree oil to unrefined coconut oil and use it as a daily moisturizer. For this to work well the oil must be pure and it has worked wonders with this brand.</li>
            <li> Since this is one of those oils that the FCC doesn&#x27;t care about, it&#x27;s hard sometimes to find this in an undiluted form (because people will find profit in anything they want). I have bought 3 bottles of this so far to treat my reoccurring foot... trouble... and can attest that this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is STRONG and I send my fiance screaming from the room whenever I use it. I happen to like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the design of the bottle, you will find that the fluid pours slowly at first and speeds up really quickly as the bottle drains. My first bottle went through quick because I didn&#x27;t realize this and dumped the last 1/3 of it on my foot in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> a great product. I ordered this oil along with other items the inside of the package was great but the outside wasn&#x27;t so hot. I also had a problem with the delivery. The delivery guy could find the package, so another delivery came later that evening.</li>
            <li> I use this when I wash my hair for scout treason and it works it is a very strong smell of the tree oil but I recommended if you need to treat your scalp</li>
            <li> A friend told me that Tea Tree oil was good for insect bites (like itchiness, etc.)  We have just moved into a new house and we have tons of spiders.  I have been using my Tea Tree oil on a spider bite and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Should have all lasted longer if they are 100%concentrated as stated when you purchase from them, which I will not be doing, even though price was okay, product was disappointing</li>
            <li> do not like the dropper! There is too much waste with the current dropper. Need to replace with a traditional style.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it and I seem to be allergic to the scent.</li>
            <li> After trying tag-away for over nine months, I tried using this stuff. It didn&#x27;t work either. Ended up using the Equate version of Compound W. It Worked. A little painful. But it worked and worked fast.</li>
            <li> Seems like good quality oil, but a very fast drip bottle! Hard to control drop amount you want!</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was suppose to clear up athletics foot.  I have used it for 3 weeks and have seen very little improvement.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, good.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for ten days, it had no affect on skin tags. No change what so ever. It had a strong turpentine smell. I wrote to  company and NO reply. There reviews claim they&#x27;ve seen changes to skin tags immediately, etc.. Wonder who wrote some these reviews. Internet a great place for the good and bad.....buyer beware.</li>
            <li> High quality essential oil in a user-friendly bottle. Company has a great product selection and I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have had 3 spots on my arm which would not heal. Just. a small rash but I have tried several antibiotic creams and ointments. Nothing seemed to help. I tried this oil and in just 5 days I have noticed the rash is smaller and isn&#x27;t red. I would recommend this to everyone, esp. if you want a natural product.</li>
            <li> My wife uses the oils mostly. We&#x27;ve got other oils from this brand that were great, but this tea tree oil just doesn&#x27;t seem quite as concentrated as others she has used.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a few skin tags but it did nothing for me, unfortunately.  However, I then tried it on some acne since I&#x27;ve read that it helps to get rid of that as well.  It helps greatly, in fact, it starts to work overnight and after a couple of days, it clears quickly!  Pretty cheap for acne flareups.  Yes, the smell is strong at first, since I wasn&#x27;t used to it, but after it was opened and I was using it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me anymore.</li>
            <li> Just great- no problems expected</li>
            <li> Might as well buy this cheaper at Trader Joes. Not a bad product, though. Didn&#x27;t work on skin tags at all - just burned them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the way the oil leaves the container.  It&#x27;s very controlled, drop-by-drop.  That may seem like a small thing, but this bottle is very small and the liquid very potent, so that&#x27;s more important than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> At first, I was VERY skeptical about tea tree oil&#x27;s ability to treat skin tags and dandruff, but I bought it because it was so cheap. After a week, I hated it - I saw no progress and was going to leave a 1 star review. But I decided to give it a little longer. So after about 18 days, my skin tags fell off. Granted, they were very sore the last couple days, the product did what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheap, Works exactly as described, virtually painless, no scarring or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Strong smell, terribly designed dropper, takes patience</li>
            <li> Not sure what what tea tree this came from sure wasn&#x27;t Earl Grey.  Seriously tho I can&#x27;t tell any benefit from this stuff. Unfortunately my bottle did not come with any sort of instructions, but I found a few ideas on the internet (which are always 100% correct/true) and my sister-in-law also always 100% right.  So far I still have ten fingers and ten toes, but my skin seems the same. Bought it hoping to clear up some dry itchy skin...no luck,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s antibacterial job though.</li>
            <li> My daughter got diagnosed with Molluscum contagiosum and the dices said no treatment available. After much research we decided to try this. After two weeks, 2 times a day it is almost completely cleared up. It smells terrible but well worth it!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil arrived exactly as pictured and has worked great for my use as part of a homemade mildew-removing spray. I only gave it 4 stars because of the value. I have found other stores carrying 15 ml. of tea tree oil for the same price. Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> A smelly modern version of snake oil, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> seems one of the better ones I&#x27;ve bought for the affordable price though I can&#x27;t tell for sure</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I purchased it in hopes that it would remove some sort of blemish that I had on my face that would not go away. I am guessing that it was some sort of skin tag since I had it for almost a year and it continued to slowly grow. I am still not sure what it was, but am thankful that it is now gone thanks to this tea tree oil. I applied it three times a day and in less than a month, it was gone. Since tea tree oil has so many uses, I will continue to keep a bottle of this in my cabinet at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this oil just on pimples and it dries them very fast. Also, my pimples doesn&#x27;t get ugly or big. This oil helps for my pimples not to get big. I love it.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Essential Oil is a very good product.  It even take care of acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li> My family and I use this product both topically for cuts, burns, insect bites, facial blemishes, etc.  We also mix this with other essential oils aromatically for certain outcomes.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil that I ordered is a fantastic buy for the price. It came in a padded envelope and the container was completely sealed. Tea tree oil is great for acne and other cuts/abrasions to help with the healing process and I would highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I Bought this based on the reviews to fight fungus on my toe andfingernails.  lt worked well, fingernails clear and toes much improved.</li>
            <li> I love this Tea Tree Oil!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buying it, but it works well on my acne and skin problems so far. I like the dropper lid, which keeps me from wasting it, since a little goes a long way. I dilute it into aloe vera gel, and sometimes jojoba oil, because it works even when diluted.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s really 100% pure (who can, anyway?) but I have not had any adverse reactions, and if you&#x27;re looking for a solid source of Tea Tree Oil, no frills, additives or premium grade (I&#x27;m guessing this is average), then this is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me</li>
            <li> buen producto lo uso para curar infecciones de garganta o para dolor de cabeza como aromaterapia curar pequeñas heridas funciona bien</li>
            <li> shipped relatively quick, and the oil itself it okay quality. it does the job and i like the small bottle, makes it portable</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face every night before bed and I have noticed I my rosacea doesnt bother me at all and the occasional acne I would get is gone.  It smells horrible but I find the benefits far out weigh the smell.  I just started my 11 year old son on it for horrible acne and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree, works great and I always keep some on hand. Nice product.</li>
            <li> great for adding to vinegar, water, baking soda and scrubbing my shower to a squeaky-clean shine!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks &amp; is super oily. I tried it for a skin tag but it was so potent that I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Instead I just used a Dr Scholls freeze away that took care of it in a week or so. I would like to return this product but because I already opened it &amp; it&#x27;s cheap I&#x27;m just going to keep it or toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I use this for fungus on my toe nail ,cold sore ,fleas bite ,and many others too many to names it all ,love melaleuca tea tree oil ,my first experience with tea tree oil is from the direct sale tea tree oil ,but I like the Amazon prices</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping and great results. I had an infection on my nose ring and withing 3 uses of the tree tea oil the infection had cleared out and I was even able to change the stud!</li>
            <li> This product is PURE and STRONG. Tea tree has SO many uses (just google for 100 things you can use tea tree oil for!) it is really a versatile product! Good quality!</li>
            <li> I brought it to put in my son shampoo and detangle to keep lice away.. has a little smell but isn&#x27;t noticeable after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> its perfect,it is the product that its supposed to be and it works for all the problems that tea tree oil is supposed to cure</li>
            <li> good product, i haven&#x27;t bought alot of different brands of tea tree oil, just this and one other, and they were both the same to me. i use this mixed with witchhazel for my acne, and i like it alot. would definently purchase again.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND IT&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT TO MIX WITH DR.BRONNERS SOAP AND BAKING SODA TO WASH MY DREADS&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly and just as described. The smell is strong, but nothing overbearing and what you would expect from a tree oil. Overall very happy, using it to treat an acne scar.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB. I have cystic acne and it dries it fairly quickly. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work on skin tags</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil for a variety of different uses. I purchased this for my pimples and my ingrown hairs I get every now and then. This product worked for me, clearing them up in a few days.  The oil is %100 pure and has a very distinct smell that does take a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this product is that it does not come with a dropper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she says it works, so there...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product! Super fast processing and shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really love this tea tree oil for treating the fungus under my toenails.  It and the pure melaleuca oils are the only thing I have found that work.</li>
            <li> As a nurse working in places that can have scabies outbreaks etc. I like to keep this around. Any areas on myself that I have in question I put tea tree oil on after working with such patients. I have used this company&#x27;s tea tree oil and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality. This product was sent professionally and I received it within days.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a week with no results.  Also, the oil has a very unpleasant odor associated to the product.  Will continue for another couple of days...however, at this point it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have a nose piercing, and one day I woke up, and there it was... the dreaded &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34;. I start freaking out, like every emotional girl does, and was doing some research on what would make it go away. I tried salt water soaks, and those didn&#x27;t work. The next best thing was tea tree oil. It came in the mail, and I immediately put some on a cotton swab and rubbed the swab around the outside of my piercing. It smells a little weird for someone that has never used it before (like me), but nothing bad enough to make me stop using it. Within the night, the bump had gone down considerably! I did this again for the next 4 days, twice a day, and now my nose is bump free! Thank you tea tree oil, for making me feel human, once again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but I bought this more for its antiseptic, antifungal and antibacterial properties. For those qualities, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my recent body odor problems (I dab a bit under my arms at after i shower everyday instead of using deodorant when i don&#x27;t need an antiperspirant). I took a while for my body to adjust to it, but now my body odor is practically gone, so the oil is worth it for that alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face now, and it has helped my face quite a bit (i have combination skin with lots of acne)... I apply moisturizer, then apply this over it, and do that every morning and night, and have been doing this for 2 weeks, and my skin has improved (my skin&#x27;s not completely healed, but it has been improved nonetheless).</li>
            <li> A handy oil to have around!</li>
            <li> small bottle of magic tea tree stuff. This stuff STINKS by the way but it works well. It runs out a bit too fast so get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Used this in a &amp;#34;cold and flu bomb&amp;#34; mix...in diffuser and by the spoon.  Nixed my slight cold so fast!</li>
            <li> Very good customer service product is convenient to use and so far seems to work</li>
            <li> After battling for over 3 months with sudden onset adult acne (the cystic kind and I am 34 yrs old), I read that tea tree oil helps (after trying EVERY known home remedy and spent hundreds of dollars purchasing acne treatments).  I purchased this product along with another brand of tea tree oil (the Desert Essence brand wasn&#x27;t noticeably effective).  My face was a wreck, covered in acne, with scars already setting in.  I have used this oil for 9 days, nightly, straight from the bottle with no other dilution.  The smell is very strong but I have gotten used to it.  I wash my face with Missha Super Aqua anti trouble wash, use the  matching toner (I used Missha&#x27;s acne care alone for over a month with fewer new breakouts but it wasn&#x27;t really helping get rid of what I already had), then apply the tea tree oil a few hours before bed to allow it to absorb.  When I wake, I would apply Vitamin E oil, let it set for a few hours, then wash it off.  I get a few dry little scabs on the spots when I wake, but the Vitamin E oil gets rid of that.  I am happy to say that my face is looking better!!  The protruding cysts have diminished down to flat spots (some of these have diminished within a day), pain and redness is gone and it&#x27;s already fading out the scars.  After 9 days!  I have had no other breakouts.  Seeing that I am using other products (vitamin E and Missha), I can still say that after adding the tea tree oil to my regimen, it has made a significant improvement.  I highly recommend.  Please note that not all acne regimens work for everyone.  It&#x27;s trial and error.  What works for some, may not work for you.  You just have to try everything.  I am very happy and I am at the moment purchasing another bottle to continue my treatment.  I&#x27;m going to make a toner out of the oil for daily prevention after my face is cleared up completely.  I do hope this works for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> smells good,clear the skin and foot.  no other fongal cream works on me, after using it for a week I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes..love it!</li>
            <li> I applied this product to a skin tag on the side of my neck and the smell is hard to handle.  Can&#x27;t really say if this product would have taken that skin tag off if I had kept applying the oil a couple of times a day.  You can&#x27;t put this on and go out into public.  People will make fun of you for your strong smell!</li>
            <li> This is pure tea tree oil so it can be a little strong but easily diluted with other oils. Works great and heals many skin ailments</li>
            <li> Definitely useful around the house (cleaning).  It comes at a very reasonable price too, which is an extra bonus.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have a preauricular pit, or sinus pit, which has a persistent infection and smelly drainage, consider using this product to control the problem.  I&#x27;ve suffered from a draining sinus pit all my life and have never found a way to fix the problem that wouldn&#x27;t involve surgery.  Having heard that tea tree is a natural antibacterial agent, and that people use it on ear piercings, I got the idea that I may be able to use it to control my infected sinus pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze all the discharge out of the pit and then add a couple drops of tea tree oil directly in to the hole (or as my horrified wife said, &amp;#34;directly in to your head!&amp;#34;).  Whatever - it works.  The puss and the smell goes away for at least a few days anytime I use it.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my diabetic Mother who has been having problems with her feet,When she feels that she is starting to get the redness on her feet or ankles she will rub the tea tree oil on them and by the next day the redness and soreness is gone... works really well for her..</li>
            <li> Could smell better but does what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I use this for an incurable chronic infection flare-up.  When I feel a flare-up starting, I use a small amount of this oil.  It seems to stop the flare-up, which means less antibiotics for more serious flare-ups.  It is worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I purchased this product to help remove skin tags and it really does the job!  It takes a few weeks of repeated application and it does smell odd but beats having to make trip to the doctors office!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product but make sure to educate yourself first.  It is literally an all-around useful product with great results.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all for skin tags and smells like you live in a pine forest.</li>
            <li> It came on time and  in good condition and works just fine. I purchased it for making homemade cleaning solutions and for my son&#x27;s ear that has some sort of fungus on the lobe.</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil for my cartilage piercing infection, and this along with sea salt soaks fixed the issue completely in a few weeks. The only complaint I have is the dropper. It&#x27;s strange and kind of annoying. Overall, good product!</li>
            <li> I brought the Tea Tree Oil to add into my shampoo for my hair. I have very dry scalp and I read that Tee Tree Oil was very good in managing this issue. I only used the oil twice and so far so good. The scent is indeed strong but that&#x27;s tea tree for you - I really don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> The oil smells like a land fill, after only 2 uses the ugly colors on my toe nails have vanished, will keep using but not indoors because the smell tends to lurk for a while.</li>
            <li> Put it on before bed because of the medicine smell but it seems to work.  Skin tags reduced dramatically after the first few uses. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not remove skin tags.  I wanted to remove ONE, TINY skin tag on my chest, and this stuff didn&#x27;t do it.  I applied it diligently 2 to 3 times a day for a week and a half.  Judging from similar reports online, the tag should have disappeared.  For its small size, it should have just shriveled up and fallen off (or have been easy enough to pluck off).  Nope...nothing....still have it on my chest.  And the best part was that the area surrounding the tag turned very rough and red...clearly a sign of skin irritation.  My next strategy will be to use Dawn dishwashing liquid.  Allegedly, that&#x27;s how my grandmother removed her skin tags.  Long story short:  avoid this product at all costs if you&#x27;re only using it for skin tag removal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a natural tick and flea repellant for my dog and so far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> Had a friend recommend the product to me and I tried it out.  Really helps with tension headaches and the smell is just lovely.</li>
            <li> Purchased for skin tag removal.&lt;br /&gt;Works well. Small skin tags dry up if used&lt;br /&gt;twice a day for about two weeks. Larger ones,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but keep it away from your cats! They are attracted to this but it&#x27;s deadly to them. Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I used this diluted as a spray to get rid of black mold on window sills- it&#x27;s fantastic.  I will definitely buy this again as I need it, but so far no black mold returning and it&#x27;s been 2 months.</li>
            <li> this is a great product can do you wonders.  i bought this product since it has great reviews and the product didnt disappoint me</li>
            <li> I bought this product over less expensive ones thinking it would be of better quality.  The cheaper one i bought after was better.  Much better. This product did not do what it was purchased for ( reducing scars formed as a result of a piercing.)</li>
            <li> I read that this stuff would remove skin tags and I had one so it really did workand I am happy</li>
            <li> I use this for so many things--wounds, rashes, problems with skin.  I think it smells wonderful, and I would recumbent it.</li>
            <li> I use it on face and for most of the skin problems. I don&#x27;t know how, but it works. Pretty strong but bit expensive. So use with cotton swabs to minimise the loss.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Good product!</li>
            <li> I call this my \\&quot;little bottle from the fountain of youth\\&quot;. I use this on problem areas twice a day and use all over my face about once a week. I have had no breakouts since using this product. I also have small flesh colored moles on my face that have gotten significantly smaller. I have gotten comments on how good i have been looking. I dont know why tea tree oil is not more mainstream, i did not find this product harsh at all on my skin. I love this stuff! My boyfriend uses it now after seeing how it has helped my skin. Gets rid of blemishes, blackheads, evens out my skin tone.... the list goes in and on!</li>
            <li> My only advice, is use a very little amount! the smell is VERY strong and overwhelming. Shipping was fast and I was overall, pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle of tea tree oil, but it will last you forever. Tea tree oil is way too harsh to use undiluted, so I&#x27;ve been using a few drops mixed with water in a small spray bottle. I use this for everything--I spray it on cuts or scrapes to use as an antiseptic, spray it on my pillow to prevent acne--I even spray it in my shoes to kill bacteria. I find that it speeds up healing and definitely helps prevent skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have purchased about 20 essential oils from this company and in every case the product was powerful and effective. I have used other essential oil brands that cost much more and these oils compare very well with those produced by other companies.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use Tea Tree Oil with Coconut Oil for dandruff in my hair.  This is a great treatment and this oil worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This smells awful!  I use other brands of tea tree oil that don&#x27;t make me gage.  Save your money and go with another brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this tea tree oil by Plant Therapy.  I use it for cleaning and topical uses (properly diluted) and it is amazing.  I also use for aromatherapy and it is a great addition to blends for germ fighting and allergies.</li>
            <li> On time, super, we use it for healing, cuts and sores.&lt;br /&gt;Right sizes to add to first aid bag for the car</li>
            <li> I did not like this oil. I got it to use it in my face steamer but hated the smell, I usually don&#x27;t mind that kind of thing but the smell just reminds me of public restrooms being cleaned.</li>
            <li> Came as subscripted high quality essential oil.  Use in my face toner. Face feels so clean and refreshed. Using the tea tree oil with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil in general, but this one was a little bit too expensive. It did do the job, though.  I wear braids a lot, so it is very good to use some oil that will remove fungus from the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used this tea tree oil in conjunction with 100% pure, organic aloe vera gel, to heal a sebacious cyst.  While it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the cyst, it minimized it so much that a doctor said it was not well-defined enough to remove it and it has not gotten infected again.</li>
            <li> I use this to make sure my kids don&#x27;t get lice. I just add a little to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for treating wounds, minor wounds.</li>
            <li> Bought to use on skin tags.  No effect after using full bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for...and much less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. I use it in a homemade toner mix, and using it has helped keep zits and such to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advise of my mother for a skin problem. it has taken care of the problem. great stuff</li>
            <li> After reading much hype about the benefits if tea tree oil, I purchased this product based on the ratings. When I received it, I was a little put off by the smell as I wasn&#x27;t familiar with how potent it should be. The entire night I smelled like pinesol mixed with moth balls, the next day I had a red welt near a spot I had placed it and it itched as if I was having an allergic reaction. I laid off for a couple of days, then reapplied again diluted this time and same thing. I was soooo disappointed as I hoped this was the cure for my skin issues. I went to my massage therapist today who makes her own essential oil mixes and asked her if she knew what Tea Tree oil was supposed to sell, she handed me a pure 100% bottle of cold fused tea tree oil and I smelled it, it smelled tons better than this brand. Yes it had a woodsy pine smell, but it was not chemical based. I have now purchased from Edens Garden on Amazon, and she says it is the only brand she will buy now. Save yourself the money and purchase another brand!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to do... but smells really really nice. Too bad it didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to :(</li>
            <li> Junk.  Doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does (remove warts/skin tags).</li>
            <li> I chose this rating for a couple of reason, this is hard to find locally and at a good price. When you do find it locally it has been mixed with other things, not what I am looking for. I keep this in my home for scrapes, cuts and bruises, also when I have had minor dental issues, it works very well as a rinse until you can see a dentist, three drops to warm water, rinse, and you are good to go. This is the real thing, pure , undiluted,  I recommend your getting  it and keeping it in your home or first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is tea tree oil, and the product seems very good.  The dispensing mechanism, on the other hand, is a disaster.  If you just need to pour this out into your hands or an applicator of some sort, this product is fine for you.  If, on the other hand, you are trying to put this directly on a cut or something, good luck.  You either get a drop or two, or it starts pouring out.  I have never seen a dispenser like this and it doesn&#x27;t seem removable (if it is, it would be messy).</li>
            <li> Received my product in a timely fashion, the product is 100% tea tree oil. I add it to my conditioner , and  mix with other oil for moisture and to help easy my itchy scalp. Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else yet.</li>
            <li> Worked great for getting rid of mold on wood caused by a water leak.  Used 1 tsp in cup of water in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think of this product.  I bought it with hope that it would help with my skin tags on my neck. I did put it on daily and cover with a band aid and eventually it fell off but I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that it was the tea tree oil that did it. I have covered my skin tags before and so called suffocated them. I will try again and update soon.</li>
            <li> great stuff and great price!! i have to write 15 words so i am writing more and more. i hope this helps your purchase :-)</li>
            <li> I got this bottle of tea tree oil because I&#x27;d heard it is a natural way to fight mold and mildew.  It&#x27;s exactly as advertised-a 10 mL bottle of the stuff.  Don&#x27;t be concerned that it&#x27;s so small-it&#x27;s highly concentrated.  The first thing I did when I got it was dilute it with water in a spray bottle.  The seller got it to me relatively quickly and in great condition.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didnt care for the bottle and found that TTO can be purchased other places for less for what we use it for.</li>
            <li> This has been great on my red, flakey, open eczema rashes. It doesn&#x27;t sting like tea tree oil I&#x27;ve bought at the drugstore. It is truly an oil and soothes. It&#x27;s a bonus that I don&#x27;t have to dilute it or worry about it irritating me even more.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of a long time keloid on my earlobe. I used it daily like it said but nothing really helped by using this. Maybe if i were to get a bigger size it would but I think i will just face the fact that all things won&#x27;t work for certain people.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would meet the testimonial standard and it failed. If you apply it to dry skin it dries it out even further and produced no visible beneficial medicinal effects. I understand fully that it may work wonders for someone else. For my mild yet persistent surface redness and dryness it looked like I had used rubbing alcohol on it. Caveat Emptor. Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> The top is odd... I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work consistently. It smells like pine-sol. Really, really strong sent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a couple skin tags and it has done nothing, although, I have read many reviews stating that it does work.  Also, it stinks!</li>
            <li> Picked out this product b/c it was the cheapest with highest stars. It&#x27;s good stuff, got rid of my dandruff in short order and all that stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews but it simply does not work. It smells strong, not unpleasant, I&#x27;m sure it is what it claims to be, if you put some in a plastic cup with a little water it will melt the cup within a couple of hours. Change in skin tags 0%. I have small skin tags, I thought it would be no problem to take care of. I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I successfully held oral thrush at bay whilst waiting for my doc to return from vacation by rinsing with 2 drops of tea tree and two drops of cinnamon oils TID.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certain we&#x27;ll find loads of other uses, too, but if that&#x27;s all it ever does...thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a nifty undercap that helps you get just a drop at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this company!</li>
            <li> Okay first I ordered peppermint oil from this company and now the tea tree . . . they are both awesome!  The uses have been great and I&#x27;m amazed how I&#x27;ve cured things naturally.  Tea Tree oil is great for bumps, although it stings if the skin is exposed.  I plan to order lavender next and keep a regular supply!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help remove my tags.</li>
            <li> great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried tea tree oil before. Smells great. Been using it on my scalp and so far it&#x27;s working to reduce flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for my SO&#x27;s toenail fungus. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and the nail is beginning to grow out without any signs of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit the euro dropper is strange but if you hold it upside down and have 2 seconds of patience, a perfect drop will fall out. After 3 weeks of using 2x a day its only 1/3 down. It has a very strong smell which indicates the concentration and quality of the tea tree oil to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product and good seller, would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a cartilage piercing in my ear that is taking a long time to heal.  If I sleep on that side I get a nasty red bump near the opening of the piercing, and applying this tea tree oil with a q-tip has helped significantly!  When I use it regularly the bump is nearly gone and the piercing seems to be healing better.  I also read you can use it for acne, although I haven&#x27;t experimented with it much further yet.</li>
            <li> There is nothing i can say about this product to do it justice. I use it for acne and it works flawlessly. All good things take time, but using this for over a month or so now, my acne has subsided for the most part. I order 3 or more of these every once in a while, just to have stock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: you get use to the smell after a while. It might seem bad at first, but it&#x27;s actually not that bad once you become a regular user.</li>
            <li> Aside from the product arriving with a loose cap and 25% of the oil leaked into the packaging, I believe the product will eventually aid in shrinking or removing skin tags.  I do like it - even if the scent is initially strong upon application.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packaged and is exactly what it says it is. Use if as an antimicrobial/fungal, good for acne and scarring and skin tags.</li>
            <li> I have been having terrible problems with itchy ears and the doctor finally told me to try tea tree oil, but get a good quality.  This product really helped, did not hurt my ears (as other versions have in the past) and is very nice.  The only issue is that it does not come with a dropper, so I had to find one and take the rubber stopper out of it.</li>
            <li> i chose this product because i needed to replace it.  i am well pleased with this product.  i have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil. I use it for cuts, facial cleansing(it heals acne), any sort of infections(from hang nails or cut cuticles to scrapes and blisters). The quality is always excellent. I have ordered this oil 4 times, and will continue to use this product. My facial breakouts have stopped. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. I mix this oil with a little argan oil. I use 3 drops of the PlantTherapy tea tree mixed with 6-7drops of pure argan. It keeps my face glowing.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic.. I&#x27;ve been using it on my acne along with dr bronners tea tree soap! They have cleared up acne..</li>
            <li> This is the oil that began my essential oil (EO) addiction.  I had bought it originally to use it for skin tags and now I make my own ear mite treatment with this for my dog (poisonous for cats), age spots, fever blisters, oil diffuser, etc. I have even bought this and given them as gifts. Soldiers in World War II were given tea tree oil in their standard issue first aid kits for burns, cuts, scratches, tropical infections and as insect repellent. If it was good enough for them it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> We have well over 50 different essential oils that we have used for years. I use Tea Tree oil very often since I am a type 1 diabetic using an insulin pump and a continuous monitoring system. Both of these require weekly insertion into my body. Tea Tree has kept me from having any infections at these sites for well over 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils are natures goodness for humanity as well as for our animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Plant Therapy to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for keeping skin clear and avoiding blemishes.  I&#x27;ve spent way too much time pouring over items in the pharmacy, trying to find some sort of skin cream/wash/cloth that effectively combats acne and skin problems, usually with mixed results at best.  A few drops of this on any irritated spot in the morning usually has it clear within a day.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and expect to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well on my skin tags as I had hoped, but my son felt a cold sore coming on and he put the oil on immediately and it stopped the cold sore.</li>
            <li> As always, Plant Therapy never disappoints</li>
            <li> As with other reviews which enticed me to use, I found adding to the shampoo was worse. I added to a scare on my forearm - etc and have not found it to be inovative. I asked the makers to provide other benefits and got NO answer. So - for me, it is okay.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I forget to use it on a regular basis like we were supposed to, but my son applies it and it smells fabulous.  Good product for the price. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item and had it shipped to my APO/DPO address. The estimated time of arrival was approx 12 days (i ordered it on a weekend) and it got here in 7....so great shipping time in my opinion. I&#x27;ve only been able to use it now for a few days which i don&#x27;t think is enough time to really give an accurate statement as to if it works well or not. I bought it because of my breakouts and i had heard that tea tree oil was good for this sort of thing. I read some reviews that mentioned that it should not be used alone since it may dry out your skin so i&#x27;ve been using a bit of pure aloe vera with it also. One drop is more than enough as the smell is kind of intense, it may even make your eyes water a bit. I suggest using this at night or when you won&#x27;t be around other people for a couple hours or so as the strong scent lasts a while. When/If it works, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my post.</li>
            <li> Tried it on a variety of skin problems. If you asked the dermatologist, everything I had was eczema. Fingers, eyelids, ear canal. The stuff he prescribed didn&#x27;t seem to eradicate it so I tried the tea tree oil. They&#x27;re right,my bathroom smelled like a pine grove (turpentine). Haven&#x27;t given up but no positive results so far. I&#x27;m told it works for skin mites... I can believe that.</li>
            <li> all good, no complains, would buy again. I use it in humidifier in mine and my baby&#x27;s room and this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Hard to say how effective it is.</li>
            <li> This is great for killing mold, bacteria, and viruses, plus it smells really good.  I will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i have ordered this tea tree oil and I love it. Instead of spending tons of $ on expensive dandruff shampoos, I have been adding this to my home made herbal hair mask 2-3 times a week and my scalp is no longer constantly itchy!!</li>
            <li> I use this oil mixed with Pin Sol to keep bugs away in kitchen...always works and is much better than chemicals!  Arrived on time and the price was right!</li>
            <li> I used it for dermatitis; it is clearing the area.  I would order again if I had need to use it.</li>
            <li> I am using this in my toenails and it is working, the nails are looking much better. I realized that this is an ingredient in my dogs shampoo so when he started scratching I put a little on his skin and it soothed his skin and no more scratching.</li>
            <li> I love your essential oils.  Wonderful quality, wonderful price. I will definitely order in the future.  I have quite a few I want to try.</li>
            <li> Some really nice stuff! I got this product since it had the perfect price point for me. I think it is a nice product. I have used others that I liked a little bit better. Other seems to have a stronger smell- I don&#x27;t know if that is a good or bad thing, but I prefer it. Product seems to work like all others and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tea Tree oil because I read it was great for adding to water and cleaning sponges.  I decided to see what other uses and discovered it was great for acne or scars.  Last week I added a small drop to acne and notice the bumps peeling the next day.  The smell is REALLY strong but goes away quickly.  I believe it slightly reduce the pain due the swelling of acne.  I also read you can add to shampoo to eliminate dandruff.  Not sure if I am bold enough to try that but will definitely try on scars.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I got this for a skintag and it worked... I put this on 3-4 times a day and a week later it&#x27;s gone. I also like how they put it&#x27;s kid safe on there and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would definitely order again. We use a few drops of tea tree oil mixed with white vinegar and keep it in a spray bottle in the kitchen. Makes a great, low-cost, non-toxic, all-purpose, kid-safe countertop sanitizer, cleaner and ant deterrent.</li>
            <li> Have you ever gone to bed with a clear face, only to wake up the next morning with a big red spot glaring back at you in the mirror??  Well it happened to me.....yikes!  Thank goodness I had received the tea oil in the mail the day before.  I immedietly applied it to the red spot,which appeared to be some type of &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; and by the next morning the ugly red spot was hardly visible and by the next day was completly gone!!  Since then I have applied it to a burn, two cuts and another bite, this time on my arm.  Every time, it worked like a.....charm!!!</li>
            <li> once again i must say i am pleased with this product will reorder again. i have encouraged and have several of my friends that are also using tea tree oil not only foor theirselves but also for their pets. thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this to take away my skin tags. I almost bought the &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; stuff but the reviews were so bad I bought this and it works great!! They are almost gone and it&#x27;s only been 4 days!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in making homemade baby wipes.  The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li> I bought these to self-treat my big-toe-nail fungus. I have read online that the medicines for toenail fungus are pretty harsh on your liver and they are often ineffective. So I thought I really had nothing to lose to try this product before I sought a more rigorous means of healing. I applied this to my toe nail every day for about 6 months and now I have completely gotten rid of the annoying fungus. So I give my two thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> I am using this along with lavender and peppermint oils to combat mites.  I use it in a hot bath and it has&lt;br /&gt;been very effective while also leaving my skin feeling smooth and much less dry.  I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Euro dropper&amp;#34; is something that I am not familiar with.  It is difficult to apply the oil with it.  I was expecting either a glass dropper or a suction dropper.  I would suggest that more description be given or pictures of the dropper.  Including instructions on how to use it with the shipping would be nice too.</li>
            <li> I tried on a pimple and it dried it up in just a couple of days. Works great and natural.</li>
            <li> Perfect in all beverages.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting really dry scalp along my hairline and once I put a little of this (mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier) it cleared right up. Now after each wash I apply the mixture and my dry scalp is all gone!</li>
            <li> Great oil at a great price!</li>
            <li> So everyone knows the reviews for Tea Tree, we (personally) use it on everything from papercuts, slivers, burns, scars etc.  So what Im reviewing is this brand, Im happy with this bottle and packaging BECAUSE it doesnt come out too fast, there is some home party brand out there that will charge you twice to triple the price for the same thing, but the problem with their brand is the bottles and plastic stoppers, they are soooo big and loose that the oils POUR out, this is perfect, I can tape out a drop or two, or use a clean Qtip to get it out. We tend to use qtips. I really like this brand and how they package them and the plastic insert in the bottle so this doesnt spill everywhere and isnt too hard to get out.</li>
            <li> It does work well for burning in a burner and for using (sparringly) in bath products, it does not smell as nice as some others that I have used in the past, but overall it does have the medicinal qualities I need so I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used this on some skin tags on my legs &amp; they were gone in less than a week.  Love it!</li>
            <li> it does the job thats what i like</li>
            <li> It is not working at all.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for skin tags and it&#x27;s working slowly but surely.  They are drying up ....it would probably work quicker but I forget to use it some days.  Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the odor.  The description suggests that the smell is buffered but I found it precluded my using the oil.</li>
            <li> Bought it for skin tags. I would put in on my skin tags everyday for 3 months, 2x a day. Didnt work...it does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> Finally, 100% pure oil! Although I hate the smell, this oil worked wonders on my ezcema. I also put a few drops in my shampoo and conditioner for that fresh, clean feel. Good product.</li>
            <li> A great product but the bottle design could be better. I am blind in one eye. The way this bottle is designed way too much came out and I finished the whole bottle in one week. I warned my husband and so he is extra careful with his bottle. The way to address the bottle problem is to take out the plastic insert and use a little make up brush to apply the oil to your toe nails. It works great. !!I bought this through Amazon and we now buy everything we can through Amazon Prime... what a deal...</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil! I got it at a great price and it arrived quickly! The oil seems to be a great quality and was just what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I already knew so many benefits of Tea Tree Oil and is a must in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;This time I am using it to remove a pilar cyst from my scalp.  After 8 days of treatment it is less than 1/2 its size.&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B005V2UI5Y Tea Tree (Melaleuca) Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a 5 star.  Such power in a little bottle.  I bought this at the same time as the Relax Synergy Essential Oil.  I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  Recommend.  A different sort of odor than lavender or vanilla, but quite addictive.  rlw</li>
            <li> CANNOT live without tea tree oil. My neck, my back, my acne and my plaque. ( Hair plaque..dandruff. I put drops in my shampoo.) I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I received this product and some had spilled out in the package (the bottle was sealed, but the lid wasn&#x27;t turned all the way) and so I just left a message for the company I bought it from.  I didn&#x27;t want a return for my money or anything, I just wanted to let them know to prevent future instances like mine from happening and they company actually sent me a whole bottle at no cost.  They stand behind their product and their customer service!  I would buy from them again :).  The smell is obviously tea tree which is invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Therapy essential oils. Help with fongus on toe mail, IT take sometime but works recommended</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t removed not one skin tag yet</li>
            <li> It cured a chronic skin rash in just one week. I would recommend to this product to anyone. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt this isn&#x27;t 100% pure essencial oil, but from what I previous believed tea tree oil smelled like.. This was not it. Honestly, it could be how they all smell and I&#x27;ve only sampled the odor of tea tree oil in products that are blending serval &amp;#34;ingredients.&amp;#34; I expected a fresh, invigorating aroma.. and this sadly, almost smelled industrial. &#x3D;/ Very harsh- even wish a small drop on your skin that&#x27;s been airing out for a while. Hopefully, it still upholds are the benefits and just doesn&#x27;t smell how I expected.. C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is very potent and works very good for my scalp. I used it to clean my scalp due to the dryness I was experiencing, it works like a charm, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS. I&#x27;VE ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW DAYS NOW, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. THE SCENT IS A LITTLE STRONG AT FIRST, BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.</li>
            <li> My mom always added water and then a couple drops of the oil to her oil burner and the smells would fill the house. Next time I use this it will be without the water so that I can really get the smell. It reminds me of when I was younger when my mom and grandma would bust out the T36C7. I love associating smells with memories.</li>
            <li> I bought this as the recommendation of my midwife to use as a Post-partum peri-bottle solution. OH MY!!! IT WORKS!!!! It was cleansing and soothing after giving birth to my daughter. I have used it for other things as well, such as ringworm and nail growth.</li>
            <li> Overall this tea tree oil is amazing. Works great on skin for acne and for moisture. However it would make things 100% easier if it came with a glass dropper instead. Anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil should take note of the VERY pungent smell as well, but I love this oil and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the bottle may have been broken as there was no eye dropper to apply so it didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to see results.</li>
            <li> good for so many things</li>
            <li> Works great. However, I should have listened to other reviews, the dropper sucks. The oil doesn&#x27;t drip out when you hold it upside down, it pours down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> trea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;recommended product to my sister. was pleased with product. i would purchase it again and would try other products from manufacturer</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. Some people either love the smell or hate it...I love it &amp;#60;3  works on so many things!</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil to cure my acne. I can see result after only 2 uses. It&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and felt it was worth the price I paid for it. Tea Tree Oil is a fix all in my opinion - every household should have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Order was on time and the oil smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used Melalauca oil for years for healing properties. Now we have an adorable little Pom puppy with baby teeth like tiny pointed razors and she often missed her toys when we are playing and tags my thin skin arm drawing blood.  I found that the Tea Tree oil smells so strongly that she is much more cautious and doesn&#x27;t get near my arm.  Win-win. I no longer look like the loser in a fight with barbed wire.  Thanks Plant Therapy Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> Do not care for the smell.  Cannot use on my scalp because the smell is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Exactly as specified, so many uses I could write a book. Buy this and use it for hair, skin, pets, etc. it works and feels great.</li>
            <li> Obviously good quality and not diluted with \\&quot;fillers.\\&quot; I looked at many before I decided on this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with the choice.</li>
            <li> Definitely 100% pure essential oil. The smell is as potent as it gets for tea tree oil. Used it for some fungal issues, which were dealt with quickly and effectively. Make sure to dilute properly, it seems to be very strong. A little pricey, yet reasonable for the quality of the product. Extremely happy I tried this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells but that would be ok if it worked, it is worthless, it is tree oil, think I&#x27;ll use it to oil my tree</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff works great for athletes feet, its a really good product and smells like pinesol.  Got rid of my athlete feet but takes several week even a month or 2 to take effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about the many benefits of tea tree oil. I use this for homemade cleaning solutions as a disinfecting agent. I mix a few drops with my shampoo during the week to help clean my scalp and prevent dandruff. I use it as part of a DIY insect deterrent and spray around my house to keep bugs out of the house. Dabbing a bit on mild acne breakouts works well too. So useful!</li>
            <li> Good buy. Quality product .</li>
            <li> This is very high quality, potent oil.  I use it with distilled water as a spray for my hair and it&#x27;s great.  The smell fades if you don&#x27;t overdo it.  If you know tea tree, it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like roses.</li>
            <li> Really good company.  It didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped for my skin tags, but did help the toenail some.  I still recommend this company</li>
            <li> favorite brand!  works great!</li>
            <li> Smells like the holy ghost just came after your nose but it works great in getting rid of my flakes/dandruff</li>
            <li> just as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I thought this would have a foul smell but it actually smells great! In little time I have notice that the infected area is slowing returning to its original color. I have to complete the treatment first but I have 2 weeks with it using it twice a day and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on skin tags!! Used the Tea Tea oil 3X per.day on skin tags around the neck.  Within 2 weeks they were gone!! I am planning to purchase this again.  BEST VALUE and GREAT Company!!!!</li>
            <li> Not diluted like so many other products so this lasts a long time and is strong enough for all needs.</li>
            <li> After reading blogs about oil cleansing I decided to try it, and they all recommend tea tree oil for blemishes.  It works great, I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell like Pine Sol.  I received my package within a couple of days and was very satisfied with the price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is a terrible disorder where you get really bad cysts around apocrine sweat glands or subaceous glands. Mine go around...a sensitive area down south. It is terrible! There is no cure, so diet changes and homeopathic remedies are usually the best result since doctors only want to put you on extended doses of antibiotics. I for one would rather have my body not become resistant to antibiotics, so I chose the homeopathic route.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is supposed to be anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal, so a lot of HS sufferers have used it on cysts. I&#x27;ve been having some bad flare-ups, so I decided to try out this method. So far, so good! It is amazing how it takes a raw, sore cyst and makes it feel so much better. There is literally no pain after application. I apply it 3-4 times a day directly on the cyst, and it is working wonders. They are even healing quicker, and the scars left are being healed, too!&lt;br /&gt;This would only work with high quality tea tree oil, so I will definitely be using this brand again. So happy to finally have found something that works!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, for any other HS sufferers, I am also taking 90mg of zinc every day. This is supposed to help the infection from inside out. I&#x27;m double-hitting this, and seeing results. Yay!</li>
            <li> I like this oil, I use it for my dry itchy scalp and it works wonders,I also make my own body scrubs with other essential oils and tea tree is one the oils I use.</li>
            <li> Great, wonderful, fantastic, love it.</li>
            <li> Skin hair nails all will reap the benefits of this amazing oil.  I use it a few times a week but I am learning how to use it even more!</li>
            <li> Love the Plant Therapy oils!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my acne symptoms.  It must be diluted first! Great company, great product! Its pure and inexpensive! I use this oil on almost everything!</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil really does a great job of healing and we use it for both human and animal applications. Most recently, I ordered some to combine with sulphur and vaseline to heal a fungal infection/wound on one of our horses. She has healthy skin growing now after just three applications. The service was quick and the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> it smells very strong, but it works. I got this for my acne, and it slowly disapears! This is a must have for every one!</li>
            <li> WOW it dried up my husband staff infection he got on his back from the college gym! He DID NOT go to a Dr instead I watched this stuff dry that horrible thing up before my eyes! I bought it for him...I had used that dirty college showers and had this really itchy athletes foot between my little toe so I dabbed some of this on! GONE! Itch immediately stopped and it dried up. I will never again be without it in by bathroom cupboard as I have seen and felt its results. It will dry up any pimples you&#x27;ve got too! Sure the smell is strong, kind of like sandalwood mixed with eucalyptus, but there are a lot of whining babies on these reviews complaining about the smell and missing the miraculous anti fungus, bacterial and virual properties it has. Used this liberally on my husband&#x27;s back and my toe so I bought another as I panic now if I don&#x27;t have any! Put it on cuts, burns any skin ailment and I bet you will be amazed how quickly things heal up!</li>
            <li> It works well....kind of has a pine sol scent to it, which I could do without, but it helps with my scalp issues</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the European dropper isn&#x27;t all that wonderful.  I simply use a cotton ball or Q tip.  Smells great, good price, and the shipping was super fast.</li>
