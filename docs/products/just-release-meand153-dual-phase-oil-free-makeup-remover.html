            <li>Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Very happy w/ this product!</li>
            <li>But it works very very good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on mascara, though, and I don&#x27;t even wear waterproof.</li>
            <li>I use a great deal of waterproof makeup on a layer of primer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Their eye-makeup remover is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, works great, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>Philosophy products are truly amazing!</li>
            <li>and I found Mary Kay&#x27;s oil free makeup remover to be the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>My favorite eye make up remover!</li>
            <li>WHICH IS AMAZING</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I recommend buying your own leak proof container from REI or Container Store and putting it in there.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I saw I could purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Anything that removes waterproof make-up effectively has some amount of oil in the product.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy Just Release Me Eye Makeup Remover is my &#x27;best new find&#x27; product in YEARS!</li>
            <li>This is the best and most gentle remover I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>This is a non-oily eye-make-up remover that gets off most make up.  </li>
            <li>remover - both were absolutely fantastic!).</li>
            <li>Need more than 5 stars for this one.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never been fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great gentle eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It melts off even the most stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Philosophy keeps winning me over one product at a time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also no regulated dripper on the bottle that most eye-makeup remover bottles have.  </li>
            <li>works good but have to make sure and not apply toooo much it is very oily</li>
            <li>a wonderful make up remover, doesn&#x27;t sting and is gentle on my highly sensitive allergy eyes!</li>
            <li>even the hardest to get off makeup comes off easily</li>
            <li>and I can easily transfer their product into travel bottles for airplane carry on.</li>
            <li>Gets off water proof eyeliner easily.  </li>
            <li>A lot of eye makeup removers do this even those that are oil free.</li>
            <li>but overall I am happy with my  purchase.</li>
            <li>The consistency is too oily for me even though it&#x27;s supposed to be oil free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Takes makeup off great and the bottles has lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li>If I use makeup it comes off so quickly with it-</li>
            <li>This eye makeup remover is mild yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I really like how&#x27;s it easily removes makeup without being super oily.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural blend of herbals (chamomile etc.) and very light.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye makeup remover, and I have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is by far not as oily as many others I&#x27;ve tried but there is a bit of the residue.  </li>
            <li>The price paid is worth this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of eye makeup removers and this, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>just right for you.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye makeup remover that does NOT sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes that react to a lot of products, and I can use this product comfortably with no reaction.  </li>
            <li>I like using soap and water better than this and following up w/ eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I always remove my eye-makeup first and then wash my face, tone, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for the most difficult to remove mascaras!</li>
            <li>I thought about making my own due to difficulty in finding one that really worked</li>
            <li>It certainly removes all liquid liner and mascara without feeling like I&#x27;m scrubbing my eyelids off.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, the only makeup remover that gets my mascara off without rubbing enough to hurt the skin around my eyelids.</li>
            <li>now(Almay gentle gel remover, Revlon Colorstay make-up</li>
            <li>Extremely gentle when removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I wear a liquid eye liner</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>Gets water proof mascara off soooooo much easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and not too greasy, nor does it hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>it works fast - and no swollen eyes.  </li>
            <li>Removes waterproof mascara fast.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping, boxed and packed very well</li>
            <li>This product does better at removing it all than any other.</li>
            <li>I have used the eye make up remover for almost a year and continue to do so because I like how easily it removes eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin around the eye area as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>If you want a makeup remover that work fabulous for very sensitive eyes &amp; skin, look no further!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective, removes tough makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>you have sensitive eyes and find scrubbing makeup off at the end of the day irritates them, then I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and my sensitive skin has never reacted to it, so</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this because others I have tried that you have to shake to combine were very greasy and left me needing to wash off the residue.</li>
            <li>I guess the negative to this would be using more product than you need, but I have not found this to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find an eye makeup remover that&#x27;s alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Was able to find it locally for cheaper, however, so probably won&#x27;t reorder, but will also NEVER go back to other products (which were more expensive btw.</li>
            <li>peels off most makeup and looses up the rest but does leave behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Eye makeup is easily removed using this product and since only a little is needed, the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>and it takes it right off with very little pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels really oily, it does sting the eyes, and though it looks like it removes makeup, I woke up with black schmutz around my eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gently removes waterproof makeup with little to no effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Gently removes waterproof makeup with little to no effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave a mild oily feel behind that I wash off with a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is not at all greasy, a little goes far so</li>
            <li> Why pay $$$ for Estee Lauder or some other overpriced brand, when Philosophy&#x27;s product does the same job.</li>
            <li> but this product doesn&#x27;t feel any different than other removers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out lashes</li>
            <li> those are the only down falls.</li>
            <li> I mean, who wants the skin around their eyes dried out by alcohol?!  </li>
            <li> and it has never caused milia or any other problems that others do.</li>
            <li> then you are instructed to use another for the other eye.</li>
            <li> I wear only hard core waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> if you are used to using quite a bit, you might try using less until you get the amount</li>
            <li> It does leave a slightly oily feeling on your skin, though.</li>
            <li> The Philosophy just release me is a little oily -</li>
            <li> tried a few others</li>
            <li> This product missed the mark, I don&#x27;t blame them because it is no easy task, but I threw it away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I did it seemed to take care of it without excessive rubbing.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY USE CLINIQUE TAKE THE DAY OFF</li>
            <li> Not refreshing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never experienced irritation or redness when using this product.</li>
            <li> Think about it, it is really hard to create a product that removes crazy makeup and does not sting the eye.</li>
            <li> but it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> But HATE the container because it keeps leaking when you travel with it.  </li>
            <li> I hate fighting to get my mascara off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> My favorite eye makeup remover, and I have sensitive eyes.  I use a great deal of waterproof makeup on a layer of primer.  This product does better at removing it all than any other.</li>
            <li> I like this well enough, but it seems greasy and drying at the same time.  I will have to test it out with a different cotton pad perhaps.  It certainly removes all liquid liner and mascara without feeling like I&#x27;m scrubbing my eyelids off.</li>
            <li> This stuff hurts if it gets in your eye and its oil- those are the only down falls. But it works very very good. If I use makeup it comes off so quickly with it- even the hardest to get off makeup comes off easily</li>
            <li> This is a non-oily eye-make-up remover that gets off most make up.  It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on mascara, though, and I don&#x27;t even wear waterproof. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and my sensitive skin has never reacted to it, so I still like it. Even so, I&#x27;ll probably look for a remover that takes care of my mascara</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a substiute for products no longer being sold for some time now(Almay gentle gel remover, Revlon Colorstay make-up remover - both were absolutely fantastic!). This is the only product I have found that actually works. It is a bit greasy, but it takes waterproof eye makeup off without having to scrub at it.</li>
            <li> BEST eye makeup remover EVER !!!!  Need more than 5 stars for this one.  Was able to find it locally for cheaper, however, so probably won&#x27;t reorder, but will also NEVER go back to other products (which were more expensive btw.</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle when removing eye makeup. Can use during application with out having a left over greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Use it every morning.  Not oily.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I was recently turned onto philosophy at a make-up counter.  I really like how&#x27;s it easily removes makeup without being super oily.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover EVER!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, the only makeup remover that gets my mascara off without rubbing enough to hurt the skin around my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but I always come back to this makeup remover. It just works so well, and the size to price is great too!</li>
            <li> Eye makeup is easily removed using this product and since only a little is needed, the bottle will last a long time.  I have purchased the product twice and would recommend it.  It does leave a mild oily feel behind that I wash off with a cleanser.  A lot of eye makeup removers do this even those that are oil free. This is by far not as oily as many others I&#x27;ve tried but there is a bit of the residue.  There is no scent and I&#x27;ve never experienced irritation or redness when using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye makeup remover that does NOT sting my eyes. Gentle and effective, removes tough makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I wear a liquid eye liner and it takes it right off with very little pressure. It is not greasy at all.. I would recomment this product.</li>
            <li> I have used the eye make up remover for almost a year and continue to do so because I like how easily it removes eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin around the eye area as others I have tried.  The price paid is worth this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but it was a disappointment. Think about it, it is really hard to create a product that removes crazy makeup and does not sting the eye. This product missed the mark, I don&#x27;t blame them because it is no easy task, but I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;It feels really oily, it does sting the eyes, and though it looks like it removes makeup, I woke up with black schmutz around my eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few others and I found Mary Kay&#x27;s oil free makeup remover to be the best.</li>
            <li> Like you, I have tried every type of eye makeup remover from the drugstores. They all seemed to work somewhat but I&#x27;ve never been fully satisfied. I was hesitant to purchase this because others I have tried that you have to shake to combine were very greasy and left me needing to wash off the residue. This is not at all greasy, a little goes far so if you are used to using quite a bit, you might try using less until you get the amount just right for you. I do not wear water proof mascara often but when I did it seemed to take care of it without excessive rubbing. I would give it give stars of they would put a flip cap or squeeze cap on it but overall I am happy with my  purchase.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations! Great for the most difficult to remove mascaras! I won&#x27;t ever use anything else again!  Philosophy products are truly amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find an eye makeup remover that&#x27;s alcohol free.  I mean, who wants the skin around their eyes dried out by alcohol?!  Why pay $$$ for Estee Lauder or some other overpriced brand, when Philosophy&#x27;s product does the same job. So for the price and the quality, this is the best.</li>
            <li> Nice product but it&#x27;s overpriced. For this type product, save the money and go with Rimmel. For the best use Kate Sommerville.</li>
            <li> Love this eye makeup remover.  But HATE the container because it keeps leaking when you travel with it.  Philosophy needs to find a leak proof container.  I recommend buying your own leak proof container from REI or Container Store and putting it in there.  Otherwise, this is a great gentle eye makeup remover.  I have very sensitive skin and it has never caused milia or any other problems that others do.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye makeup remover.  It melts off even the most stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  It is gentle and one of the few eye makeup removers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it&#x27;s the only one I found that isn&#x27;t oil-based and won&#x27;t leave a film on my eyes if I use it when i&#x27;m wearing my contacts. It does leave a slightly oily feeling on your skin, though.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and great at removing eye makeup!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out lashes</li>
            <li> Is the best eye make up remover I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I USUALLY USE CLINIQUE TAKE THE DAY OFF WHICH IS AMAZING THIS PRODUCT IS JUST OIL AND WATER AND ALCOHOL DONT EVEN REMOVE REGUALR MASCARRA</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says this is the best makeup remover she has ever used.  Enough said!</li>
            <li> Actually, BEST eye makeup remover EVER!! Gets water proof mascara off soooooo much easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is too oily for me even though it&#x27;s supposed to be oil free.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye make up remover! Doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes at all and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It cleans off chunky make-up with ease.  I have sensitive eyes that react to a lot of products, and I can use this product comfortably with no reaction.  I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> a wonderful make up remover, doesn&#x27;t sting and is gentle on my highly sensitive allergy eyes! will definitley buy again!</li>
            <li> I know this product advertises that it does not contain oil... but it feels like oil to me.  It might not be oil... but this product doesn&#x27;t feel any different than other removers I have tried.  Yes it removes the mascara... but you need to use alot of product to saturate the cotton ball... then you are instructed to use another for the other eye. I like using soap and water better than this and following up w/ eye cream.  My sight is blurry after using it.  Not refreshing.  Does what is supposed to - remove makeup... So I am giving 3 stars. Would give 5 stars if it stood up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of eye makeup removers and this, by far, is my favorite. Gently removes all make up without stinging or leaving a heavy residue. I was thrilled when I saw I could purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> peels off most makeup and looses up the rest but does leave behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I wear only hard core waterproof mascara. This is the best and most gentle remover I&#x27;ve found yet. Five stars. I thought about making my own due to difficulty in finding one that really worked but this is a five star product. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Philosophy keeps winning me over one product at a time.  Their eye-makeup remover is a great product.  Gently removes waterproof makeup with little to no effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also no regulated dripper on the bottle that most eye-makeup remover bottles have.  The benefits to this are: I can get the amount that I need onto a cotton pad quicker and I can easily transfer their product into travel bottles for airplane carry on. I guess the negative to this would be using more product than you need, but I have not found this to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some oil in this eye-makeup remover.  Anything that removes waterproof make-up effectively has some amount of oil in the product.  I have skin that can be acne prone and I have had no problems with this product.  I always remove my eye-makeup first and then wash my face, tone, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive eyes and find scrubbing makeup off at the end of the day irritates them, then I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Pricy but for mascara it&#x27;s like a dream. I hate fighting to get my mascara off.</li>
            <li> It is the same as the rest. Takes two times to come off.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and not too greasy, nor does it hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gets off water proof eyeliner easily.  Very happy w/ this product!</li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena oil-free eye makeup remover  it left my eyes swollen. The Philosophy just release me is a little oily - it works fast - and no swollen eyes.  Removes waterproof mascara fast.  It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> works good but have to make sure and not apply toooo much it is very oily</li>
            <li> This is a great product, works great, not greasy or oily. Takes makeup off great and the bottles has lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover is mild yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Philosophy Just Release Me Eye Makeup Remover is my &#x27;best new find&#x27; product in YEARS! If you want a makeup remover that work fabulous for very sensitive eyes &amp; skin, look no further! When you shake it (per instructions), it appears to have some oiliness in the bottle, but it&#x27;s NOT oily whatsoever. It&#x27;s been trial and error to find this product, which an Ulta rep/manager referred me to try.&lt;br /&gt;No tugging or rubbing to remove even waterproof mascara. This is an all natural blend of herbals (chamomile etc.) and very light. Leaves NO trace of product on your eyes/skin, no stinging or burning or blurriness with use. Thank you PHILOSOPHY!&lt;br /&gt;As for this seller, THANK YOU!!! Extremely fast shipping, boxed and packed very well (I purchased 5 of them!)</li>
