            <li>Oh and the size was perfect!  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This belt is PERFECT for her needs...would buy again!</li>
            <li>This is a great belt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I had no issues with it riding up (another, pleasant, surprise)</li>
            <li>I ordered the size recommended for her, and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>this belt seems to be made of durable materials and the fit is perfect, with room for my growing stomach.</li>
            <li>It is still very supportive though.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the email communication, and prompt refund.  </li>
            <li>Great product great company to buy tv rom very prompt service</li>
            <li>(and I love it more when my wife loves it!)</li>
            <li>She claims it is comfortable and breathable while offering good support.  </li>
            <li>It stayed up just fine without them!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear for extended amounts of time.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable to walk around in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I felt like it was very light support.</li>
            <li>I got this one because I needed more support.  </li>
            <li>I wear mine over a tank top to help keep it a bit</li>
            <li>Since my wife is absolutely in love with this thing, I give it my 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This belt is so much more supportive.  </li>
            <li>It did do the job for the most part.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get better support that way :)  </li>
            <li>- just I wish they had a better type of padding underneath velcro</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Overall great product though!</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing</li>
            <li>It is way more comfortable than all of the maternity support bands I tried on in the stores.</li>
            <li>It is supportive and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>But other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because being pregnant and having backache and also a hernia in my belly button!</li>
            <li>My belly is huge</li>
            <li>Great support at a low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an XL size and this was really comfortable and does not dig in to skin or create bulging.  </li>
            <li>purchased the XL praying that it would fit my plus sized shape, and thank the heavens...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that comfortable.</li>
            <li>(I work in an office setting, so sitting is primarily what I do.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints and would recommend to any plus sized woman that is looking for a fit, will find it here.</li>
            <li>This belt is great for moderate support.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and I like that it doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin</li>
            <li>Rest easy my full figured friends, there is plenty of room to spare in the XL size.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for wearing while I am working</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon didn&#x27;t have the size I needed, so I ordered directly from the company and was very pleased with how quickly it was shipped.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item when I was 23 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I wish the velcro options were more versatile, meaning it could work for you for a better part of the pregnancy if the velcro ability was bigger.</li>
            <li>I purchased this when I was 5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am a plus sized woman who is 6 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>It was my fav until I got super pregnant (7.5-9 months) when I had to move to the belt that has straps on it to help hold up your ever growing tummy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife who is pregnant with twins.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I agree with the rest, large would have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>and I found this didn&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li>Being a plus-sized girl, I was really debating on maternity belts and hoping to find one that could really fit</li>
            <li>belt surprised me by not only fitting out of the box without adjusting, but I could adjust it TIGHTER for better support and still feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>This belt was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Gives very good support; I only wear when exercising and going to be standing for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for back and belly support, I haven&#x27;t had any back pain since I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It is also very soft and comfortable to wear against your skin under your clothes or over your pants.  </li>
            <li>If I had gotten a smaller size, it might be more beneficial for my c-section post partum support.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too hot in the summer</li>
            <li>even then, it wasn&#x27;t really supportive enough.</li>
            <li>Helped give my belly better shape and support my back.</li>
            <li>im only giving this belt two stars because though it did fit around my belly unlike some of the more expense brands it did not give the actual support that i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I bought the xtra large</li>
            <li>Even though I went by the sizing chart, it was a bit large</li>
            <li>and I feel like I may have ordered a size too large because I didn&#x27;t measure my belly,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s STILL too large.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good belt for that little bit of support that&#x27;s needed during pregnancy but not for separation of the muscles and a very sensitive hernia that now sticks out.</li>
            <li>I have worn this for a whole day and at night</li>
            <li>It really helps with the pain i was having with a pulled musle in my belly.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for it to really make a difference in the way you feel by the end of the day</li>
            <li>I love how wide this belt is!</li>
            <li>I may need something more in my last couple of weeks; but for now, I am so glad I tried this before I invested in the more expensive and bulkier belly harnesses!</li>
            <li>But it still does the trick, and I&#x27;m sure it will get me through the rest of my pregnancy-- especially since I&#x27;ll just get bigger!</li>
            <li>The soft design is comfortable yet it helps with support of my belly and back.</li>
            <li>This has helped her back pain tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I exchanged it twice due to size issues and they always posted a replacement before I sent the original back - good quality and not like other belts hat can dig into your side</li>
            <li>It offers no support and is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I measured around the largest part of my belly at that time and was on the border between large and extra large.</li>
            <li>have only had the product for about 3 days now, and my only concern is the velcro part where you fit the belt and tighten or loosen it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the extra large and when it arrived it was far too large.</li>
            <li>cuz I was a pretty big girl (238 at 9 mo)  </li>
            <li>After wearing this it completely went away!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had ordered the large it would have been enough support but it also seemed to stretch and loosen over the three months I wore it.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a large, they run kinda big.</li>
            <li>only downside is that you can see it through clothes and it wears out fast.</li>
            <li>If you (or your wife/girlfriend) think this might help you, by all means, I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is the elastic part (the wrap around back) is starting to pull in places, and so it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit as snugly anymore.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This is my 4th pregnancy and my first support belt, I wish I had got one of these long ago.</li>
            <li>It could just be that my belly is bigger than normal but for the work i do it does not provide the support needed.</li>
            <li>Purchased belt due to umbilical hernia that showed up 7months pregnant with my last baby.</li>
            <li>It was hard to put on, and once on it really didn&#x27;t provide very much support.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After fighting to get it on a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t seem worth the struggle for such little support.</li>
            <li>In my fourth month of my third pregnancy, I started experiencing back pain and round ligamnet pain while trying to keep up with my exercise routine (although scaled back significantly).  </li>
            <li>i was afraid because I am gifted with hips!  </li>

            <li> /&gt;After fighting to get it on a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t seem worth the struggle for such little support.</li>
            <li> In my fourth month of my third pregnancy, I started experiencing back pain and round ligamnet pain while trying to keep up with my exercise routine (although scaled back significantly).  </li>
            <li> i was afraid because I am gifted with hips!  </li>
            <li> The velcro is super heavy duty and depending on how tight or loose you want it to be, there is enough room for growth.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say about the belt is that it gets fuzzy fast and does not stick as well with the Velcro.</li>
            <li> All of the other bands I have looked at just didn&#x27;t have enough coverage to hold up all my belly and not cut into my back.</li>
            <li> The only other belt I tried was a Be Band (similar to Bella Band).  </li>
            <li> Also there are two hard reinforcements in the sides which can dig into your thighs if you sit too much</li>
            <li> It alleviates my round ligament pain and gives me overall support to help take the load off my back.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the more complicated harnesses that go over the shoulder, but really didn&#x27;t want to wear one of those if I didn&#x27;t have to, as they looked uncomfortable and obtrusive.  </li>
            <li> is it rolls down in the back sometimes.</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t the sizing because I pulled it as tight as it would go.  </li>
            <li> I got an XL but maybe thinking I should have picked up a L, so maybe this runs a little big?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less tired and feel so much</li>
            <li> I wore this belt nearly everyday for the second half of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t stick to other parts of the belt and fray the material,  </li>
            <li> To put that in perspective for other Plus Sized women, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9 and wear a size 20 in jeans.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the other reviews, but immediately returned it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because you have to be very careful with the velcro at all times</li>
            <li> As a curvy girl, we have dips and curves where average women do not..</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t ride up or roll down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 7 months pregnant with my third and was getting terrible round ligament pain from the stretching around my belly button.  </li>
            <li> and it starts to dig in a little bit.</li>
            <li> Dr says my little one is going to be about 9lbs, and I stand all day as a casher at work.</li>
            <li> It made my back hurt much worse.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on that belt.</li>
            <li> It digs into my side after a few minutes of sitting down.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought the xtra large cuz I was a pretty big girl (238 at 9 mo)  I will say that I agree with the rest, large would have worked just fine.  i was afraid because I am gifted with hips!  Doesn&#x27;t crawl up and used from 5 months through end of pregnancy.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this support band to help with the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; belly under my baby bump as well as for support for my back and ever growing belly. All of the other bands I have looked at just didn&#x27;t have enough coverage to hold up all my belly and not cut into my back. I bought the XL, and I do wish I had gotten the L because I think it could be tighter. It is still very supportive though. If I had gotten a smaller size, it might be more beneficial for my c-section post partum support. It may still work though, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item when I was 23 weeks pregnant.  Even though I went by the sizing chart, it was a bit large so I had to wait a few weeks before it really felt like it was giving support.  Now that I am 29 weeks along I can&#x27;t imagine not having it.  I originally purchased it for wearing while I am working (physical job, on my feet, lifting, bending), but now I want to wear it all the time.  It alleviates my round ligament pain and gives me overall support to help take the load off my back.  The only other belt I tried was a Be Band (similar to Bella Band).  I got this one because I needed more support.  I like this one because I can wear it all day and it never feels uncomfortable, I don&#x27;t have to take it off when I go to the bathroom, and I it will grow with me.  I don&#x27;t like it because you have to be very careful with the velcro at all times so it doesn&#x27;t stick to other parts of the belt and fray the material,  and the fact that you have to hand wash it.  I wear mine over a tank top to help keep it a bit cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon didn&#x27;t have the size I needed, so I ordered directly from the company and was very pleased with how quickly it was shipped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because being pregnant and having backache and also a hernia in my belly button! gave me support and is comfy. only downside is that you can see it through clothes and it wears out fast.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  I have an embarrassingly saggy belly from my last pregnancy and myncurrent pregnancy belly was looking and feeling awkward and just fat.  This band helped shape my belly and lift it up as well as help alleviate pain from a growing belly. I started wearing this at 17.5 weeks and I feel like I may have ordered a size too large because I didn&#x27;t measure my belly, but I guess I will have lots of room to grow. It is way more comfortable than all of the maternity support bands I tried on in the stores.</li>
            <li> Since my wife is absolutely in love with this thing, I give it my 5 star rating. She no longer complains about her back pain, and she says it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all. I ordered the size recommended for her, and it was a perfect fit. If you (or your wife/girlfriend) think this might help you, by all means, I recommend it completely. Love it (and I love it more when my wife loves it!)</li>
            <li> I wore this belt nearly everyday for the second half of my pregnancy. I was worried it would be too hot in the summer so I also bought the mini cradle which I never used. This belt is so much more supportive.  I gave 4 stars because the Velcro started to curl which meant it could be seen under my clothes. Also there are two hard reinforcements in the sides which can dig into your thighs if you sit too much but they ended up falling out anyway. It stayed up just fine without them!</li>
            <li> This my 3rd pregnancy. Purchased belt due to umbilical hernia that showed up 7months pregnant with my last baby. I&#x27;m 5 1/2 months now and it does not give me the support I am in need of. Support level is poor. It&#x27;s a good belt for that little bit of support that&#x27;s needed during pregnancy but not for separation of the muscles and a very sensitive hernia that now sticks out.</li>
            <li> I was having some very annoying back pain, which caused me to be unable to sleep, sit in my chair at work, walk around easily, etc. I bought this hoping it would help, and boy did it! Two days later my back pain was gone. I&#x27;m now 33.5 weeks, and haven&#x27;t had back pain since then. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is the elastic part (the wrap around back) is starting to pull in places, and so it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit as snugly anymore. But it still does the trick, and I&#x27;m sure it will get me through the rest of my pregnancy-- especially since I&#x27;ll just get bigger! DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li> Sizing on this belt seems a little bit wonky.  It did do the job for the most part.  I wish the velcro options were more versatile, meaning it could work for you for a better part of the pregnancy if the velcro ability was bigger.</li>
            <li> Great product great company to buy tv rom very prompt service I exchanged it twice due to size issues and they always posted a replacement before I sent the original back - good quality and not like other belts hat can dig into your side</li>
            <li> It made my back hurt much worse. I only had it on for a minute and thought I would die in pain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I was 5 months pregnant. I measured around the largest part of my belly at that time and was on the border between large and extra large. I ordered the extra large and when it arrived it was far too large. I had to wrap it well past where it should have velcroed and even then, it wasn&#x27;t really supportive enough. I&#x27;m now almost 8.5 months and it&#x27;s STILL too large. Perhaps if I had ordered the large it would have been enough support but it also seemed to stretch and loosen over the three months I wore it.</li>
            <li> This is a great belt. Great support at a low price. Just used for my 3rd pregnancy to help hold up an unfortunate sagging belly. Helped give my belly better shape and support my back. I&#x27;m an XL size and this was really comfortable and does not dig in to skin or create bulging.  Going to try and extend usage by using after post opt support.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this band because of the sizes it comes in. I am a plus sized woman who is 6 months pregnant. To put that in perspective for other Plus Sized women, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9 and wear a size 20 in jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the XL praying that it would fit my plus sized shape, and thank the heavens... It does! Rest easy my full figured friends, there is plenty of room to spare in the XL size. The velcro is super heavy duty and depending on how tight or loose you want it to be, there is enough room for growth. I expect to wear the belt through the remainder of my pregnancy. It&#x27;s great for back and belly support, I haven&#x27;t had any back pain since I purchased it. **You should expect a little bit of stretching in the material, nothing too bad to worry about.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the downfall. It&#x27;s not all that comfortable. As a curvy girl, we have dips and curves where average women do not.. It bunches a bit in those areas. Where my &amp;#34;Hourglass&amp;#34; hits, is where it bunches and it starts to dig in a little bit. (I work in an office setting, so sitting is primarily what I do.) I adjust the band every time I get up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints and would recommend to any plus sized woman that is looking for a fit, will find it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a plus size gal and I found this didn&#x27;t fit very well.  The stiffer part dug in to my side.  I only wore it a handful of times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to reduce back strain in my pregnancy.  The item is well made and shipped promptly.  Unfortunately, it was not the style my physician wanted me to use and I had to return it.  I was very pleased with the email communication, and prompt refund.  I will definately consider this companies products for post natal support.</li>
            <li> This is my second pregnancy and this time I am haveing twins. I needed something to support my belly not my back and I have purchased the one from a store and it was just for my back. I wasted my money on that belt. but this belt is a wonder.. Since i have had it I&#x27;m less tired and feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear for extended amounts of time. Have not experienced any rash of rubbing from it.</li>
            <li> This belt is great for moderate support. It was my fav until I got super pregnant (7.5-9 months) when I had to move to the belt that has straps on it to help hold up your ever growing tummy. The only negative I can say about the belt is that it gets fuzzy fast and does not stick as well with the Velcro.</li>
            <li> Returned.  Did not provide any support and felt very uncomfortable on.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  In my fourth month of my third pregnancy, I started experiencing back pain and round ligamnet pain while trying to keep up with my exercise routine (although scaled back significantly).  I tried this based on the other reviews, but immediately returned it.  It offers no support and is very flimsy.  It definitely wasn&#x27;t the sizing because I pulled it as tight as it would go.  Not the product I was looking so I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> im only giving this belt two stars because though it did fit around my belly unlike some of the more expense brands it did not give the actual support that i was looking for.  It could just be that my belly is bigger than normal but for the work i do it does not provide the support needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 7 months pregnant with my third and was getting terrible round ligament pain from the stretching around my belly button.  After wearing this it completely went away!  It is also very soft and comfortable to wear against your skin under your clothes or over your pants.  I do recommend having someone hold up your belly when you put it on or prop your belly on a counter while you&#x27;re tightening it.  You&#x27;ll get better support that way :)  Oh and the size was perfect!  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and currently 200lbs (was 175 pre-pregnancy)and there is plenty of growing room in this belt.</li>
            <li> Being a plus-sized girl, I was really debating on maternity belts and hoping to find one that could really fit me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This belt surprised me by not only fitting out of the box without adjusting, but I could adjust it TIGHTER for better support and still feel comfortable. My hips and waist are between 55 for hips and 46 for waist (yes, big girl!). It was very comfortable to walk around in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the product for about 3 days now, and my only concern is the velcro part where you fit the belt and tighten or loosen it. It digs into my side after a few minutes of sitting down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with it riding up (another, pleasant, surprise) - just I wish they had a better type of padding underneath velcro part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update on how this goes for the last of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is my 4th pregnancy and my first support belt, I wish I had got one of these long ago. this belt seems to be made of durable materials and the fit is perfect, with room for my growing stomach. I have worn this for a whole day and at night and it doesn&#x27;t ride up or roll down. The soft design is comfortable yet it helps with support of my belly and back. No more pulled muscle stain for me!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This belt was worth the money. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gives very good support; I only wear when exercising and going to be standing for long periods of time. I got an XL but maybe thinking I should have picked up a L, so maybe this runs a little big? Overall great product though!</li>
            <li> I love how wide this belt is! Im a bigger woman and I got the xL It really helps with the pain i was having with a pulled musle in my belly. The only problem Im having with the belt is it rolls down in the back sometimes. But other than that its awesome. My belly is huge Dr says my little one is going to be about 9lbs, and I stand all day as a casher at work. This belt does its job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who is pregnant with twins.  This has helped her back pain tremendously.  She claims it is comfortable and breathable while offering good support.  She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It was hard to put on, and once on it really didn&#x27;t provide very much support.&lt;br /&gt;After fighting to get it on a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t seem worth the struggle for such little support.</li>
            <li> Helped a ton with my lower back pain during pregnancy!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed!  It is supportive and comfortable.  You cannot tell I am wearing it in almost every outfit.  There has definately been a big reduction in my back over the last 5 days that I have worn it.  I looked at the more complicated harnesses that go over the shoulder, but really didn&#x27;t want to wear one of those if I didn&#x27;t have to, as they looked uncomfortable and obtrusive.  I may need something more in my last couple of weeks; but for now, I am so glad I tried this before I invested in the more expensive and bulkier belly harnesses!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter, who is an ER nurse working 12 hour shifts.  This pregnancy she is bigger and needs extra support.  This belt is PERFECT for her needs...would buy again!</li>
            <li> Oh my the relief this thing brings is astronomical.  I couldn&#x27;t wear it until almost 27 weeks but now it&#x27;s my back saver, muscle saver, and life saver.  If you need one for the 2nd trimester I recommend getting a large, they run kinda big.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and I like that it doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin but if you&#x27;re looking for it to really make a difference in the way you feel by the end of the day, I don&#x27;t think this is it. It is better than nothing but I felt like it was very light support. I&#x27;m actually wearing my postpartum compression band from my c-section and getting firmer support. I also have a bulging disc and I put on a lot of extra weight during pregnancies.</li>
