            <li>I love this comb, excellent for spacing and waving the hair!!</li>
            <li>She was so happy that I was able find one for her.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
            <li>but its a really nice comb for a beard</li>
            <li>So nice to have a stash of these combs.</li>
            <li>The comb seems fine and arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Love how close it gets to my hair and pulling up off my scalp, and its one of a kind.</li>
            <li>I suddenly need to look my best, and my own hair doesn&#x27;t pass muster.</li>
            <li>Love this thing when I&#x27;m Wolfin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my wigs it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair out :) I am very satisfied, it can tackle (small) tangles!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>We have used these combs for years and was delighted to see we could order several at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love it for helping my connections and not destroying the progress in my waves.</li>
            <li>This come has been hard to find in stores and is a great price when found on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I use the wider part to comb over the heightened parts and it really looks smooth, yet thicker without tearing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Originally, the gal who cut my hair gave me one, and then I looked everywhere to find the same comb.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would really be helpful&lt;</li>
            <li>this comb really just combs out my waves because i have really curly hair</li>
            <li>I came to love it, but after a few years, I really needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 96 year old mother.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much and don&#x27;t know how it will last.</li>
            <li>You will need this comb to help get your connections better if you are looking for 360 waves, you need to use the small side of the comb to help de-tangle your hair even though it is short, this way you can get the moisturizer in and it will go throughout your hair.</li>
            <li>I finally found them on Amazon, so ordered a few right away!  </li>
