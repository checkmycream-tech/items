            <li>I REALLY LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I chose 3 stars because the fragrance was just okay.  </li>
            <li>shipping time was excellent ,the article did not present any harm whereby the product is recommended for purchase so</li>
            <li>I love this perfume have since it came out.</li>
            <li>Not like &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; by Jessica Simpson, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Its very sweet and warm but doesnt smell cheap or teen-ish.</li>
            <li>goes on somewhat strong though.</li>
            <li>Also side comment, I wasnt a great big fan of HEIRESS, and never bought Paris Hilton&#x27;s line again, but I will purchase CAN CAN..</li>
            <li>but it was a great present for her!</li>
            <li>The best I have used since I have used it haven&#x27;t found any other I love as much as this one since it came out.</li>
            <li>Mild and Sweet!</li>
            <li>It has a sweet light smell, a bit nutty/popcorny like.</li>
            <li>Its clean and not to overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really like this, a bit to sweet and powdery for ne to absolutely love it though.</li>
            <li>however this scent is also good for mid 30ies</li>
            <li>The One would be the classier sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This baby will satisfy any sweet tooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet smell, and I do like sweet fragrances, but (to me)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me either.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it looks like many other people love this scent</li>
            <li>My husband and son really like it too!</li>
            <li>But if you are purchasing this without having first tried it I would recommend ordering the smallest container first, like I did.</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;m sure they are perfectly safe, but</li>
            <li>I do not like this fragrance too much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Plus it lasts long for a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>It came brand new sealed.</li>
            <li>if you are trying to be classy, this aint the perfume!</li>
            <li>Another thing that bothered me a little was that the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; were a huge list of chemicals I hadn&#x27;t heard of before.  </li>
            <li>not trying to be young.</li>
            <li>Im really not a fan of  paris hiltons, that being said, this perfume smells amazing and last a very long time, i only have to spray it once</li>
            <li>Will purchase some more for my daughter as long as I get a few sprays for myself here and there.</li>
            <li>but there was no fragrance left on my skin as far as I or my husband could tell.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume just as much as some of my really expensive perfumes!</li>

            <li> It opens with creammy mellow peach then dried down to soft floral candyish scent.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like about ordering fragrance on Amazon is that usually you can choose a small size, so that even though you can&#x27;t return it you are not out that much if you don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> I bought for a friend at work for Christmas due to it being affordable and something i knew she would like.</li>
            <li> The base is warmer with vanilla.</li>

            <li> My daughter received as a Christmas gift.... Yesterday I picked her up from school and she smelled great! So this morning I sprayed some on.... So many compliments! Mild and Sweet! Will purchase some more for my daughter as long as I get a few sprays for myself here and there. :) Also side comment, I wasnt a great big fan of HEIRESS, and never bought Paris Hilton&#x27;s line again, but I will purchase CAN CAN..</li>
            <li> i am 43. not trying to be young. love my age. and i like this smell. it softens to a cotton candy smell. goes on somewhat strong though. its a smell for the weekend. if you are trying to be classy, this aint the perfume! lol! Dolce and Gabanna The One would be the classier sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE CAN CAN  IT SMELL REALLY GOOD .</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Its clean and not to overpowering. My husband and son really like it too!</li>
            <li> excellent product, fit this classification because it seems a good product and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
            <li> I do not like this fragrance too much I will not buy again. Smells too smokey.</li>
            <li> I chose 3 stars because the fragrance was just okay.  A pleasant one when smelled at the sprayer end, but there was no fragrance left on my skin as far as I or my husband could tell.  I will be hesitant to try Paris Hilton Eau De Parfum again.</li>
            <li> I bought for a friend at work for Christmas due to it being affordable and something i knew she would like. I dont personally like the smell but it was a great present for her!</li>
            <li> shipping time was excellent ,the article did not present any harm whereby the product is recommended for purchase so do not hesitate to buy</li>
            <li> Im really not a fan of  paris hiltons, that being said, this perfume smells amazing and last a very long time, i only have to spray it once and im set for the rest of the day! I get so many compliments on this perfume just as much as some of my really expensive perfumes!</li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon ship and sold. It came brand new sealed. This baby will satisfy any sweet tooth. Its very sweet and warm but doesnt smell cheap or teen-ish. It opens with creammy mellow peach then dried down to soft floral candyish scent. The base is warmer with vanilla. This perfume is so delicious and sexy! Plus it lasts long for a sweet scent. I also have Can Burlesque but I prefer this version. Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> this smells wonderful !! &amp; im picky</li>
            <li> I love this perfume have since it came out. The best I have used since I have used it haven&#x27;t found any other I love as much as this one since it came out.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like about ordering fragrance on Amazon is that usually you can choose a small size, so that even though you can&#x27;t return it you are not out that much if you don&#x27;t care for it.  Such is the case with &amp;#34;Can Can&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me either.  It&#x27;s a sweet smell, and I do like sweet fragrances, but (to me) it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34;.  Not like &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; by Jessica Simpson, which I love.  Can Can reminds me of those inexpensive &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; fragrances sold at the drugstore. Another thing that bothered me a little was that the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; were a huge list of chemicals I hadn&#x27;t heard of before.  I mean, I&#x27;m sure they are perfectly safe, but still...  Anyway, it looks like many other people love this scent so I don&#x27;t want to discourage a potential buyer.  But if you are purchasing this without having first tried it I would recommend ordering the smallest container first, like I did.</li>
            <li> is a perfume you can give to any woman for its exquisite fragrance, a light fragrance with a comfortable introduction to the portfolio that is the intension of the size offered</li>
            <li> For all the ladies that work for tips, get this now.</li>
            <li> I really like this, a bit to sweet and powdery for ne to absolutely love it though.</li>
            <li> muy buen perfume  huele divino, el envi&amp;oacute; fue r&amp;aacute;pido gracias</li>
