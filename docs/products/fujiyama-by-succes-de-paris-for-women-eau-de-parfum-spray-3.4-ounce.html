            <li>And I Love It.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, it smells like you just sliced a lemmon.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and have already ordered it twice.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many perfumes on the market and a number morphs into this cat pee odor.  </li>
            <li>It meshes better when I use an unscented soap and lotion</li>
            <li>This fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s cheap!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;s mostly men scent, then women perfume.. smells like o d cologne..</li>
            <li>Who absolutely love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I, usually, love citrusy/flowery scents.</li>
            <li>Mild but nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it, I get so many compliments, the scent is pleasant and last for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s quite feminine.</li>
            <li>Happy to say no disappointment very strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of some trendy men&#x27;s store (I want to say Structure) because it has that certain sharpness that can be headache inducing.  </li>
            <li>but everybody I asked to describe the scent told me it smells like cheap cologne..</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Loves Fresh Lemon in the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>like some cheap soap bar...  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and almost always gets me a complement .</li>
            <li>Have to agree with the customer who said that it smells cheap.</li>
            <li>later it seemed to just have it&#x27;s own nice scent.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with right.  </li>
            <li>Very unique fragrance, I have to be in the right mood for this one.</li>
            <li>It is mild but does well for me who is allergic to strong scents.</li>
            <li>I love it smells exactly how it was supposed to</li>
            <li>I like the clean, floral scent.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it would be ok on the skin once the alcohol evaporated, but the scent that remained was still very strong, hardly fit for a woman (this is definitely not one of those \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; types either)</li>
            <li>It is a light, clean, fresh fragrance with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>Thanks I will return for more.</li>
            <li>This smells like cool water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad though,just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>So many people ask me what im wearing and are so surprised when they find out its such a cheap price but smells so good.</li>
            <li>and  if your lucky to do find it its Over $25.  </li>
            <li>Worth my bucks</li>
            <li>for the price I am very happy, very mild and fresh and it lasts long, not all day but long enough</li>
            <li>I am going to buy this again because I am almost out of the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I can smell it the first hour</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy another one once this one is all gone.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li>It was our first expsure to Fujiyama.</li>
            <li>On me, the smell is not so as much as masculine but very fresh.  </li>
            <li>It is not a sweet fragrance, but it is a fresh type with strong tones at first.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>thank you amazon for the amazing customer service,the ordered was delayed because of mailing error but amazon resend in less than 3 days!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time on me and it is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, fresh, last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a summer fragrance for me and I will gladly use it as such.  </li>
            <li>Will update later after I use it but in the box it smells pretty good like fresh lemons but very subtle.</li>
            <li>only someone who gets very close will smell it.  </li>
            <li>By far, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Its a masculine smell.</li>
            <li>I did some research before buying, but found nothing useful at the Blu website and other sites were somewhat misleading.</li>
            <li>it is not expensive like other perfumes.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a little citrusy..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly suggest that you purchase any fragrance at a brick and mortar that you have not tried out previously</li>
            <li> The scent also last a long time.</li>
            <li> But i suggest to give a try, coz the smell grows subtle with time and lingers for long, giving a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SMELL, BUT THE PUMP DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO WORK PROPERLY, WHEN I PUSH IT, IT STAYS DOWN</li>
            <li> Its pretty difficult to buy perfumes that you haven&#x27;t tried earlier, just by looking at description and reviews.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great, but isn&#x27;t terrible...</li>
            <li> It arrived with one third of the bottle&#x27;s contents missing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and save my expensive perfumes for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to order some of the other scents.</li>
            <li> which I suppose makes the fact that it only lasts for about 10 minutes not seem like a complaint.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this and one of the few fragrances she likes to wear.</li>
            <li> very harsh smell - alcohol being the overpowering component...</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> A must have if you are a perfume fanatic as I am.  </li>
            <li> but, alas, it is not available now.  </li>
            <li> I thought I made some mistake during my order and confused, when I received my Fujiyama.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the 5 random perfumes purchased in amazon for gifting purpose.</li>
            <li> and I was all set to return it because it was a blind buy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed,maybe it&#x27;s because my body chemistry with perfume is quite weird.</li>
            <li> one even said \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot;:( disappointing, and not returnable to amazon...</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, to boot.</li>
            <li> This one is simply awful.</li>

            <li> This is the one of the 5 random perfumes purchased in amazon for gifting purpose. Its pretty difficult to buy perfumes that you haven&#x27;t tried earlier, just by looking at description and reviews. However this bottle impressed me. Love the bottle style, looks good for gifting. At the initial try the smell can be too citrus y and not for everyone&#x27;s liking. But i suggest to give a try, coz the smell grows subtle with time and lingers for long, giving a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> very harsh smell - alcohol being the overpowering component... I thought maybe it would be ok on the skin once the alcohol evaporated, but the scent that remained was still very strong, hardly fit for a woman (this is definitely not one of those \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; types either)... I thought it was just me - but everybody I asked to describe the scent told me it smells like cheap cologne.. one even said \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot;:( disappointing, and not returnable to amazon... this is the proverbial \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;:)</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and attractive shape , size and fragrance.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores and  if your lucky to do find it its Over $25.  Love it! smells clean and light, great summer fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. Once I discovered it, I stuck with it and I&#x27;ve been very pleased. It&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s quite feminine. Above all, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy this again because I am almost out of the first bottle.  I fell in love with Loves Fresh Lemon in the 70&#x27;s but, alas, it is not available now.  I searched the net for a substitute fragrance and the majority of the reviews included Fujiyama, so I got it.  And I Love It.  Several times I have been in a crowd or on the bus, or in line (don&#x27;t ask) and someone has remarked \\&quot;somebody smells good\\&quot;.  Nuff Said.</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant scent. It isn&#x27;t great, but isn&#x27;t terrible...which I suppose makes the fact that it only lasts for about 10 minutes not seem like a complaint.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it smells like you just sliced a lemmon.  Very clean, fresh, last a long time.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;And it is not expensive like other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase! Excellent value!</li>
            <li> So many people ask me what im wearing and are so surprised when they find out its such a cheap price but smells so good. Love this perfume and have already ordered it twice.</li>
            <li> I was  betwixt two opinion while shopping online as to whether or not to get this perfume.  Happy to say no disappointment very strong and lasting. Worth my bucks and it was delivered on time.  I couldn&#x27;t help but return and add, this is one of the most amazing scent I have ever worn and the best of the three I purchased .  A must have if you are a perfume fanatic as I am.  Delivery was on time. Thanks I will return for more.</li>
            <li> I wanted to state that I am no perfume snob and I only buy what works with my body chemistry.  I have tried so many perfumes on the market and a number morphs into this cat pee odor.  Not this one.  I bought this for a song at a local discount store and I was all set to return it because it was a blind buy and I never heard of this brand before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfumes/EDT can go two ways: it blends beautifully with your body chemistry or it morphs into something horrid.  From the bottle it kind of smells like men&#x27;s cologne. I am not kidding.  The scent reminds me of some trendy men&#x27;s store (I want to say Structure) because it has that certain sharpness that can be headache inducing.  But I gave it a shot on two different occasions and it worked with my body.  On me, the smell is not so as much as masculine but very fresh.  This is definitely a summer fragrance for me and I will gladly use it as such.  It meshes better when I use an unscented soap and lotion so there is no clashing of scents.  It lasts a long time on me and it is not as strong.  I highly suggest that you purchase any fragrance at a brick and mortar that you have not tried out previously or else it would be a costly mistake.</li>
            <li> smells like CK. it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
            <li> This fragrance is lovely. It is mild but does well for me who is allergic to strong scents. I would recommend to anyone with allergies like me.</li>
            <li> Bottle design gets a huge thumbs up! Easy to use. Very unique fragrance, I have to be in the right mood for this one. It is not a sweet fragrance, but it is a fresh type with strong tones at first. I can smell it the first hour and then it fades. For the price point, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this and one of the few fragrances she likes to wear. She is not a perfume person, so this is perfect for her. Mild but nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> It arrived with one third of the bottle&#x27;s contents missing. From the smell, I&#x27;d guess it happened during shipping. It was cheap and I got what I paid for. It smells terrible, to boot. I would recommend that you take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I did not like this, it smelled like mens cologne.  It did not have the citris scent that was discribed.</li>
            <li> I like it because it stays on all day and the smell is not overpowering. I will most likely buy another one once this one is all gone.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap (price wise )cologne, but smells real nice. Every time I wear it, I get a compliment. It has a citrusy fruity smell to it. I use it everyday and save my expensive perfumes for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I love it, I get so many compliments, the scent is pleasant and last for hours. I think I am going to order some of the other scents.</li>
            <li> I like the clean, floral scent.  I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, now.  It&#x27;s light.  It fades throughout the day then only someone who gets very close will smell it.  I&#x27;m not a fan of packing a punch with scents so it&#x27;s always been perfect for me.  AND it&#x27;s cheap!  Have never had a shipping problem with it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> By far, one of my favorites. It&#x27;s inexpensive, but I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the fragrance, from men and women.</li>
            <li> I thought I made some mistake during my order and confused, when I received my Fujiyama. I&#x27;s mostly men scent, then women perfume.. smells like o d cologne.. like some cheap soap bar...  unfortunately, I deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I bought.  I fell in love with right.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of complements on this.  It has a light fragrance and almost always gets me a complement .</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SMELL, BUT THE PUMP DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO WORK PROPERLY, WHEN I PUSH IT, IT STAYS DOWN AND I NEED TO PULL IT UP.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the price. I did some research before buying, but found nothing useful at the Blu website and other sites were somewhat misleading.</li>
            <li> Who absolutely love the fragrance.  She bugged me until I bought it for her.  It was our first expsure to Fujiyama.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and get lots of compliments on it. It is a light, clean, fresh fragrance with a hint of citrus. Never overpowering, I wear it....it doesn&#x27;t wear me!</li>
            <li> Have to agree with the customer who said that it smells cheap. I, usually, love citrusy/flowery scents. This one is simply awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife. And she loved the bottle and the smell. She put some on and went to work and her co-workers kept telling her that she smelled good. The scent also last a long time.</li>
            <li> for the price I am very happy, very mild and fresh and it lasts long, not all day but long enough</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed,maybe it&#x27;s because my body chemistry with perfume is quite weird. smell too lemony for my taste.gave me a headache.It&#x27;s not bad though,just don&#x27;t work for me.If you&#x27;re into fresh,citrus smell then look no further.</li>
            <li> This smells like cool water. Its a masculine smell.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a little citrusy..later it seemed to just have it&#x27;s own nice scent. It doesn&#x27;t get stinky later on..like alot of others.</li>
            <li> Almost the same smell of CK One.</li>
            <li> I love it smells exactly how it was supposed to</li>
            <li> received it today! thank you amazon for the amazing customer service,the ordered was delayed because of mailing error but amazon resend in less than 3 days! this perfume is for a gift for my daughter she&#x27;s been searching for it for years, and i stumbled upon it here! shes gonna be so happy! thanks</li>
            <li> Just arrived&lt;br /&gt; Haven&#x27;t uses it yet to verify if it works with my chemistry. Will update later after I use it but in the box it smells pretty good like fresh lemons but very subtle.</li>
