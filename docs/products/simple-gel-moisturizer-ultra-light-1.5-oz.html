            <li>The packaging is nice-</li>
            <li>and it feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>But I kind of feel like it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>, it soaks in nicely, and my skin feels soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels cooling when you put it on the skin, but then it dries to a kind of tightness.</li>
            <li>It is a gel like consistency, which is nice.</li>

            <li>in all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this moisturizer and recommend it to others with oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin while also making it feel very smooth and product-free.</li>
            <li>I used this day and night and it helps to have it on before I put on my makeup because it is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Excellent light moisturizer perfect for summer when you want something cool and refreshing without being too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Like most people with oily skin, I struggled to find a moisturizer that would not amplify that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it makes my skin feel hydrated, and at 56, I have no wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Like I said between the 3, my skin looks so much better and healthier.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer beyond words.</li>
            <li>I will keep it and continue to use it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>I still tend to need an oil blotting sheet by the afternoon, but that&#x27;s way better than before</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I lOVE</li>
            <li>I was expecting more dryness relief.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product again, for sure.</li>
            <li>I cannot even tell you how many lotions, creams, and gels</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love that it has both vitamin c and vitamin b in it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this when mixed 50-50 with my foundation to create the perfect tinted moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>But I feel like it just sits on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly lightweight and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>This gel started out pretty good.</li>
            <li>Other gel moisturizers don&#x27;t compare--this is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pump action, the gel is simply wonderful, and I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s opaque, which is important for any product containing Vitamin C, and it has a pump which is sanitary and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this product, with it&#x27;s claims of being &#x27;ultra light&#x27; and &#x27;fast drying - and it is both of those things!</li>
            <li>This gel moisturizer just goes on so smooth and hydrates so well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light and almost sticky.</li>
            <li>I like this because it is oil free.</li>
            <li>Have not used in winter yet, so I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s moisturizing enough then, but for spring/summer it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that goes on smooth and dries fairly matte.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never needed a moisturizer before, but now I am older and after trying many, many products, I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>It is also too light for adequate winter protection.</li>
            <li>I really like the light feeling of the gel!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad pimples</li>
            <li>and it absorbs into my skin quickly</li>
            <li>i have been using this for over A year, my skin has never been so healthy smooth and clear of breakout.</li>
            <li>Ok so apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who experienced the burning sensation.</li>
            <li>This is great, my daughter has sensitive acne prone skin and is on a topical acne medication.  </li>
            <li>I love the light weight feel of this and the fact that it works well with the simple line of products.</li>
            <li>Never had a moisturizer that absorbed so well.</li>
            <li>and so far i love it.</li>
            <li>I have always liked facial gels, and this one does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>it does a decent job of making me feel moisture (though the feeling seemed to wear off faster than some other products), but it isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, though, because Vitamin C (aka Ascorbic Acid) is fantastic for your skin (it&#x27;s an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and it also suppresses melanin production which helps you get rid of those pesky dark spots left from old pimples), while Vitamin E (aka tocopherol) is comedogenic for many people.</li>
            <li>It has an exceedingly strange scent, kind of like tequila (no joke).</li>
            <li>and it works great with the simple moisturizing face wash by simple.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of use I can definitely say this product has stood the test of time and is absolutely FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>It was odorless at first</li>
            <li>I saw a difference immediately after the first wash.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first for me.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I want to mention that as of this writing the product description on Amazon is incorrect (the ingredients listed are correct, it&#x27;s just the description of them</li>
            <li>product is pretty moisturizing, considering it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li>Also, I think my physical sunscreen does not sink in as well when put on top of this moisturizer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>During the day I hot flash a lot</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love it especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li>If you are having problems with peeling or extreme dryness in certain areas, you will need a more heavy duty moisturizer, but as a daily one this is perfect.</li>
            <li>My beauty routine is pretty much just soap and water.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations because it is an attractively priced moisturizer without Ceteryl Alcohol (which I have negative reactions to).</li>
            <li>I LOVE this gel and would highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from the same skin woes as me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, I&#x27;ve  had no reactions.</li>
            <li>It also tends to get oily during certain times of the year.</li>
            <li>It is very light, but not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s completely clear and has a funny smell to it, and it&#x27;s sort of sticky when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very picky</li>
            <li>It sits on top of your skin leaving it looking wet and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to put any product on my face.</li>
            <li>Note that it&#x27;s much cheaper in stores</li>
            <li>I will not be buying this product again, and you might not have the same effects as me, so feel free to try it out.</li>
            <li>With all the money I have spent on all of these lotions that irritated my skin, I can honestly say I have found success in this Simple gel product.  </li>
            <li>and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Okay let me just say I&#x27;ve done 2 other reviews from this skin care line.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dry, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have dry, but hyper sensitive skin that reacts quite poorly to so many products that are hypoallergenic and/or noncomedogenic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for an affordable fatty-alcohol free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this irritated some patches of skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>But also keep in mind, everyone is different so not everyone can expect the same results. :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Slight burning sensation on the apples of my cheeks at initial application, however, it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, I felt it dried me out more than moisturized, as my skin was much oilier throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and this was way too much for me.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than expected and does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>Maybe in the summer it would be enough, but for now it&#x27;s just not cutting it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fatty alcohols (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol), which are found in most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>My skin  is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li>Does leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized, and keeps the oil down to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot humid climate and this helps to prevent that heavy feeling one gets with certain types of moisturizers.</li>
            <li>After years of spending a lot money for expensive branded face lotions, finally I found a great product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how well it was working until about 2 weeks into using it when my skin started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I came across this at wal mart and saw that it was specifically for sensitive skin and basically contained nothing</li>
            <li>have combination oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I give only 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>It is a gel moisturizer and leaves my face soft........</li>
            <li>This is light enough to not make me oily and simple enough to not make me breakout.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up so much in the last 2 weeks just from using the moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky at all and wore well under make up, but it didn&#x27;t really give me that instant relief I&#x27;m used to feeling with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My sensitive, oily, acne prone skin LOVES this product.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers are way too thick, and end up leaving my skin oily and causes break outs.</li>
            <li>My only complain about the packaging is that the tube is made of hard plastic, so when I get down to the last dregs I won&#x27;t be able to cut the top off and scoop out the remainder.</li>
            <li>A little tacky, but dries down nicely.  </li>
            <li>I tried several lotions and moisturizers but they all felt heavy, some caused break-outs and most left a shine on my face that lasted throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have friends with dry skin who first moisturize with a normal moisturizer and then later apply this as an actual primer.</li>
            <li>It is clear and seems very similar to aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 and have always had combination, red, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You should give it a try too, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using a prescription retinoid and I already have sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>I have oily combination skin and needed a facial moisturizer to complete my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m combination sensitive dry and oily, and this made a burning sensation upon application.</li>
            <li>This will be a heaven sent for anyone that has sensitive, combination (dry, &amp; oily), and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily/combination, sensitive skin, and very few moisturizers sit well with me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I broke out from using very light applications before bed.</li>
            <li>Irritated my face - made it bright red, tight, and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> it does a decent job of making me feel moisture (though the feeling seemed to wear off faster than some other products), but it isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great, though, because Vitamin C (aka Ascorbic Acid) is fantastic for your skin (it&#x27;s an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and it also suppresses melanin production which helps you get rid of those pesky dark spots left from old pimples), while Vitamin E (aka tocopherol) is comedogenic for many people.</li>
            <li> It has an exceedingly strange scent, kind of like tequila (no joke).</li>
            <li> and it works great with the simple moisturizing face wash by simple.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of use I can definitely say this product has stood the test of time and is absolutely FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> It was odorless at first</li>
            <li> I saw a difference immediately after the first wash.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first for me.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that as of this writing the product description on Amazon is incorrect (the ingredients listed are correct, it&#x27;s just the description of them</li>
            <li> product is pretty moisturizing, considering it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li> Also, I think my physical sunscreen does not sink in as well when put on top of this moisturizer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> During the day I hot flash a lot</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with peeling or extreme dryness in certain areas, you will need a more heavy duty moisturizer, but as a daily one this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My beauty routine is pretty much just soap and water.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations because it is an attractively priced moisturizer without Ceteryl Alcohol (which I have negative reactions to).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel and would highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from the same skin woes as me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive, I&#x27;ve  had no reactions.</li>
            <li> It also tends to get oily during certain times of the year.</li>
            <li> It is very light, but not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s completely clear and has a funny smell to it, and it&#x27;s sort of sticky when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very picky</li>
            <li> It sits on top of your skin leaving it looking wet and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to put any product on my face.</li>
            <li> Note that it&#x27;s much cheaper in stores</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this product again, and you might not have the same effects as me, so feel free to try it out.</li>
            <li> With all the money I have spent on all of these lotions that irritated my skin, I can honestly say I have found success in this Simple gel product.  </li>
            <li> and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Okay let me just say I&#x27;ve done 2 other reviews from this skin care line.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dry, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have dry, but hyper sensitive skin that reacts quite poorly to so many products that are hypoallergenic and/or noncomedogenic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for an affordable fatty-alcohol free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this irritated some patches of skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> But also keep in mind, everyone is different so not everyone can expect the same results. :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Slight burning sensation on the apples of my cheeks at initial application, however, it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, I felt it dried me out more than moisturized, as my skin was much oilier throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and this was way too much for me.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than expected and does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li> Maybe in the summer it would be enough, but for now it&#x27;s just not cutting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fatty alcohols (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol), which are found in most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> My skin  is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> Does leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized, and keeps the oil down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot humid climate and this helps to prevent that heavy feeling one gets with certain types of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> After years of spending a lot money for expensive branded face lotions, finally I found a great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how well it was working until about 2 weeks into using it when my skin started to clear up.</li>
            <li> I came across this at wal mart and saw that it was specifically for sensitive skin and basically contained nothing</li>
            <li> have combination oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I give only 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It is a gel moisturizer and leaves my face soft........</li>
            <li> This is light enough to not make me oily and simple enough to not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up so much in the last 2 weeks just from using the moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky at all and wore well under make up, but it didn&#x27;t really give me that instant relief I&#x27;m used to feeling with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My sensitive, oily, acne prone skin LOVES this product.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers are way too thick, and end up leaving my skin oily and causes break outs.</li>
            <li> My only complain about the packaging is that the tube is made of hard plastic, so when I get down to the last dregs I won&#x27;t be able to cut the top off and scoop out the remainder.</li>
            <li> A little tacky, but dries down nicely.  </li>
            <li> I tried several lotions and moisturizers but they all felt heavy, some caused break-outs and most left a shine on my face that lasted throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have friends with dry skin who first moisturize with a normal moisturizer and then later apply this as an actual primer.</li>
            <li> It is clear and seems very similar to aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and have always had combination, red, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You should give it a try too, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using a prescription retinoid and I already have sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and needed a facial moisturizer to complete my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m combination sensitive dry and oily, and this made a burning sensation upon application.</li>
            <li> This will be a heaven sent for anyone that has sensitive, combination (dry, &amp; oily), and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily/combination, sensitive skin, and very few moisturizers sit well with me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I broke out from using very light applications before bed.</li>
            <li> Irritated my face - made it bright red, tight, and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as an eye cream and for very dry smile lines for the past year.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about it making me break out or not because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.</li>
            <li> It felt a little sticky, too, which made it hard to smooth over my skin.</li>
            <li> My face actually felt a little tight immediately after applying it, and I had to reapply a lot just within the first hour since my skin kept drying out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love w/ this product and recommend it to anyone who suffers from the same skin types that I have.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned that it stung when they put it on, and I noticed that too, but only for a split second on my driest areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep compared to other facial moisturizers, but not bad compared to other fatty alcohol-free moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth, and doesn&#x27;t make it oily (or at least no more oily than it already</li>
            <li> However, after a few weeks of using, my skin seems to have developed an allergy to this product.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak for long term results.</li>
            <li> I apply a pea-sized amount in the morning after my shower and it hydrates my skin (without any excess oils or irritation) ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> I am a life long customer!</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not want to give this 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it is as moisturizing as other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have used other Simple skin products, this one made my face feel as though it were on fire.  </li>
            <li> My skin still feels dry and unmoisturized.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> even though I don&#x27;t have dry or flaky skin, it feels like it&#x27;s lacking moisture.</li>
            <li> Everything else was so harsh on my skin and left it irritated, dry or oily, and still red</li>
            <li> well it has limited ingredients</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but it&#x27;s helping keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Weird but true.</li>
            <li> I ship it to Singapore because it&#x27;s not available in the range of Simple products here.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a thick, clear gel.</li>
            <li> Dried up my skin and made it red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Because the description said it was hydrating, I expected it to feel moist on my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels fluffy when dispensed and is absorbed into the skin almost immediately without leaving behind an unwanted glare on the face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t break out my extremely acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been difficult for me to find one that isn&#x27;t also very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you only need a very small amount to cover the face.</li>
            <li> And this stuff seems to make my skin clearer, maybe because it&#x27;s less irritated than before.</li>
            <li> reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it produces a slight burning sensation when I put it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Also, it had an odd smell, almost like bacon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from the typical line-up of drugstore lotions to the higher-end Sephora &amp; Macy&#x27;s lotions.  </li>
            <li> This winter, when I started getting angry red chapped spots on my face, I knew I needed to find something that I would actually use.</li>
            <li> and this seems to help a little to keep down the oily look I get.</li>
            <li> i have horrible oily skin and this keeps it down for a few hours which is amazing because I&#x27;ve tried everything to the point where i have to use phillips as a primer to keep the oil down when i use makeup.</li>
            <li> but I do have little breakouts often.</li>
            <li> My face usually gets greasy with all other moisturizers that I use</li>
            <li> I wish it also had a little e</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Made me break out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> After a few times, this no longer bothers me.</li>
            <li> It made  my skin feel tight but at least it didn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> This gel also seems to provide very little moisture.</li>
            <li> My skin is crazy sensitive</li>
            <li> The bottle is small</li>
            <li> But sadly, I didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry</li>
            <li> (I prefer dry skin to oily and broken out) but alas I have found my heavenly product.</li>
            <li> In fact, it has no ingredients that are common comedogens, except for dimethicone.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I hated it.</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of anything even remotely greasy  on my face, so I&#x27;m pretty bad about putting moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really good at keeping up on skincare routines</li>
            <li> Its consistency is awful and it does not absorb into the skin very well at all.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s wrong).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not have any sunscreen protection so I can&#x27;t use it during the summer.</li>
            <li> After applying it, I&#x27;d still get random flakes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going through a bad breakout, this product may be somewhere to start.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also hated the slimy texture I felt when applying it.</li>
            <li> low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed by this purchase.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like most people with oily skin, I struggled to find a moisturizer that would not amplify that greasy feeling. After 6 months of use I can definitely say this product has stood the test of time and is absolutely FABULOUS! I am a life long customer!</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my face! I ship it to Singapore because it&#x27;s not available in the range of Simple products here.</li>
            <li> Ok so apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who experienced the burning sensation. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and this was way too much for me. I would look elsewhere for a light-weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is very picky but my face likes this product. I&#x27;ve never needed a moisturizer before, but now I am older and after trying many, many products, I&#x27;m sticking with this one. It&#x27;s light, it makes my skin feel hydrated, and at 56, I have no wrinkles! I will continue to buy this product, I&#x27;m very happy with it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feeling. Would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this product smells.  It was odorless at first but after a couple of months on the shelf it started to smell like dirt after it rained.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like this moisturizer. It has an exceedingly strange scent, kind of like tequila (no joke). Its consistency is awful and it does not absorb into the skin very well at all. It sits on top of your skin leaving it looking wet and shiny. Its moisturizing potential is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed by this purchase. I had high expectations because it is an attractively priced moisturizer without Ceteryl Alcohol (which I have negative reactions to).</li>
            <li> Okay let me just say I&#x27;ve done 2 other reviews from this skin care line. I purchased this gel moisturizer, the foaming face wash and the soothing facial toner. All together they are PERFECT for my skin!! I&#x27;m 21 and have always had combination, red, sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not bad pimples but I do have little breakouts often. Especially now that I&#x27;m on a hormonal birth control. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and nothing worked. Everything else was so harsh on my skin and left it irritated, dry or oily, and still red so it was a waste of money and time. I came across this at wal mart and saw that it was specifically for sensitive skin and basically contained nothing so I decided to give it a try. Like I said between the 3, my skin looks so much better and healthier. I saw a difference immediately after the first wash. Even my mom made the comment that my face didn&#x27;t look as red like it always does. This gel moisturizer just goes on so smooth and hydrates so well. A little goes a long way. I just apply it last after I&#x27;ve used the foaming cleanser and then the hydrating toner twice a day. I am a hooked Simple customer! You should give it a try too, especially if you have sensitive skin like me. You&#x27;ll love it like I do! But also keep in mind, everyone is different so not everyone can expect the same results. :)</li>
            <li> Every time I use this product my skin broke out.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I hated it. It&#x27;s extremely light and almost sticky. I find that you have to use quite a bit to cover your face. It is clear and seems very similar to aloe vera gel. After two uses I immediately ordered the moisturizer I had been using. I&#x27;m going to keep using this til it&#x27;s gone but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> well it has limited ingredients but whatever is in there makes my allergy&#x27;s flare and hives all over my face.  be cautious if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> Made me break out after a few uses. Didn&#x27;t mosturize just sat on my face</li>
            <li> It is thicker than expected and does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is great, my daughter has sensitive acne prone skin and is on a topical acne medication.  We purchased this for a night moisturizer to wear while using her medication.  It has been great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. My face usually gets greasy with all other moisturizers that I use but this seems to keep the geysers in check.  The pH balance is ALMOST perfect for MY skin and that&#x27;s good enough for me seeing as everything else dries my skin out or makes it greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really like the light feeling of the gel!  The only reason I did not want to give this 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it is as moisturizing as other lotions.  It&#x27;s great for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve used it as an eye cream and for very dry smile lines for the past year. Could not be happier. My skin is super sensitive, I&#x27;ve  had no reactions. The lines around my eyes have been smoothing out nicely as well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Effective moisturizer, very effective, and does not lead to any increase in breakouts or skin irritation--none at all.  That&#x27;s a first for me.  And this stuff seems to make my skin clearer, maybe because it&#x27;s less irritated than before.</li>
            <li> Irritated my face - made it bright red, tight, and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This gel started out pretty good. Does not make skin shiny at greasy. However, after a few weeks of using, my skin seems to have developed an allergy to this product. My skin is crazy sensitive so I know this won&#x27;t happen to everyone. This gel also seems to provide very little moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer beyond words. I have very oily/combination, sensitive skin, and very few moisturizers sit well with me. Other gel moisturizers don&#x27;t compare--this is the best. It hydrates my skin while also making it feel very smooth and product-free. It is incredibly lightweight and dries super fast. If you are having problems with peeling or extreme dryness in certain areas, you will need a more heavy duty moisturizer, but as a daily one this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to put any product on my face. My beauty routine is pretty much just soap and water. Using this gel is almost like putting aloe vera gel on your face. It is very light, but not very moisturizing. I will keep it and continue to use it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> I love the light weight feel of this and the fact that it works well with the simple line of products. I used this day and night and it helps to have it on before I put on my makeup because it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is oil free.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that as of this writing the product description on Amazon is incorrect (the ingredients listed are correct, it&#x27;s just the description of them that&#x27;s wrong). This product does not contain vitamin E. It has vitamin C. That&#x27;s great, though, because Vitamin C (aka Ascorbic Acid) is fantastic for your skin (it&#x27;s an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and it also suppresses melanin production which helps you get rid of those pesky dark spots left from old pimples), while Vitamin E (aka tocopherol) is comedogenic for many people. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the Simple brand official website has a different ingredient list. The one on this amazon page matches the one I received from Amazon, and also matches one that someone I know bought from a CVS. No idea why there would be a discrepancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and so far so good. The packaging is nice- it&#x27;s opaque, which is important for any product containing Vitamin C, and it has a pump which is sanitary and easy to use. My only complain about the packaging is that the tube is made of hard plastic, so when I get down to the last dregs I won&#x27;t be able to cut the top off and scoop out the remainder. The product itself is a thick, clear gel. I&#x27;ve actually never seen a &amp;#34;gel moisturizer&amp;#34; before that actually looked like a gel. It has no smell that I can detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m very sensitive to fatty alcohols (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol), which are found in most moisturizers.  This product has none of those. In fact, it has no ingredients that are common comedogens, except for dimethicone. I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for an affordable fatty-alcohol free moisturizer. It&#x27;s been difficult for me to find one that isn&#x27;t also very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty moisturizing, considering it&#x27;s a gel. Other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried have either made me break out (Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizing gel) or were not moisturizing at all (Garnier Moisture Rescue Refresh Gel Cream). It has lots of humectant moisturizers, including glycerin. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, and doesn&#x27;t make it oily (or at least no more oily than it already is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it produces a slight burning sensation when I put it on my cheeks. I&#x27;m currently using a prescription retinoid and I already have sensitive skin, so this reaction might just be my problem. Also, I think my physical sunscreen does not sink in as well when put on top of this moisturizer than others I&#x27;ve used. The price is a little steep compared to other facial moisturizers, but not bad compared to other fatty alcohol-free moisturizers. Note that it&#x27;s much cheaper in stores (I think it&#x27;s $8.99 at Target) than on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this moisturizer and recommend it to others with oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Dried up my skin and made it red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I give only 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t like the smell. It does fade but the initial smell is gross. It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a gel and it feels nice going on. I&#x27;m not really good at keeping up on skincare routines so I can&#x27;t speak for long term results. But I kind of feel like it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Once it&#x27;s soaked in (or evaporated) I don&#x27;t feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is a gel moisturizer and leaves my face soft........</li>
            <li> My skin  is very sensitive. It also tends to get oily during certain times of the year. This is light enough to not make me oily and simple enough to not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...&lt;br /&gt;Slight burning sensation on the apples of my cheeks at initial application, however, it goes away quickly. Does leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized, and keeps the oil down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> My face actually felt a little tight immediately after applying it, and I had to reapply a lot just within the first hour since my skin kept drying out. It felt a little sticky, too, which made it hard to smooth over my skin. Also, it had an odd smell, almost like bacon. I like the smell of bacon, but not when it&#x27;s on my face. I can&#x27;t say anything about it making me break out or not because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer for oily skin! I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep my greasy face under control, from mattifying moisturizers to oils. It&#x27;s a clear gel that goes on smooth and dries fairly matte. I still tend to need an oil blotting sheet by the afternoon, but that&#x27;s way better than before, where I&#x27;d need it the second I got to work, and would need to use 2 of them. Have not used in winter yet, so I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s moisturizing enough then, but for spring/summer it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Two things: 1) this product is not for everyone. I have sensitive skin, but this irritated some patches of skin the first time I used it. After a few times, this no longer bothers me. 2) you only need a very small amount to cover the face. Because the description said it was hydrating, I expected it to feel moist on my skin. It does feel like a gel. During the day I hot flash a lot and this seems to help a little to keep down the oily look I get. It also seems to help keep my makeup on. I live in a hot humid climate and this helps to prevent that heavy feeling one gets with certain types of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for folks with incredibly oily skin. Ladies, it works as a wonderful primer for me as well. I have friends with dry skin who first moisturize with a normal moisturizer and then later apply this as an actual primer. I love it especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s so light and it absorbs into my skin quickly so I don&#x27;t have to rub it in to my face for ten minutes every morning.</li>
            <li> Never had a moisturizer that absorbed so well.</li>
            <li> i was looking for burts bees daily moisturizer at a CVS but couldn&#x27;t find it and i stumbled upon this and so far i love it. Its been 3 days. i have horrible oily skin and this keeps it down for a few hours which is amazing because I&#x27;ve tried everything to the point where i have to use phillips as a primer to keep the oil down when i use makeup. I lOVE IT and it works great with the simple moisturizing face wash by simple. I want to get the toner. My skin has cleared up so much in the last 2 weeks just from using the moisturizing face wash. IM HOOKED!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more dryness relief.</li>
            <li> Not greasy... But it&#x27;s completely clear and has a funny smell to it, and it&#x27;s sort of sticky when you first apply it. I prefer Simple&#x27;s richer moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This was not the moisturizer for me.  Even though I have used other Simple skin products, this one made my face feel as though it were on fire.  (I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> This product feels pleasant and cool while applying. Unfortunately, I broke out from using very light applications before bed. I was hoping for a moisturizer light/gentle enough for night use (which I still have yet to find). I have dry, but hyper sensitive skin that reacts quite poorly to so many products that are hypoallergenic and/or noncomedogenic. (My daytime go-to is Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizer GEL.) If your skin is similar to mine, you may find night time use out of the question.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for those with super-sensitive skin types. I&#x27;m combination sensitive dry and oily, and this made a burning sensation upon application. Also, I felt it dried me out more than moisturized, as my skin was much oilier throughout the day. I will not be buying this product again, and you might not have the same effects as me, so feel free to try it out. I feel it&#x27;s a hit-or-miss type of product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from a gel in what appeared to be a can (a spray can?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pump action, the gel is simply wonderful, and I am really liking this product. I have always liked facial gels, and this one does not disappoint. It feels good as I apply it, it soaks in nicely, and my skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product again, for sure.</li>
            <li> I cannot even tell you how many lotions, creams, and gels I have gone through in just one year to hydrate my skin in the morning.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from the typical line-up of drugstore lotions to the higher-end Sephora &amp; Macy&#x27;s lotions.  I even tried Proactiv from all of the rave reviews it got.  With all the money I have spent on all of these lotions that irritated my skin, I can honestly say I have found success in this Simple gel product.  I apply a pea-sized amount in the morning after my shower and it hydrates my skin (without any excess oils or irritation) ALL DAY LONG.  I do wear makeup and it keeps it looking fresh and flawless.  I LOVE this gel and would highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from the same skin woes as me.  You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for about 1.5 - 2 weeks since i got it, and i like it okay. it does a decent job of making me feel moisture (though the feeling seemed to wear off faster than some other products), but it isn&#x27;t so great i will go out of my way to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent light moisturizer perfect for summer when you want something cool and refreshing without being too heavy or greasy. I love that it has both vitamin c and vitamin b in it. I wish it also had a little e but this is great. There is no scent/smell which is great because I can&#x27;t stand smells or perfume on my FACE and it absorbs fast. I&#x27;m adding this product to my daily regime. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of anything even remotely greasy  on my face, so I&#x27;m pretty bad about putting moisturizer on. This winter, when I started getting angry red chapped spots on my face, I knew I needed to find something that I would actually use. I was thrilled to find this product, with it&#x27;s claims of being &#x27;ultra light&#x27; and &#x27;fast drying - and it is both of those things! But sadly, I didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the feeling of this gel as something like aloe. It feels cooling when you put it on the skin, but then it dries to a kind of tightness. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and wore well under make up, but it didn&#x27;t really give me that instant relief I&#x27;m used to feeling with a moisturizer. Other reviewers mentioned that it stung when they put it on, and I noticed that too, but only for a split second on my driest areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually could have lived with all of those things above, accept that it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my face. I used it for almost a week and I didn&#x27;t see or feel any improvement in my skin. Maybe in the summer it would be enough, but for now it&#x27;s just not cutting it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dry, and is not greasy. Unfortunately it does not have any sunscreen protection so I can&#x27;t use it during the summer. It is also too light for adequate winter protection.</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my skin. After applying it, I&#x27;d still get random flakes. I also hated the slimy texture I felt when applying it. However, it didn&#x27;t break out my extremely acne prone skin. If you&#x27;re going through a bad breakout, this product may be somewhere to start.</li>
            <li> I love this when mixed 50-50 with my foundation to create the perfect tinted moisturizer!  A little tacky, but dries down nicely.  A great summer moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this moisturizer. It is a gel like consistency, which is nice. But I feel like it just sits on top of my skin. My skin still feels dry and unmoisturized. I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gone. Thankfully</li>
            <li> best hydrating gel. non sticky, great feeling. love it. i have been using this for over A year, my skin has never been so healthy smooth and clear of breakout. After years of spending a lot money for expensive branded face lotions, finally I found a great product. Best for oil or combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Wal-Mart. I have dry skin and it didn&#x27;t  keep my skin hydrated at all. It made  my skin feel tight but at least it didn&#x27;t irritate it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My sensitive, oily, acne prone skin LOVES this product. Not sure why, but it&#x27;s helping keep my skin clear. Weird but true.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so this moisturizer is great! It&#x27;s not greasy which is a big plus for me. It moisturizes and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This will be a heaven sent for anyone that has sensitive, combination (dry, &amp; oily), and acne-prone skin. Most moisturizers are way too thick, and end up leaving my skin oily and causes break outs. (I prefer dry skin to oily and broken out) but alas I have found my heavenly product. I absolutely am in love w/ this product and recommend it to anyone who suffers from the same skin types that I have.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and needed a facial moisturizer to complete my skincare routine. I tried several lotions and moisturizers but they all felt heavy, some caused break-outs and most left a shine on my face that lasted throughout the day. This gel has put an end to my search. It feels fluffy when dispensed and is absorbed into the skin almost immediately without leaving behind an unwanted glare on the face. I didn&#x27;t realize how well it was working until about 2 weeks into using it when my skin started to clear up. Now, when I forget or don&#x27;t have time to apply it then I notice and even though I don&#x27;t have dry or flaky skin, it feels like it&#x27;s lacking moisture. The bottle is small but I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for 4 months now and am not even halfway through it.</li>
