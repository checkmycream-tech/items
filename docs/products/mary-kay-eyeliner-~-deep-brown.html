            <li>Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li>easy to apply - great color</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this eye liner.</li>
            <li>Lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>What I liked the best about it is that it cut my eye make-up application time in half!  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth this eyeliner goes on.</li>
            <li>It goes on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, and quickly, without smudging.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic eyeliner, goes on smooth and last all day without primer or finishing spray.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of eyeliner that would allow you to do cat eyes and other effects if you so choose.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t so much say it is water-proof as water-resistant.  </li>
            <li>It has it&#x27;s own built-in sharpener in the tip-top of the cap that doesn&#x27;t waste the product.  </li>
            <li>Neither perspiration nor make-up will cause it to run or fade, but it doesn&#x27;t take a good scrubbing or expensive eye make-up remover to clean your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other eyeliners that twist up, I found that this one does not break apart easily...</li>
            <li>Please send me a new one.</li>
            <li>Any errant marks you make are easily and cleanly corrected with a thin brush or q-tip.  </li>
            <li>It is soft so you can&#x27;t apply it aggressively like we do when we&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>Item arrived early and item was as promised.</li>

            <li> Just like any other.. not worth the higher price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a less expensive pencil eye liner with high reviews next time around, but I still highly recommend this eyeliner and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is extremely lightweight, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, it is of the highest quality.</li>
            <li> my eyes by lunch time to stop the smears and usually reapply by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> My liner was dried up.</li>
            <li> It never causes me any trouble.</li>
            <li> It will break off if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact I never experienced breakage at all.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> every time I use it the pencil breaks off</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Unlike other eyeliners that twist up, I found that this one does not break apart easily...as a matter of fact I never experienced breakage at all. It goes on incredibly smooth. This is the kind of eyeliner that would allow you to do cat eyes and other effects if you so choose. It does not smudge and it stays on all day! The eyeliner itself is extremely lightweight, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, it is of the highest quality. I&#x27;d recommend this to any and everyone!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and happy with product!!</li>

            <li> this is a fantastic eyeliner, goes on smooth and last all day without primer or finishing spray.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I will wear. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Wish they still sold the color sable, it was richer!</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner. Lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.Good color too!</li>
            <li> Item arrived early and item was as promised.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this product.  Goes on easily, and quickly, without smudging.  Any errant marks you make are easily and cleanly corrected with a thin brush or q-tip.  And it lasts through an evening out, a work out, or a day out.  Neither perspiration nor make-up will cause it to run or fade, but it doesn&#x27;t take a good scrubbing or expensive eye make-up remover to clean your eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t so much say it is water-proof as water-resistant.  It has it&#x27;s own built-in sharpener in the tip-top of the cap that doesn&#x27;t waste the product.  What I liked the best about it is that it cut my eye make-up application time in half!  It lasted me a solid 2+ months of use, 4-5x per week. (I do use a different pencil for smudging in the crease of my eye as this eyeliner does not &amp;#34;smudge&amp;#34; as well).  I&#x27;m going to try a less expensive pencil eye liner with high reviews next time around, but I still highly recommend this eyeliner and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this eye liner for years. It never causes me any trouble. I do have to &amp;#34;wipe&amp;#34; my eyes by lunch time to stop the smears and usually reapply by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction! Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li> easy to apply - great color</li>
