    <ol>
            <li>Excellent price and quality product.</li>
            <li>The best price I found, delivered promptly</li>
            <li>We spend a fortune on razor blades, and I&#x27;ve found Amazon to be the best price with subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li>The best razors ever, but I like the 8 pack best.</li>
            <li>It is the best for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got one of the Schick razor/trimmer combinations, and these work excellently as a refill.</li>
            <li>Delivery was excellent</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>very happy with these.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It came before the time they said, and I love this razor!!!</li>
            <li>It has been the best product of this kind!</li>
            <li>Great price and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>They have always worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>These plates are great.</li>
            <li>This worked out great.</li>
            <li>Great blade......</li>
            <li>These razors provide a great, close shave and are long-lasting blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman and these do an amazing job!</li>
            <li>The closest best shave to the Quattro was the Schick FX Diamond, but the Quattro is definitely a better razor.</li>
            <li>ive subscribed to every 2 months, and this seems like a good increment of time for me.</li>
            <li>how much good a coupon that expired five months ago will do me, but there was one included in the shipment.  </li>
            <li>This combination may sound picky but it works perfectly for me and prolongs the life of blades a bit as well.</li>
            <li>So it keeps its good look.</li>
            <li>and I get good shaves with the blades with no irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li>Cut the baloney with X number of razors and just sell good stuff period.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy on something used often.</li>
            <li>great price on refills, be sure you get the correct brand, /shape refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I found it really good and effective.</li>
            <li>This one causes fewer nicks and abrasions for sure!</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving!!</li>
            <li>cant beat the price,will be buying more in the future,for me and the wife!</li>
            <li>glad i found it on the internet!</li>
            <li>I found the shave to be acceptable, would work great to take along on a vacation but still not as close or smooth as my DE razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Schick Quattro and these were a good price (about $1 a blade when I bought them).  </li>
            <li>I love these blades they do a good job</li>
            <li>I put in a brand new blade on 1/1/12 and here its May 8th and it still shaves perfectly.</li>
            <li>For someone who has very sensitive skin, and tried virtually all razor blades from Gillette and Schick, this is the best razor ever.</li>
            <li>It was as described, good price and received quickly</li>
            <li>and I was able to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li>but these are the real deal at a great price.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>These are the best possible shavers out there.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is they are OK, maybe a bit better than OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used them and will always purchase more.</li>
            <li>Nothing feels better to me than a</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how you can get a better shave....</li>
            <li>well maybe if Sophia Vergara&lt;br /&gt;was shaving your face. :-)</li>
            <li>Real Schick razors for a great price.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best cartridges I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>Even better.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I would say my favorite blade is the Gillette Fusion followed by a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great smooth shave without all those nicks and cuts and is much cheaper than purchasing in the neighborhood store.</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable shave every time!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants a good shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved these razors because they flex when you shave versus staying straight.</li>
            <li>Come on Schick - make it good and make it REAL.</li>
            <li>They are good but seem to need to repeat areas to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Seems better than the original with the razor.</li>
            <li>You can always get a better shave if you have clean blades.</li>
            <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li>Sure I can&#x27;t trim worth a darn around the corners of my mouth with this overpriced razor, but the smooth part of the skin on my cheeks needs to be like a baby&#x27;s bottom if I want a lovely lady to caress it and</li>
            <li>The product inside was fine.</li>
            <li>Everything was just fine.</li>
            <li>The blades consistently give a good shave and last for a good amount of time before having to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there is a huge difference</li>
            <li>When the talk about razors comes up I enjoy &amp;#34;poking fun&amp;#34</li>
            <li>they dont leave me with cuts and they keep my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I had to use an X-acto knife to get these to fit my existing Quatro handle.</li>
            <li>The Quattro blades, in my opinion, are far superior to the Mach 3 in all respects, except one.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a 5 star rating because these razors leave me with a clean smooth shave every time I use them.</li>
            <li>and it is a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>im sure that the only better way to shave is with a straight razor, but good luck with that.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what you think, authentic Schick refill blades for your Quattro handle.</li>
            <li>that was kind of hard to open lol, but these razors are amazing!</li>
            <li>My mother always told my I was a unique and special snowflake.  </li>
            <li>Extremely pleased to have bought this for my husband, who has a thick beard and needs a good razor, but also has a metals allergy, which makes the Titanium coating a must!</li>
            <li>I really like the product but wish there was a way to clean the blades better.</li>
            <li>They are most prone to damage if dropped too much.</li>
            <li>Good price, especially if you use the subscription option.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this Quattro set is the consistency of manufacture to a high level of quality, yielding a smooth shave without nicks or cuts (assuming you don&#x27;t have bumpy skin) in tight spaces.</li>
            <li>I feel that the blades wear out too quickly for something that has four blades in one shaving frame.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>So I have tried many razors, including ones from the 99 cent store, high end ones at target, waterproof electric, and even that nair stuff that dissolves body hair.  </li>
            <li>is not only more convenient, but more economical.  </li>
            <li>Love the Schick Quattro razor but it is hard to find the refill cartridges at a good price in the store.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and is also durable</li>
            <li>The razors arrived before the expected date which was good.</li>
            <li>This razor is absolutely without question the best in the business for the price, quality of shave, and a surprisingly long lasting razor.  </li>
            <li>Not only do you get a very close shave, but nicks and cuts are almost completely eliminated by the protective wire and great design.  </li>
            <li>There is no single blade on the top, like some Quattros offer.</li>
            <li>Been using this razor for awhile and am very please with it - These refills fit very well and did the job</li>
            <li>I still subscribe to her philosopy and that is why although this product may get the job done adequately for the regular man, for my unique and special skin, I am left yearning for more.  </li>
            <li>Good product if a little pricey</li>
            <li>Its very smooth and comfortable esp for someone like me who somehow enjoy a good dense beard :(.</li>
            <li>ok no issues but price is same as walmart.</li>
            <li>Frankly I don&#x27;t think these are any better than the earlier 3-blade cartridges which were cheaper</li>
            <li>Thanks Schick Quattro!</li>
            <li>so maybe the next one will be better.</li>
            <li>It is  exactly like the blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This was a much better deal then our local stores have</li>
            <li>theses refills do exactly what i need.</li>
            <li>The real deal, not fake like some others we&#x27;ve bought on ebay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same razor since first year of college, these were handed out for free with the handle, I never bothered to switch products.</li>
            <li>and they last THREE MONTHS for me and my gay boyfriend</li>
            <li>I use these many times and they stay pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>Came in its own little box</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>; about these 3, 4, 5 blade modern wonders.</li>
            <li>This is a very good&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li>Those refills can cost you as much as four dollars a piece.</li>
            <li>Also, the lubricated strip lasts much longer and even beyond that, I keep using them until the blades feel worn.  </li>
            <li>Those days are over thanks to Shick.</li>
            <li>Since I been using it, my skin face looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wonder if these are really made by Schick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer these standard blades (better than the titanium premium version) on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for body hair too if you buzz first, the large hairs come out with a little bit of effort from the back.  </li>
            <li>Basically a ripoff, but you can&#x27;t even buy the older styles anymore.</li>
            <li>The main difference is the Gillette does the job</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and have it on auto order</li>
            <li>sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine because the Quattro blades aren&#x27;t that common in personal care aisles of many stores and online</li>
            <li>No complaint what so ever.</li>
            <li>We can put a man on the moon, we can cure childhood diseases (if we actually take the vaccines that is), we can make a tasty strudel right in our toasters at home but the razor industry can&#x27;t make me a razor with a dozen blades?</li>
            <li>They are cheap enough to replace often, but durable enough to last for a pretty extended period of time if you really want to.</li>
            <li>I switched to it after trying a free sample after using other blades for years.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, it might be worth the extra money to use the Quattro</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and always cut myself whenever i put in a new blade.</li>
            <li>Gillette blades are fabulous but they dull quickly, 99 cent store ones hack apart my face, electric razor results in razor burn and an unsightly red rash for 30 minutes, and nair damages my skin.  </li>
            <li>And no more of those stinging pencils to try and stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing is that if you dry the blade off after shaving, these blades will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I get 6 easy shaves a blade and 8-9 max per blade so with a little math, assuming the Quattro is an even $2.25 a blade that would be just about the cost of 3 of my blades and getting 6 a blade (low estimate)</li>
            <li>The item shipped very very promptly (two days after an evening order) and was as expected.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and consistent and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>The razor industry seems to only want to appeal to the lowest common denominator, creating razors with a paltry amount of blades when some of us need more.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, not very good for close detailed beard trimming.</li>
            <li>My 2 main &amp;#34;good blades&amp;#34; are the Japanese Feather $6.00 10 pack, and the German Merkur $6.50-$7 a 10 pack.</li>
            <li>I generally use each blade for a couple months before replacing them.</li>
            <li>I generally shave about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>but I think I will stick with my Old Fashioned Double Edge.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will never go back to another brand as long as these guys keep the quality up.</li>
            <li>The strips on the razor cartridge give a smoother shave without irritating my skin, and the four blades are more than enough to tackle the closest stubble.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this, Its ridiculous how much stores are getting for these things today.</li>
            <li>I shave my face against-the-grain (up, instead of down) with two separate blades for different areas: the Quattro for my upper lip where whiskers are dense, space is tight and the skin is sensitive, and for the rest of my face another manufacturer&#x27;s blades in which each blade is slightly farther apart so as to not block up with shaving cream and whiskers so easily for a longer stroke.</li>

            <li> Good price, especially if you use the subscription option.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this Quattro set is the consistency of manufacture to a high level of quality, yielding a smooth shave without nicks or cuts (assuming you don&#x27;t have bumpy skin) in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> I feel that the blades wear out too quickly for something that has four blades in one shaving frame.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> So I have tried many razors, including ones from the 99 cent store, high end ones at target, waterproof electric, and even that nair stuff that dissolves body hair.  </li>
            <li> is not only more convenient, but more economical.  </li>
            <li> Love the Schick Quattro razor but it is hard to find the refill cartridges at a good price in the store.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and is also durable</li>
            <li> The razors arrived before the expected date which was good.</li>
            <li> This razor is absolutely without question the best in the business for the price, quality of shave, and a surprisingly long lasting razor.  </li>
            <li> Not only do you get a very close shave, but nicks and cuts are almost completely eliminated by the protective wire and great design.  </li>
            <li> There is no single blade on the top, like some Quattros offer.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for awhile and am very please with it - These refills fit very well and did the job</li>
            <li> I still subscribe to her philosopy and that is why although this product may get the job done adequately for the regular man, for my unique and special skin, I am left yearning for more.  </li>
            <li> Good product if a little pricey</li>
            <li> Its very smooth and comfortable esp for someone like me who somehow enjoy a good dense beard :(.</li>
            <li> ok no issues but price is same as walmart.</li>
            <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t think these are any better than the earlier 3-blade cartridges which were cheaper</li>
            <li> Thanks Schick Quattro!</li>
            <li> so maybe the next one will be better.</li>
            <li> It is  exactly like the blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This was a much better deal then our local stores have</li>
            <li> theses refills do exactly what i need.</li>
            <li> The real deal, not fake like some others we&#x27;ve bought on ebay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same razor since first year of college, these were handed out for free with the handle, I never bothered to switch products.</li>
            <li> and they last THREE MONTHS for me and my gay boyfriend</li>
            <li> I use these many times and they stay pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> Came in its own little box</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> ; about these 3, 4, 5 blade modern wonders.</li>
            <li> This is a very good&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> Those refills can cost you as much as four dollars a piece.</li>
            <li> Also, the lubricated strip lasts much longer and even beyond that, I keep using them until the blades feel worn.  </li>
            <li> Those days are over thanks to Shick.</li>
            <li> Since I been using it, my skin face looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wonder if these are really made by Schick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer these standard blades (better than the titanium premium version) on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for body hair too if you buzz first, the large hairs come out with a little bit of effort from the back.  </li>
            <li> Basically a ripoff, but you can&#x27;t even buy the older styles anymore.</li>
            <li> The main difference is the Gillette does the job</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and have it on auto order</li>
            <li> sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine because the Quattro blades aren&#x27;t that common in personal care aisles of many stores and online</li>
            <li> No complaint what so ever.</li>
            <li> We can put a man on the moon, we can cure childhood diseases (if we actually take the vaccines that is), we can make a tasty strudel right in our toasters at home but the razor industry can&#x27;t make me a razor with a dozen blades?</li>
            <li> They are cheap enough to replace often, but durable enough to last for a pretty extended period of time if you really want to.</li>
            <li> I switched to it after trying a free sample after using other blades for years.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, it might be worth the extra money to use the Quattro</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and always cut myself whenever i put in a new blade.</li>
            <li> Gillette blades are fabulous but they dull quickly, 99 cent store ones hack apart my face, electric razor results in razor burn and an unsightly red rash for 30 minutes, and nair damages my skin.  </li>
            <li> And no more of those stinging pencils to try and stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing is that if you dry the blade off after shaving, these blades will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I get 6 easy shaves a blade and 8-9 max per blade so with a little math, assuming the Quattro is an even $2.25 a blade that would be just about the cost of 3 of my blades and getting 6 a blade (low estimate)</li>
            <li> The item shipped very very promptly (two days after an evening order) and was as expected.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and consistent and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> The razor industry seems to only want to appeal to the lowest common denominator, creating razors with a paltry amount of blades when some of us need more.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, not very good for close detailed beard trimming.</li>
            <li> My 2 main &amp;#34;good blades&amp;#34; are the Japanese Feather $6.00 10 pack, and the German Merkur $6.50-$7 a 10 pack.</li>
            <li> I generally use each blade for a couple months before replacing them.</li>
            <li> I generally shave about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> but I think I will stick with my Old Fashioned Double Edge.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and will never go back to another brand as long as these guys keep the quality up.</li>
            <li> The strips on the razor cartridge give a smoother shave without irritating my skin, and the four blades are more than enough to tackle the closest stubble.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this, Its ridiculous how much stores are getting for these things today.</li>
            <li> I shave my face against-the-grain (up, instead of down) with two separate blades for different areas: the Quattro for my upper lip where whiskers are dense, space is tight and the skin is sensitive, and for the rest of my face another manufacturer&#x27;s blades in which each blade is slightly farther apart so as to not block up with shaving cream and whiskers so easily for a longer stroke.</li>
            <li> Dry the blade off after shaving and be surprised how long your blade starts lasting.</li>
            <li> This 4-blade doesn&#x27;t provide such a god shave, especially if my beard is long.  </li>
            <li> As such, a single pack can last me almost a year if I push it.</li>
            <li> Even with both of us using them they still last a long time.</li>
            <li> These last me a long time, so I buy them.  </li>
            <li> and it costs me half as much as the other brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillete for long time and then one day I tried this Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li> As long as Schick keeps selling this refill cartridge, I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> even with a new blade i get an average and painful shave, i bought these by accident, should have paid better attention.</li>
            <li> I have not even looked back at the other brand that I used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to Gillette or any other.  </li>
            <li> Also these blades last longer than other blades I have used.</li>
            <li> The box had something smeared all over it and was crushed.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;ve never straight up broke.</li>
            <li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While using them I am getting a rough shave with nicks all over..</li>
            <li> Give me a break its a classic obselescence game.</li>
            <li> I will usually use one set of blades for about two months (daily use) before changing it, but the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades are still sharp and usable for at least that long.</li>
            <li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had one cut with a schick, no more bleeding and going out of the house with little pieces of toilet paper stuck to my face.</li>
            <li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
            <li> I press the blade part tight against a washcloth to soak up water and then polish off the handle.</li>
            <li> that is why I simply demand at least 9 or 10, wait, no, at least 11 blades.  </li>
            <li> In terms of getting cut, The only time I ran into an issue with that is when the thin wires that run perpendicular to the length of the blades is damaged in some way.</li>
            <li> It does the job with few nicks.</li>
            <li> My husband uses his razor everyday and this blade cartridge lasts at least 3 weeks before feeling even slightly used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the head snapped off the last razor long before it was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Not the usual from this brand.</li>
            <li> usually and will from now on forever buy gilette</li>
            <li> They get a closer and less irritating shave.  </li>
            <li> Hard to argue with that.</li>
            <li> This package of blades seem dull as if they&#x27;ve been used already.</li>
            <li> However, I have thick stubble on my face and both work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Plus they are expensive at almost $2 each.</li>
            <li> Now products are produced with precision to FAIL, to keep that monthly cash flow rising.</li>
            <li> Plus, ordering from Amazon and not having to get the weird dude at CVS to unlock the razor case?  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> these are expensive and the drug stor</li>
            <li> These do cut the whiskers but they also pull like crazy.</li>
            <li> Any time I use another razor that doesn&#x27;t bend/flex, I end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The reason blades &#x27;go bad&#x27; is not because they wear out they rust out.</li>
            <li> you need the edging blade like I do, this is worthless, and now not returnable since I opened the package and used a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor refill prices are insane.</li>
            <li> worst razor i have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The box had something smeared all over it and was crushed. The product inside was fine.</li>
            <li> Everything was just fine.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because these razors leave me with a clean smooth shave every time I use them.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quality product.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges are essential for the quattro. I really like the product but wish there was a way to clean the blades better. You can always get a better shave if you have clean blades.</li>
            <li> It came before the time they said, and I love this razor!!! Came in its own little box that was kind of hard to open lol, but these razors are amazing! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillete for long time and then one day I tried this Schick Quattro. I found it really good and effective. Its very smooth and comfortable esp for someone like me who somehow enjoy a good dense beard :(. I wish Schick will defintiely reduce its price though.</li>
            <li> came on time! ive subscribed to every 2 months, and this seems like a good increment of time for me. sharp and easy to use and I&#x27;m a girl but I still use the mens razors because they&#x27;re marginally cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have been using for a while.  The blades consistently give a good shave and last for a good amount of time before having to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same razor since first year of college, these were handed out for free with the handle, I never bothered to switch products. It works, and has almost no means to be improved upon. I generally use each blade for a couple months before replacing them. As such, a single pack can last me almost a year if I push it. In terms of getting cut, The only time I ran into an issue with that is when the thin wires that run perpendicular to the length of the blades is damaged in some way. I think those stabilize them or something. If I notice those wires starting to go, I&#x27;ll ditch it and replace it. But they&#x27;ve never straight up broke. They are most prone to damage if dropped too much.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say?  I love my Schick Quattro and these were a good price (about $1 a blade when I bought them).  Hard to argue with that.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades are nothing compared to the ones that came with my razor. These do cut the whiskers but they also pull like crazy. I don&#x27;t know why there is a huge difference but there is.</li>
            <li> The best price I found, delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Razors. ok no issues but price is same as walmart.</li>
            <li> I feel that the blades wear out too quickly for something that has four blades in one shaving frame. Plus they are expensive at almost $2 each. Frankly I don&#x27;t think these are any better than the earlier 3-blade cartridges which were cheaper and I was able to get more use out of them. Basically a ripoff, but you can&#x27;t even buy the older styles anymore.</li>
            <li> Razor refill prices are insane. We all know that but these are the real deal at a great price. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> This razor cartridge lasts forever!  My husband uses his razor everyday and this blade cartridge lasts at least 3 weeks before feeling even slightly used.  Highly recommend and have it on auto order so he is never without.</li>
            <li> These are the best possible shavers out there. I&#x27;m a woman and these do an amazing job! Thanks Schick Quattro!</li>
            <li> As long as Schick keeps selling this refill cartridge, I will keep buying them. They have always worked great for me.</li>
            <li> great price on refills, be sure you get the correct brand, /shape refills.&lt;br /&gt;the head snapped off the last razor long before it was bad. so check the holder every day.  I like it hangs in the shower. and it is a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with great satisfaction. It gives a great smooth shave without all those nicks and cuts and is much cheaper than purchasing in the neighborhood store. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I have both the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo and the Schick Quattro with four blades.  No complaints about either razor.  However, I have thick stubble on my face and both work.  The main difference is the Gillette does the job but I need to go over my shaving area, several times.  The Schick will take the beard off on ONE swing of the blades.  The Gillette cuts lighter but the Schick cuts closer.  If you need to shave once or twice a day, the Schick is the answer to that problem.</li>
            <li> This 4-blade doesn&#x27;t provide such a god shave, especially if my beard is long.  I&#x27;ve only used one of the three Blades so maybe the next one will be better.</li>
            <li> I have shaved my head &amp; face for 15+ years with a standard Double Edge (DE) Safety Razor and bought this razor/blade pack on a whim. I found the shave to be acceptable, would work great to take along on a vacation but still not as close or smooth as my DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;  When the talk about razors comes up I enjoy &amp;#34;poking fun&amp;#34; about these 3, 4, 5 blade modern wonders. My 2 main &amp;#34;good blades&amp;#34; are the Japanese Feather $6.00 10 pack, and the German Merkur $6.50-$7 a 10 pack. I get 6 easy shaves a blade and 8-9 max per blade so with a little math, assuming the Quattro is an even $2.25 a blade that would be just about the cost of 3 of my blades and getting 6 a blade (low estimate) the Quattro needs to last 18-21+ shaves and I dont see that happening but maybe someone out there has taken the time to do the math.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line is they are OK, maybe a bit better than OK but I think I will stick with my Old Fashioned Double Edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much good a coupon that expired five months ago will do me, but there was one included in the shipment.  It likely wouldn&#x27;t have worked online anyway. That&#x27;s fine because the Quattro blades aren&#x27;t that common in personal care aisles of many stores and online is not only more convenient, but more economical.  Why just three stars?  That coupon I mentioned.  I don&#x27;t reward carelessness with anything, even if I&#x27;m going to buy another pack of these sooner or later.  If the coupon had been valid, this would be five stars.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a hirsute man, so that might explain their longevity; these blades last me like 6-9 months. i&#x27;m on my last set and i think i&#x27;ve had &#x27;em for almost a year, no rust or nuthin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These plates are great. I&#x27;ve always used them and will always purchase more.</li>
            <li> I purchase these for my wife and I to use.  We can the subscribe and save and get two packs every two months.  Before you know it you have a surplus and you don&#x27;t feel the 20-30 hit monthly like buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> Sitting at my kitchen table, I ran my hand across my face. Nothing feels better to me than a&lt;br /&gt;ultra close shave. Thats what I get using Schick Quattro Titanium blades. This is a very good&lt;br /&gt;product. I have not even looked back at the other brand that I used for a long time. There is&lt;br /&gt;no comparison to me. Those refills can cost you as much as four dollars a piece. I can shave&lt;br /&gt;for a month using a Quattro refill and it costs me half as much as the other brand. I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;shave every day, I don&#x27;t have to. I generally shave about 3 times a week. Schick is now my&lt;br /&gt;brand for life. I don&#x27;t know how you can get a better shave....well maybe if Sophia Vergara&lt;br /&gt;was shaving your face. :-) I digress.....</li>
            <li> I prefer these standard blades (better than the titanium premium version) on my sensitive skin.  Also, the lubricated strip lasts much longer and even beyond that, I keep using them until the blades feel worn.  Each lasts for dozen of shaves.</li>
            <li> My mother always told my I was a unique and special snowflake.  I still subscribe to her philosopy and that is why although this product may get the job done adequately for the regular man, for my unique and special skin, I am left yearning for more.  The razor industry seems to only want to appeal to the lowest common denominator, creating razors with a paltry amount of blades when some of us need more.  Why not 6 or 7, even 8 blades.  Sure I can&#x27;t trim worth a darn around the corners of my mouth with this overpriced razor, but the smooth part of the skin on my cheeks needs to be like a baby&#x27;s bottom if I want a lovely lady to caress it and that is why I simply demand at least 9 or 10, wait, no, at least 11 blades.  We can put a man on the moon, we can cure childhood diseases (if we actually take the vaccines that is), we can make a tasty strudel right in our toasters at home but the razor industry can&#x27;t make me a razor with a dozen blades?</li>
            <li> So I have tried many razors, including ones from the 99 cent store, high end ones at target, waterproof electric, and even that nair stuff that dissolves body hair.  Gillette blades are fabulous but they dull quickly, 99 cent store ones hack apart my face, electric razor results in razor burn and an unsightly red rash for 30 minutes, and nair damages my skin.  This razor is absolutely without question the best in the business for the price, quality of shave, and a surprisingly long lasting razor.  I buy 4 of these at Walmart and they last THREE MONTHS for me and my gay boyfriend, he shaves only his face every three days, and I shave every day including body hair with this thing.  It&#x27;s good for body hair too if you buzz first, the large hairs come out with a little bit of effort from the back.  Highly recommended and will never go back to another brand as long as these guys keep the quality up.</li>
            <li> There is no single blade on the top, like some Quattros offer. Therefore, not very good for close detailed beard trimming.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this Quattro set is the consistency of manufacture to a high level of quality, yielding a smooth shave without nicks or cuts (assuming you don&#x27;t have bumpy skin) in tight spaces. I shave my face against-the-grain (up, instead of down) with two separate blades for different areas: the Quattro for my upper lip where whiskers are dense, space is tight and the skin is sensitive, and for the rest of my face another manufacturer&#x27;s blades in which each blade is slightly farther apart so as to not block up with shaving cream and whiskers so easily for a longer stroke. This combination may sound picky but it works perfectly for me and prolongs the life of blades a bit as well.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased to have bought this for my husband, who has a thick beard and needs a good razor, but also has a metals allergy, which makes the Titanium coating a must! He doesn&#x27;t get the facial/neck rash after using this razor on his skin, so we know it works. And the prices for the 2 packs I bought were cheaper than just 1 at the local stores!</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable shave every time!</li>
            <li> We spend a fortune on razor blades, and I&#x27;ve found Amazon to be the best price with subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li> It has been the best product of this kind! I switched to it after trying a free sample after using other blades for years. This one causes fewer nicks and abrasions for sure!</li>
            <li> The best razors ever, but I like the 8 pack best.</li>
            <li> Although description includes edging blade, the received product does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the edging blade like I do, this is worthless, and now not returnable since I opened the package and used a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Shick.</li>
            <li> The item shipped very very promptly (two days after an evening order) and was as expected. Real Schick razors for a great price.</li>
            <li> very basic razor head.  i will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best cartridges I&#x27;ve ever used!! I am a fan! Get it!!! Smooth shaving!! It is the best for the price!</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for awhile and am very please with it - These refills fit very well and did the job</li>
            <li> DVD didn&#x27;t work in our Sony DVD player. Have to play it on the Pc instead. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price,will be buying more in the future,for me and the wife! glad i found it on the internet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these razors because they flex when you shave versus staying straight. Any time I use another razor that doesn&#x27;t bend/flex, I end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got one of the Schick razor/trimmer combinations, and these work excellently as a refill. The strips on the razor cartridge give a smoother shave without irritating my skin, and the four blades are more than enough to tackle the closest stubble. No muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought Gillette razors and blades, until I tried the Shick because it was on sale at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and always cut myself whenever i put in a new blade. Those days are over thanks to Shick. I have never had one cut with a schick, no more bleeding and going out of the house with little pieces of toilet paper stuck to my face. And no more of those stinging pencils to try and stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing is that if you dry the blade off after shaving, these blades will last a very long time. I press the blade part tight against a washcloth to soak up water and then polish off the handle. So it keeps its good look. I put in a brand new blade on 1/1/12 and here its May 8th and it still shaves perfectly. The reason blades &#x27;go bad&#x27; is not because they wear out they rust out. Dry the blade off after shaving and be surprised how long your blade starts lasting.</li>
            <li> Good product if a little pricey</li>
            <li> Love the Schick Quattro razor but it is hard to find the refill cartridges at a good price in the store. This worked out great.</li>
            <li> It does the job with few nicks. The blades are sharp and consistent and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> The real deal, not fake like some others we&#x27;ve bought on ebay.</li>
            <li> For someone who has very sensitive skin, and tried virtually all razor blades from Gillette and Schick, this is the best razor ever. Not only do you get a very close shave, but nicks and cuts are almost completely eliminated by the protective wire and great design.  The closest best shave to the Quattro was the Schick FX Diamond, but the Quattro is definitely a better razor. Will never go back to Gillette or any other.  Worth every penny, and is also durable, you&#x27;ll get plenty of shaves out of each cartridge.</li>
            <li> The Quattro blades, in my opinion, are far superior to the Mach 3 in all respects, except one.  The blades remain sharper for probably and extra week over the Mach.  They get a closer and less irritating shave.  The problem is that they can be more expensive.  If you have sensitive skin, it might be worth the extra money to use the Quattro</li>
            <li> This package of blades seem dull as if they&#x27;ve been used already. While using them I am getting a rough shave with nicks all over..Not the usual from this brand.</li>
            <li> It is  exactly like the blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> It was as described, good price and received quickly</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent and I get good shaves with the blades with no irritation or nicks. Also these blades last longer than other blades I have used.</li>
            <li> Great blade......&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this, Its ridiculous how much stores are getting for these things today. Give me a break its a classic obselescence game. American companies used to pride themselves on producing products to last. Now products are produced with precision to FAIL, to keep that monthly cash flow rising. But this product works well. Come on Schick - make it good and make it REAL. Cut the baloney with X number of razors and just sell good stuff period.</li>
            <li> Item as described, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. They are cheap enough to replace often, but durable enough to last for a pretty extended period of time if you really want to. I will usually use one set of blades for about two months (daily use) before changing it, but the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades are still sharp and usable for at least that long.</li>
            <li> This was a much better deal then our local stores have and I didn&#x27;t need to leave the house to buy it.</li>
            <li> I use these many times and they stay pretty sharp.  My wife can&#x27;t find a razor that works as well so she &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; mine.  Even with both of us using them they still last a long time.</li>
            <li> theses refills do exactly what i need. they dont leave me with cuts and they keep my face smooth. very happy with these. im sure that the only better way to shave is with a straight razor, but good luck with that.</li>
            <li> If you like Quattros (or Cincos or Ochos or whatever they are making now), you know what you&#x27;re getting here.  These last me a long time, so I buy them.  Plus, ordering from Amazon and not having to get the weird dude at CVS to unlock the razor case?  Even better.</li>
            <li> No complaint what so ever. I am very happy with the product. Since I been using it, my skin face looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on using it for ever.</li>
            <li> The razors arrived before the expected date which was good. They are good but seem to need to repeat areas to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I had to use an X-acto knife to get these to fit my existing Quatro handle. I wonder if these are really made by Schick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Mea Culpa, I&#x27;m a D.A. I used a HYDRO handle not a Quattro handle - my review is hereby invalid. Sorry. Never mind.</li>
            <li> worst razor i have ever purchased. even with a new blade i get an average and painful shave, i bought these by accident, should have paid better attention. usually and will from now on forever buy gilette</li>
            <li> Seems better than the original with the razor. these are expensive and the drug stor so I order them again.</li>
            <li> I love these blades they do a good job and I&#x27;ve never gotten burn or cut.  Bonus: there was a $3 off coupon in the package for the next set.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you think, authentic Schick refill blades for your Quattro handle. Good price, especially if you use the subscription option.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy on something used often. These razors provide a great, close shave and are long-lasting blades.</li>
            <li> I do not like the metal wire that holds these blades together.  I feel it gets in the way of a close shave.  I would say my favorite blade is the Gillette Fusion followed by a Mach 3.  Skip these.</li>
