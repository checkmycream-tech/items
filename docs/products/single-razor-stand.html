            <li>but once he tried this he loved it!!!</li>
            <li>This fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good, price is very fair.</li>
            <li>The stand itself is great.  </li>
            <li>The razor has been great but the stand I purchased to hold it was built for munchkin shavers and can&#x27;t hold the shaver.</li>
            <li>Great razor stand had to widen the pronks alittle to accept my razor but</li>
            <li>Good quality for your money and attractive on display.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the complaints from others, this stand fit my razor handle perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice addition to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The opening that holds the razor could be described better on the site.</li>
            <li>I do believe it will work well with MOST safety razors (as it does with my Fat Boy), but I don&#x27;t know about some of these newer cartridge ones.</li>
            <li>- better still - go to a website that will match the razor to the stand and buy THAT.</li>
            <li>use Merkur Futur and it is a perfect fit after a minor adjustment.</li>
            <li>This razor stand is a handsome piece with nice welds, heavy feel, and great finish.  </li>
            <li>I suspect the flattened end of the Parker finds the sweet spot of the concave whereas the more pointy end of the plastic razors just slide on the polished surface.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me it did hold my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>You can never guess if yours will fit.</li>
            <li>overall great look</li>
            <li>Most of my razors just fell right out of it.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, but usability highly depends on the razor you have.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor stand is the bomb, looking cool &amp; relaxed if there is no razor and showing strength and commitment if you hang your razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s length fits modern Plastic razors fine</li>
            <li>This is completely fine for a real razor blade razor.</li>
            <li>On the web you can find other stands for much more money but why spend more when this one does the job</li>
            <li>None of these razors, all of different sizes, fit in the hook comfortably, or in the Merkur&#x27;s case, at all.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it would hold most double edge razors but that is not the case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and one more note: be aware that the seller, which is the sole purveyor of this particular razor stand, may add you to its mailing list upon purchase.  </li>
            <li>The stand is solid and easily fits in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>I learned from reading the box that it&#x27;s made custom for two particular razor handles that the same company also sells, but as I said, should work well with most safety razors both older and newer.</li>
            <li>importantly, how can a company mass produce something with a totally obvious flaw?</li>
            <li>I needed a razor stand that was slim enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>so it does not take up much room on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>To add to the unpleasantness of the experience I can&#x27;t return the darned thing because the return freight is as much as the product costs.&lt;br /&gt;Important</li>
            <li>I should have been more careful.</li>
            <li>This razor stand looks sharp; feels sturdy; has a smooth, shiny finish; and has a nice, solid heft - all for a price much lower than many of the other chrome single razor stands on the market.  </li>
            <li>Tried both a Merkur and Weishi razor, and it would have been a decent stand if it was made correctly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if your looking for just a razor stand.</li>
            <li>Slightest attempt to bend it straight caused hook to snap off completely.  </li>
            <li>The hook that holds the razor is too small in diameter to hold many modern safety and double-edged razors.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would bend it into shape</li>
            <li>, it is too tall for short handled double edge safety razors, but fits long handled nicely.  </li>
            <li>His old razor was ancient and he was reluctant to try a new one</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m on the Direct Marketing Association&#x27;s &#x27;do not mail&#x27; list, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that this incident is no accident.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however the opening is a little small for today&#x27;s larger Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in conjunction with the purchase of a new, fancy chrome razor and since they were on the same line of the Amazon webpage I just assumed that they were together.</li>
            <li>Came angled slightly downward, letting razor slip right out.</li>
            <li>At least it is of decent weight, but it&#x27;s going right in the recycle bin after I get my refund.</li>
            <li>It barely holds my husbands razor up, so I think he will be getting an upgrade for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li>Holds my Premium Black Handle very well.</li>
            <li>My father has very sensitive skin and is an expert shaver of wet method.</li>

            <li> poor shave, I tossed it out and went back to Shick</li>
            <li> Well built design, heavy base with concave depression to catch any drips. Matched my existing brush stand which was a plus. Unlike the complaints from others, this stand fit my razor handle perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this stand. It looks like it would hold most double edge razors but that is not the case. Most of my razors just fell right out of it. Lucky for me it did hold my favorite razor. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, heavy weight. Holds my Premium Black Handle very well. Should last a long time. Nice addition to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This razor stand looks sharp; feels sturdy; has a smooth, shiny finish; and has a nice, solid heft - all for a price much lower than many of the other chrome single razor stands on the market.  So why only three stars?  The hook that holds the razor is too small in diameter to hold many modern safety and double-edged razors.  An example: My main handle is a Merkur 47c, and I also own a vintage Lady Gillette and an awful Schick Quattro that I hang on to for emergencies.  None of these razors, all of different sizes, fit in the hook comfortably, or in the Merkur&#x27;s case, at all.  If your razor handle happens to be the diameter of a standard no. 2 pencil, you might be in luck, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one more note: be aware that the seller, which is the sole purveyor of this particular razor stand, may add you to its mailing list upon purchase.  About a month after ordering this item, I began receiving catalogs from Rockler Woodworking and Hardware.  Since I&#x27;m on the Direct Marketing Association&#x27;s &#x27;do not mail&#x27; list, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that this incident is no accident.</li>
            <li> Quality is good, price is very fair. The opening that holds the razor could be described better on the site. I took a chance that it would work with my Gillette Fat Boy, and it does, well. However, I can see how some reviewers noted the small opening that is too small to work with some razors. I do believe it will work well with MOST safety razors (as it does with my Fat Boy), but I don&#x27;t know about some of these newer cartridge ones. I learned from reading the box that it&#x27;s made custom for two particular razor handles that the same company also sells, but as I said, should work well with most safety razors both older and newer.</li>
            <li> Came angled slightly downward, letting razor slip right out. How the hell is any razor supposed to stay in this?  It&#x27;s downright dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, how can a company mass produce something with a totally obvious flaw? Tried both a Merkur and Weishi razor, and it would have been a decent stand if it was made correctly.  Slightest attempt to bend it straight caused hook to snap off completely.  At least it is of decent weight, but it&#x27;s going right in the recycle bin after I get my refund.</li>
            <li> I received this as a (requested) gift along with the [[ASIN:B00CQ8Y7VW Premium Black Handle Metal Shaving Handle]] for Gillette Mach 3 razors. The razor handle fits into the stand with a click of metal on metal and takes a little bit of effort to remove which prevents it from slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it has an all-metal base. Since this sits in my shower I was concerned about rust but have added a couple of rubber feet to keep it above any water that collects on the ledge.</li>
            <li> My father has very sensitive skin and is an expert shaver of wet method. His old razor was ancient and he was reluctant to try a new one but once he tried this he loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a razor stand that was slim enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.  This fits the bill perfectly.  The stand is solid and easily fits in the cabinet.  I use it with a 1960s era Hoffritz DE slant razor.  The stand holds the razor without issue.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The stand itself is great.  But the opening would not fit my razor, so now I have an expensive paper weight.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my double edge razor.  Keeps falling off.  Use it as a pen stand now.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but usability highly depends on the razor you have. You can never guess if yours will fit. Mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This razor stand is the bomb, looking cool &amp; relaxed if there is no razor and showing strength and commitment if you hang your razor.&lt;br /&gt;I am contemplating if I get another one and mount it to the hood of my car.</li>
            <li> This razor stand is a handsome piece with nice welds, heavy feel, and great finish.  It&#x27;s length fits modern Plastic razors fine, it is too tall for short handled double edge safety razors, but fits long handled nicely.  The base has a slight dish meant to contain the base of the razor, My heavy Parker sits tall and rock solid, but my mass produced mach3 and Fusion struggle and frequently fall out.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the weight or the design of the handle that makes the difference.  I suspect the flattened end of the Parker finds the sweet spot of the concave whereas the more pointy end of the plastic razors just slide on the polished surface. I recommend this stand.  Try to pair it with a matching brush stand.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good quality for your money and attractive on display.  I have the ability to hang the razor with the head up or down.&lt;br /&gt;I use Merkur Futur and it is a perfect fit after a minor adjustment. I am very pleased with my purchase. On the web you can find other stands for much more money but why spend more when this one does the job</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he just loves it. It is small so it does not take up much room on the bathroom counter. Highly recommend this if your looking for just a razor stand.</li>
            <li> This product should be zero (0) stars except that was not an option in the survey. I purchased this product in conjunction with the purchase of a new, fancy chrome razor and since they were on the same line of the Amazon webpage I just assumed that they were together. Shame on me - bad assumption - the two items had nothing in common. The razor has been great but the stand I purchased to hold it was built for munchkin shavers and can&#x27;t hold the shaver. This is MUCH too small. To add to the unpleasantness of the experience I can&#x27;t return the darned thing because the return freight is as much as the product costs.&lt;br /&gt;Important Tip: Measure the height of your shaver to make sure it fits (less 3/4&amp;#34; for the base) before you purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;Or - better still - go to a website that will match the razor to the stand and buy THAT. I will never buy items from Amazon that I have to match-up again.</li>
            <li> Great razor stand had to widen the pronks alittle to accept my razor but overall great look</li>
            <li> The stand holds my Parker 22 R a long as I put it in upside down with the razor head down. The problem is that I shave in the shower and this stand began to rust within two weeks. Making the problem worse is that the stand has a groove around the base that prevents water from draining.</li>
            <li> I requested and got this as a gift and was horribly let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point where it grips the razor is bent at a downward angle, so any razor I attempt to place on it simply falls onto the counter. Normally I would bend it into shape but it&#x27;s chromed so if I do that the chrome will flake off and it will likely rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOA and not fixable, I guess you get what you pay for. I should have been more careful.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s intended job, but that&#x27;s it. It barely holds my husbands razor up, so I think he will be getting an upgrade for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however the opening is a little small for today&#x27;s larger Gillette razors. This is completely fine for a real razor blade razor.</li>
