            <li>I had to  buy more of this product, becuase the results of my skin being more lighter and having an  more even complexion are amazing.  </li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT TIP -</li>
            <li>Skin looks even tone and fabulous love it !</li>
            <li>Overall it works great for me, but it is important to have a great sunblock when going out.</li>
            <li>so make sure you add moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>DID NOT WORK, CAUSE MORE SKIN DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>After a couple months of use, I can say I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in the size of my pores; almost invisible around my nose and working its way up to the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I love this soap it worked wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient. :)</li>
            <li>hope it works :)</li>
            <li>Will order more soon.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>And scent is okay, neutral i guess.</li>
            <li>It also has helped my daughter who has moderately more breakouts and superficial scaring</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and will continue for about 4 more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy more if I see some change to my skin, until I get the desired results.</li>
            <li>Love using this soap to even my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I love how this makes me glow and controls acne</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I wholeheartedly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>but, its ok.</li>
            <li>i love this soap.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li>in all this soap is a great product if you are looking for something to make your skin more youthful, lighter, and clear.</li>
            <li>Amazing it really worked and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I Got it amazing quickly, let&#x27;s se how it works</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Love it my face feels clean</li>
            <li>strong and discolored my face</li>
            <li>It really works to light the skin tone very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also help reduce fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>Fine as a soap, but did not notice any changes in the melasma on my face.  </li>
            <li>My acne scars have been fading more quickly AND I&#x27;ve been having fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>My color is  light caramel, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>My skin was brighter and smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes skin bright and soft.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this as a great bar cleanser/skin toner.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I love my chocolately golden brown complexion and this works wonders to correct and even out your skin tone (over about 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>My skin dries so fast after showering that I honestly don&#x27;t even need a towel, I have to bring my lotion to the bathroom and put it on before I leave the room or elseI&#x27;ll start drying out.</li>
            <li>I am excited at the prospect of having even toned skin- not just hyperpigmentation free, but also permatan free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>COOL PRODUCT GREAT FAST SHIPPING THANKS</li>
            <li>However it stings and can dry your skin out, so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is great, except that it makes your skin really dry..</li>
            <li>at night clean face with toner,&lt;br /&gt;-Then</li>
            <li>Smaller than a average soap and works great to resurface your skin but not so great in lightening your skin.</li>
            <li>Great price too better than the small 2pack version.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells nice and the price isn&#x27;t that far off from off the shelf soaps...</li>
            <li>It looks cool</li>
            <li>This is the God honest truth Do Not waste your money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t expect fast results like within 3 weeks like many others expect&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li>and it was fine the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Had an allergic reaction when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>If you are not seeing results you are most likely not using it correctly; the longer you leave it on, the better it works.</li>
            <li>I thought I would never have my normal skin tone back but that to Skokie San orange soap I feel beautiful again</li>
            <li>Great stuff actually works im much clearer</li>
            <li>but I just love the orange smell and how soft and clean</li>
            <li>My skin overall is pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product for removing scars and dark spots and brightening darkened lips that are suffering the effects of a TAN or EXCESS SKIN and SCARRING making your skin appear darker, but I don&#x27;t believe this product will lighten your skin beyond your natural complexion.</li>
            <li>I will say that it has a tendency to dry my skin out, so a good moisturizer is a must after using.</li>
            <li>Be aware!</li>
            <li>I HAD RESULTS ON MY FIRST USE!</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, however, it feels like a film is left on your skin and the formula does not brighten or lighten skin.</li>
            <li>Nice soap but no lightening effects currently on my second bar</li>
            <li>Because the skin on your face is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It does tingle but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>worth buying online and having it shipped</li>
            <li>The soap is nice but it doesnt actually whitening your skin.</li>
            <li>I know that there are product owners who buy their own soap and giving them good reviews (false reviews).</li>
            <li>I was hesitant and was like right while purchasing .</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t expect to see results right away</li>
            <li>it doesnt whiten right away of course and takes time</li>
            <li>So far its been doing a very good job in making my stretch marks less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I find that my skin is clearer, less oily and much more even after using this product for more than month.</li>
            <li>It believe it will work over some time &amp; to my understanding it will most likely not lighten up your natural skin tone but make it more radiant.</li>
            <li>Other than that it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>Third time purchases the second time I ordered it never showed up , but its a great soap</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, but will dry your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>I would say this more so helps to REVEAL brighter layers of skin beneath your dull outer most layer by being a powerful cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliate first: I exfoliate in the shower with a loofah and exfoliating body wash.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, it was for my daughter&#x27;s acne scars.</li>
            <li>but my pores around and on my nose were pretty visible.</li>
            <li>and I am still on my first bar.  </li>
            <li>I started using it the first week of April 2014 and am writing this the first week of May 2014.</li>
            <li>and  since then  my skin  looks better  every day  because i use it daily</li>
            <li>Just finish My first bar after  a month .</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ll say that it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>like this soap because it dries out pimples, controls oil and is a good general face soap especially in summer.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn at first but now</li>
            <li>If it does slowly start taking effect after my third bar, I will be more than happy to change my review.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would try the kojic soap first</li>
            <li>It worked OK but a bit pricey for only three bars of soap.</li>
            <li>u are first timer</li>
            <li>I suggest to only use it at night and wear sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>to be truthful i didnt see a difference i bought 2 different pack</li>
            <li>effective as other kojie san soap.</li>
            <li>Only good thing I can say is I bought from different vendors who sell kojic acid soaps to compare.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and my face has never felt so clean :) it does dry out your skin</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because It dries out your skin quick and it may sem darker if you don&#x27;t moisturize quick enough</li>
            <li>I use charcoal soap first to ensure my skin is free of all oils and then the kogic acid soap with my flat loofah sponge.</li>
            <li>Love this soap came on time expected</li>
            <li>Just that I hope that this product really works with my type 💪💆💅of skin tone...</li>
            <li>But it is gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>Really evened my complexion</li>
            <li>Works fast apply on area</li>
            <li>then I wash the soap off, it work really well.</li>
            <li>but I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I heard that it &#x27;melts&#x27; fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>, I promise that this is a real review.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>it smells like a really ripe orange  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kojie San for almost a month now--I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t do the two times a day that lots of people recommend on here, but even so, my skin has really benefited from it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really use much makeup on my face anymore, except for my undereye circles.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>Cleanses your skin very well.</li>
            <li>it is really cleansing and removes my impurities</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the soap rlly works for me ^ ^</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it will lighten up sun damaged skin back to the natural color &amp; even completion.</li>
            <li>my only complain would be that it melts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The only upside is that it made me squeaky clean</li>
            <li>During off weeks I alternate between Dudu Osun and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m too old for acne) and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because first of all, I love its short and sweet ingredient list and my face was looking pretty dull</li>
            <li>It does make my complexion lighter but not a weird lighter like skin bleaching products, it looks natural.</li>
            <li>As a person of color I&#x27;ve tried many products to help lighten my dark spots.</li>
            <li>Please look at my other reviews, I have purchased a good amount of whitening soaps and I rate every single one.</li>
            <li>My mild hormonal acne scars have definitely faded, it does lighten skin shade(maybe 1-2 shades?)</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is Kojic acid and once a day still gets the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read about in some reviews, so be aware, but I like it after hair removal, hot humid days,assist in occasional breakout, For exfoliation</li>
            <li>/&gt;-And most importantly apply thin layer of non scented baby powder over face which dries up the break outs</li>
            <li>but when I used It made me break out more &amp; really dried my skin</li>
            <li>Using this soap you will definitely notice some &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or even stinging if you&#x27;re super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Mind you, it really does get worse before it gets better!</li>
            <li>I live all the way from Trinidad and Tobago so the packages take a while to reach</li>
            <li>It helped cleared some spots and prevented new acne from forming</li>
            <li>however I told myself that if this didn&#x27;t work then I will just have to face the music and learn to live with my new skin.</li>
            <li>but this one is new &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it depends on your skin tone or other factors, but part of the problem, I think, is that I spend a significant amount of time in the sun (even though I DO use 100 SPF sunscreen).</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my mineral makeup oxidating, so no joke, throughout the day, I would constantly touch up my powder to &amp;#34;re-brighten&amp;#34; my face.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, it does sting a bit an dry&#x27;s up very fast.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel smooth and tight, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>I also have stretch marks and bought this product to make all of the former problems become less noticeable and also to give me a more even and clear skin tone.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so clear that people often gives me compliments.</li>
            <li>works well makes skin clear</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sooooo self conscious about them.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m absolutely ordering back a pack of these asap!!!!</li>
            <li>At first it was drying up my skin but in long term</li>
            <li>I can tell a change after I guess about 8 weeks, the scars arent completely gone but there not as dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You absolutely MUST use a lotion or moisturizer after showering with this (especially if you lather twice like myself).</li>
            <li>if could even damage your skin if you leave it that compromised after it dries out, and nobody wants a set back.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body, not just only my face.</li>
            <li>and so far one bar lasts me for months.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had this soap for a week now and it hasn&#x27;t lighten my tan drastically</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is very drying.</li>
            <li>Really works I&#x27;ve bought these for the last six months!!!!</li>
            <li>I went back Skincaretalk and after reading quite a few comments, I&#x27;ve discovered I was not using it to garner better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and all, I love my natural complexion, and with age and sun as I slowly creep towards</li>
            <li>This has caused my major breakouts!</li>
            <li>So I just stopped and my face is already getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>, i use a moisturizer after  using it since my skin is very sensible and dry, but i recommend this  product 100%</li>
            <li>I recently came back from the Bahamas and have gotten very tanned.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes before it starts burning.</li>
            <li>well and apply moisturizing lotion: This soap is drying but not extremely and not to the point that lotion doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i first used it i got some red spots because some parts of my skin got really dry.</li>
            <li>i am brown skinned not very dark but not a carmel skin tone</li>
            <li>It does make it a lil clear but not noticeable white.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on soaps, creams, acne kits, treatments, peels and even foundations (which i never had to buy in</li>
            <li>this soap does not turn you ghost white, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it just reveals your natural skin tone and brightens it.</li>
            <li>My  dark spots and blotchiness has gotten  50% better within just a few days.</li>
            <li>No irritation,  no dry skin, or burning sensation.</li>
            <li>i really need my dark skin to lighten</li>
            <li>This happened my first go round, but I was leaving it on for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last that long so don&#x27;t be surprised if its gone within a blank of an eye...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lightened a little but not too much mainly because I don&#x27;t have time yo let it sit but even without me letting it sit I see results!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had to  buy more of this product, becuase the results of my skin being more lighter and having an  more even complexion are amazing.  </li>
            <li> VERY IMPORTANT TIP -</li>
            <li> Skin looks even tone and fabulous love it !</li>
            <li> Overall it works great for me, but it is important to have a great sunblock when going out.</li>
            <li> so make sure you add moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK, CAUSE MORE SKIN DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, I can say I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in the size of my pores; almost invisible around my nose and working its way up to the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love this soap it worked wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient. :)</li>
            <li> hope it works :)</li>
            <li> Will order more soon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> And scent is okay, neutral i guess.</li>
            <li> It also has helped my daughter who has moderately more breakouts and superficial scaring</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and will continue for about 4 more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy more if I see some change to my skin, until I get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Love using this soap to even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I love how this makes me glow and controls acne</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I wholeheartedly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> but, its ok.</li>
            <li> i love this soap.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li> in all this soap is a great product if you are looking for something to make your skin more youthful, lighter, and clear.</li>
            <li> Amazing it really worked and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I Got it amazing quickly, let&#x27;s se how it works</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it my face feels clean</li>
            <li> strong and discolored my face</li>
            <li> It really works to light the skin tone very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also help reduce fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> Fine as a soap, but did not notice any changes in the melasma on my face.  </li>
            <li> My acne scars have been fading more quickly AND I&#x27;ve been having fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> My color is  light caramel, which is fine.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> My skin was brighter and smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes skin bright and soft.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this as a great bar cleanser/skin toner.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I love my chocolately golden brown complexion and this works wonders to correct and even out your skin tone (over about 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> My skin dries so fast after showering that I honestly don&#x27;t even need a towel, I have to bring my lotion to the bathroom and put it on before I leave the room or elseI&#x27;ll start drying out.</li>
            <li> I am excited at the prospect of having even toned skin- not just hyperpigmentation free, but also permatan free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> COOL PRODUCT GREAT FAST SHIPPING THANKS</li>
            <li> However it stings and can dry your skin out, so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is great, except that it makes your skin really dry..</li>
            <li> at night clean face with toner,&lt;br /&gt;-Then</li>
            <li> Smaller than a average soap and works great to resurface your skin but not so great in lightening your skin.</li>
            <li> Great price too better than the small 2pack version.  </li>
            <li> The soap smells nice and the price isn&#x27;t that far off from off the shelf soaps...</li>
            <li> It looks cool</li>
            <li> This is the God honest truth Do Not waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t expect fast results like within 3 weeks like many others expect&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li> and it was fine the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> If you are not seeing results you are most likely not using it correctly; the longer you leave it on, the better it works.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never have my normal skin tone back but that to Skokie San orange soap I feel beautiful again</li>
            <li> Great stuff actually works im much clearer</li>
            <li> but I just love the orange smell and how soft and clean</li>
            <li> My skin overall is pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product for removing scars and dark spots and brightening darkened lips that are suffering the effects of a TAN or EXCESS SKIN and SCARRING making your skin appear darker, but I don&#x27;t believe this product will lighten your skin beyond your natural complexion.</li>
            <li> I will say that it has a tendency to dry my skin out, so a good moisturizer is a must after using.</li>
            <li> Be aware!</li>
            <li> I HAD RESULTS ON MY FIRST USE!</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, however, it feels like a film is left on your skin and the formula does not brighten or lighten skin.</li>
            <li> Nice soap but no lightening effects currently on my second bar</li>
            <li> Because the skin on your face is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It does tingle but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> worth buying online and having it shipped</li>
            <li> The soap is nice but it doesnt actually whitening your skin.</li>
            <li> I know that there are product owners who buy their own soap and giving them good reviews (false reviews).</li>
            <li> I was hesitant and was like right while purchasing .</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t expect to see results right away</li>
            <li> it doesnt whiten right away of course and takes time</li>
            <li> So far its been doing a very good job in making my stretch marks less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I find that my skin is clearer, less oily and much more even after using this product for more than month.</li>
            <li> It believe it will work over some time &amp; to my understanding it will most likely not lighten up your natural skin tone but make it more radiant.</li>
            <li> Other than that it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> Third time purchases the second time I ordered it never showed up , but its a great soap</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, but will dry your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> I would say this more so helps to REVEAL brighter layers of skin beneath your dull outer most layer by being a powerful cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliate first: I exfoliate in the shower with a loofah and exfoliating body wash.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, it was for my daughter&#x27;s acne scars.</li>
            <li> but my pores around and on my nose were pretty visible.</li>
            <li> and I am still on my first bar.  </li>
            <li> I started using it the first week of April 2014 and am writing this the first week of May 2014.</li>
            <li> and  since then  my skin  looks better  every day  because i use it daily</li>
            <li> Just finish My first bar after  a month .</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ll say that it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> like this soap because it dries out pimples, controls oil and is a good general face soap especially in summer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn at first but now</li>
            <li> If it does slowly start taking effect after my third bar, I will be more than happy to change my review.</li>
            <li> but I thought I would try the kojic soap first</li>
            <li> It worked OK but a bit pricey for only three bars of soap.</li>
            <li> u are first timer</li>
            <li> I suggest to only use it at night and wear sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> to be truthful i didnt see a difference i bought 2 different pack</li>
            <li> effective as other kojie san soap.</li>
            <li> Only good thing I can say is I bought from different vendors who sell kojic acid soaps to compare.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and my face has never felt so clean :) it does dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because It dries out your skin quick and it may sem darker if you don&#x27;t moisturize quick enough</li>
            <li> I use charcoal soap first to ensure my skin is free of all oils and then the kogic acid soap with my flat loofah sponge.</li>
            <li> Love this soap came on time expected</li>
            <li> Just that I hope that this product really works with my type 💪💆💅of skin tone...</li>
            <li> But it is gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Really evened my complexion</li>
            <li> Works fast apply on area</li>
            <li> then I wash the soap off, it work really well.</li>
            <li> but I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I heard that it &#x27;melts&#x27; fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> , I promise that this is a real review.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> it smells like a really ripe orange  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kojie San for almost a month now--I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t do the two times a day that lots of people recommend on here, but even so, my skin has really benefited from it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really use much makeup on my face anymore, except for my undereye circles.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> Cleanses your skin very well.</li>
            <li> it is really cleansing and removes my impurities</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the soap rlly works for me ^ ^</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it will lighten up sun damaged skin back to the natural color &amp; even completion.</li>
            <li> my only complain would be that it melts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The only upside is that it made me squeaky clean</li>
            <li> During off weeks I alternate between Dudu Osun and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too old for acne) and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because first of all, I love its short and sweet ingredient list and my face was looking pretty dull</li>
            <li> It does make my complexion lighter but not a weird lighter like skin bleaching products, it looks natural.</li>
            <li> As a person of color I&#x27;ve tried many products to help lighten my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Please look at my other reviews, I have purchased a good amount of whitening soaps and I rate every single one.</li>
            <li> My mild hormonal acne scars have definitely faded, it does lighten skin shade(maybe 1-2 shades?)</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is Kojic acid and once a day still gets the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read about in some reviews, so be aware, but I like it after hair removal, hot humid days,assist in occasional breakout, For exfoliation</li>
            <li> /&gt;-And most importantly apply thin layer of non scented baby powder over face which dries up the break outs</li>
            <li> but when I used It made me break out more &amp; really dried my skin</li>
            <li> Using this soap you will definitely notice some &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or even stinging if you&#x27;re super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Mind you, it really does get worse before it gets better!</li>
            <li> I live all the way from Trinidad and Tobago so the packages take a while to reach</li>
            <li> It helped cleared some spots and prevented new acne from forming</li>
            <li> however I told myself that if this didn&#x27;t work then I will just have to face the music and learn to live with my new skin.</li>
            <li> but this one is new &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it depends on your skin tone or other factors, but part of the problem, I think, is that I spend a significant amount of time in the sun (even though I DO use 100 SPF sunscreen).</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my mineral makeup oxidating, so no joke, throughout the day, I would constantly touch up my powder to &amp;#34;re-brighten&amp;#34; my face.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend, it does sting a bit an dry&#x27;s up very fast.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel smooth and tight, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I also have stretch marks and bought this product to make all of the former problems become less noticeable and also to give me a more even and clear skin tone.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so clear that people often gives me compliments.</li>
            <li> works well makes skin clear</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sooooo self conscious about them.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m absolutely ordering back a pack of these asap!!!!</li>
            <li> At first it was drying up my skin but in long term</li>
            <li> I can tell a change after I guess about 8 weeks, the scars arent completely gone but there not as dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You absolutely MUST use a lotion or moisturizer after showering with this (especially if you lather twice like myself).</li>
            <li> if could even damage your skin if you leave it that compromised after it dries out, and nobody wants a set back.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body, not just only my face.</li>
            <li> and so far one bar lasts me for months.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this soap for a week now and it hasn&#x27;t lighten my tan drastically</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is very drying.</li>
            <li> Really works I&#x27;ve bought these for the last six months!!!!</li>
            <li> I went back Skincaretalk and after reading quite a few comments, I&#x27;ve discovered I was not using it to garner better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and all, I love my natural complexion, and with age and sun as I slowly creep towards</li>
            <li> This has caused my major breakouts!</li>
            <li> So I just stopped and my face is already getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> , i use a moisturizer after  using it since my skin is very sensible and dry, but i recommend this  product 100%</li>
            <li> I recently came back from the Bahamas and have gotten very tanned.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes before it starts burning.</li>
            <li> well and apply moisturizing lotion: This soap is drying but not extremely and not to the point that lotion doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When i first used it i got some red spots because some parts of my skin got really dry.</li>
            <li> i am brown skinned not very dark but not a carmel skin tone</li>
            <li> It does make it a lil clear but not noticeable white.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on soaps, creams, acne kits, treatments, peels and even foundations (which i never had to buy in</li>
            <li> this soap does not turn you ghost white, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it just reveals your natural skin tone and brightens it.</li>
            <li> My  dark spots and blotchiness has gotten  50% better within just a few days.</li>
            <li> No irritation,  no dry skin, or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> i really need my dark skin to lighten</li>
            <li> This happened my first go round, but I was leaving it on for 20 mins.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long so don&#x27;t be surprised if its gone within a blank of an eye...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lightened a little but not too much mainly because I don&#x27;t have time yo let it sit but even without me letting it sit I see results!</li>
            <li> My skin type is generally on the dry side already.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it again last week with the assistance of a flat loofah sponge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I store it in a small Tupperware container and it keeps very well.  </li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time, I happen to use it with my spin brush on my face only.</li>
            <li> People with oily skin should moisturize after using it, people with dry skin HAVE to moisturize religiously.</li>
            <li> and I had developed these little, stubborn bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dark african american</li>
            <li> I wet the soap and rub it on my stomach and let it sit for about ten mintues before I wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I gotta be careful with where I use it, especially when i have cuts and stuff.</li>
            <li> omg but not for long</li>
            <li> Used with a washcloth morning and evening and the bars lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it doesnt take long to dry and when it does you do not see or feel it on your skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the other sellers kojie San.</li>
            <li> Dry skin &#x3D;</li>
            <li> recommend it for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does leave your face really dry</li>
            <li> dont forget to apply a follow up mositurizer because this soap will dry</li>
            <li> let dry</li>
            <li> As for my bacne, again, I haven&#x27;t used this soap as often as I probably should and maybe exfoliating would help too, so I still have scars, BUT no new breakouts at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only wanted to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> The red bumps turned into dark marks all over my skin</li>
            <li> ONLY MY BODY WHERE DARK PIGMENTATION NEED IMPROVEMENT...</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one month only on the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> This soap is smaller than the average sized soap.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY IF YOU SUFFER FROM DRY SKIN OR ECZEMA!!!!</li>
            <li> I am an African American/mixed girl with medium brown skin and my skin has gotten brighter all over and a little lighter in complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> When I first bought this soap I left it on for at least 3-4 minutes which seriously caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li> I mean it grasp on the skin so tight and impedes the free flow of soap flush, running shower, and heavy dried skin.</li>
            <li> Be very careful if you have dry skin..</li>
            <li> But in my case, alternating it with Raw Black African Soap can make it last a while</li>
            <li> After I had my second child I got a lot of skin discoloration and dark spot and this soap took away all my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The bars are small and don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> If used daily it will dried up your skin and/or cause</li>
            <li> and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I saw results immediately, not much brightening but smoother clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already naturally pale, with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> While my skin is still damp I lather Kojie san on from the neck down and let it dry before stepping out.</li>
            <li> The dark spots have faded but be careful this product stings and it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> I wear a robe and do other things around the house to pass the time.</li>
            <li> The other 2 vendors I bought from soaps worked but not from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday and don&#x27;t keep it on your skin for too long.</li>
            <li> Please do not forget to check my other reviews</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is great. Mind you, it really does get worse before it gets better! When I first bought this soap I left it on for at least 3-4 minutes which seriously caused me to breakout. I didn&#x27;t give up on it, however after the initial reaction, I decided to just leave it on for 1-2 minutes. I find that my skin is clearer, less oily and much more even after using this product for more than month. My mild hormonal acne scars have definitely faded, it does lighten skin shade(maybe 1-2 shades?) after continued use, which I don&#x27;t mind. I would also recommend this on the body for getting rid of the farmers tan. People with oily skin should moisturize after using it, people with dry skin HAVE to moisturize religiously. Overall it works great for me, but it is important to have a great sunblock when going out. If you don&#x27;t protect your skin while using this soap you are undoing all the progress and might even end with darker spots!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome soap.. I have Asian skin with acne scars.. It&#x27;s fading away my scars (which 100$ dollars product didn&#x27;t do)</li>
            <li> It is great, except that it makes your skin really dry..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any result and I have used all 3 bars continuously. The only upside is that it made me squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin feel soft and my face has never felt so clean :) it does dry out your skin so make sure you add moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Third time purchases the second time I ordered it never showed up , but its a great soap</li>
            <li> Been using this product since September. This is the healthiest and the clearest my face had ever been. I have suffered from acne since puberty. I&#x27;m now 40 and no longer am I bothered with breakouts since using this soap. No money do I have to wear foundation to hide my acne scars or pimples. I was my fave with this in the morning apply a moisturizer and a sunscreen of spf 45. At night I was my face with a Shea butter soap and apply jojoba oil for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to discover this soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this months ago and used it once or twice and stopped. I went back Skincaretalk and after reading quite a few comments, I&#x27;ve discovered I was not using it to garner better results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it again last week with the assistance of a flat loofah sponge and I saw a difference in 3 days. I use charcoal soap first to ensure my skin is free of all oils and then the kogic acid soap with my flat loofah sponge. I leave it on for 5 mins and when it looks like its drying i re-wet with the loofah sponge and continue to lather for 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;I was applying it twice a day, but Ive noticed a  acne pop up on my arms, so I discontinued usage. This happened my first go round, but I was leaving it on for 20 mins. I might consider only applying on non consecutive days or do a 5 on 2 off schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to resume application when I have the time to devote to my skin. I am excited at the prospect of having even toned skin- not just hyperpigmentation free, but also permatan free.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate applying MUAC glycolic acid lotion and Amlactin lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Does not work well on darker skin.  Only wanted to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> do not use if you have eczema. I never had a problem with my hands but after using this product it dried out my hands and I had to stop. Not good if you have a skin condition. As for if it works, I cant tell because I had to stop.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK, CAUSE MORE SKIN DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li> Great! Being using it for over 6mths now and am spotless</li>
            <li> im not sure..but this soap doesnt work on me at all...everyone elses says it lighten up their skin&lt;br /&gt;it didnt do anything....</li>
            <li> Love this soap came on time expected</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction when I was pregnant. The red bumps turned into dark marks all over my skin and I&#x27;m sooooo self conscious about them. It&#x27;s been 9 months and I decided to try this soap and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my marks has already started to fade!! I LOVE THIS SOAP! I live all the way from Trinidad and Tobago so the packages take a while to reach but I&#x27;m absolutely ordering back a pack of these asap!!!! I will post photos with before and after within a few weeks time</li>
            <li> It says makes acne scars go alway but when I used It made me break out more &amp; really dried my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake soap for a dark skin, because it&#x27;s not even working yet, after using it for like a week now. And it has a bad moisture on my skin, like I mean it grasp on the skin so tight and impedes the free flow of soap flush, running shower, and heavy dried skin. Disappointed.😼!</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up some. The dark spots have faded but be careful this product stings and it&#x27;s drying. Give yourself breaks to allow your skin to breathe. I use this continuously for 2 weeks in the mornings only followed by sunscreen then I go off it for 3 weeks to allow skin to breathe. Even with this regimen the dark spots on my caramel skin have lightened drastically and skin is noticeably smoother. During off weeks I alternate between Dudu Osun and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the other sellers kojie San. I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing. A little confused.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. It got rid of dark spots around my mouth and  my chin.it definitely  has improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> Just that I hope that this product really works with my type 💪💆💅of skin tone...</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference yet,because i have not used it but a week.  But it is gentle on the face. Smells wonderful too.  I also noticed the the wrinkles on my face seems to be decreasing with each use.</li>
            <li> This has caused my major breakouts! Be aware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for lightening for maybe about a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I use it on my face, neck, back, and chest. I leave it on for 5 mins and there&#x27;s a burning sensation but that&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It did my skin wonders. My skin was brighter and smooth. Everyone was asking me why I was glowing. This is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL BUT SOAP IS VERY HARSH AND DRYING TO SKIN, YOU NEED A  EXPENSIVE MOISTURIZER BEHIND USING THE PRODUCT!!! NO RESULTS AS YET BEING THAT I JUST STARTED USING IT, BUT WILL NOT BE USING IT ON MY FACE ONLY MY BODY WHERE DARK PIGMENTATION NEED IMPROVEMENT... I FEEL THIS SOAP IS TO DRYING FOR FACIAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU SUFFER FROM DRY SKIN OR ECZEMA!!!!</li>
            <li> it made my skin darker</li>
            <li> smell is great. At first it was drying up my skin but in long term it&#x27;s all good. I do see the difference and every time I go out people are asking me what I&#x27;m using to have a great skin. My skin tone is uniform and bright now</li>
            <li> I have been using Kojie San for about a month and I already see amazing results. I have acne scarring on my chin and forehead and hyperpigmentation around my mouth, elbows, and knees. I also have stretch marks and bought this product to make all of the former problems become less noticeable and also to give me a more even and clear skin tone. I began seeing results after about two weeks; my scars are lighter and the hyperpigmentation and stretch marks have begun to fade. It does make my complexion lighter but not a weird lighter like skin bleaching products, it looks natural. If you are not seeing results you are most likely not using it correctly; the longer you leave it on, the better it works. Here are some tips to get the maximum effect:&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate first: I exfoliate in the shower with a loofah and exfoliating body wash. While my skin is still damp I lather Kojie san on from the neck down and let it dry before stepping out. Don&#x27;t worry, it doesnt take long to dry and when it does you do not see or feel it on your skin&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for at least 15 minutes: I leave mine on for about 20-30 minutes. I wear a robe and do other things around the house to pass the time. I apply Kojie San to my face and ears for the last ten minutes of my waiting time.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse well and apply moisturizing lotion: This soap is drying but not extremely and not to the point that lotion doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;Use SPF: SPF 30 is best&lt;br /&gt;Use everyday: I would not recommend using it twice a day as it would probably make your skin too dry. The main ingredient is Kojic acid and once a day still gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this soap is a great product if you are looking for something to make your skin more youthful, lighter, and clear. It works and I will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes skin bright and soft. Removes dark spots and acne scars and blemishes. Warning will lighten skin if used often or daily.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, it was for my daughter&#x27;s acne scars. I started using it and had some results of my own. My skin overall is pretty good but my pores around and on my nose were pretty visible. After a couple months of use, I can say I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in the size of my pores; almost invisible around my nose and working its way up to the top. My daughters acne scars on her forehead have flattened and visibly less noticeable. I don&#x27;t use this everyday because for my normal/dry skin it&#x27;s slightly drying. When I use it, it&#x27;s either for the morning or the night never both. I will definitely recommend this as a great bar cleanser/skin toner.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t work to lighten any spots. It only woks to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It makes my skin so clear that people often gives me compliments.</li>
            <li> I had to  buy more of this product, becuase the results of my skin being more lighter and having an  more even complexion are amazing.  Now the  soap is extremely drying, I had some flaking  for a few days but nonthing Jergens Lotion and or Aveeno Moisturizer with SPF30 couldnt fix, I was so impressed with the results.  My  dark spots and blotchiness has gotten  50% better within just a few days. My skin is glowing and is lighter. My  face was a shade darker than my body. this has happened over the last 4 years or so. My color is  light caramel, which is fine. But its looks bad when you have a hyperpigmentation and uneven discoloration due to acne  or not wearing enough spf 30.  You will not go wrong with this product, the scent smells like Sherbert. its great.</li>
            <li> The seller charged $5.48 for shipping! Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap! Smells nice and I can see the changes it has made. I like to exfoliate with dial&#x27;s skin therapy with Himalayan salt and exfoliating beads before applying the kojie soap. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase &amp; I&#x27;ve just ordered my second box!</li>
            <li> I Got it amazing quickly, let&#x27;s se how it works</li>
            <li> Love it my face feels clean keeps my skin even toned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 4 months now and have seen a big difference in my skin. I recently came back from the Bahamas and have gotten very tanned. So I&#x27;m now working on getting my color back..</li>
            <li> Great will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap it worked wonders for my skin. After I had my second child I got a lot of skin discoloration and dark spot and this soap took away all my dark spots. I thought I would never have my normal skin tone back but that to Skokie San orange soap I feel beautiful again</li>
            <li> As a person of color I&#x27;ve tried many products to help lighten my dark spots. After watching a YouTube video on this product I purchased it. I have been using it for one month only on the dark spots on my face. I see a noticeable difference and will keep using the product.</li>
            <li> The soap smells nice and the price isn&#x27;t that far off from off the shelf soaps... It lathers nicely, however, it feels like a film is left on your skin and the formula does not brighten or lighten skin. I have used it twice a day on my face for at least 3 weeks and there is no difference what so ever. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any impact on my brown spots or the lightening/brightening/evening of the skin tone on my face. As soap goes... it is very nice. I like it; however, I won&#x27;t buy it again after it runs out.</li>
            <li> It really works to light the skin tone very pleased. Would highly recommend, it does sting a bit an dry&#x27;s up very fast.</li>
            <li> as an exfoliant. It has helped fade my hyperpigmentation from past acne.  I use it on my face only and a bit on my neck if I get the urge to go the extra mile.  I will keep this product in my beauty arsenal for quite some time. It smells great too.  I store it in a small Tupperware container and it keeps very well.  I use it 2x a day and I am still on my first bar.  I started using it the first week of April 2014 and am writing this the first week of May 2014. Storing it in something air tight is a must.</li>
            <li> effective as other kojie san soap. Great price too better than the small 2pack version.  Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, it was packaged nicely. I use this soap on my face at night for my acne scars. I can tell a change after I guess about 8 weeks, the scars arent completely gone but there not as dark.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people said that it doesn&#x27;t work on them because they&#x27;re African American...but I am too. And it works for me. You just have to be patient. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 6 months on my stomach to help fade away stretch marks. So far its been doing a very good job in making my stretch marks less noticeable. I try to use it at least twice a day. I wet the soap and rub it on my stomach and let it sit for about ten mintues before I wash it off in the shower. I also use it to lighten my underarms.</li>
            <li> I ordered this  whitening soap  recommended by my sister who use it and at the beginning i thought i would take  about 2 weeks to show  any improvements, but no, it  worked  at the same week i  began using it, my co-workers  asked me  what  i was using because my face  has this  beautiful glow and  since then  my skin  looks better  every day  because i use it daily, i use a moisturizer after  using it since my skin is very sensible and dry, but i recommend this  product 100%</li>
            <li> Smaller than a average soap and works great to resurface your skin but not so great in lightening your skin. Orange smell doesn&#x27;t l</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer of this. It helped cleared some spots and prevented new acne from forming</li>
            <li> Just finish My first bar after  a month . I was hesitant and was like right while purchasing . Skin looks even tone and fabulous love it !</li>
            <li> Love the product!! Very fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> smells great ...just started using it no break outs or drying of skin...cant wait to see skin lightening results i really need my dark skin to lighten hope it works :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying I am a african-american of mixed carribean/latin/african ancestry. I have a skin tone somewhere around the tone of Nikki Minaj if that helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap took me 1 MAYBE 2 shades lighter, and I don&#x27;t believe it had anything to do with actually &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; my skin, and I&#x27;ll explain. I would say this more so helps to REVEAL brighter layers of skin beneath your dull outer most layer by being a powerful cleanser. Using this soap you will definitely notice some &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or even stinging if you&#x27;re super sensitive. The only area I felt stinging was on my lips but I could definitely understand the irritation others had mentioned. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for removing scars and dark spots and brightening darkened lips that are suffering the effects of a TAN or EXCESS SKIN and SCARRING making your skin appear darker, but I don&#x27;t believe this product will lighten your skin beyond your natural complexion. Ultimately I love my chocolately golden brown complexion and this works wonders to correct and even out your skin tone (over about 3 weeks). But if you&#x27;re trying to actually change your skin tone, that might require medical intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I love my natural complexion, and with age and sun as I slowly creep towards my 30&#x27;s I obviously won&#x27;t always have it. I thought this would be an awesome way to revisit my old youthful glow, and it&#x27;s great for that, if you want truly lightened skin though, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY VERY IMPORTANT TIP - You absolutely MUST use a lotion or moisturizer after showering with this (especially if you lather twice like myself). This soap is soak drying I personally believe if could even damage your skin if you leave it that compromised after it dries out, and nobody wants a set back. My skin dries so fast after showering that I honestly don&#x27;t even need a towel, I have to bring my lotion to the bathroom and put it on before I leave the room or elseI&#x27;ll start drying out. Dry skin &#x3D; dead skin cells which just dull out and perpetuate darkening skin/ scarring etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help to use and get result ..... It looks cool but I don&#x27;t know how it work with my skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff actually works im much clearer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my complexion. Will order more soon. Wonder soap and smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice soap but no lightening effects currently on my second bar</li>
            <li> This is the God honest truth Do Not waste your money. i have it the extra star just so I wouldnt look like a hater. Wasted my money. Only good thing I can say is I bought from different vendors who sell kojic acid soaps to compare. The other 2 vendors I bought from soaps worked but not from this vendor. Sorry thumbs down. i didnt even feel a burning sensation no stinging no nothing.</li>
            <li> Works just as perfect like I know it should! Flawless! Fantastic! Fierce!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ll say that it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I&#x27;ve had it for months now and have seen no discernible difference. I don&#x27;t know if it depends on your skin tone or other factors, but part of the problem, I think, is that I spend a significant amount of time in the sun (even though I DO use 100 SPF sunscreen). For a while, I was using the soap and leaving it on for a few minutes, but then I stopped doing that. So maybe I should try it again. If I try a different regimen and find that it works for me, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because, while it did not work for me, I don&#x27;t feel that it was a waste of my money. It does make my skin feel smooth and tight, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> seems to work well, but it stings sometimes aha so I gotta be careful with where I use it, especially when i have cuts and stuff.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin. When i first used it i got some red spots because some parts of my skin got really dry. But as soon as I putted cream on it they were gone. I use it on my whole body, not just only my face. I would recommend, when you put it on your body, leave it on for around 3 min. And on your face only 1 min. Because the skin on your face is more sensitive. And scent is okay, neutral i guess.</li>
            <li> This soap is a lifesaver!!!!  I struggle with hormonal breakouts and scaring. I&#x27;m of medium complexion and this soap has brightened and dried out annoying blemishes. I saw results within a week of use and didn&#x27;t find it ultra drying like others. My skin type is generally on the dry side already. It does tingle but is well worth it. It also has helped my daughter who has moderately more breakouts and superficial scaring and she is so happy she can start her freshman year with bright skin. I don&#x27;t notice a lightening effect just brighter smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a while. And that one is completely different. It leaves a slippery somethinh on your skin.  No skin peeling.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Really evened my complexion</li>
            <li> wanna get white this will help.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It does take some time before you will start to see results, but it works. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and will continue for about 4 more. The three pack seems to last for about a month and 2 weeks. I use it nightly, all over and then use an exfoliating sponge with the lather. I will say that it has a tendency to dry my skin out, so a good moisturizer is a must after using.</li>
            <li> Great product. Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Just Didn&#x27;t Do Anything.</li>
            <li> The soap smells amazing. I love it. The soap lighten you up little bit but I have not gotten dramatic results. But it does lighten you up a bit but you have to give it some time on your skin send it also burns a little</li>
            <li> Works fast apply on area you are treating  and leave on for 5 minutes. I apply it to dark marks on my face and arms, both morning and night. to pass the time, I brush my teeth which takes about 5 minutes then I wash the soap off, it work really well.</li>
            <li> I use this soap 3 time a week to exfoliate.  If used daily it will dried up your skin and/or cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It also help reduce fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> Im someone who never had acne growing up.  Well, 24hrs after I turned the big 3-0 my skin looked as if I was a greasy pizza faced pubescent kid. I have spent so much money on soaps, creams, acne kits, treatments, peels and even foundations (which i never had to buy in the past)....but nothing worked.  I came across this soap and said &amp;#34;why not, its under $8&amp;#34;.... however I told myself that if this didn&#x27;t work then I will just have to face the music and learn to live with my new skin. Guess what.....it worked! I order 3 bars of this soap every 2 months. No irritation,  no dry skin, or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this soap has made me any lighter (Not why I buy it) but I just love the orange smell and how soft and clean it makes my skin feeling, even my husband is a convert and swears he&#x27;s not going back to regular soaps. Kojie San can sting a little but that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working in exfoliating my skin and my only complain would be that it melts pretty quickly. But in my case, alternating it with Raw Black African Soap can make it last a while and the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> KEEPS ACNE AWAY AND ALSO KEEPS SKIN TONE EVEN BY TAKING AWAY DARK SPOTS</li>
            <li> Be very careful if you have dry skin..even moisturizing doesn&#x27;t help. Don&#x27;t use it everyday and don&#x27;t keep it on your skin for too long.</li>
            <li> Its fake doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Very good product incredibly good for oily skin</li>
            <li> like this soap because it dries out pimples, controls oil and is a good general face soap especially in summer. I keep it in a soap dish to make it last longer and so far one bar lasts me for months. pkg is a good deal since you pay for volume packaging and save a lot per bar. I rub the bar just 2-3 times and let the suds sit on my face for 20-30 minutes for best effect.I don&#x27;t get the excessive drying or skin shedding I read about in some reviews, so be aware, but I like it after hair removal, hot humid days,assist in occasional breakout, For exfoliation, I use this soap, homemade Tend to which I add a drop of glycerin and aloe vera juice, and my VIt C retinol serum.</li>
            <li> This product works really good for acne On my god! I am an African American/mixed girl with medium brown skin and my skin has gotten brighter all over and a little lighter in complexion. I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week and my boyfriend says that he sees a difference. It didn&#x27;t burn at first but now omg but not for long I lather up and wash off 3 min after. I gave it four stars because It dries out your skin quick and it may sem darker if you don&#x27;t moisturize quick enough but I have really oily skin so it feels great.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better lightening soap! I gave a bar to my friend and people have recognized an improvement with her skin. I use it for my face, arms, underarms, buttocks and neck. I HAD RESULTS ON MY FIRST USE! That&#x27;s what hooked me. However it stings and can dry your skin out, so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> YES! indeed it works, had been searching for a product that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> I thought the soap bars would be normal / average sized. It wasnt. I got 5 washes out of each. If you bathe twice a day thats just 2 and a half days. But they smell good, like oranges</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME!!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to lighten up my tanned arms and neck. So far I&#x27;ve had this soap for a week now and it hasn&#x27;t lighten my tan drastically but it has made it more bright. It believe it will work over some time &amp; to my understanding it will most likely not lighten up your natural skin tone but make it more radiant. I&#x27;m sure that it will lighten up sun damaged skin back to the natural color &amp; even completion. I love the soap it smells great but the are like small hotel sized soap. It does tend to be a bit drying. I cut my soap up into little cubes and use as needed cause I heard that it &#x27;melts&#x27; fast. Shipping was really fast. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look in a few months! I will continue to buy more if I see some change to my skin, until I get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Amazing it really worked and the results are amazing. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> This soap is smaller than the average sized soap. It is suppose to to whiten your skin just like what the title describes it. The package itself says skin lightening soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and used 1/3 of the product, there has not been a slight change on my skin. I&#x27;ve been wearing a sweater to stay away from the sun to get the maximum result. This is another failed product. It is up to you to take my word for it. Please look at my other reviews, I have purchased a good amount of whitening soaps and I rate every single one. I know that there are product owners who buy their own soap and giving them good reviews (false reviews). I assure you, this product does not work. If it does slowly start taking effect after my third bar, I will be more than happy to change my review. Please do not forget to check my other reviews, I promise that this is a real review.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I am noticing gradual lightening of my hyperpigmentation areas.  If you use nightly you will go through an average of 1 bar a week.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Love using this soap to even my skin tone. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my second bar !This is month 2 I&#x27;ve lightened a little but not too much mainly because I don&#x27;t have time yo let it sit but even without me letting it sit I see results! The smell is good but I&#x27;m used to soap smelling like soap  it smells like a really ripe orange  I&#x27;m really dark african american and I love how this makes me glow and controls acne</li>
            <li> Burn but no lightening...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the peeling set by Marie France but I thought I would try the kojic soap first (what I purchased is not France kojic soap). This soap works well on the dark skin between my thighs. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin between my legs is a shade lighter.  The bars are small and don&#x27;t last long so I would suggest buying a 3 park or larger.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! My skin is scar prone and I have an uneven skin tone so I wash my body with this every night. My acne scars have been fading more quickly AND I&#x27;ve been having fewer breakouts. This is one of my must-haves. The only thing is that it is very drying. You should use a good moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li> Lovely skin whitener works great!</li>
            <li> It good &amp; I like it but the only problem I have is that it did not lighting my body at at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown skin African american woman and it didn&#x27;t work for my skin at all. I&#x27;m not looking to bleach my skin just to fade some dark spots on my face and I didn&#x27;t expect to see results right away so I used it for 6 months and there&#x27;s no noticeable difference after using it twice a day. I&#x27;m going to keep using it anyway it works really good as a makeup remover I don&#x27;t have to wash my face twice. It does leave your face really dry so use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Really works I&#x27;ve bought these for the last six months!!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for stuff, but I felt like I had to for this product because it actually works! I&#x27;ve been using Kojie San for almost a month now--I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t do the two times a day that lots of people recommend on here, but even so, my skin has really benefited from it. I&#x27;m already naturally pale, with yellow undertones. I bought this soap because first of all, I love its short and sweet ingredient list and my face was looking pretty dull and I had developed these little, stubborn bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried. At first I thought it was my mineral makeup oxidating, so no joke, throughout the day, I would constantly touch up my powder to &amp;#34;re-brighten&amp;#34; my face. After washing my makeup off, I noticed my skin would still look dark... Now my face is the same color as my body. It&#x27;s bright and smooth--the bumps on my forehead are gone and I don&#x27;t really use much makeup on my face anymore, except for my undereye circles. As for my bacne, again, I haven&#x27;t used this soap as often as I probably should and maybe exfoliating would help too, so I still have scars, BUT no new breakouts at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this soap does not turn you ghost white, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it just reveals your natural skin tone and brightens it. I have very sensitive skin, so I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes before it starts burning. I do 20 on my body, but I&#x27;m considering trying 30. I moisturize with jojoba oil afterward and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the soap being too drying or causing wrinkles. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I wholeheartedly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my face for a month now and it was fine the first 2 weeks but then I started getting cystic acne and milia. So I just stopped and my face is already getting back to normal. I will continue to use for the rest of my body just not my face.</li>
            <li> ALOHA HEY GUYS GREAT PRODUCT REALLY WORKS I USE EVERY SHOWER DAILY IM IN CONSTRUCTION WORK REMOVING ALL DARK DIRTY OLD SKIN MY GIRL LOVES IT AND SHE SAID IT EVEN LIGHTENED MY PRIVATES COOL PRODUCT GREAT FAST SHIPPING THANKS I WILL REORDER OVER AND OVER MAN I SEE A DIFFRENCE BIG TIME</li>
            <li> 1 month use have not seen any changes whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I would buy again especially because I cannot buy in the stores&lt;br /&gt;Not worth buying online and having it shipped</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> strong and discolored my face</li>
            <li> It worked OK but a bit pricey for only three bars of soap. Other than that it worked pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t last that long so don&#x27;t be surprised if its gone within a blank of an eye...</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! Cleanses your skin very well. You&#x27;ll definitely need to moisturize after using it, but you can see all of the dirt this soap helps to pick up and cleanse away in the shower.</li>
            <li> rated this medium cos haven&#x27;t actually tried it -- but see my pic -- i just received this (august, 2015), but wanting to advise of the ACTUAL ingredients -- as **differing from what is stated** in this product listing (and unfortunately, includes MINERAL OIL): coconut oil, de-ionized water, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, kojic acid, glycerin, water and xanthan gum and caprylyl glycol and glucose and caragreenan and phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycerine, cocodiethanolamide, mineral oil, tea tree oil, CI 15985, CI 19140, BHT</li>
            <li> Works wonders to take off dead skin to give e en gone.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this soap for long time and it helped to dried my pimples.if u are first timer dont forget to apply a follow up mositurizer because this soap will dry ur skin.it also whitens the skin...</li>
            <li> too small for the price</li>
            <li> Soap smells good. Will write a review after it starts to work.</li>
            <li> Since commenters helped me with this purchase I figured I would help some one too seeing as I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback. But this product deserves it. So:&lt;br /&gt;-Using it for 2 months now and its finally evening out my tone and lightening blemishes&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t expect fast results like within 3 weeks like many others expect&lt;br /&gt;-Leave on for 1-3 minutes as suggested by others twice a day&lt;br /&gt;-Use good sunblock&lt;br /&gt;I guess you&#x27;ve already heard all this advice but this one is new &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;-If it causes break outs...at night clean face with toner,&lt;br /&gt;-Then apply thin layer of benzoyl peroxide five per cent- let dry&lt;br /&gt;-And most importantly apply thin layer of non scented baby powder over face which dries up the break outs/bumps.&lt;br /&gt;If this helps let me know. Good luck.</li>
            <li> The soap is nice but it doesnt actually whitening your skin. It does make it a lil clear but not noticeable white. I would recommend it. The soap comes in small bars would av prefer biger size and does not.last longer.</li>
            <li> i like it. it doesnt whiten right away of course and takes time but, its ok. its a bit small per bar tho. so dont let it sit in water, it will melt.</li>
            <li> i love this soap. it is really cleansing and removes my impurities</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past couple months and I have to say I&#x27;m in love with it my skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I saw results immediately, not much brightening but smoother clearer skin. It did bring out blackheads and pimples and then my skin is getting gorge by the day.</li>
            <li> Clears up my acne (I&#x27;m too old for acne) and leaves my skin super soft. I also notice that my skin tightens up.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. One bar lasts a long time, I happen to use it with my spin brush on my face only. My skin has brightened up a lot. I suggest to only use it at night and wear sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the soap rlly works for me ^ ^</li>
            <li> This product did not work for i am brown skinned not very dark but not a carmel skin tone</li>
            <li> to be truthful i didnt see a difference i bought 2 different pack just to  try to even if it worked but nothing!</li>
            <li> works well makes skin clear</li>
            <li> Honestly, it just felt like soap. They didn&#x27;t have any effect on my face.</li>
            <li> Fine as a soap, but did not notice any changes in the melasma on my face.  Has a nice smell, but will dry your skin a bit.  Used with a washcloth morning and evening and the bars lasted a long time.</li>
