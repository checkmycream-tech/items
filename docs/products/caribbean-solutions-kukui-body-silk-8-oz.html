            <li>I liked the feel and scent of it.      </li>
            <li>It has a creamy texture and light scent, both of which are pleasant.</li>
            <li>Love the softness of this product and the ingredients &amp; wish more companies would not use harmful chemicals in their products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and does wonderful things for my skin!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of a review or two that I saw and because I liked Caribbean Solution&#x27;s Sol Guard SPF 25 (which is biodegradable and Reef Safe) sunscreen.    </li>
            <li>bottle comes with a nice pump top not the squeeze top pictured.</li>
            <li>is it may have very lightly tinted my skin tan</li>
            <li>Also, this does come with a pump top.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>glad I found a place to buy it again</li>
            <li>Was wondering where I could get more.</li>
            <li>The alternative is L&#x27; Occitane Ultra Rich Shea Butter skin cream, which is amazing, but it also costs over $40 for a jar.</li>
            <li>Light scent, absorbs really quickly and keeps my skin feeling amazing.  </li>
            <li>no bad things!  </li>
            <li>Great product, got it at the local health food store...</li>
            <li>It does have a light floral scent</li>
            <li>I noticed that my peeling skin had a light tan color to it.  </li>
            <li>They were demoing this product at the pool gift shop and I was more than willing to test it out.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>The smell is delicate and it has all the best ingredients.....</li>
            <li>My skin can be very fickle when it comes to lotion and does not respond well to most drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and there is no reaction at all, just smooth hydrated skin!</li>
            <li>The lotion has a lovely feel - not heavy or greasy, but substantial (if that makes any sense).  </li>
            <li>Really a great bodylotion, I use it many times after shower, it really makes your skin soft and beautifully moist, even, without ANY bad ingredients...</li>
            <li>I first used this product almost 10 years ago in Orlando,FL.</li>
            <li>You should definitely give this lotion a try, it&#x27;s so much more effective than any other sunburn lotion I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to anyone who needs help beyond what grocery/drugstores have to offer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this helped our sunburns heal and much quicker.</li>
            <li>I question if this is the real caribbean solutions moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This as all Carribean Solution products are great for your skin year round, both male and female Snow Bunny from Boston Smile</li>
            <li>My go-to cheap moisturizer is Jergens Ultra Healing, but it doesn&#x27;t really work on extremely dry patches.</li>
            <li>My family still continues to purchase this product and we highly recommend it to you and yours.</li>
            <li>I used this after my shower this morning (used the self-tanner last night, BTW) and my skin is super soft and silky!  </li>
            <li>my wife realy likes the lotion alot and it is now her favorite sun dried skin remedy.  </li>
            <li>It is, of course, much cheaper here than it was at the resort in Cabo, but it works just the same!</li>
            <li>I first tested the \\&quot;Icy Relief Gel\\&quot; which was heaven to my burn</li>
            <li>do tend to have dry skin and so far, even my knees and elbows are soft and silky - no trace of their lizard-like scaliness.  </li>
            <li>I prefer other products for intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Much like the other five star reviewers, the kukui body silk</li>
            <li>It certainly works better than the Jergens on really dry patches, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as expensive as L&#x27;Occitane.</li>

            <li> We bought this for the first time on our honeymoon in Cabo, when we got a bad sunburn. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this helped our sunburns heal and much quicker. It smells great and absorbs well. It is, of course, much cheaper here than it was at the resort in Cabo, but it works just the same! Also, this does come with a pump top. You should definitely give this lotion a try, it&#x27;s so much more effective than any other sunburn lotion I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  My daughter makes spa products and hasn&#x27;t found a recipe for anything as good as my Kukui Silk.  So she gets it from me as a gift.  Soothes my callouses from gardening too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years. Do not use anything but this on my face after shaving. Also great for sunburn and to keep your skin moist. I order 3 at a tIme</li>
            <li> I first used this product almost 10 years ago in Orlando,FL. while on vacation. After 2 days of basking in the Florida sun I was burned beyond discomfort. They were demoing this product at the pool gift shop and I was more than willing to test it out. I first tested the \\&quot;Icy Relief Gel\\&quot; which was heaven to my burn and then I purchased \\&quot;Kakui Body Silk\\&quot; to use later that evening. After applying the \\&quot;Kakui Body Silk\\&quot; I was convinced that this was the product to have after being exposed to sun. My family still continues to purchase this product and we highly recommend it to you and yours.</li>
            <li> Really a great bodylotion, I use it many times after shower, it really makes your skin soft and beautifully moist, even, without ANY bad ingredients... Great product, got it at the local health food store...</li>
            <li> I prefer other products for intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> bought this biodegradeable lotion product along with the suntan lotion and burn relief before going to mexico.  my wife realy likes the lotion alot and it is now her favorite sun dried skin remedy.  bottle comes with a nice pump top not the squeeze top pictured.</li>
            <li> I agree with everything the previous one star reviewer said.  Much like the other five star reviewers, the kukui body silk was a wonderful lotion that seemed to magically heal sun burns over night and smelled great.  The bottle ordered from here smells of bad perfume, does not do much for sun burns, and comes in the wrong bottle...this indicates to me that it is a fraudulent product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it smelled wonderful. (purchased somewhere else)  When I received this it smelled aweful.  I question if this is the real caribbean solutions moisturizer. The picture shows a push down lid, mine came with a pump dispenser.  I contacted the seller about a return/exchange without a response.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and does wonderful things for my skin!  I have sensitive skin and there is no reaction at all, just smooth hydrated skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the Caribbean Solutions self tanner - I love this stuff!  I used this after my shower this morning (used the self-tanner last night, BTW) and my skin is super soft and silky!  The lotion has a lovely feel - not heavy or greasy, but substantial (if that makes any sense).  It does have a light floral scent that I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to have dry skin and so far, even my knees and elbows are soft and silky - no trace of their lizard-like scaliness.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this as my go-to body moisturizer!</li>
            <li> BEST stuff ever.  Use this with the Icy relief gel and your sunburn will no longer burn and you will not peel.</li>
            <li> Love the softness of this product and the ingredients &amp; wish more companies would not use harmful chemicals in their products!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of a review or two that I saw and because I liked Caribbean Solution&#x27;s Sol Guard SPF 25 (which is biodegradable and Reef Safe) sunscreen.    The Kukui Body Silk smelled nice and helped give relief to my sunburned areas.  NO, I didn&#x27;t burn because of using the sunscreen mentioned above, I didn&#x27;t burn where I&#x27;d used that.  And I didn&#x27;t burn on the other beach and snorkeling outings I&#x27;ve been on when using C. S. Guard SPF 25.  On this trip to the Caribbean I burned on a few areas I either missed putting the sunscreen on or didn&#x27;t reapply (chest, shoulders, and upper back).      The Kukui Body Silk provided the moisturizing that my parched body needed.  I liked the feel and scent of it.      The only negative I had with it is it may have very lightly tinted my skin tan (but maybe that isn&#x27;t a negative after all, hummmmm...).  I noticed that my peeling skin had a light tan color to it.  My husband said he thought the color may have come from the sun, but I don&#x27;t remember ever having that happen before, so I think it was from the Kukui nut.    I like this product and would buy it again.    *** ON EDIT : August 21, 2011... Used this product on my husband&#x27;s back the other day and did not notice any tinting on his skin.  So maybe he was right, and the faint brownish tinge was from my sunburn and not the Kukui Body Silk.      I used it on my husband&#x27;s back to relieve dry, itchiness.  It worked.  Since it seems the tinting may not have been due to the product after all and because it did give me relief and has just given my husband relief, I&#x27;m adding a star.    Again, I like this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  The smell is delicate and it has all the best ingredients.....no bad things!  I am ordering my second bottle....I use it on my face and body, and in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion! Light scent, absorbs really quickly and keeps my skin feeling amazing.  Bought the three pack because I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> this is so good for your skin..my opion..smells wonderful been using it for years since the 90&#x27;s ...glad I found a place to buy it again</li>
            <li> Spectacular after sun lotion!!! I don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s a more superior lotion than this!!!</li>
            <li> My skin can be very fickle when it comes to lotion and does not respond well to most drugstore brands. My go-to cheap moisturizer is Jergens Ultra Healing, but it doesn&#x27;t really work on extremely dry patches. The alternative is L&#x27; Occitane Ultra Rich Shea Butter skin cream, which is amazing, but it also costs over $40 for a jar. This lotion is the middle ground. It certainly works better than the Jergens on really dry patches, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as expensive as L&#x27;Occitane. It has a creamy texture and light scent, both of which are pleasant. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who needs help beyond what grocery/drugstores have to offer.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion as a gift for my wife while on a snorkel trip to Key Largo. This was definitely a homerun. She loves it. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and no chemicals. Was wondering where I could get more. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> This as all Carribean Solution products are great for your skin year round, both male and female Snow Bunny from Boston Smile</li>
