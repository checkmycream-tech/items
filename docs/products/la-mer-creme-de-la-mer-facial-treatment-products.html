    <ol>

            <li>Excellent cream.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s one of the best I used on my face.</li>
            <li>says the clients with the best skin always confess to using it.  </li>
            <li>Nivea works beautifully for some people and that&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a very good product, but too costly and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for sagging skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very good and also protected my skin against Rosacea.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible product.</li>
            <li>The best as a moisturizer and the price was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, my husband&#x27;s face healed beautifully and the actinic keratosis is gone.  </li>
            <li>Seems like once you&#x27;ve experienced &#x27;la mer&#x27;, nothing else compares.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks great</li>
            <li>and I remembered how great it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, the best part is how your skin feels on your face after applying it.</li>
            <li>La Mer is a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>It does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li>Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.</li>
            <li>Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product.</li>
            <li>La Mer worked out really good for me...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always tried to take really good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a maintenance good cream.</li>
            <li>During the warmer months I find the sun does for me what the cream seems to do in the winter months, make me feel i look good without the need for makeup.  </li>
            <li>It does feel good, and seems to overcome life&#x27;s visible imperfections, colds, stress, etc.</li>
            <li>A very good product, very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy as a clam that I don&#x27;t have to pine away for La Mer any more because Nivea truly is a twin to La Mer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to turn 64, and my skin is every bit as nice as someone with good skin in their 40&#x27;s, even perhaps 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I Love Creme de La Mer!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Customer service is very good, it worth to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 18 years now, and I have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li>It works for every kind of skin.</li>
            <li>Tocoferyl Succinate is the most effective form of Vitamin E, which is good.    </li>
            <li>If my skin is irritated for whatever reason, La Mer is soothing to put on overnight, and that&#x27;s what I liked it for:  </li>
            <li>They harvest their own sea kelp just as Chanel harvests their own batch of lavender from a farmer in the south of France.  </li>
            <li>It will be nice to put expiration date on the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li>think this is a great cream and, for me, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used to cure my flaky and dry skin in the winter and keep me glowing in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to buy the 1 ounce jar.  </li>
            <li>, Hollywood actresses use (must be great, right?).  </li>
            <li>If you want to buy into the hype, all the department store brands ALSO produce the familiar drug store brands, which while not identical, are every bit as good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything will magically change your skin by itself.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my face looks and can&#x27;t imagine living without this product.</li>
            <li>It kills the faster growing cancer cells -- but it also wreaks havoc on the healthy cells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to buy more</li>
            <li>I LOVE every La Mer product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>at 63 the wrinkles in my neck (from my perspective) look even better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I found plenty of these ingredients over the internet, most on makingcosmetics.com as well as on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Basically, I love this cream for the winter.</li>
            <li>I saw more improvement in 48 hrs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a bit suspicious that while I liked this cream, it had a huge amount of \\&quot;myth\\&quot; built up around it, celebrities buy it and tout its wonders, and the magazines are always praising it.  </li>
            <li>They moisturize, some better than others.  </li>
            <li>i love the product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>and she said, \\&quot;funny I was just about to comment on how good your skin</li>
            <li>Not all the fine lines are gone, but my skin feels really hydrated, elastic, and bright.    </li>
            <li>The vendor delivered this very quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I strongly disagree.  </li>
            <li>It has a \\&quot;magic broth\\&quot; made from special seaweed.  </li>
            <li>The contour of my skin, my pore size, the texture and tone, the moisture levels, the fine lines - all of it is improved.</li>
            <li>Adequate collagen helps your skin stay more youthful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordered what I thought were free trial samples.</li>
            <li>Beyond using Retin A at night, the key to good skin is:  always wear good sunscreen and never allow burning, give up on having a tan, never go to a tanning salon, don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink much, and moisturize moisturize moisturize.  </li>
            <li>The best thing you can do for your skin, especially if you are 45 or older, is get a doctor&#x27;s prescription for Retin A or Renova.  </li>
            <li>If you have to place all of your eggs in one basket place them in the original Cr&amp;egrave;me de La Mer formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of an ultra rich, heavier moisturizer that had a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Because this cream is so wonderfully rich</li>
            <li>do believe that my CDLM was the original version from Max Huber labs (says so on the bottom) -- before it was taken over.  </li>
            <li>So, yes, I would buy this, and I would buy it more than once if it didn&#x27;t meet your expectations the first time around (assuming you have the money of course).  </li>
            <li>It took a while for it to arrive and when it did the original packaging of the cream looked sketchy.  </li>
            <li>At dinner the other night, I started to tell her I bought some overpriced but beautifully fragranced and formulated (smooth creamy) product</li>
            <li>La Mer by far, has been the BEST, quickest acting, line smoothing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for your face if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>There have been critiques of very respected people such as Paula Begoun stating that this is actually a pretty old fashioned formulation with nothing especially magical about it, and no, that seaweed broth isn&#x27;t any more mystical and magical than anthing else out there.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks bright and younger.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and it&#x27;s much cheaper in US</li>
            <li>sweet almond) seed meal, Sodium Gluconate, Potassium Gluconate,  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think I would stick with it after one jar full, but, forget about it</li>
            <li>I am a thirty six-year old year-old woman with pretty good genes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone---I cannot find another cr√®me that is as  successful as this one for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got the money and want beautiful skin, I highly recommend purchasing the La Mer cream (unless you&#x27;re younger than 35).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes we get lucky, we take a chance, we find something we like.</li>
            <li>My face looks as fresh and line free at 9:30 p.m. as it did at 6:30 a.m. when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but felt like this time I should.  </li>
            <li>- the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice.</li>
            <li>I just happened to remember that I had a tiny jar of CDLM and that it had been invented by a NASA scientist to treat his own burns.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth the price.</li>
            <li>Since my early 20&#x27;s, I had used facial products from Shiseido, which was great for my skin.  </li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li>so maybe the differences between the two becomes more marked</li>
            <li>So far, I have yet to find one that does (and I&#x27;ve used Murad, Strivectin, Kinerase, Perricone and many others).  </li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review products, but I was so impressed with La Mer&#x27;s Creme de la Mer that I wanted to put in a good word for it after seeing all the negative reviews.    </li>
            <li>The cream is very good value for me as one 30ml jar will last me a long time - 3/4months</li>
            <li>If the price was just a little lower, they would so many more loyal customers.</li>
            <li>First, I believe (and of course I could be wrong)this product is mostly for middle-aged, or mature adults.</li>
            <li>I just use the classic, original formula face cream.</li>
            <li>Do these things starting as young as you can, and you will have great skin when you are older.  </li>
            <li>but as a cosmetic junkie and research scientist I&#x27;ve put my ability to think critically and research the heck out of nearly everything I eat or put on my body into good use.  </li>
            <li>I hoped to find something very much like Creme de la Mer</li>
            <li>I think when reading the negative reviews these are people for whom no face cream makes them happy because they&#x27;re literally looking for a miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would pay this much for a moisturizer, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Do you knowthat the German version of Nivea cream has many of these ingredients?</li>
            <li>, I may use more than necessary.</li>
            <li>First recommendation</li>
            <li>it on your fingers first just like La Mer.  </li>
            <li>‚Ä¶.I think is pretty kick</li>
            <li>Blemishes clear much faster, and scars/sun damage/uneven tone improve very quickly.</li>
            <li>As for it being thick and greasy, um, well sure, because it&#x27;s a super rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just occasionally try out high end products to see if they do anything better for my skin.  </li>
            <li>shouldn&#x27;t the trail period be long enough to make a good evaluation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product years ago, which permanently erased a large age spot.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of a certain age....</li>
            <li>Nivea has been around for ages, and I suspect that when Dr. Huber was formulating his cream, he might have started with a formula like Nivea&#x27;s as it was a very popular and widely used cream long</li>
            <li>It is sold for a very very high cost that people are convinced to pay as a result of buying into all the marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when I use La Mer it literally lasts all day long--until I&#x27;m ready for bed and am getting ready to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a jar of CDLM but could not bring myself to use it very often because it cost so much.  </li>
            <li>And I purchased it through their website, so it should have been the real product, but if the real product has a spoon with it, this package did not.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t really buy the whole, &#x27;</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Oh, really?  </li>
            <li>Really they are.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, it does seem somewhat shiny/greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really doubt if there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into my background and sound like a total pompous jerk</li>
            <li>but I really think they are just trying to sensationalize a story and discredit La Mer.  </li>
            <li>For the expensive ones, many are quite nice</li>
            <li>Smooth, clear, soft, no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am 42 years old black woman with very good skin, that is not boast: it is to set the scene for the fact that, I believe, this cream is very good for people who have who age badly, e.g. if you see lines that are not laughter lines in your 20s or early 30s.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bothered with trying the other products; I figure those are marketed and sold based on the famous name.</li>
            <li>Even the actual cream jar looks as though it is not the original product.  </li>
            <li>Well, look at virtually every cream, especially the department store brands, and they fall all over themselves to continually introduce a \\&quot;new and better and more magical\\&quot; concoction, usually featuring some herb, vitamin, or whatever.  </li>
            <li>and I felt that it improved the look and feel of my skin by reducing fine lines, evening skin tone and helping me to retain moisture throughout the day (and my skin is kinda dry)</li>
            <li>This makes the cream easy to apply since it is so thick and rich.</li>
            <li>as far as the real procuct sold in various retail venues, it is unique.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product more consistently for 6 months and small wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li>However, after three months of using this product my skin has improved tremendously, and I have been getting several compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered another, larger jar.  </li>
            <li>Even just a tiny dab makes a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>the older you are and</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t ever do anything particularly \\&quot;magical\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>i was actually shopping both for more at a discount and also to save tax the last day of no tax shipping to california.</li>
            <li>I like high end cosmetics, however, they must deliver.  </li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t think my skin particularly needs at this age; a bit like a 20 year old having Botox, you can do it, but do you really need it?</li>
            <li>I tend to use it In the winter months, when the weather is particularly harsh, and my work place heating dries my skin out more.</li>
            <li>I use that one during the day, it&#x27;s lovely and not as heavy, and if I don&#x27;t feel I need the heavier one, I use it at night too.  </li>
            <li>Who knows if the current mass produced version is really the same as the original \\&quot;artisinal\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel like it has never been worn before--like you have brand new</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, if this this is the only product I use on my face, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I suspect very young women with oily skin would not like La Mer</li>
            <li>Most you can buy in small inexpensive quantities I wonder if someone can make it at home.</li>
            <li>the majority of ingredients are the same) but most creams do have the same ingredients as they are in the same consistency category of‚Ä¶.A CREAM.  </li>
            <li>I put out more than $90 for two small samples.  </li>
            <li>My face is incredibly clear with the product and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly noticeable if I use it before bed and then look at myself in the morning.</li>
            <li>my skin was so sensitive to the salt).</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30</li>
            <li>there is NO dead skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m not to that point.  </li>
            <li>everything* your whole cabinet of elixirs, creams, potions and goopy topical agents do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All it did for me was make my eyes tear up and cause redness near the eyes.</li>
            <li>that* overpriced for what it does to my skin and what it offers.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seen my 31 year old daughter since I started using product.</li>
            <li>Mer has mineral oil&amp;#34; - mineral oil has a bad rap for various reasons but there are many different grades of mineral oil and most of it is absolutely harmless and does not clog pores or harm the skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Major improvements!</li>
            <li>Nivea makes a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; cream for roughly the same price, 5.8 ounces for $6, and it is very much like the new La Mer softer version.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare the German one, but really, why wouldn&#x27;t the formula be the same no matter where it&#x27;s made?  </li>
            <li>I recently moved to Australia and with the stress of the move and living in a very high UV place, my skin was dry, flaky, and it just felt old.  </li>
            <li>even though i live in a tropical area i have extremely dehydrated skin to the point that if i dont moisturize enough i get rash on my forehead (i dont drink much water</li>
            <li>I can only tell you this about Creme de la Mer: I&#x27;ve used it since my early 30s; I&#x27;m 43 now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m mistaken constantly for still being in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This face cream is so far above everything else on the market</li>
            <li>I am only in my early thirties</li>
            <li>wine - packaging, marketing and reputation/status are used to appeal to the customer rather than straight quality and the cost is mostly arbitrary.</li>
            <li>simply because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Make sure you put a little dab in your hand and close your palm in order to heat the cream a little.</li>
            <li>It is not good to keep cosmetics too long, and I would rather purchase the smaller amount more frequently.</li>
            <li>but I have to testify that it really was something of a miracle worker in our extreme time of need!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, I&#x27;ve tried those other products that some have previously mentioned such as Eucerin Q10, Strivectin, B. Kamins Chemist (my 2nd favorite).  </li>
            <li>Yes - you&#x27;re paying for marketing and for some major paychecks to the celebs that campaign for them, which I can totally understand why people would be miffed over it.  </li>
            <li>The creme itself if a little pricey, but heals dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I battle frequent dry spots and flakiness.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been trying a variety of good but less expensive face creams...</li>

            <li> Nivea works beautifully for some people and that&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a very good product, but too costly and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for sagging skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very good and also protected my skin against Rosacea.</li>

            <li> and I remembered how great it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, the best part is how your skin feels on your face after applying it.</li>
            <li> La Mer is a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> It does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product.</li>
            <li> La Mer worked out really good for me...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always tried to take really good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a maintenance good cream.</li>
            <li> During the warmer months I find the sun does for me what the cream seems to do in the winter months, make me feel i look good without the need for makeup.  </li>
            <li> It does feel good, and seems to overcome life&#x27;s visible imperfections, colds, stress, etc.</li>
            <li> A very good product, very quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy as a clam that I don&#x27;t have to pine away for La Mer any more because Nivea truly is a twin to La Mer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 64, and my skin is every bit as nice as someone with good skin in their 40&#x27;s, even perhaps 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I Love Creme de La Mer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Customer service is very good, it worth to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 18 years now, and I have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li> It works for every kind of skin.</li>
            <li> Tocoferyl Succinate is the most effective form of Vitamin E, which is good.    </li>
            <li> If my skin is irritated for whatever reason, La Mer is soothing to put on overnight, and that&#x27;s what I liked it for:  </li>
            <li> They harvest their own sea kelp just as Chanel harvests their own batch of lavender from a farmer in the south of France.  </li>
            <li> It will be nice to put expiration date on the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> think this is a great cream and, for me, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used to cure my flaky and dry skin in the winter and keep me glowing in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to buy the 1 ounce jar.  </li>
            <li> , Hollywood actresses use (must be great, right?).  </li>
            <li> If you want to buy into the hype, all the department store brands ALSO produce the familiar drug store brands, which while not identical, are every bit as good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything will magically change your skin by itself.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my face looks and can&#x27;t imagine living without this product.</li>
            <li> It kills the faster growing cancer cells -- but it also wreaks havoc on the healthy cells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to buy more</li>
            <li> I LOVE every La Mer product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> at 63 the wrinkles in my neck (from my perspective) look even better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I found plenty of these ingredients over the internet, most on makingcosmetics.com as well as on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Basically, I love this cream for the winter.</li>
            <li> I saw more improvement in 48 hrs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit suspicious that while I liked this cream, it had a huge amount of \\&quot;myth\\&quot; built up around it, celebrities buy it and tout its wonders, and the magazines are always praising it.  </li>
            <li> They moisturize, some better than others.  </li>
            <li> i love the product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> and she said, \\&quot;funny I was just about to comment on how good your skin</li>
            <li> Not all the fine lines are gone, but my skin feels really hydrated, elastic, and bright.    </li>
            <li> The vendor delivered this very quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> I strongly disagree.  </li>
            <li> It has a \\&quot;magic broth\\&quot; made from special seaweed.  </li>
            <li> The contour of my skin, my pore size, the texture and tone, the moisture levels, the fine lines - all of it is improved.</li>
            <li> Adequate collagen helps your skin stay more youthful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordered what I thought were free trial samples.</li>
            <li> Beyond using Retin A at night, the key to good skin is:  always wear good sunscreen and never allow burning, give up on having a tan, never go to a tanning salon, don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink much, and moisturize moisturize moisturize.  </li>
            <li> The best thing you can do for your skin, especially if you are 45 or older, is get a doctor&#x27;s prescription for Retin A or Renova.  </li>
            <li> If you have to place all of your eggs in one basket place them in the original Cr&amp;egrave;me de La Mer formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of an ultra rich, heavier moisturizer that had a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Because this cream is so wonderfully rich</li>
            <li> do believe that my CDLM was the original version from Max Huber labs (says so on the bottom) -- before it was taken over.  </li>
            <li> So, yes, I would buy this, and I would buy it more than once if it didn&#x27;t meet your expectations the first time around (assuming you have the money of course).  </li>
            <li> It took a while for it to arrive and when it did the original packaging of the cream looked sketchy.  </li>
            <li> At dinner the other night, I started to tell her I bought some overpriced but beautifully fragranced and formulated (smooth creamy) product</li>
            <li> La Mer by far, has been the BEST, quickest acting, line smoothing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for your face if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> There have been critiques of very respected people such as Paula Begoun stating that this is actually a pretty old fashioned formulation with nothing especially magical about it, and no, that seaweed broth isn&#x27;t any more mystical and magical than anthing else out there.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks bright and younger.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it&#x27;s much cheaper in US</li>
            <li> sweet almond) seed meal, Sodium Gluconate, Potassium Gluconate,  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think I would stick with it after one jar full, but, forget about it</li>
            <li> I am a thirty six-year old year-old woman with pretty good genes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone---I cannot find another cr√®me that is as  successful as this one for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got the money and want beautiful skin, I highly recommend purchasing the La Mer cream (unless you&#x27;re younger than 35).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes we get lucky, we take a chance, we find something we like.</li>
            <li> My face looks as fresh and line free at 9:30 p.m. as it did at 6:30 a.m. when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but felt like this time I should.  </li>
            <li> - the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice.</li>
            <li> I just happened to remember that I had a tiny jar of CDLM and that it had been invented by a NASA scientist to treat his own burns.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Since my early 20&#x27;s, I had used facial products from Shiseido, which was great for my skin.  </li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li> so maybe the differences between the two becomes more marked</li>
            <li> So far, I have yet to find one that does (and I&#x27;ve used Murad, Strivectin, Kinerase, Perricone and many others).  </li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but I was so impressed with La Mer&#x27;s Creme de la Mer that I wanted to put in a good word for it after seeing all the negative reviews.    </li>
            <li> The cream is very good value for me as one 30ml jar will last me a long time - 3/4months</li>
            <li> If the price was just a little lower, they would so many more loyal customers.</li>
            <li> First, I believe (and of course I could be wrong)this product is mostly for middle-aged, or mature adults.</li>
            <li> I just use the classic, original formula face cream.</li>
            <li> Do these things starting as young as you can, and you will have great skin when you are older.  </li>
            <li> but as a cosmetic junkie and research scientist I&#x27;ve put my ability to think critically and research the heck out of nearly everything I eat or put on my body into good use.  </li>
            <li> I hoped to find something very much like Creme de la Mer</li>
            <li> I think when reading the negative reviews these are people for whom no face cream makes them happy because they&#x27;re literally looking for a miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would pay this much for a moisturizer, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Do you knowthat the German version of Nivea cream has many of these ingredients?</li>
            <li> , I may use more than necessary.</li>
            <li> First recommendation</li>
            <li> it on your fingers first just like La Mer.  </li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶.I think is pretty kick</li>
            <li> Blemishes clear much faster, and scars/sun damage/uneven tone improve very quickly.</li>
            <li> As for it being thick and greasy, um, well sure, because it&#x27;s a super rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just occasionally try out high end products to see if they do anything better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> shouldn&#x27;t the trail period be long enough to make a good evaluation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, which permanently erased a large age spot.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of a certain age....</li>
            <li> Nivea has been around for ages, and I suspect that when Dr. Huber was formulating his cream, he might have started with a formula like Nivea&#x27;s as it was a very popular and widely used cream long</li>
            <li> It is sold for a very very high cost that people are convinced to pay as a result of buying into all the marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I use La Mer it literally lasts all day long--until I&#x27;m ready for bed and am getting ready to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a jar of CDLM but could not bring myself to use it very often because it cost so much.  </li>
            <li> And I purchased it through their website, so it should have been the real product, but if the real product has a spoon with it, this package did not.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t really buy the whole, &#x27;</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Oh, really?  </li>
            <li> Really they are.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, it does seem somewhat shiny/greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really doubt if there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into my background and sound like a total pompous jerk</li>
            <li> but I really think they are just trying to sensationalize a story and discredit La Mer.  </li>
            <li> For the expensive ones, many are quite nice</li>
            <li> Smooth, clear, soft, no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I am 42 years old black woman with very good skin, that is not boast: it is to set the scene for the fact that, I believe, this cream is very good for people who have who age badly, e.g. if you see lines that are not laughter lines in your 20s or early 30s.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bothered with trying the other products; I figure those are marketed and sold based on the famous name.</li>
            <li> Even the actual cream jar looks as though it is not the original product.  </li>
            <li> Well, look at virtually every cream, especially the department store brands, and they fall all over themselves to continually introduce a \\&quot;new and better and more magical\\&quot; concoction, usually featuring some herb, vitamin, or whatever.  </li>
            <li> and I felt that it improved the look and feel of my skin by reducing fine lines, evening skin tone and helping me to retain moisture throughout the day (and my skin is kinda dry)</li>
            <li> This makes the cream easy to apply since it is so thick and rich.</li>
            <li> as far as the real procuct sold in various retail venues, it is unique.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product more consistently for 6 months and small wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li> However, after three months of using this product my skin has improved tremendously, and I have been getting several compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I quickly ordered another, larger jar.  </li>
            <li> Even just a tiny dab makes a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> the older you are and</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t ever do anything particularly \\&quot;magical\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> i was actually shopping both for more at a discount and also to save tax the last day of no tax shipping to california.</li>
            <li> I like high end cosmetics, however, they must deliver.  </li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t think my skin particularly needs at this age; a bit like a 20 year old having Botox, you can do it, but do you really need it?</li>
            <li> I tend to use it In the winter months, when the weather is particularly harsh, and my work place heating dries my skin out more.</li>
            <li> I use that one during the day, it&#x27;s lovely and not as heavy, and if I don&#x27;t feel I need the heavier one, I use it at night too.  </li>
            <li> Who knows if the current mass produced version is really the same as the original \\&quot;artisinal\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel like it has never been worn before--like you have brand new</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, if this this is the only product I use on my face, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I suspect very young women with oily skin would not like La Mer</li>
            <li> Most you can buy in small inexpensive quantities I wonder if someone can make it at home.</li>
            <li> the majority of ingredients are the same) but most creams do have the same ingredients as they are in the same consistency category of‚Ä¶.A CREAM.  </li>
            <li> I put out more than $90 for two small samples.  </li>
            <li> My face is incredibly clear with the product and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly noticeable if I use it before bed and then look at myself in the morning.</li>
            <li> my skin was so sensitive to the salt).</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30</li>
            <li> there is NO dead skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not to that point.  </li>
            <li> everything* your whole cabinet of elixirs, creams, potions and goopy topical agents do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All it did for me was make my eyes tear up and cause redness near the eyes.</li>
            <li> that* overpriced for what it does to my skin and what it offers.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nowhere near the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seen my 31 year old daughter since I started using product.</li>
            <li> Mer has mineral oil&amp;#34; - mineral oil has a bad rap for various reasons but there are many different grades of mineral oil and most of it is absolutely harmless and does not clog pores or harm the skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Major improvements!</li>
            <li> Nivea makes a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; cream for roughly the same price, 5.8 ounces for $6, and it is very much like the new La Mer softer version.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare the German one, but really, why wouldn&#x27;t the formula be the same no matter where it&#x27;s made?  </li>
            <li> I recently moved to Australia and with the stress of the move and living in a very high UV place, my skin was dry, flaky, and it just felt old.  </li>
            <li> even though i live in a tropical area i have extremely dehydrated skin to the point that if i dont moisturize enough i get rash on my forehead (i dont drink much water</li>
            <li> I can only tell you this about Creme de la Mer: I&#x27;ve used it since my early 30s; I&#x27;m 43 now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mistaken constantly for still being in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This face cream is so far above everything else on the market</li>
            <li> I am only in my early thirties</li>
            <li> wine - packaging, marketing and reputation/status are used to appeal to the customer rather than straight quality and the cost is mostly arbitrary.</li>
            <li> simply because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Make sure you put a little dab in your hand and close your palm in order to heat the cream a little.</li>
            <li> It is not good to keep cosmetics too long, and I would rather purchase the smaller amount more frequently.</li>
            <li> but I have to testify that it really was something of a miracle worker in our extreme time of need!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;ve tried those other products that some have previously mentioned such as Eucerin Q10, Strivectin, B. Kamins Chemist (my 2nd favorite).  </li>
            <li> Yes - you&#x27;re paying for marketing and for some major paychecks to the celebs that campaign for them, which I can totally understand why people would be miffed over it.  </li>
            <li> The creme itself if a little pricey, but heals dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I battle frequent dry spots and flakiness.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been trying a variety of good but less expensive face creams...</li>
            <li> In years past, I tried this Creme de la Mer, largely because of all the hype on it.  </li>
            <li> But few people can afford to live on La Mer for years and years.    </li>
            <li> I have combination skin - some dry, yet very oily in the T-zone, and some breakouts usually around my chin.</li>
            <li> I use very very little of the cr&amp;egrave;me because of the high cost.  </li>
            <li> I still love my Eminence and my trusty Ponds cold cream.  </li>
            <li> So it was just in my medicine cabinet for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Called the company and they will give me a partial refund only.  </li>
            <li> and I mean MAJOR difference between the less expensive creams and say La Mer is that by the end of the day the fine lines, creases and crows feet are VERY noticeable, as is the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop due to the financial burden of grad school.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit so it can last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Basically it cost me the same amount as any other night cream that I would buy, I would say it&#x27;s costing me around ¬£20 or ¬£30 a month to use.  </li>
            <li> I have read hundreds of reviews (here and on other sites) and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of other reviews stating that La Mer is almost the same as using Eucerin Q10 cream.  </li>
            <li> The key is to use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> A week in a half later they charged $87.63 to my card.  </li>
            <li> and then I put a tiny little dab of this stuff on my fingers, rub them together to get the Creme to melt a bit</li>
            <li> Hard to break old habits.</li>
            <li> Also was curious if the Limolene, Geraniol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal and Citronellol are used as fragrance, as well as Citral (lemon balm).    </li>
            <li> when I use the less expensive creams, yes they seem to do the same thing as the more expensive creams, the MAJOR</li>
            <li> Yes they share quite a few of the same ingredients (not a lot and certainly not</li>
            <li> I have been using the La Mer cream on and off for the past 8 years since my mid 20s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use foundation or any other face make up.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s genetics, nutrition, toxins, water intake, amongst other things.  </li>
            <li> One other thing ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even compare it to other &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was heavily skeptical and I was converted on the spot.</li>
            <li> Takes away scars in addition to all other blemishes.</li>
            <li> other brands I&#x27;d tried weren&#x27;t as soothing and moisturizing overnight.  </li>
            <li> Be VERY careful.</li>
            <li> i mix it with a drop of active vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> The price is truly ridiculous, but a few years back I got a couple of one-ounce jars for a hundred ten at the time, and once I had a two-ounce jar that was a savings over two of the one ounce sizes, but due to price and the economy, I haven&#x27;t bought one for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I never take the time to write a review, but I just had to after seeing several negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really fix skin that has decades of damage with mere creams and lotions, it&#x27;s not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are people that swear up and down</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other products but my skin breaks out or looks dull and dry.</li>
            <li> Years ago a respected elder told me not to waste time on any of the other (cheaper) brands of face cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know sometimes whether any product will live up to its claims (mostly not) or the price (mostly not).</li>
            <li> and i sleep much less than i should).</li>
            <li> &quot; version, thinking maybe the cream was a bit too heavy for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Throw out the cheaper brands, get rid of the harsh crud, stop fighting your skin and give it something to feast on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used La Mer for a few years.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few months and have been using the Eucerin product for years before and after that.  </li>
            <li> For me, I find that I don&#x27;t need to use it all year round.</li>
            <li> I have been using La Mer for a few years.</li>
            <li> So - onto a few points about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced?  </li>
            <li> gave La Mer 2 stars entirely due to the utterly ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars though because it&#x27;s so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way past that point with La Mer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way past that point with La Mer.</li>
            <li> I use the soft cream in the Spring/Summer months and this Creme in the cold midwest Fall/Winter months.  </li>
            <li> sadly, the la mer product that i received was not the same as any that i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other comments saying that while it&#x27;s expensive you&#x27;ll use less.  </li>
            <li> But no - save your hard earned cash</li>
            <li> I do recommend using it at night because it&#x27;s thick and oily.</li>
            <li> The texture is really thick (like desitin)</li>
            <li> This company is setting its users up for failure.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night, very small amount, you \\&quot;warm\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Alcohol Denaturated is not a good alcohol for the face.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the current price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their very expensive skin lotion has made my skin so subtle that the woman who does my pedicure now can&#x27;t get any dead skin off my feet</li>
            <li> continue to use it with the essential oil of lavandar, but I hate the taxe thing in France T_T</li>
            <li> After just using it for one week, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Efudex is not for the faint of heart -- takes courage to put yourself through the regimen.  </li>
            <li> Way over priced, and I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I purchased my La mer at Nordstrom, so I doubt I received the fake La Mer.</li>
            <li> this basically an expensive version of Nivea?&amp;#34; - I hear this all of the time and it makes me want to scream.  </li>
            <li> He had been skeptical but also desperate.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li> People are shocked to hear my age.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that I had a nasty cold and felt like #%)(@$ - this was quite a product endorsement.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife has been trying a variety of good but less expensive face creams... Knowing she was about to run out I bought her this and she couldn&#x27;t have been happier. Seems like once you&#x27;ve experienced &#x27;la mer&#x27;, nothing else compares. Her skin looks great and I haven&#x27;t heard a sigh in weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using the La Mer cream on and off for the past 8 years since my mid 20s. I had to stop due to the financial burden of grad school. My skin is smoother and brighter every time I use the product. I have been using this product more consistently for 6 months and small wrinkles are disappearing. I have tried to use other products but my skin breaks out or looks dull and dry. On a recent trip to Hawaii, my face was left wind burnt and salt water burnt  my skin was so sensitive to the salt). When I got home, I used the cream immediately, the redness and flakiness when away about 75 %. I decided to go to the store and the ladies gave me a sample of the serum which seemed to repair my skin over night.   As far as I&#x27;m concerned, if this this is the only product I use on my face, it&#x27;s worth it. I don&#x27;t use foundation or any other face make up.  I Love Creme de La Mer!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but felt like this time I should.  La Mer by far, has been the BEST, quickest acting, line smoothing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have read hundreds of reviews (here and on other sites) and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of other reviews stating that La Mer is almost the same as using Eucerin Q10 cream.  I strongly disagree.  First, I believe (and of course I could be wrong)this product is mostly for middle-aged, or mature adults. Second, I&#x27;ve tried those other products that some have previously mentioned such as Eucerin Q10, Strivectin, B. Kamins Chemist (my 2nd favorite).  Finally, in my opinion the difference is this, when I use the less expensive creams, yes they seem to do the same thing as the more expensive creams, the MAJOR and I mean MAJOR difference between the less expensive creams and say La Mer is that by the end of the day the fine lines, creases and crows feet are VERY noticeable, as is the dry skin.  However, when I use La Mer it literally lasts all day long--until I&#x27;m ready for bed and am getting ready to wash my face.  It truly does amaze me in this regard.  My face looks as fresh and line free at 9:30 p.m. as it did at 6:30 a.m. when I first put it on.  That is never the case with the cheaper creams and is not even the case when I use my Strivectin which I used to swear by.  If you&#x27;ve got the money and want beautiful skin, I highly recommend purchasing the La Mer cream (unless you&#x27;re younger than 35).  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I think the cream here is getting flack for not miraculously changing people&#x27;s skin.  I don&#x27;t think anything will magically change your skin by itself.  That&#x27;s genetics, nutrition, toxins, water intake, amongst other things.  But as a moistureizer it&#x27;s fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is gold in a jar for the 30+ crowd and any sun God or Goddess out there. Buy it. That&#x27;s all I have to say. If you have to place all of your eggs in one basket place them in the original Cr&amp;egrave;me de La Mer formula. It&#x27;s pricey, but for 50 and under you only need it once a day. For the 50-sih Plus crowd, the hydration is unparalleled. You will feel and see the difference. Not Greasy. It&#x27;s like silk.</li>
            <li> No cmplaints except price.</li>
            <li> Women have such emotional expectations of face products. I think when reading the negative reviews these are people for whom no face cream makes them happy because they&#x27;re literally looking for a miracle in a jar. I can only tell you this about Creme de la Mer: I&#x27;ve used it since my early 30s; I&#x27;m 43 now and I&#x27;m mistaken constantly for still being in my early 30&#x27;s. People are shocked to hear my age. As for it being thick and greasy, um, well sure, because it&#x27;s a super rich moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be anything but that. I&#x27;ve never heard of an ultra rich, heavier moisturizer that had a matte finish. I&#x27;d be suspicious of the ingredients if so. Because this cream is so wonderfully rich it is the only cream I&#x27;ve ever used that keeps my face from peeling in Winter or when I need to use an acne medication. I&#x27;m a fan of Creme de la Mer for life. I haven&#x27;t bothered with trying the other products; I figure those are marketed and sold based on the famous name. I just use the classic, original formula face cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it&#x27;s much cheaper in US lol&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it with the essential oil of lavandar, but I hate the taxe thing in France T_T</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0013V1TLE La Mer by LA MER La Mer Creme de La Mer--/1OZ]]    I never take the time to write a review, but I just had to after seeing several negative reviews on this product. I am a thirty six-year old year-old woman with pretty good genes. Nevertheless, I recently started to notice my skin losing elasticity, and I also discovered a couple of wrinkles on my forehead.  Initially, when I started to use this product, I did not see any improvements. However, after three months of using this product my skin has improved tremendously, and I have been getting several compliments on my skin. I love the way my face looks and can&#x27;t imagine living without this product. I do recommend using it at night because it&#x27;s thick and oily.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  WRONG! IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin. My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product. I even tried the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; version, thinking maybe the cream was a bit too heavy for my skin.  But no - save your hard earned cash - the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  I use very very little of the cr&amp;egrave;me because of the high cost.  However, it arrived protected in box ,and despite the cost, perhaps I&#x27;ll order some again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a jar of CDLM but could not bring myself to use it very often because it cost so much.  So it was just in my medicine cabinet for a long time.  My husband had actinic keratosis.  His physician prescribed Efudex which is a topical chemotherapy (F-5-Flouroracil).  It has to be applied every day for several weeks.  It kills the faster growing cancer cells -- but it also wreaks havoc on the healthy cells.  At the end of two weeks my husband had lesions that were red and even weeping, like burns.  At this point he was told to stop and use cortisone cream, but the cortisone did nothing.  He was in agony from the pain.  I just happened to remember that I had a tiny jar of CDLM and that it had been invented by a NASA scientist to treat his own burns.  I gave the tiny jar to my husband and he just slathered it on.  He had been skeptical but also desperate.  Well, it stopped the pain almost immediately and very shortly after the redness started abating.  The jar had almost been emptied!  I quickly ordered another, larger jar.  Now, several years later, I still have just the tiniest bit remaining in that second jar and I use it for emergencies if I have redness or irritation.  It still seems to work.  I&#x27;m not going to buy more but I have to testify that it really was something of a miracle worker in our extreme time of need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that my CDLM was the original version from Max Huber labs (says so on the bottom) -- before it was taken over.  Who knows if the current mass produced version is really the same as the original \\&quot;artisinal\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my husband&#x27;s face healed beautifully and the actinic keratosis is gone.  Efudex is not for the faint of heart -- takes courage to put yourself through the regimen.  But it works.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30 and I have used almost every commercial brand moisturizer...even though i live in a tropical area i have extremely dehydrated skin to the point that if i dont moisturize enough i get rash on my forehead (i dont drink much water and i sleep much less than i should). La Mer worked out really good for me...my skin looks bright and younger. The texture is really thick (like desitin) so what i do is i mix it with a drop of active vitamin c serum so i can apply it easier. I think its worth the price.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would pay this much for a moisturizer, but it is worth every penny. La Mer rejuvenates your skin giving it that plumped up youthful look that you never appreciate until you lose it. Even just a tiny dab makes a tremendous difference. Make sure you put a little dab in your hand and close your palm in order to heat the cream a little. This makes the cream easy to apply since it is so thick and rich.</li>
            <li> I have been using La Mer for about 6 months (I order it thru Neiman Marcus) and I recently found that it is cheaper here.  It&#x27;s time for me to sign up for Prime just so I can purchase this cheaper.  I LOVE every La Mer product I&#x27;ve tried.  My face is incredibly clear with the product and at 63 the wrinkles in my neck (from my perspective) look even better.  I started with this product and I&#x27;ve branched out the point that I&#x27;m now using about 30% of their products and every one causes me to try another in the line.  Their skin refining product I use in the shower and would not give it up.  Their very expensive skin lotion has made my skin so subtle that the woman who does my pedicure now can&#x27;t get any dead skin off my feet bc there is NO dead skin.  So, yes, I would buy this, and I would buy it more than once if it didn&#x27;t meet your expectations the first time around (assuming you have the money of course).  One other thing ... I&#x27;ve read other comments saying that while it&#x27;s expensive you&#x27;ll use less.  So far I&#x27;m not to that point.  At 63 I have a habit of using X amount and I expect that will continue.  Hard to break old habits.</li>
            <li> Not the same formulation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but I was so impressed with La Mer&#x27;s Creme de la Mer that I wanted to put in a good word for it after seeing all the negative reviews.    I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve always tried to take really good care of my skin.  Since my early 20&#x27;s, I had used facial products from Shiseido, which was great for my skin.  I recently moved to Australia and with the stress of the move and living in a very high UV place, my skin was dry, flaky, and it just felt old.  My mom had given me a sample of La Mer&#x27;s Creme a while back and I remembered how great it felt on my skin.  So, I sucked it up and bought a 2oz bottle.  After just using it for one week, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my skin.  Not all the fine lines are gone, but my skin feels really hydrated, elastic, and bright.    I realise there is no miracle in a bottle, but this is the closest thing.  I only gave it four stars though because it&#x27;s so expensive.  If the price was just a little lower, they would so many more loyal customers.</li>
            <li> This face cream is so far above everything else on the market I can&#x27;t even compare it to other &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;. Years ago a respected elder told me not to waste time on any of the other (cheaper) brands of face cream. This stuff does *everything* your whole cabinet of elixirs, creams, potions and goopy topical agents do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face (with a Clarisonic) and then I put a tiny little dab of this stuff on my fingers, rub them together to get the Creme to melt a bit and then I just *press* it into my skin. The contour of my skin, my pore size, the texture and tone, the moisture levels, the fine lines - all of it is improved. You can see it happen, immediate results. The scent is divine. The texture is indulgent. It works for every kind of skin. I have combination skin - some dry, yet very oily in the T-zone, and some breakouts usually around my chin. La Mer managed to make a product that improves all of my skin concerns. Blemishes clear much faster, and scars/sun damage/uneven tone improve very quickly. It&#x27;s clearly noticeable if I use it before bed and then look at myself in the morning. Major improvements! To be honest, the best part is how your skin feels on your face after applying it. The first time I tried it I was heavily skeptical and I was converted on the spot. It makes your face feel like it has never been worn before--like you have brand new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s pricey--don&#x27;t be turned off by that. Jettison everything else you&#x27;re wasting money on and just get this. Throw out the cheaper brands, get rid of the harsh crud, stop fighting your skin and give it something to feast on. Over the course my adult life, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on a lot of crappy products, skin or otherwise. It&#x27;s hard to know sometimes whether any product will live up to its claims (mostly not) or the price (mostly not). This is an incredible product. IT IS WORTH THE EXPENSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we get lucky, we take a chance, we find something we like. I&#x27;m way past that point with La Mer. This product is a winner above all others. Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.I&#x27;m way past that point with La Mer. This product is a winner above all others. Wonderful investment that will make you feel good and will actually do good for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream.  Makes wrinkles go away and tightens face.  I recommend it to all ages.  Takes away scars in addition to all other blemishes.</li>
            <li> I started calling to cancel, only to be left on hold &amp;#34;waiting for the next customer service prepresentative&amp;#34; for 10-15 minutes each time.  Granted I was trying to call from work BECAUSE they are not open on the weekends.  so I finally got thru today and was told that they had already charged my card for $85 on Friday because I didn&#x27;t call in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said that I had just received the product and was within the 14 days.  did you read the terms?&amp;#34; the woman with an attitude in her voice asked and I said yes I have 14 days to try the product before I am charged.  the trial period is for 14 days which start WHEN YOU PLACE THE ORDER.  it took them a week to deliver my product so I had one week to try.  Then she said I should have called in for an extension - why would I have to do that?  shouldn&#x27;t the trail period be long enough to make a good evaluation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product states that it takes 4-6 weeks to see results.  This company is setting its users up for failure.  spend your money else where!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before but never from Amazon.  It took a while for it to arrive and when it did the original packaging of the cream looked sketchy.  Even the actual cream jar looks as though it is not the original product.  Will not ever order from a non-reputable vendor again.  Next time I will actually purchase from Neiman Marcus or Bloomingdale&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Listen up ladies.  I like high end cosmetics, however, they must deliver.  This product does not.  Way over priced, and I&#x27;m not impressed.  I have used, Kiehl&#x27;s Creme D&#x27;Elegance Repairateur for years.  I wanted to try something that is all the rave, Hollywood actresses use (must be great, right?).  Well, it isn&#x27;t.  Went back to Kiehl&#x27;s.  Save your money.  By the way, I purchased my La mer at Nordstrom, so I doubt I received the fake La Mer.</li>
            <li> Be VERY careful. Their trial package is for 14 days and then you get billed $86!  The message about that is UNDER the mailing label.  All it did for me was make my eyes tear up and cause redness near the eyes. I&#x27;ll stay with my Olay!  Called the company and they will give me a partial refund only.  I would NOT recommend it. And I purchased it through their website, so it should have been the real product, but if the real product has a spoon with it, this package did not.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Was shipped well.</li>
            <li> The vendor delivered this very quickly and packaged well.  The creme itself if a little pricey, but heals dry skin quickly.  You only need to use a little bit so it can last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to buy the 1 ounce jar.  It is not good to keep cosmetics too long, and I would rather purchase the smaller amount more frequently.</li>
            <li> These are the ingredients of Creme de La Mer in proper order):  Seaweed (Algae) Extract, Mineral oil (liquid paraffin), Petrolatum, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Citrus aurantifolia(lime) extract, Microcrystaline  Wax,  Lanolin Alcohol, Sesamum indicum (sesame)oil, Eucalyptus leaf oil(eucalyptus globulus), Magnesium sulfate,  Sesamum indicul (sesame) seed,  Medicago sativa (alfafa) seed powder, Helianthus Annuus (sunflower) seed cake, Prunus Amigdalus Dulcis (sweet almond) seed meal, Sodium Gluconate, Potassium Gluconate,  Copper gluconate, calcium gluconate, magnesium gluconate, zinc gluconate, paraffin, tocopherol succinate, niacin, Beta-carotene, Decyl Oleate, Aluminum Distearate, Octyldodecanol, Citric Acid, Cyanocobalamim, Magnesium Stearate, Panthenol, Limolene, Geraniol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Citral, Methylchloroisothiazoline, Methylisothiazolinone, Alcohol Denat, Fragrance ILN30769    I found plenty of these ingredients over the internet, most on makingcosmetics.com as well as on Amazon. Most you can buy in small inexpensive quantities I wonder if someone can make it at home. Let me know.  I would avoid the last ingredients though. They are toxic, but here they are added as last ingredients of the list. Methylchloroisothiazoline and Methylisothiazolinone (together added and known as \\&quot;Kathon CG\\&quot;) - control microbial growth and they add just one drop to 55 gallons!!! Alcohol Denaturated is not a good alcohol for the face. Lanolin alcohol and Decyl Oleate can clog pores.  Magnesium Sulfate is used in Epsom Salts. Tocoferyl Succinate is the most effective form of Vitamin E, which is good.    I was wondering why they use Sodium Gluconate,Potassium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate,Calcium Gluconate, Magnesium Gluconate and Zinc Gluconate? Why not another form of these minerals.  Also was curious if the Limolene, Geraniol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal and Citronellol are used as fragrance, as well as Citral (lemon balm).    Do you knowthat the German version of Nivea cream has many of these ingredients? Check them out:  Water, Mineral Oil (liquid paraffin), Microcrystaline wax, Glycerin, Lanolin Alcohol, Paraffin, Panthenol, Decyl oleate, Octyldodecanol, Aluminum Distearate, Citric Acid, Magnesium sulfate, Magnesium stearate, Fragrance(parfum), Limonene, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate instead of Benzyl Salicylate(in La Mer), Cynnamyl Alcohol (instead of Alcohol Denat. (in La Mer)    Some say Creme de La Mer and the German version of Nivea even have similar smell.    I&#x27;ve used La Mer for a few years. It&#x27;s definitely a very good product, but too costly and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for sagging skin. It makes your skin feel very good and also protected my skin against Rosacea. But it&#x27;s not a miracle cream. It&#x27;s just a maintenance good cream. I still think it&#x27;s one of the best I used on my face. But few people can afford to live on La Mer for years and years.    [...]</li>
            <li> La Mer is a great moisturizer and I felt that it improved the look and feel of my skin by reducing fine lines, evening skin tone and helping me to retain moisture throughout the day (and my skin is kinda dry) but I wouldn&#x27;t classify this item as a miracle cream.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of info on this product and it seems like any dermatologist that gets asked about it says the clients with the best skin always confess to using it.  However, it&#x27;s very expensive and I feel like I get close to the same results with a $10 jar of Eucerin Q10 Creme.  I am only in my early thirties so maybe the differences between the two becomes more marked the older you are and the longer you use it.  I used it for a few months and have been using the Eucerin product for years before and after that.  I just occasionally try out high end products to see if they do anything better for my skin.  So far, I have yet to find one that does (and I&#x27;ve used Murad, Strivectin, Kinerase, Perricone and many others).  So, I don&#x27;t really buy the whole, &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; mentality.  I think cosmetics might be a lot like wine - packaging, marketing and reputation/status are used to appeal to the customer rather than straight quality and the cost is mostly arbitrary.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old black woman with very good skin, that is not boast: it is to set the scene for the fact that, I believe, this cream is very good for people who have who age badly, e.g. if you see lines that are not laughter lines in your 20s or early 30s.  For me, I find that I don&#x27;t need to use it all year round. I tend to use it In the winter months, when the weather is particularly harsh, and my work place heating dries my skin out more. The cream is very good value for me as one 30ml jar will last me a long time - 3/4months generally, I only have to use it at night and I could stretch it longer, I may use more than necessary. I really don&#x27;t get the applicator.  During the warmer months I find the sun does for me what the cream seems to do in the winter months, make me feel i look good without the need for makeup.  Basically it cost me the same amount as any other night cream that I would buy, I would say it&#x27;s costing me around ¬£20 or ¬£30 a month to use.  Basically, I love this cream for the winter. My only concern, is that the cream is doing something to my skin that I don&#x27;t think my skin particularly needs at this age; a bit like a 20 year old having Botox, you can do it, but do you really need it?</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, which permanently erased a large age spot. I&#x27;m hoping it will do this again. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just do do not see what the fuss is about. if you want something that will DRASTICALLY change your skin - make it glow and remove wrinkles scars and blemishes - look into sea buckthorn oil and capsules. I saw more improvement in 48 hrs w that than 3 months of la mer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone---I cannot find another cr√®me that is as  successful as this one for my dry skin.  Will continue to shop Amazon for it as it is so convenient.</li>
            <li> A very good product, very quick shipment. Customer service is very good, it worth to buy this product. First recommendation</li>
            <li> In years past, I tried this Creme de la Mer, largely because of all the hype on it.  I hoped I wouldn&#x27;t like it, but I actually did.  The price is truly ridiculous, but a few years back I got a couple of one-ounce jars for a hundred ten at the time, and once I had a two-ounce jar that was a savings over two of the one ounce sizes, but due to price and the economy, I haven&#x27;t bought one for a few years.  I was shocked to see the current price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve always been a bit suspicious that while I liked this cream, it had a huge amount of \\&quot;myth\\&quot; built up around it, celebrities buy it and tout its wonders, and the magazines are always praising it.  It has a \\&quot;magic broth\\&quot; made from special seaweed.  Oh, really?  Well, look at virtually every cream, especially the department store brands, and they fall all over themselves to continually introduce a \\&quot;new and better and more magical\\&quot; concoction, usually featuring some herb, vitamin, or whatever.  There have been critiques of very respected people such as Paula Begoun stating that this is actually a pretty old fashioned formulation with nothing especially magical about it, and no, that seaweed broth isn&#x27;t any more mystical and magical than anthing else out there.  It is sold for a very very high cost that people are convinced to pay as a result of buying into all the marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the scoop:  Not one of any cream or lotion out there will cure your wrinkles.  If you want to buy into the hype, all the department store brands ALSO produce the familiar drug store brands, which while not identical, are every bit as good.  Really they are.  I know because I feel like I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there.  For the expensive ones, many are quite nice but they don&#x27;t ever do anything particularly \\&quot;magical\\&quot;.  They moisturize, some better than others.  I hoped to find something very much like Creme de la Mer simply because I have sensitive skin and I battle frequent dry spots and flakiness.  If my skin is irritated for whatever reason, La Mer is soothing to put on overnight, and that&#x27;s what I liked it for:  other brands I&#x27;d tried weren&#x27;t as soothing and moisturizing overnight.  If you use too much, it does seem somewhat shiny/greasy.  The key is to use only a small amount.  I suspect very young women with oily skin would not like La Mer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the truth:  The best thing you can do for your skin, especially if you are 45 or older, is get a doctor&#x27;s prescription for Retin A or Renova.  I&#x27;ve used this for about 18 years now, and I have amazing skin.  I&#x27;m about to turn 64, and my skin is every bit as nice as someone with good skin in their 40&#x27;s, even perhaps 30&#x27;s.  Smooth, clear, soft, no wrinkles.  Retin A helps your skin boost collagen production, which declines with age. Adequate collagen helps your skin stay more youthful.  Beyond using Retin A at night, the key to good skin is:  always wear good sunscreen and never allow burning, give up on having a tan, never go to a tanning salon, don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink much, and moisturize moisturize moisturize.  Do these things starting as young as you can, and you will have great skin when you are older.  Simple as that.  You can&#x27;t really fix skin that has decades of damage with mere creams and lotions, it&#x27;s not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to a La Mer twin:  I finally discovered it, and it&#x27;s Nivea cream in the blue tin.  It has the same consistency, the same scent, it feels the same, it works the same.  You can get about 5.8 ounces for about six dollars, so you can do the math:  about a dollar an ounce compared to La Mer&#x27;s current one hundred fifty an ounce.  I use this at night, very small amount, you \\&quot;warm\\&quot; it on your fingers first just like La Mer.  I use it when needed, not necessarily every night.  There&#x27;s a discussion here about real German vs. Mexican produced Nivea.  I really doubt if there&#x27;s a difference.  I have the Mexican made one and it&#x27;s like La Mer.  I can&#x27;t compare the German one, but really, why wouldn&#x27;t the formula be the same no matter where it&#x27;s made?  Nivea makes a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; cream for roughly the same price, 5.8 ounces for $6, and it is very much like the new La Mer softer version.  I use that one during the day, it&#x27;s lovely and not as heavy, and if I don&#x27;t feel I need the heavier one, I use it at night too.  I&#x27;m happy as a clam that I don&#x27;t have to pine away for La Mer any more because Nivea truly is a twin to La Mer.  Nivea has been around for ages, and I suspect that when Dr. Huber was formulating his cream, he might have started with a formula like Nivea&#x27;s as it was a very popular and widely used cream long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave La Mer 2 stars entirely due to the utterly ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I have been using La Mer for a few years. It is pricey but worth it. It does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is a derivative of sea kelp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I would stick with it after one jar full, but, forget about it, it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my sunscreen on after this application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll see the difference!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for your face if you have dry skin.  I use the soft cream in the Spring/Summer months and this Creme in the cold midwest Fall/Winter months.  I won&#x27;t go into my background and sound like a total pompous jerk but as a cosmetic junkie and research scientist I&#x27;ve put my ability to think critically and research the heck out of nearly everything I eat or put on my body into good use.  I consider myself a well-informed consumer.  So - onto a few points about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced?  Yeah - it is.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s *that* overpriced for what it does to my skin and what it offers.  Yes - you&#x27;re paying for marketing and for some major paychecks to the celebs that campaign for them, which I can totally understand why people would be miffed over it.  You&#x27;re also paying so La Mer can maintain it&#x27;s private sea kelp farm off of the coast of Vancouver.  They harvest their own sea kelp just as Chanel harvests their own batch of lavender from a farmer in the south of France.  Which‚Ä¶.I think is pretty kick ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Is this basically an expensive version of Nivea?&amp;#34; - I hear this all of the time and it makes me want to scream.  Of course it&#x27;s not!  Yes they share quite a few of the same ingredients (not a lot and certainly not the majority of ingredients are the same) but most creams do have the same ingredients as they are in the same consistency category of‚Ä¶.A CREAM.  That&#x27;s just how cosmetic chemistry and the preservation process works.  There are people that swear up and down it&#x27;s the same thing but I really think they are just trying to sensationalize a story and discredit La Mer.  I&#x27;ve tried out Nivea cream (both made in Germany and Mexico) and they are not the same thing.  Nivea works beautifully for some people and that&#x27;s awesome but it&#x27;s nowhere near the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;La Mer has mineral oil&amp;#34; - mineral oil has a bad rap for various reasons but there are many different grades of mineral oil and most of it is absolutely harmless and does not clog pores or harm the skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great cream and, for me, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used to cure my flaky and dry skin in the winter and keep me glowing in the summer.  I still love my Eminence and my trusty Ponds cold cream.  I&#x27;m not a brand snob.  I use what works and I&#x27;m not one to fall for gimmicks.  Hope this was informative.</li>
            <li> Ordered the trial (samples), I thought.  Gave them my VISA card for the shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later they charged my card $87.63;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered what I thought were free trial samples. Gave them my VISA card for the shipping charges.  A week in a half later they charged $87.63 to my card.  I feel this is a rip off.  I put out more than $90 for two small samples.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> The best as a moisturizer and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Cream Has a yellow tint  indicating pass the date of use.  It will be nice to put expiration date on the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> smelling and feeling tell it is fake because I have used many times. I checked comments and found out a lot of people have same situation. I regret I didn&#x27;t check before I bought it.</li>
            <li> i love the product and have been using it for years. i was actually shopping both for more at a discount and also to save tax the last day of no tax shipping to california. sadly, the la mer product that i received was not the same as any that i have ever purchased. the scent was completely different and the texture as well. as far as the real procuct sold in various retail venues, it is unique.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of a certain age....hadn&#x27;t seen my 31 year old daughter since I started using product. At dinner the other night, I started to tell her I bought some overpriced but beautifully fragranced and formulated (smooth creamy) product and she said, \\&quot;funny I was just about to comment on how good your skin looked\\&quot;.  Given the fact that I had a nasty cold and felt like #%)(@$ - this was quite a product endorsement.  It does feel good, and seems to overcome life&#x27;s visible imperfections, colds, stress, etc.</li>
