    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li>However, after using it about 4 or 5 times, my hair began looking perfect even without any styling.</li>
            <li>Smells very good.  </li>
            <li>it is excellently glossy shiny gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>When used with Moroccan Oil, it seems to work great.</li>
            <li>it smells great in my hair</li>
            <li>as a warning, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t take very kindly to color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars though because it&#x27;s not like rock your socks off amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gone through hundreds of dollars trying to find the best humidity shampoo as I now live in the south</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the products are OK, the shampoo is better than the conditioner, but neither is as good as my usuals (Kerastase and Fekkai).  </li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>smell, gentle but good shampoo, pleasant conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t condition my hair (wavy, fine)</li>
            <li>My hair can get a bit frizzy after blow drying and these two items keep it smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>I have used almost everything under the sun to control my frizzy Asian hair, and so far this one has worked the longest and the best.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really worth the price</li>
            <li>I had some scalp irritation so I was looking for something with more natural ingredients and tried this on a whim.</li>
            <li>The best thing is the scent however which is a clean and refreshing and subtly lingers for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and this is my second dual pack.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner really helps to control frizz, even in the FL summers.</li>
            <li>But overall, it did nothing to smooth the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Suds up very well.  </li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>this bamboo line is too scent-y then try the Alterna &amp;#34;Life&amp;#34; in their GREEN bottles which is even more friendly to sensitive people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very lightweight and the scent is tolerable for sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>and they are so worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this, but don&#x27;t be discouraged if it doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li>but their new formulas are so allergic</li>
            <li>though, I love the soft scent and the way it makes my dry, coarse hair feel.</li>
            <li>When you first use this, you probably won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s conditioning your hair enough.</li>
            <li>It keeps it smooth with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say this: the conditioner does make your hair feel light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>My auburn color had lasted two months without fading, but after 2 weeks of using Bamboo, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Alterna products stripping the color before, so this was unexpected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alterna is it for sensitive people.</li>
            <li>The first time for me left my hair dry and frizzy, so I thought I would have to dump the product.</li>
            <li>I generally like Alterna products and this duo is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy expensive shampoo, but this stuff is pretty good.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner really helps to control frizz, even in the FL summers. Smells wonderful too. A little goes a long way, so I think this combo will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d trialed some samples from a friend and wanted to try it a while longer.  I saw this and decided to order it online and received what I ordered.  As far as the product itself, I have to agree with some others that it can leave hair a little &#x27;sticky&#x27;.  When used with Moroccan Oil, it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and this is my second dual pack.  My hair can get a bit frizzy after blow drying and these two items keep it smooth and silky.  The best thing is the scent however which is a clean and refreshing and subtly lingers for a long time.  These are expensive but a little goes a long way and they are so worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> It does what it promies which is not always the case with some products .&lt;br /&gt;And it smells great in my hair</li>
            <li> When you first use this, you probably won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s conditioning your hair enough. The first time for me left my hair dry and frizzy, so I thought I would have to dump the product. However, after using it about 4 or 5 times, my hair began looking perfect even without any styling. It seems that the shampoo and conditioner just need some time to work. A week ago, I ran out of this and decided to use my old shampoo and conditioner, and I absolutely hated how heavy it felt in my hair. Alterna actually moisturizes your hair and washes out, instead of leaving gunk in your hair to make it seem moisturized. I would definitely recommend this, but don&#x27;t be discouraged if it doesn&#x27;t work right away. It might take a few washes.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have used almost everything under the sun to control my frizzy Asian hair, and so far this one has worked the longest and the best. I use it with the Alterna bamboo hair oil. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, but it does control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Alterna Caviar products, and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t for me. I agree with what one reviewer said -- the shampoo leaves your hair feeling sticky and dry. I found that I had to use a lot of conditioner to get my hair back to being manageable. I&#x27;ll say this: the conditioner does make your hair feel light and fluffy. But overall, it did nothing to smooth the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a warning, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t take very kindly to color-treated hair. My auburn color had lasted two months without fading, but after 2 weeks of using Bamboo, it was completely gone. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Alterna products stripping the color before, so this was unexpected.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, leaves my hair soft and shiny. Still have frizz though, and need to use additional products to help control that. But Florida is extremely humid and my hair is naturally curly, so I think that is to be expected. The shampoo is really worth the price though, I love the soft scent and the way it makes my dry, coarse hair feel.</li>
            <li> For those with severe allergies, my family recommends this Alterna line of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is very lightweight and the scent is tolerable for sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;If this bamboo line is too scent-y then try the Alterna &amp;#34;Life&amp;#34; in their GREEN bottles which is even more friendly to sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried Wen haircare, it itches my face all day long even tho it is excellently glossy shiny gorgeous hair stuff.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried Pantene, Finesse etc but their new formulas are so allergic so we had to find something else.&lt;br /&gt;Alterna is it for sensitive people.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy expensive shampoo, but this stuff is pretty good. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but like once a week, but I notice whenever I use this stuff compared to cheaper shampoo, my hair is a lot smoother and softer. The conditioner also gives your hair shine, but not that greasy look. At least not for mine. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I give it 4 stars though because it&#x27;s not like rock your socks off amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It is pricey.  Smells very good.  Suds up very well.  I like all Altena Bamboo shampoos</li>
            <li> I have gone through hundreds of dollars trying to find the best humidity shampoo as I now live in the south and this is by far the best!  It keeps it smooth with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this shampoo and conditioner combo leaves my hair with significantly less frizz than normal shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo and conditioner.  It seems to control the frizz effects in the humidity of Florida in the summer.</li>
            <li> I had some scalp irritation so I was looking for something with more natural ingredients and tried this on a whim. Liked it so much I bought this refill to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, gentle but good shampoo, pleasant conditioner. Nice product. I like it.</li>
            <li> I generally like Alterna products and this duo is no exception.  The shampoo is pretty thick so I dilute it down in my hand with some water.  It lathers up nicely and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m less fond of the conditioner unfortunately.  It doesn&#x27;t condition my hair (wavy, fine) well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the products are OK, the shampoo is better than the conditioner, but neither is as good as my usuals (Kerastase and Fekkai).  I doubt I will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from my local salon, used it twice and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all.  I am looking to purchase the set.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair fell sticky. Hated to waste the bucks but finally tossed it. Used this product previously however this was definitely not the same.</li>
