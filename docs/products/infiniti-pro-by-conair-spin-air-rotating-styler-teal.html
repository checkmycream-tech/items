            <li>I would most defintley buy it.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Just have to get used to the brush doing most of the work.</li>
            <li>ok, so this thing comes and i go to use it</li>
            <li>and this helps to smooth her hair and gives her a more softer curl.</li>
            <li>and it was really easy to get your hair tangled in the brushes.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and looks salon done....</li>
            <li>I have curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The product inside was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome alternative to blow drying with a dryer in one hand and a round brush in another.  </li>
            <li>, i wish it was more powerful though</li>
            <li>Made it smooth.</li>
            <li>i got so excited i ordered immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit large and can seem bulky to hold, but it gets easier to use the more you use it.</li>
            <li>If the manufacture would correct the way they attach the brush barrel and put a cool button to easily cool the curl, I would by it again.</li>
            <li>If you want to straighten your hair quickly this is the product to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thin and kind of wavy, so you would expect that the dryer feature would work perfectly fine with my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>The spinning action on the Infiniti Pro Spin Styler creates nice volume, which is frizz-free and super fast.</li>
            <li>Works great if you want to add body to your hair, or make those little flips on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>excellent for a quick handling of thick ,coarse hair ,use it when hair is almost completely dry ,creats beautiful styles, sleek or wave</li>
            <li>hair look professionally done and it is easy to use even though I have arthritis.</li>
            <li>It is also easier on her hair than a regular blow dryer, the heat is spread out a bit more so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was play with it~~</li>
            <li>I find the Spin Air Rotating Styler really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can style my hair without using too much time and energy.</li>
            <li>The result is shiny bouncy straight hair.</li>
            <li>She has very curly hair</li>
            <li>The ease of use and styling results were better than expected.  </li>
            <li>It saves me a lot of time in getting ready for work and the style lasts.  </li>
            <li>live without it , wish it was higher voltage</li>
            <li>i ordered around 4pm EST and being so excited paid for next day shipping</li>
            <li>I gave it 4stars, because it could use a little bit more heat.</li>
            <li>does not dry as quickly as advertised, ended up going back to using a curling brush and the old blow dryer again</li>
            <li>Powerful, but small and light enough to pack for travel</li>
            <li>i am 5&#x27;91/2&amp;#34; so not little</li>
            <li>I really like this styling tool, because it does not flatten and burn hair as a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I will say that you need to be careful with the rotation at first because it can get tangled in your hair if you let it get away from you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using my new Spin Air Rotating Styler.</li>
            <li>but amazon got it to me the next day clear from PST.</li>
            <li>careful using it, it will stuck your hair in if you spin too fast.</li>
            <li>trying to turn the rolling part on i constantly hit the wrong direction because the buttons are so far from the hot and cool settings and are right next to each other so was continually bumping the wrong one completely screwing up my hairstyle and most times&lt;br /&gt;getting</li>
            <li>It takes a long time  to dry my hair up, and the end result is not quite exactly a straight, shinny hair.</li>
            <li>This Conair hairdryer is small, but powerful.  </li>
            <li>and the outcome is much more dramatic than the traditional way.  </li>

            <li> I got this a while ago through amazon and decided to give it a try despite the negative reviews. My hair is super thin and kind of wavy, so you would expect that the dryer feature would work perfectly fine with my kind of hair. Well it doesn&#x27;t. It takes a long time  to dry my hair up, and the end result is not quite exactly a straight, shinny hair. I would say, that I get a nicer wavy hair, which it is not the reason why I purchased this item for.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on here, I bought this item yesterday. I tried it out today and didn&#x27;t like it; it didn&#x27;t provide enough heat or power to really dry my hair, and I didn&#x27;t see any volume. By the time I \\&quot;did\\&quot; my hair, I had to go back with my round brush and blow dryer to finish the job, which sort of defeats the purpose. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart for about $50.  It&#x27;s an awesome alternative to blow drying with a dryer in one hand and a round brush in another.  I believe it&#x27;s quicker and the outcome is much more dramatic than the traditional way.  I was considering the &#x27;INSTYLER&#x27; but after reading all the bad reviews I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  I will say that you need to be careful with the rotation at first because it can get tangled in your hair if you let it get away from you.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using my new Spin Air Rotating Styler.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten your hair quickly this is the product to use.  It works great and straightens in no time.</li>
            <li> The spinning action on the Infiniti Pro Spin Styler creates nice volume, which is frizz-free and super fast. I partially dry my shoulder- length hair and I use Purology straightening balm before drying. Then, I use the Infinit Pro Spin to style in sections. I really like this styling tool, because it does not flatten and burn hair as a flat iron. I gave it 4stars, because it could use a little bit more heat. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This Conair hairdryer is small, but powerful.  It smooths my hair as it dries.  Powerful, but small and light enough to pack for travel</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting it to do. It awkward to use and it was really easy to get your hair tangled in the brushes.  I returned it - just too frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> this product works great. I got up one morning and I didn&#x27;t want to get my hair wet, so I thought why not try it. I used the Pro on my dry pillow hair and in 5 mins I was done. Beautiful shape and body. I would give the infiniti Pro 5 stars but I also think they should offer a smaller one as well. I would most defintley buy it.</li>
            <li> I find the Spin Air Rotating Styler really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I can style my hair without using too much time and energy.</li>
            <li> excellent for a quick handling of thick ,coarse hair ,use it when hair is almost completely dry ,creats beautiful styles, sleek or wave&lt;br /&gt;cannot live without it , wish it was higher voltage</li>
            <li> Love this.  It works great!&lt;br /&gt;My hair look professionally done and it is easy to use even though I have arthritis.</li>
            <li> I like the brush and how it spins. The problem I had is where then metal was crimped together, it pulled out my hair by getting stuck. The drier switch was awkward to switch to cool to set your curl.  If the manufacture would correct the way they attach the brush barrel and put a cool button to easily cool the curl, I would by it again.</li>
            <li> Love this!! So easy to use and looks salon done....I have curly, fine hair. The result is shiny bouncy straight hair. Thank u</li>
            <li> Bought one of these and gave it to my daughter to use on my granddaughters hair after I found out how nice it was to use. She has very curly hair and this helps to smooth her hair and gives her a more softer curl. It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair so she will sit still a lot longer. It is also easier on her hair than a regular blow dryer, the heat is spread out a bit more so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Perfect for setting styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I hated having to borrow back something I gave in the first place, (and that looks kinda bad too) and I missed using it, so I bought myself this one. I use it all the time. Works great if you want to add body to your hair, or make those little flips on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit large and can seem bulky to hold, but it gets easier to use the more you use it. Just have to get used to the brush doing most of the work.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that has inspired me to write a review! i happened to watch a youtube video on doing hair and saw several videos on this thing. i got so excited i ordered immediately. i ordered around 4pm EST and being so excited paid for next day shipping and i can&#x27;t believe it but amazon got it to me the next day clear from PST. ok, so this thing comes and i go to use it&lt;br /&gt;immediately and what a fiasco. biggest problem is the barrel is way  way way to big to handle. i am 5&#x27;91/2&amp;#34; so not little hands.&lt;br /&gt;in trying to turn the rolling part on i constantly hit the wrong direction because the buttons are so far from the hot and cool settings and are right next to each other so was continually bumping the wrong one completely screwing up my hairstyle and most times&lt;br /&gt;getting it all tangled up. thought it was just me so kept trying and trying...for get it...out the door today.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely works as billed. I would have given it 5 stars except it will sometimes grab hairs and pull them out of my scalp. I have a lot of hair so I am no worried. Someone with thin hair would probably be distressed.</li>
            <li> does not dry as quickly as advertised, ended up going back to using a curling brush and the old blow dryer again</li>
            <li> This brsh is wonderful.  The ease of use and styling results were better than expected.  It saves me a lot of time in getting ready for work and the style lasts.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the item in the mail, it was a little beat up, the box was inside an envelope, so I imagin it was from processing and shipping. The product inside was fine. Had not been opened or used. The first thing I did was play with it~~ I love this thing!! Tips: you want your hair to be somewhat dry, not soak-n-wet when you use it.. The spin brush gave my hair volumn and shine, just as promised! I had 3 people comment on my hair at work that day!! Love it! I have used this thing when my hair is dry... i.e. for my bangs to give them volumn.. Id rather use this than my straightener or curling iron on my bangs.</li>
            <li> very nice product,gives my hair volume.&lt;br /&gt;be careful using it, it will stuck your hair in if you spin too fast.</li>
            <li> Great item, freat price,  works as described, great hairstyle within minutes, love it, i wish it was more powerful though</li>
            <li> Not quicker then a Straightener. Didn&#x27;t give all the volume but I have shoulder lenght hair it did feel as my hair would if I put all the product in it but I didn&#x27;t have any in. Made it smooth. I will say i had to use my conair Straightener to get the unrully curls out. The spin button would randomly stop working. And it would get stuck mid brush.</li>
