    <ol>
            <li>The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>excellent product and service</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews &amp; tips before purchasing this and I must say I&#x27;m so impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!!</li>
            <li>It is the best.  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and was happy with it</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am one that carried deodorant in the car just in case so a good one is a priority.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and it does what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>is odorless which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Also this deodorant has a good rating on the consumerdatabase.com</li>
            <li>It is also very healthy compare to others.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried it during something like a work out, but for day-to-day purposes its amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I find this product prevents odor for all except the most humid/sticky days.  </li>
            <li>I bought more on amazon</li>
            <li>Glad i am using this.</li>
            <li>This product is effective and sent free.  </li>
            <li>so it is better for you than most deodorants on the market.  </li>
            <li>and I feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>so I figured why not, it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>, it does not control sweating (and works best only when you&#x27;re not sweating a TON).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Before I bought this deodorant, I bought Bubble and Bee deodorant and none of their deodorants worked for me except the lemongrass which not only didn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>I have found if I squeeze the edge where bottle meets the ball the ball will be able to move freely again.</li>
            <li>Good buy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s just best to buy organic deodorant or try other options if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>washes off easy</li>
            <li>I could even apply it after a run and I&#x27;d smell fine until I can get home to shower.  </li>
            <li>I used the roll-on and it applies smoothly and does leave a sticky feeling or residue on clothes.</li>
            <li>I was really excited with the reviews.</li>
            <li>The bottles leak, and the liquid inside the bottles is very runny, more like water.</li>
            <li>It is a good daily product, even for exercising.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been looking for more natural and chemical free products to use.  </li>
            <li>Many of the celebrities are wearing crystal rock for that particular purpose.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly</li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant, its much easier to use than the rock but its almost empty</li>
            <li>After reading numerous reviews I followed some advice and used the crystal rock first and then put this on lightly over top as a back-up layer.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t mind sweating as long as I don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything more you can ask from a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Its nice to know that this product is all natural with no weird chemicals, but it just doesn&#x27;t compare as far as odor protection.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I was having so many issues with rashes on my under arms from other aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever bothered to write.  </li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this roll on after all the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>this product may not be strong enough for all but for me it works very very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>it really did not help my problem</li>
            <li>and I sweat a lot on my runs... and because there is so much moisture in this deodorant...</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>AND no harsh chemicals!!!</li>
            <li>No more stains in my clothes, non sticky, feels fresh, I love it.</li>
            <li>As long as your job isn&#x27;t a construction job, where you sweat all day, you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to let it dry completely after you put it on.  </li>
            <li>The added bonus of no white residue, or yellow stains just makes it that much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this Crystal roll-on to switch to something more natural and avoid the dark underarms caused by deodorants containing aluminum.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this natural product.</li>
            <li>Anyway it works all day and its natural!</li>
            <li>I Find That The Lafes Brand Lavendar Scent Is The Only natural deodorant that works well for me-- which is ironic since I really don&#x27;t normally care for the scent of lavender.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, goes on completely clear,</li>
            <li>Yay it worked to go natural.</li>
            <li>This one is natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because there was some much talk about different deodorants leads to cancer.</li>
            <li>but it took away my energy (probably since lemongrass is a natural sedative).  </li>
            <li>It is with natural ingredients, but I have no confidence as I would have with some major brands.</li>
            <li>Male 30yrs old.</li>
            <li>I use only a shaver and this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>As long as shower and wash everyday, the deodorant keeps me smelling fresh.</li>

            <li> I was finding that regular deodorants (even the clinical strength) tend to give out half way through the day, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> Not sure what I am missing in application.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop excessive sweat</li>
            <li> With this deodorant, I find myself smelling unpleasant in a few hours, even on a low activity day</li>
            <li> Although it is not an antiperspirant, at least I thought, it would cut any BO.</li>
            <li> do not recommend this product whatsoever - at least from this seller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money trying it!!!</li>
            <li> If I am dirty from the day before, it does little to keep the sink away.</li>
            <li> I think the seller must have either found these in the dumpster behind the warehouse, or in the dollar store reject bins.</li>
            <li> choose this product as it does not have any ingredients that have been implicated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to risk the possibility that antiperspirants might be implicated in breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Every other deodorant irritate my skin so badly it cannot be used.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this does nothing to deodorize me.  </li>
            <li> Bought it and put on a lot, and 4 hours later, I smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> And I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I smelled horrible.</li>

            <li> I bought this Crystal roll-on to switch to something more natural and avoid the dark underarms caused by deodorants containing aluminum.  Unfortunately, this does nothing to deodorize me.  I used Degree for a long time, and I got all day protection from it.  I could even apply it after a run and I&#x27;d smell fine until I can get home to shower.  With this deodorant, I find myself smelling unpleasant in a few hours, even on a low activity day (e.g. working at a desk job).  Might as well spray my pits with water.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant, its much easier to use than the rock but its almost empty and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month! Anyway it works all day and its natural!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  My husband likes it because it&#x27;s non-irritating to his skin.</li>
            <li> if you are worried about the connection between Alzheimer&#x27;s and aluminum and want a product that works - this is for you.  I gave it a shot and it works great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Hard to find in México, where I live, so I have to order it by Internet or buy it when I travel to the States, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble. No more stains in my clothes, non sticky, feels fresh, I love it.</li>
            <li> The bottles have been re-labeled with a different barcode. I think the seller must have either found these in the dumpster behind the warehouse, or in the dollar store reject bins. The bottles leak, and the liquid inside the bottles is very runny, more like water. I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and will continue to do so. It works very well. However-- I will not buy it from this seller ever again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more natural and chemical free products to use.  I am one that carried deodorant in the car just in case so a good one is a priority.  I have been pleased with this deodorant.  The price is good and it does what is advertised.  It has no scent at all.  We all know some unscented products smell.  I used the roll-on and it applies smoothly and does leave a sticky feeling or residue on clothes. I highly recommend this natural product.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever bothered to write.  This product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  Every other deodorant irritate my skin so badly it cannot be used.  This deodorant does not irriate at all, it has no smell, is not sticky and does not stain.  It goes on easily and lasts for hours.  There may be other similar products but I am unaware of them.  This one works.</li>
            <li> excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I find this product prevents odor for all except the most humid/sticky days.  It is a good daily product, even for exercising.&lt;br /&gt;I choose this product as it does not have any ingredients that have been implicated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease development.&lt;br /&gt;One key is to apply and give it time to fully dry before dressing.</li>
            <li> Its nice to know that this product is all natural with no weird chemicals, but it just doesn&#x27;t compare as far as odor protection.  It only protects for about an hour.  I keep it in my car as an emergency backup, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was really excited with the reviews. Bought it and put on a lot, and 4 hours later, I smelled terrible. Although it is not an antiperspirant, at least I thought, it would cut any BO. Nope! I smelled horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money trying it!!!</li>
            <li> I had pain under one arm. Someone told me it could be my deodarant. Cause all the aluminum in it  i couldnt believe it. So i bought some of this at a store and tried it. Pain under my arm is goneee. Yay it worked to go natural. And no swat or body odor. The salts in this block odor bacteria. And sweat glands. I bought more on amazon cause its cheaper. Glad i am using this. This one is natural. Good buy and fast shipping. You wont be disappointed. It truly works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat a lot. I work an office job, but I would not trust this product. It is with natural ingredients, but I have no confidence as I would have with some major brands. Male 30yrs old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for any of this brand&#x27;s deodorants.  none of them seem to work for me.  I Find That The Lafes Brand Lavendar Scent Is The Only natural deodorant that works well for me-- which is ironic since I really don&#x27;t normally care for the scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> This product is effective and sent free.  One problem I have had is the roller ball &#x27;locking up&#x27;.  I have found if I squeeze the edge where bottle meets the ball the ball will be able to move freely again.</li>
            <li> I guess I missed part of the description or something but for whatever reason I expected this to have a scent. It didn&#x27;t, so it really did not help my problem</li>
            <li> I bought this product because there was some much talk about different deodorants leads to cancer. Many of the celebrities are wearing crystal rock for that particular purpose. I was told that  per sprint deodorant cent  is a hazard to your health. So it&#x27;s just best to buy organic deodorant or try other options if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was having so many issues with rashes on my under arms from other aluminum free deodorants. I was given the name of this deodorant by a friend. And I was extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m a runner and I sweat a lot on my runs... and because there is so much moisture in this deodorant... it made the rash ten times worse.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has been working well for me.  Before I bought this deodorant, I bought Bubble and Bee deodorant and none of their deodorants worked for me except the lemongrass which not only didn&#x27;t smell very good but it took away my energy (probably since lemongrass is a natural sedative).  Anyway, I don&#x27;t stink with this deodorant and the deodorant itself is odorless which is a good thing. Also this deodorant has a good rating on the consumerdatabase.com so it is better for you than most deodorants on the market.  &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to risk the possibility that antiperspirants might be implicated in breast cancer. Part of the problem is using a razor to open the skin as well. I use only a shaver and this natural deodorant. It works very well and I feel safe using it. My stepdaughter started using it as well</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews &amp; tips before purchasing this and I must say I&#x27;m so impressed by this product. I was finding that regular deodorants (even the clinical strength) tend to give out half way through the day, but this one didn&#x27;t. After reading numerous reviews I followed some advice and used the crystal rock first and then put this on lightly over top as a back-up layer. I cannot believe how well this works. I haven&#x27;t yet tried it during something like a work out, but for day-to-day purposes its amazing. I don&#x27;t have to feel self-conscious at work anymore (in fear that my deodorant will stop working). I honestly don&#x27;t mind sweating as long as I don&#x27;t smell. The added bonus of no white residue, or yellow stains just makes it that much better. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! Doesn&#x27;t stop excessive sweat but it does stop the odor.  As long as your job isn&#x27;t a construction job, where you sweat all day, you&#x27;ll be fine.  You won&#x27;t break into a sweat if you&#x27;re in an office all day.  Make sure to let it dry completely after you put it on.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, goes on completely clear, washes off easy, it&#x27;s even lightening my underarms (I think I was allergic to the aluminum in regular deodorants).</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this roll on after all the reviews I read. I end up stinky by the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was happy with it but when I received it this time the packaging was quite different from what is pictured here. Also I noticed that the deodorant started to smell itself. I believe bacteria was growing on the roller ball and so when I applied it I started to smell like someone who hasn&#x27;t showered or ever put on deodorant in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product whatsoever - at least from this seller. Buy it in the stores because I think this might be a fraudulent product.</li>
            <li> this product may not be strong enough for all but for me it works very very well. AND no harsh chemicals!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I was skeptical but I needed to try something new so I figured why not, it&#x27;s so cheap! I wouldn&#x27;t plan on wearing this to the gym though, it does not control sweating (and works best only when you&#x27;re not sweating a TON).</li>
            <li> As long as shower and wash everyday, the deodorant keeps me smelling fresh. If I am dirty from the day before, it does little to keep the sink away. But, I don&#x27;t have a problem with this as I shower every day. There really isn&#x27;t anything more you can ask from a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  It is the best.  I have used this for years.  I don&#x27;t think i will ever change. It is also very healthy compare to others.</li>
            <li> I love this and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> No matter how fast or little I roll on it just feels REALLY wet. Not sure what I am missing in application.  Seems to work okay once I blot it off</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Came in the mail quickly</li>
