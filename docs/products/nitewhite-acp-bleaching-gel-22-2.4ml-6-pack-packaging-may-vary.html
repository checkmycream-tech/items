            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>I have used other similar products and they were far superior.  </li>
            <li>No where near as powerful as the old formula from 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will become very sensitive, and it didnt even really whiten them yet.</li>

            <li>Exact same product as what my sister bought from her dentist for 4x</li>

            <li>Great deal for the same product you receive at the dentist but at less than half the price!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what I found locally in stores and in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the same product I used to purchase from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>It may be that some are selling an old and expired product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could this be an old &amp;#34;Bait and</li>
            <li>I even recieved it 4 days early.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth sensitive for about 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I used to purchase the same exact product from my dentist for double the price.</li>
            <li>The results of this whitener are absolutely &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; and it is also quite &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; on my gums at a third the cost I was paying my dentist for the same thing!</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to get it any other way other than going back to his office.</li>
            <li>will be very porous after so be careful with coffee.</li>
            <li>It works &amp; is simple to use with my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same product our dentist sells minus her name printed on the front!  </li>
            <li>Price was reasonable but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as other products on the market.</li>
            <li>Although this bleaching gel doesn&#x27;t make my teeth crazy white, which is what I would prefer, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to wear overnight, just an hour or two a few days a week at first..</li>
            <li>Through Amazon, this product is available at less than half the cost than you would pay at the Dentist office.</li>

            <li> The latest shipment, however, must have been old or a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> Keep the cost down with providing the product and only the product.</li>

            <li> This product whitens without the sensitivity issues you may receive with other products.</li>
            <li> There seems to be some confusion by previous purchasers.  </li>
            <li> This was not the product in the image, which I previously purchased from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> hope this stuff works as well as the product I previously used and purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Does cause a little gum tenderness and tooth sensitivity after two consecutive uses.</li>
            <li> I may try this, although I am not happy it is the same product I ordered.</li>
            <li> I use these in my small dental assisting school.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if I&#x27;m going to try this since I don&#x27;t know how it will work since I&#x27;ve never used Zoom in the past.</li>
            <li> i visited a few proffesional whitening doctors and they said ZOOM!</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed not what I expected</li>
            <li> OF DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> :(  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I received a Phillips brand when ordered NiteWhite.</li>
            <li> This stung sooooooo bad!</li>
            <li> my teeth stains are very bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I was introduced to this system when I switched to Aspen Dental.  It works for me, and I get so many compliments on my smile. Amazon makes it so easy to keep up my supply without having to make a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Does everything advertised.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than what I found locally in stores and in the dentist&#x27;s office. Same brand and size.  Works very good.</li>
            <li> I ordered the NiteWhite ACP but I received the Phillips Zoom instead.  If I wanted the Phillips Zoom I would have ordered it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A+++++++++++ Recommended</li>

            <li> This is exactly the same product our dentist sells minus her name printed on the front!  Nite White is made by Phillips.  There seems to be some confusion by previous purchasers.  This product shipped on time and it works!  For a fraction of the price my dentist sells it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including some info on what ACP means to help clarify:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Philips Zoom Day White and Nite White Take-home whitening formulas with Amorphous Calcium Phosphate Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP), a patented technology developed by the ADA, leads to the rapid deposition of a new coating of hydroxyapatite over the original tooth surface.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, i much rather use this than any of the dentist whitening options that cost over $300. careful though it&#x27;s really strong and should not be kept longer than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Same product as my dentist sold me for big $$............  works well and will buy again.. when i need to reorder</li>
            <li> I had been using night bright for a while, and got this product, and it works a little better~! Don&#x27;t have to wear overnight, just an hour or two a few days a week at first.. and you have brilliant white teeth.</li>
            <li> Not the same packaging as they mention. But same product. Would recommend to others. It does work , I have been using this product for several years off and on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am very happy with the results.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I received a Phillips brand when ordered NiteWhite. If you don&#x27;t have a product don&#x27;t picture it on the website.</li>
            <li> Same product used by my dentist, but not available after sample kit - great to be able to use in the molds I&#x27;d had made  -  will be ordering again soon....Thank you!  K Mosera</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past, and it worked great.  The latest shipment, however, must have been old or a bad batch.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for a week, and there is not visible difference, other than my teeth being sensitive now.  Buyer beware of the company shipping.  It may be that some are selling an old and expired product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for keeping those choppers nice and white. My initial supply was through my dentist, but it was much more reasonable through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Same good product I expect from my dentist</li>
            <li> This stung sooooooo bad! My mouth still is sore. And it didnt even really whiten them. But I guess that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I just received this. The product given was zoom and looked completely different than product shown online. I read reviews about zoom. I may try this, although I am not happy it is the same product I ordered. It is similar.</li>
            <li> I swear by this bleaching kit. It makes your teeth very white! Try to keep it off your gums .This is the real deal.It makes your teeth unbelievably white in a short amount of time! You&#x27;re teeth will be very porous after so be careful with coffee.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this my teeth were noticably whiter. After a week of use, 1 hour a day, my teeth are soo brite! Everyone noticed. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I received the product today.  I opened the box to find a product called &amp;#34;Philips Zoom!&amp;#34;  NiteWhite.  This was not the product in the image, which I previously purchased from my dentist.  It says, 22% Carbamide Peroxide.  However, I placed my order based on the description and Product IMAGE on the Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could this be an old &amp;#34;Bait and Switch?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am Amazon Prime, and did not receive the package per the Prime benefits.  If a product is being shipped Signature Required, the site should state that, so I can leave a note and make arrangements with neighbors or the seller.  Ultimately, the package was left at my door.  No signature obtained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this stuff works as well as the product I previously used and purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the product my dentist sent me home with. When I ran out, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to get it any other way other than going back to his office. Much to my surprise, I found it here on Amazon. It is a great product and will continue to use. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted, with good expiration dates. I even recieved it 4 days early. THANKS !!!</li>
            <li> This product was very effective. I have used nite white before but not in the bleaching strength of this product.  I left the trays in place for 90 minutes and the results were amazing. I will purchase note white in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this today and DID NOT receive what was advertised. I got Philips Zoom! NiteWhite, NOT what is pictured. I&#x27;m unsure if I&#x27;m going to try this since I don&#x27;t know how it will work since I&#x27;ve never used Zoom in the past.</li>
            <li> This product works best if you already have custom molded whitening trays for your teeth.  You get six mixing syringes for the price of one. NiteWhite ACP Bleaching Gel 22% is highly effective and is the same product used at Dentist offices. Through Amazon, this product is available at less than half the cost than you would pay at the Dentist office.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several weeks.  Your teeth will become very sensitive, and it didnt even really whiten them yet.</li>
            <li> It works &amp; is simple to use with my busy schedule. My daughter and I compare who has the brightest to ensure we won&#x27;t  have&lt;br /&gt;yellow teeth again......Thanks</li>
            <li> my teeth stains are very bad. i visited a few proffesional whitening doctors and they said ZOOM! won&#x27;t help my situation as well as other whitening kits. so one doctor recomended this product-but the 16% one. it took me 3 weeks of every day wearing it for 2 hours and still i haven&#x27;t gotten such results as this did in 6 DAYS!! i&#x27;m getting so many compliments! people are literally embarrest standing near me with such a beautiful smile.&lt;br /&gt;for me it was a breeze to purchase this product since i had experience with this company and the lighter format.&lt;br /&gt;i think its one of the cheepest-most succesful whitening options out there.&lt;br /&gt;try it out! you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Smile because my dentist recommended this gel and my teeth are super white. Follow the directions and you will have white teeth in two weeks.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good...</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff many dentists charge 3 times as much for. The packaging looks different than my original, but the results are the same. Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth sensitive for about 24 hours.  Otherwise very satisfied.</li>
            <li> good stuff safe delivery</li>
            <li> I have used other similar products and they were far superior.  Price was reasonable but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Buy this product all the time. It works well.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the same product you receive at the dentist but at less than half the price! This product whitens without the sensitivity issues you may receive with other products.</li>
            <li> Cost continue to increase. The statement packaging may vary is exactly what they say, packaging may vary,, like paying for items you do not need or want. In this package there was a caring case, Whatthe! Keep the cost down with providing the product and only the product. I&#x27;ll look for another provider in the future.</li>
            <li> Product is as good as any I&#x27;ve received at the dentist office ... plus it&#x27;s less expensive.  bjw</li>
            <li> Like the stuff the dentist sold me.  This works just like it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my teeth any whiter at all. I don&#x27;t know if it is a bogus label or just expired.  I paid a lot of money on it too.</li>
            <li> Works Perfectly as described.I would NOT suggest leaving this product on over night.&lt;br /&gt;Tooth sensitivity and mismatched patches of colors can occur.&lt;br /&gt;I left mine end for 1-2 hours while doing house work and Had amazing results!!!!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as marketed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time consuming,Long process. Tooth sensitivity. Feels like petrolium jelly and tastes like cloves. Minimal \\&quot;foam action\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Used many times and it really works</li>
            <li> works great! do not leave on for more than 2 hours or your teeth will become very sensitive. repeat twice a week until preferred whiteness is achieved.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had originally gotten this product from my dentist along with custom teeth trays. I needed more gel so I did my price comparison &amp; bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> only product i use for my teeth. no sensitivity, no problems at all. they make ur teeth so white, and i get compliments. i do about once a year</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast!</li>
            <li> Works great. Exact same product as what my sister bought from her dentist for 4x the price of what I paid here! Does cause a little gum tenderness and tooth sensitivity after two consecutive uses. Goes away very soon so I just skip a day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many years ago, so wanted to rewhiten. It does a great job, my teeth are noticebly whiter!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every week to keep my teeth bright &amp; white. I&#x27;m 57 &amp; I look 15 yrs younger people say with my white teeth.</li>
            <li> Disappointed not what I expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as yet but if it&#x27;s the same product I&#x27;ve used before (packaging is different) it works very well.</li>
            <li> Although this bleaching gel doesn&#x27;t make my teeth crazy white, which is what I would prefer, it does a good job. The taste is pleasant and I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity issues, even when I wear the gel all night.</li>
