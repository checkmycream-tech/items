            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I thought this stuff would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and non messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly either.  </li>
            <li>They say this is the most effective product they have used.</li>
            <li>When it finally dawned on me to check Amazon, I was so happy to find it!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S BETTER THAN USING NO PRODUCT AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I LOVE AMAZON and to date, I have never had a problem</li>
            <li>and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for facial heair removal that doesn&#x27;t blister my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am complety satisfied</li>
            <li>Was glad to know that you sell it on line,&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores or pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a great buy, very ecocnomical.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using surgi-cream for many years....</li>
            <li>best depillatory for facial hair.</li>
            <li>when I received it, I read the directions &amp; made sure not to leave it on longer than 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>I really love the cream.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>At first I absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li>My results were that many of the fine hairs were still there</li>
            <li>The best thing about this depilatory is, since it keeps me from having to tweeze, I no longer have to worry about developing the ingrown hairs that I&#x27;m extremely prone to, which in turn would lead to hyperpigmentation scars as a result of trying to tweeze them out.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, convenient applicator.</li>
            <li>I have used every brand of dipilatory on the market and surgi cream is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>The parts it did work on were the baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have light peach fuzz on my face and underneath my chin.</li>
            <li>I used Surgi cream recently and I am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product as it removes hair within 4 minutes without being harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>good facial hair remover have used this for years and  always pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>My makeup glides on &amp; my face looks super smooth.</li>
            <li>all 23 reviws at the time I purchased were POSITIVE, I shoulda known better</li>
            <li>It has been 10 days and my skin has mostly healed and I&#x27;ll be happy when the peach fuzz grows back so my face is soft again.</li>
            <li>A true money, and time saver too.</li>
            <li>I always leave it on for the full 8 minutes</li>
            <li>However that faded quickly and no harm done.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>I could feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>It hardly has any smell, which is great.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF THE FIRST TIME &amp; MUST REPEAT THE PROCESS IN A DAY</li>
            <li>This is the first chemical hair remover I have used.  </li>
            <li>These are the things you need to know: First of all if the cream dries on your face you will burn your skin.</li>
            <li>Just tried using this, first time no results.</li>
            <li>Now, if only Amazon would treat their warehouse workers more humanely ...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 50 years but could no longer find it in local stores, so I was elated to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wet face first and you shouldn&#x27;t have sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reaction in spite of leaving it on for well over the recommended 8 minutes maximum (I&#x27;ve left it on for upwards of 15, but I have a few hairs that are embarrassingly stubborn.)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>AND I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANY OF THEM.  </li>
            <li>Mom would pluck her face not getting every one when she discovered this following the directions her face is smooth &amp; touchable.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is resistant the cream works very well.</li>
            <li>It also burned my face for a whole night although I followed all instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li>She really likes this product.</li>
            <li>Surgi-cream smells a lot better than the other brand that I used.  </li>
            <li>Actually, in general, Amazon is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for most products before I check local stores.  </li>
            <li>I will make this short and sweet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t just that the product was old, because the whole tube is watery.  </li>
            <li>I order this product for my family members who live overseas whenever I go visit them.</li>
            <li>The cream was very soft.</li>
            <li>SurgiCream works better than any other similar product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>With my most recent order (Feb 2014), the product is extremely watery and just drips off my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I am over 70 and I will continue using this product for years to come!  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and product was as expected.  </li>
            <li>IF IT&#x27;S USED FREQUENTLY.   </li>
            <li>May take a few times (not all in a row) to get everything, but then it is smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>it is gentle enough to remove the hair on the face without any redness or problems...</li>
            <li>Follow the directions on the box and it will remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li>annoying to be dictated to as to how many words I must use!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried Nair, Sally Hansen and a few others and none of them were strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>I applied the after cream &amp; the slight burning I had went right away.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, it actually still runs a bit oily in the T zone.  </li>
            <li>The Extra Gentle formula simply doesn&#x27;t work well for me, so I thought I was ordering the regular formula.</li>
            <li>I HAD TO USE AQUAFOR FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO RETURN MY SKIN BACK TO NORMAL.  </li>
            <li>I am a blonde w/ white blonde peach fuzz and after reading the positive reviews, decided to try SurgiCream, a big mistake!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t even completely remove the blonde peach fuzz, and left me w/ scratchy stubble, like a man in need of a shave.  </li>
            <li>What I do is wipe a little water on my face with my fingers first and then apply the cream.</li>
            <li>If you are just careful to apply it heavily, keep it on less than 8 minutes, and possibly dampen your face a little before starting you will have great results.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but not great.</li>

            <li> I am a blonde w/ white blonde peach fuzz and after reading the positive reviews, decided to try SurgiCream, a big mistake!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t even completely remove the blonde peach fuzz, and left me w/ scratchy stubble, like a man in need of a shave.  </li>

            <li> It works fine, but not great.</li>
            <li> it gave me irritation, my face was very red for long time, didn&#x27;t work well on facial hair either.</li>
            <li> I did leave it on a little too long the first time and my skin got pink around the mouth area.</li>
            <li> I use this cream about once a month and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as long as I don&#x27;t have any irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> after lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on TOO long or it WILL burn ya.</li>
            <li> have used it in the past and it was ok, but now thin and watery and does nothing.</li>
            <li> My face was very dried out and turned red to the point that even after moisturizing multiple times I had several family members comment on how red the rash was on my face.</li>
            <li> Apply it thickly or it will dry on the skin too fast and will burn.</li>
            <li> After trying other products during the interval when I could not find surgi-creme, I can definitely say that it is the best!&lt;br</li>
            <li> That way it takes longer to dry and will not burn my skin.</li>
            <li> If it starts drying on your skin apply a little water to your finger and soften the cream back up by mixing that water with the drying cream.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little scraper and, when the 4 minutes are up, you simply scrape the hair off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received the Extra Gentle formula.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not readily available locally.  </li>
            <li> Will I ever get answers or a partial refund???  </li>
            <li> I remove it with cotton makeup removers that are wet.  </li>
            <li> When I could no longer find it in stores, I used other brands.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand.</li>
            <li> She has tried other brands, but this is the one she has chose to stay with</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other products including Sally&#x27;s, which did not work at all.</li>
            <li> The thicker darker hair (I have dark brown hair) were not touched at all and still required a tweezer to remove.  </li>
            <li> I play golf and am in the sun and really notice the small hairs around my mouth and under my chin (not attractive).</li>
            <li> I applied a thick amount to my upper life and chin.  </li>
            <li> I feel it is slightly watery</li>
            <li> My hair grows in as black or almost black on my face.  </li>
            <li> Every other brand either burned my skin, left hair behind, or both.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only wish it worked a little longer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using this for years after a recommendation of a friend. When I could no longer find it in stores, I used other brands. Every other brand either burned my skin, left hair behind, or both. When it finally dawned on me to check Amazon, I was so happy to find it! I used it the night it arrived, and just as I remember, after 4 minutes, all the hair was gone, and my skin didn&#x27;t hurt at all! This is a miracle product. A true money, and time saver too.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT THRILLED WITH THIS PRODUCT BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE, IF IT&#x27;S USED FREQUENTLY.   WHEN I USED IT, EVEN THO I LEFT IT ON FOR THE TIME THE PAPERWORK INSTRUCTED, IT BURNED MY FACE AND LEFT ME RED AND SWOLLEN.  I USED THE ENCLOSED CREAM TO SOOTHE IT WHEN I WAS DONE, BUT THAT DIDN&#x27;T DO THE JOB.  I HAD TO USE AQUAFOR FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO RETURN MY SKIN BACK TO NORMAL.  DOESN&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF THE FIRST TIME &amp; MUST REPEAT THE PROCESS IN A DAY OR SO.  I FOUND THAT IT ONLY REMOVES THE LONGER HAIR AND ANY SHORT ONES REMAIN.  IT&#x27;S BETTER THAN USING NO PRODUCT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Great price for the 3 pack... this item is hard to find in stores.I LOVE AMAZON and to date, I have never had a problem</li>
            <li> Works great. No burning or scarring.</li>
            <li> This is the first chemical hair remover I have used.  I followed the instructions to the T.  I do not have sensitive skin, it actually still runs a bit oily in the T zone.  I applied a thick amount to my upper life and chin.  Then used the scraper tool to remove and used the soothing cream afterwards. I did not use it any longer than the 4 minutes recommended in the instructions.  My results were that many of the fine hairs were still there but others were gone so it didn&#x27;t work on the entire area.  The parts it did work on were the baby fine hair.  The thicker darker hair (I have dark brown hair) were not touched at all and still required a tweezer to remove.  My face was very dried out and turned red to the point that even after moisturizing multiple times I had several family members comment on how red the rash was on my face. This product is not a tweezer replacement I had  hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> This facial hair remover is the only one that works on my face. I am blonde and have peach fuzz and some longer wiry hairs as I am nearing 50. I have used it for years now. These are the things you need to know: First of all if the cream dries on your face you will burn your skin. What I do is wipe a little water on my face with my fingers first and then apply the cream. That way it takes longer to dry and will not burn my skin. Never let it sit on your skin over 8 minutes. Apply it thickly or it will dry on the skin too fast and will burn. If it starts drying on your skin apply a little water to your finger and soften the cream back up by mixing that water with the drying cream. If you are just careful to apply it heavily, keep it on less than 8 minutes, and possibly dampen your face a little before starting you will have great results. I have tried Nair, Sally Hansen and a few others and none of them were strong enough for me. They were all a waste of money. This will definitely work, but be cautious and follow the advice above. I am a lifetime customer of this product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely delicate skin and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for facial heair removal that doesn&#x27;t blister my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product has been very effective for me. I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reaction in spite of leaving it on for well over the recommended 8 minutes maximum (I&#x27;ve left it on for upwards of 15, but I have a few hairs that are embarrassingly stubborn.)  The best thing about this depilatory is, since it keeps me from having to tweeze, I no longer have to worry about developing the ingrown hairs that I&#x27;m extremely prone to, which in turn would lead to hyperpigmentation scars as a result of trying to tweeze them out.  I&#x27;m sincerely happy that I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: B+</li>
            <li> I could feel it working right away. I left it on as indicated on the package and after it was removed I could see the hair had been removed but after a couple of minutes I started noticing raised red bumps. It was almost as embarrassing as the hair itself.</li>
            <li> I have never had a negative reaction with this product.  If I run out while traveling on the road, I will travel the miles to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for still making this product and not changing the formula.</li>
            <li> I am complety satisfied</li>
            <li> Have used for years with great success!</li>
            <li> I feel it is slightly watery it is not creamy as it was the ine I used to buy in&lt;br /&gt;Mexico</li>
            <li> Works for me. I did leave it on a little too long the first time and my skin got pink around the mouth area. However that faded quickly and no harm done. Easy to apply, convenient applicator.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wet face first and you shouldn&#x27;t have sensitivity issues.  May take a few times (not all in a row) to get everything, but then it is smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Was glad to know that you sell it on line,&lt;br /&gt;since I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores or pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it worked a little longer.</li>
            <li> owies my face burns ;[.&lt;br /&gt;it works for some.&lt;br /&gt;but, i have coarse hair so no.&lt;br /&gt;worked on my legs though.&lt;br /&gt;just not face.&lt;br /&gt;and left a nasty rash.&lt;br /&gt;healed though.&lt;br /&gt;use on legs not face.&lt;br /&gt;or tummy.&lt;br /&gt;or arms.&lt;br /&gt;or ahem that place.</li>
            <li> Very effective. I would recommend it to others. It was a great buy, very ecocnomical.  Very good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best depilatory I&#x27;ve found.  Unfortunately not readily available locally.  Would, and have, recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;VERY annoying to be dictated to as to how many words I must use!!!</li>
            <li> it gave me irritation, my face was very red for long time, didn&#x27;t work well on facial hair either. will try on my legs but not on face anymore.</li>
            <li> This does not work and it burned my face! I threw out what I had after one use. I do not recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and product was as expected.  It removes facial hair without the damage that waxing does to the skin above your lip.  A dermatologist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Just tried using this, first time no results. Gave it a second try and again nothing happened. I might as well have use body lotion and it wouldn&#x27;t have been as runny either.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in the past and it was ok, but now thin and watery and does nothing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy anywhere else.  Totally works for me.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> At first I absolutely loved this product. The first tube in the 3 pack was wonderful. The second tube does not work at all  !!! Sup wid dat??? I want to contact the seller and find out why but to no avail at this point. So do I try Tube # 3??? Will I ever get answers or a partial refund???  To be continued.............</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using surgi-cream for many years....best depillatory for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years (along with a prescription for Vaniqa).  Together they have kept the chin hairs at bay.  SurgiCream works better than any other similar product I have ever used.  When my local CVS stopped carrying (and Walgreen&#x27;s never had it) I turned to Amazon.  I was so happy to be able to get this from Amazon!  Actually, in general, Amazon is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for most products before I check local stores.  Now, if only Amazon would treat their warehouse workers more humanely ...</li>
            <li> 2 minutes, and burned like fire; and I have a tough skin... all 23 reviws at the time I purchased were POSITIVE, I shoulda known better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have ordered it from Amazon the last two or three years and would have given it a five star rating until now.  With my most recent order (Feb 2014), the product is extremely watery and just drips off my face.  It wasn&#x27;t just that the product was old, because the whole tube is watery.  Poor quality control vs change in formula?  Either way, this is unacceptable.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand of depilatory.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMED TO BE THE BEST CHOICE AND I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANY OF THEM.  NEVER USED IT BEFORE.&lt;br /&gt;IT SEEMS TO DO GOOD JOB OF HAIR REMOVAL FROM MY FACE.</li>
            <li> Mom would pluck her face not getting every one when she discovered this following the directions her face is smooth &amp; touchable. I would recommend this to any woman who has facial hair problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product for years and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.&lt;br /&gt;All hair removed in 8 minutes ,comes back slower and softer.  Very easy to use and non messy.&lt;br /&gt;I work for a leading cosmetic company as a makeup  artist and recommend Surgi-cream to my ladies with unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have light peach fuzz on my face and underneath my chin. I play golf and am in the sun and really notice the small hairs around my mouth and under my chin (not attractive). I was complaining about my peach fuzz to a friend who told me to shave. Shaving was not an option for me, so I researched on the internet and found Surgi Cream. I was excited when I received it, I read the directions &amp; made sure not to leave it on longer than 6 minutes. I was impressed that all my fine hairs were gone after one use! I applied the after cream &amp; the slight burning I had went right away. I definitely recommend this product. My makeup glides on &amp; my face looks super smooth. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The cream was very soft. when I  put in on my face it would drip.When I purchased it from the store  the cream was heavier.I keep it in the bathroom where I  always kept it.Its the only cream remover I like, but was disappointed it was so soft.</li>
            <li> the worst product I have ever met. Only after applying 4 minutes I got my upper lip chemically burnt and no idea how to help now. My upper lip is swollen and burnt yes it removed the hair but it heft bigger problem. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> The Extra Gentle formula simply doesn&#x27;t work well for me, so I thought I was ordering the regular formula. Unfortunately, I received the Extra Gentle formula. Buyers beware.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 50 years but could no longer find it in local stores, so I was elated to find it at Amazon.  After trying other products during the interval when I could not find surgi-creme, I can definitely say that it is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Joyce D. Matthews</li>
            <li> Although my hair is resistant the cream works very well. I have used it for years. Highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde w/ white blonde peach fuzz and after reading the positive reviews, decided to try SurgiCream, a big mistake! Put it on for 4 minutes per the instructions, washed it off and applied their aloe cream.  Within 15 minutes my face was red and burning; I looked like I had acid burns on my face. Washed my face again and applied Tea Tree oil which helped a bit.  My face looked like I had dried raspberry jam on it and I finally put vaseline on because my skin was blistered and cracking (I would normally never use vaseline, but I was desperate). Not only that, but it didn&#x27;t even completely remove the blonde peach fuzz, and left me w/ scratchy stubble, like a man in need of a shave.  It has been 10 days and my skin has mostly healed and I&#x27;ll be happy when the peach fuzz grows back so my face is soft again. I had to buy a pack of three boxes of this product and they went into the trash immediately! I&#x27;ll never try anything like this again.  I gave it one star only because I had to, no option to give it no stars.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Product works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. It is easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used every brand of dipilatory on the market and surgi cream is hands down the best. I will never use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years or so.  I was always embarrassed because I would get a mustache.  I tried several products over the years and they never worked for me.  My hair grows in as black or almost black on my face.  I use this cream about once a month and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as long as I don&#x27;t have any irritated skin.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly either.  I use this after I have showered.  I always leave it on for the full 8 minutes and I put on a thick coat.  I remove it with cotton makeup removers that are wet.  Very little of the after lotion goes a long way.  I have been really happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t use the tool it comes with though...</li>
            <li> I really love the cream. It hardly has any smell, which is great.</li>
            <li> The product did not remove my facial hair. It also burned my face for a whole night although I followed all instructions to the letter. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> good facial hair remover have used this for years and  always pleased with it. also used this on grandfather for his whiskers rather than shave him</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I love it...it is gentle enough to remove the hair on the face without any redness or problems...you must follow directions, of course.  It is excellent..kind of hard to find..so I appreciate being able to get it through Amazon!  My skin is fairly sensitive and I am over 70 and I will continue using this product for years to come!  Thank you for carrying it!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair removal cream that does not burn my skin.  Follow the directions on the box and it will remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li> I order this for my mom. She really likes this product. She has tried other brands, but this is the one she has chose to stay with so I have to order it on Amazon since it is no longer sold in the stores in our area. She says it&#x27;s the only one that works for her.</li>
            <li> Left bumps on my face and hair on my face. I used it 3 times....throwing the rest out! Try with caution.</li>
            <li> Surgi-cream smells a lot better than the other brand that I used.  It works fine, but not great.</li>
            <li> I will make this short and sweet. I have been using Nair for years to get rid my woman mustache and for years I have hated it because it burns and leaves my skin so red, but I thought it was my only option that actually worked. I tried a couple of other products including Sally&#x27;s, which did not work at all. I used Surgi cream recently and I am so happy with the results. It does not burn to put on and you only have to leave it on for 4 minutes. It comes with a little scraper and, when the 4 minutes are up, you simply scrape the hair off. When I used Nair, I would have to do it the day before so that the redness would be gone before I had to go out in public. A red upper lip is a bit embarrassing. With Surgi cream, that problem is over!  I highly recommend this product. I am so happy that I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I thought this stuff would be perfect.  Nope.  It burned my skin AND didn&#x27;t remove any of the hair.</li>
            <li> great price and arrived before scheduled date</li>
            <li> I order this product for my family members who live overseas whenever I go visit them. They say this is the most effective product they have used.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product as it removes hair within 4 minutes without being harsh or abrasive. I will be purchasing it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years, nothing else compares. Just don&#x27;t leave it on TOO long or it WILL burn ya.</li>
