            <li> Light, crisp scent that I use year round.  People always tell me how nice i smell when I use it!</li>
            <li> This is the freshest most inexpensive spray ever! Its so amazing and I cant find it anywhere in stores anymore so I buy a bunch online. It took forever to get here but it was worth the wait. Its a great go to spray when you just need to freshen up and arent able to take a shower and its also great right out of the shower. I always get sooo many compliments on how great I smell. Can&#x27;t believe its not a 50 dollar fragrance. Loveeee it!</li>
            <li> I love this sent, I can never find it in the stores.  I use it 1st thing in the morning to get me moving. It does energize !  And as usual it seems like I just ordered it ,  and it&#x27;s in the mail box.  Thank you for the sent, and thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I should probably buy some more now that I&#x27;m down to one bottle. It&#x27;s great for the days when I don&#x27;t want to wear heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> This stuff just makes me happy. When I&#x27;m in a not so good miss, all I have to do is spray this stuff all over myself and I&#x27;m SMILING!!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it online, but agree with another reviewer that this batch doesn&#x27;t seem to have the exact same scent as the original mist.  Anyway, I wish Dove would bring it back to stores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite scent! Stores do not carry it any more. Its a very fresh, clean and light fragrance, which is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I love this scent but I will not pay such a high price for what they are asking for it. Amazon is taking advantage of a discontinued product of Dove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it, I thought it was being discontinued and was concerned but you can still buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for some months now for my wife,she loves it she calls it her happy spray</li>
            <li> Perfect; cannot find in stores any more; thank you.</li>
            <li> Are u going to get more</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not me that loves it, I bought it for my sister who searched all over for this.  She doesn&#x27;t wear much fragrance due to allergies etc. but loves this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Just too bad it isn&#x27;t available U.S. retail anymore other than warehoused stashes that are sold on line for exorbitant prices.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll still pay it because I love it so much.  I always get compliments..women are always curious and ask what the heck it is I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so amazing.  I keep it a secret!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the same as the original. At. All! Too bad, because it used to be one of my favorite scents. I ended up throwing them all away. Dove! Shame on you for doing away with it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body spray - and I cannot find it in the stores anymore so am glad to find it online!</li>
            <li> Dove Body sprays are wonderful. They give a nice light fragrance that smells fresh and clean. Not heavy perfume or over bearing smells to worry about. Great to use in the summer months for mid day refreshing. Everyone asks about the mist. The only people who can really smell it are those who get close...like with a hug. I reccommend as a great way to have a fresh light smell.</li>
            <li> Light, citrus, summery -- just right for me.  Can&#x27;t wear heavy scents.</li>
            <li> This product is a KEEPER loveeeeeee the fresh clean smell of this !!!!....will buy more ...one draw back it don&#x27;t last long so have to refresh often!</li>
