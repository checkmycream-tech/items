            <li>The &amp;#34;lot of good&amp;#34; is that it is an effective deodorant which works (on me)</li>
            <li>and it does what it is designed to do as an effective deodorant</li>
            <li>Buying this in bulk saved me money and since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anyway, this is really the best deal around.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s fault but my own so lesson learned to read the (online) label carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may be old school, but I think this is the best deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Love the availability and price and not having to search for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; without all the build up</li>
            <li>But its not an overwhelming burn.  </li>
            <li>I love it that I can order this pack of 6 deodorants here</li>
            <li>we all love it.  </li>
            <li>MORE MAN LIKE,</li>
            <li>this is my sons favorite</li>
            <li>and now I see it in most grocery and drug stores.  </li>
            <li>And, it is still a better buy on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying writing reviews for some of the stuff I buy, but this time it&#x27;s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kidding aside, the 6-pack is a perfect and simple buy.  </li>
            <li>Screw buying it at the grocery store, this is better and cheaper and more convenient.</li>
            <li>Keeps me from smelling and the ladies love it as well.</li>
            <li>Was able to buy in bulk and save a ton of money over buying in  a brick and mortar store at $3-5/pc.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant,I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li>my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, isn&#x27;t too strong, lasts all day and the next morning, and is just really a great product.</li>
            <li>(I fly a lot), so to heck with the tiny travel deodorants that never come in your favorite kind.  </li>
            <li>Good, serviceable product, made more so by having the reserve sticks at the ready.</li>
            <li>&quot; scent, which always keeps me smelling nice and, well, fresh.</li>
            <li>Kept me smellin fresh and feelin nice.</li>
            <li>Best scene of old spice that there is, and don&#x27;t be fooled, the classic alcohol-based version IS better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for many years, because it does a lot of good and no harm.  </li>
            <li>I love the original stick formulation, which is greenish and gives a cool sensation when applied to the armpits.  </li>
            <li>Throw in free shipping</li>
            <li>After this product was no longer available in my area, for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so surprised by how good this deodorant works.</li>
            <li>The fresh scent is so much better than the original.</li>
            <li>I used to use Old Spice - Original which was good.</li>
            <li>*), it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been happy with their quality products and hope they are around for a long to come.</li>
            <li>What I love most is the tag line on the tube: If your grandfather had not used Old Spice, you would not be here!</li>
            <li>Old Spice has so many deodorants on the market now, supposedly catering to every type of smelly armpit there could ever claim to be!</li>
            <li>my favorite scent i wish old spice would more readily have it available in stores in my area for easy purchase</li>
            <li>Great price and delivery on a product that is getting harder to find at brick and mortar retailers.</li>
            <li>And it is still true.</li>
            <li>Great, Hard to get in many stores.</li>
            <li>I do not like high endurance because it seems like it stays on for more than 18 hours.</li>
            <li>Great on the skin,  not too wet or too dry...just right</li>
            <li>The smell is really fresh and creates a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>Can rarely find this at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the Endurance Fresh deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely hope that Old Spice will keep making this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Worth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been known to have sensitive skin (most body products I can&#x27;t use)</li>
            <li>Great idem no messy stain or white residue</li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; version of the FRESH scent.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake too thinking this was the Endurance Fresh product I picked up at my drug store.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and has an excellent, long lasting, not overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Just the right ingredients in this stick.</li>
            <li>My dad had it right.</li>
            <li>Stick to the classic, and you&#x27;ll be golden!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and the smell is actually pretty pungent.  </li>
            <li>The first morning I used these, boy was</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first two ingredients to this product are denatured alcohol and propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who do not want lots of anti-perspirant aluminum, this is a good stick for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is so old that it has faded from the original blue color to light green/grey!  </li>
            <li>That is why it has a unique reaction with some people&#x27;s sensitive skin, a different scent than what most are used to, and will produce a burning sensation if applied over any scrapes or wounds on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice original formula does not do that.  </li>
            <li>In my area almost all strores quit stocking this Classic Men&#x27;s Deodorant in the Fresh scent</li>
            <li>As mysterious as it is basic it possesses the power to make sweat smell good instead of just giving you cancer by using aluminum to stop it in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Old Spice for years (long before the amazing commercials), so got exactly what I wanted with this.  </li>
            <li>But in my opinion, it is superior to all the other Old Spice deodorants.</li>
            <li>Also reminded me of how brand loyal I&#x27;ve been to Old Spice.</li>
            <li>and it will last him a good long while.</li>
            <li>However these are a totally different smell, AND not as strong...</li>
            <li>I thought classic meant that it was original scent Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>The Classic, as they refer to it now, has always been the best, and there is only one other deodorant stick on the market with the same ingredients!</li>
            <li>For those few guys out there shopping for a new kind, however, Old Spice Classic Fresh is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is economic as well.</li>
            <li>Smells like straight business.  </li>
            <li>Also the no aluminum factor means your dryer won&#x27;t burn those yellow stains into the armpits of your light colored</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li>I had been using a particular scented Old Spice deodorant and thought I had ordered more of the same.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat this Classic Fresh Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>This is not regular Fresh scent!</li>
            <li>I order Old Spycefor  a long time and love it.</li>
            <li>It travels nicely, lasts a long time, and is usable almost to the last bit.  </li>
            <li>It seems like everyone wants just the  the high endurance antiperspirant stuff.</li>
            <li>Old Spice evidently started makeing it again</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I have had more and more trouble finding it, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>a classic that never goes out of style</li>
            <li>I like the classic scent of this</li>
            <li>A classic scent for a neoclassic gentlemen.</li>
            <li>Normally by the end of a hot day you could say my old deodorants &amp;#34;wore off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I guess this is my fault as the buyer, but I was assuming it would be the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m used to from using from the High Endurance variety.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this is great stuff if you can get past the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>I thought Fresh scent was the same whether it is the Endurance version or this non-endurance version.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for years, this is a mild flavor, alcohol based deodorant, it has a much more subtle, unoffensive smell and will keep you fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, but as long as they keep producing the Classic Fresh</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve gotten deodorant burn/irritation like me, it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re using the new non-alcohol deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s very favorite deodarant and it is so hard to find in any local stores anymore - all they have is the High Endurance</li>
            <li>This stuff does not last the whole day!</li>
            <li>recommend this but deodorants and anti-perspiration products are pretty personal.  </li>
            <li>I surprised!</li>
            <li>but sure enough the same thing happened the next morning!</li>
            <li>First, the burning went away for me after the 3rd day, milder each day.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Scent in the Old Spice original formula is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>, my only complaint is the scent seems much better and stronger when it first opened and seems to diminish in strength as you use it up</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant but subtle, and it tends to suppress odor for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li>For me personally, all they ever had to do was stick (pun intended) to the Original and Fresh Stick, and perhaps one or two other fragrances with the same ingredients!</li>
            <li>I never had any problem with Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m no longer doing athletics, Old Spice is just the ticket.  </li>
            <li>What man doesn&#x27;t wear old spice?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using anything but Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Like Old Spice because it is Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>It is way past its expiration date, and instead of smelling like Old Spice &#x27;Fresh&#x27;, it smells like straight isopropyl alcohol!  </li>
            <li>But this smell is far better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use 1 pc in nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic-Fresh deodorant for years...</li>
            <li>Everyone has a favorite deodorant and few would give it up on another individual&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used this version and the &amp;#34;High Endurance&amp;#34; version and to me atleast this version first of all smells 100% better, and will last me all day long doing a hard day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>The High Endurance version seems to last until you take your next shower and is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>And then, past that, there&#x27;s something prideful about having a clean, Old Spice smell to you.  </li>
            <li>The new one just isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>Pick up a single stick locally and give it a try before getting married to a 6-pack.</li>
            <li>it was the regular Old Spice \\&quot;Fresh\\</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind not having the turbo strength version...but have always had trouble finding this Fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve worn other deodorants that are more powerful at stopping sweat and suppressing odor, but they were like thick gel pastes of aluminum zirconium, left my shirts crusty or stained, and were just altogether unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally get the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; brand so be careful if you&#x27;re in the same boat.</li>

            <li> I sincerely hope that Old Spice will keep making this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Worth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been known to have sensitive skin (most body products I can&#x27;t use)</li>
            <li> Great idem no messy stain or white residue</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; version of the FRESH scent.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake too thinking this was the Endurance Fresh product I picked up at my drug store.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and has an excellent, long lasting, not overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Just the right ingredients in this stick.</li>
            <li> My dad had it right.</li>
            <li> Stick to the classic, and you&#x27;ll be golden!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and the smell is actually pretty pungent.  </li>
            <li> The first morning I used these, boy was</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first two ingredients to this product are denatured alcohol and propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who do not want lots of anti-perspirant aluminum, this is a good stick for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is so old that it has faded from the original blue color to light green/grey!  </li>
            <li> That is why it has a unique reaction with some people&#x27;s sensitive skin, a different scent than what most are used to, and will produce a burning sensation if applied over any scrapes or wounds on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice original formula does not do that.  </li>
            <li> In my area almost all strores quit stocking this Classic Men&#x27;s Deodorant in the Fresh scent</li>
            <li> As mysterious as it is basic it possesses the power to make sweat smell good instead of just giving you cancer by using aluminum to stop it in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice for years (long before the amazing commercials), so got exactly what I wanted with this.  </li>
            <li> But in my opinion, it is superior to all the other Old Spice deodorants.</li>
            <li> Also reminded me of how brand loyal I&#x27;ve been to Old Spice.</li>
            <li> and it will last him a good long while.</li>
            <li> However these are a totally different smell, AND not as strong...</li>
            <li> I thought classic meant that it was original scent Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> The Classic, as they refer to it now, has always been the best, and there is only one other deodorant stick on the market with the same ingredients!</li>
            <li> For those few guys out there shopping for a new kind, however, Old Spice Classic Fresh is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is economic as well.</li>
            <li> Smells like straight business.  </li>
            <li> Also the no aluminum factor means your dryer won&#x27;t burn those yellow stains into the armpits of your light colored</li>
            <li> Thanks for keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> I had been using a particular scented Old Spice deodorant and thought I had ordered more of the same.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this Classic Fresh Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> This is not regular Fresh scent!</li>
            <li> I order Old Spycefor  a long time and love it.</li>
            <li> It travels nicely, lasts a long time, and is usable almost to the last bit.  </li>
            <li> It seems like everyone wants just the  the high endurance antiperspirant stuff.</li>
            <li> Old Spice evidently started makeing it again</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I have had more and more trouble finding it, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> a classic that never goes out of style</li>
            <li> I like the classic scent of this</li>
            <li> A classic scent for a neoclassic gentlemen.</li>
            <li> Normally by the end of a hot day you could say my old deodorants &amp;#34;wore off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I guess this is my fault as the buyer, but I was assuming it would be the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m used to from using from the High Endurance variety.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is great stuff if you can get past the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> I thought Fresh scent was the same whether it is the Endurance version or this non-endurance version.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for years, this is a mild flavor, alcohol based deodorant, it has a much more subtle, unoffensive smell and will keep you fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, but as long as they keep producing the Classic Fresh</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve gotten deodorant burn/irritation like me, it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re using the new non-alcohol deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s very favorite deodarant and it is so hard to find in any local stores anymore - all they have is the High Endurance</li>
            <li> This stuff does not last the whole day!</li>
            <li> recommend this but deodorants and anti-perspiration products are pretty personal.  </li>
            <li> I surprised!</li>
            <li> but sure enough the same thing happened the next morning!</li>
            <li> First, the burning went away for me after the 3rd day, milder each day.</li>
            <li> The Fresh Scent in the Old Spice original formula is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint is the scent seems much better and stronger when it first opened and seems to diminish in strength as you use it up</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant but subtle, and it tends to suppress odor for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li> For me personally, all they ever had to do was stick (pun intended) to the Original and Fresh Stick, and perhaps one or two other fragrances with the same ingredients!</li>
            <li> I never had any problem with Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m no longer doing athletics, Old Spice is just the ticket.  </li>
            <li> What man doesn&#x27;t wear old spice?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using anything but Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Like Old Spice because it is Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> It is way past its expiration date, and instead of smelling like Old Spice &#x27;Fresh&#x27;, it smells like straight isopropyl alcohol!  </li>
            <li> But this smell is far better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use 1 pc in nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic-Fresh deodorant for years...</li>
            <li> Everyone has a favorite deodorant and few would give it up on another individual&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used this version and the &amp;#34;High Endurance&amp;#34; version and to me atleast this version first of all smells 100% better, and will last me all day long doing a hard day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> The High Endurance version seems to last until you take your next shower and is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> And then, past that, there&#x27;s something prideful about having a clean, Old Spice smell to you.  </li>
            <li> The new one just isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> Pick up a single stick locally and give it a try before getting married to a 6-pack.</li>
            <li> it was the regular Old Spice \\&quot;Fresh\\</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind not having the turbo strength version...but have always had trouble finding this Fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve worn other deodorants that are more powerful at stopping sweat and suppressing odor, but they were like thick gel pastes of aluminum zirconium, left my shirts crusty or stained, and were just altogether unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; brand so be careful if you&#x27;re in the same boat.</li>
            <li> and i know they all quit buying all other brands and order Old SPYCE.</li>
            <li> I always order them in bulks of six, because with the plethora of High Endurance products they have out now, I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll stop production on what really works, and always has!!</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the old round deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year or so Old Spice keeps trying to move you to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the classic Old Spice deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is completely useless - thanks to this deoderant, I smell when I&#x27;m barely even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to get in stores...  </li>
            <li> This is fresh scent which, in case you haven&#x27;t noticed is as useless as water against men&#x27;s body odor.  </li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Just a note based on some of the other reviews, this is NOT High Endurance, or &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The right one is here, but way too expensive on Amazon:</li>
            <li> Almost all other deodorants I have tried</li>
            <li> Turns out I mistakenly ordered the scent I used when I as a late teen.</li>
            <li> for the average guy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in my local stores anymore, just thirty different other kinds of old spice with really stupid names marketed towards kids.  </li>
            <li> I like this product as it is a deodorant not an anti-perspiration product which I seem to have a slight reaction to.  </li>
            <li> They give a slight (2/10) burning pain for me where I applied.</li>
            <li> and I do keep it capped tightly.</li>
            <li> Lately it&#x27;s been getting harder to find this one.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I mistakenly ordered the wrong scent.</li>
            <li> six bottles wasted.</li>
            <li> so a waste for me.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of my younger years that were not all that bad.</li>
            <li> Hopping out of the shower to find the deodorant stick is spent generally signals the start of a bad day.</li>
            <li> Missing from stores lately, thank God for Amazon.</li>
            <li> very subtle...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I order the wrong stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> However, it has become nearly impossible to find this in stores.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terrible, but if you&#x27;ve never used this deodorant before then it might take some getting used to.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great, Hard to get in many stores. Must be  too &amp;#34;Old School.&amp;#34;  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Can rarely find this at the drugstore.  Love the availability and price and not having to search for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; without all the build up</li>
            <li> I may be old school, but I think this is the best deodorant.  Smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t make your arm pits feel like the Sahara desert or some chemistry experiment.  I just hope they keep selling it.  It&#x27;s getting harder to get in stores...  Go Amazon!</li>
            <li> I never had any problem with Old Spice.  It works well and you can feel it working.  But its not an overwhelming burn.  Just the right ingredients in this stick.</li>
            <li> What else can I say?  I like the product (smells nice) and I like the price.  Throw in free shipping and I&#x27;m all kinds of happy.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that my husband will use. It smells good and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like the stronger antiperspirant/deodorants. However, it has become nearly impossible to find this in stores. It seems like everyone wants just the  the high endurance antiperspirant stuff. I love it that I can order this pack of 6 deodorants here and it will last him a good long while.</li>
            <li> It smells good, isn&#x27;t too strong, lasts all day and the next morning, and is just really a great product.</li>
            <li> I order Old Spycefor  a long time and love it. I recimended it to all my friends and colegs and i know they all quit buying all other brands and order Old SPYCE. we all love it.  tHE CALSSIC HAS A BIT DIFFERENT SMELL, MORE MAN LIKE, BUT IT&#x27;S STILL GREAT.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has so many deodorants on the market now, supposedly catering to every type of smelly armpit there could ever claim to be! For me personally, all they ever had to do was stick (pun intended) to the Original and Fresh Stick, and perhaps one or two other fragrances with the same ingredients! I always order them in bulks of six, because with the plethora of High Endurance products they have out now, I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll stop production on what really works, and always has!! The Classic, as they refer to it now, has always been the best, and there is only one other deodorant stick on the market with the same ingredients! It&#x27;s a shame, but as long as they keep producing the Classic Fresh (*crosses his fingers*), it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My husband uses this and I buy it from Amazon because the local stores are only carrying the \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; varieties irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> I guess this is my fault as the buyer, but I was assuming it would be the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m used to from using from the High Endurance variety.  This didn&#x27;t smell like that at all and the smell is actually pretty pungent.  Bummer since I purchased 6 of them.</li>
            <li> Lately it&#x27;s been getting harder to find this one.  But in my opinion, it is superior to all the other Old Spice deodorants.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent i wish old spice would more readily have it available in stores in my area for easy purchase</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  I wanted the Endurance Fresh deodorant.  Unfortunately I order the wrong stuff.  This stuff does not last the whole day! Oh well, my mistake.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I mistakenly ordered the wrong scent. I had been using a particular scented Old Spice deodorant and thought I had ordered more of the same. Turns out I mistakenly ordered the scent I used when I as a late teen. Great memories everyone I apply the deodorant. Also reminded me of how brand loyal I&#x27;ve been to Old Spice. I&#x27;ve always been happy with their quality products and hope they are around for a long to come.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Classic for a reason. Written on the back is &amp;#34;If your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t exist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I can use.  It&#x27;s effective, and it smells great. The fresh scent is so much better than the original.</li>
            <li> this is my sons favorite</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery on a product that is getting harder to find at brick and mortar retailers.</li>
            <li> Everyone has a favorite deodorant and few would give it up on another individual&#x27;s recommendation.  For those few guys out there shopping for a new kind, however, Old Spice Classic Fresh is definitely worth trying.  I love the original stick formulation, which is greenish and gives a cool sensation when applied to the armpits.  The smell is pleasant but subtle, and it tends to suppress odor for at least a full day.  To be honest, I&#x27;ve worn other deodorants that are more powerful at stopping sweat and suppressing odor, but they were like thick gel pastes of aluminum zirconium, left my shirts crusty or stained, and were just altogether unpleasant.  Now that I&#x27;m no longer doing athletics, Old Spice is just the ticket.  My dad had it right.</li>
            <li> Great on the skin,  not too wet or too dry...just right</li>
            <li> What man doesn&#x27;t wear old spice?  This is the best deodorant around.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything but Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Like Old Spice because it is Old Spice.  Brings back memories of my younger years that were not all that bad.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product!  It is way past its expiration date, and instead of smelling like Old Spice &#x27;Fresh&#x27;, it smells like straight isopropyl alcohol!  Completley unusable!  It is so old that it has faded from the original blue color to light green/grey!  No bueno!!</li>
            <li> Hopping out of the shower to find the deodorant stick is spent generally signals the start of a bad day. With the pack of six, that doesn&#x27;t happen. Good, serviceable product, made more so by having the reserve sticks at the ready.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for decades.  It is gentle on the skin and has an excellent, long lasting, not overpowering fragrance.  Almost all other deodorants I have tried sooner or later make my underarms itch, burn, and/or break out with a rash.  Old Spice original formula does not do that.  The Fresh Scent in the Old Spice original formula is hard to find.  No local stores carry it.  I am happy I can order it online.  I sincerely hope that Old Spice will keep making this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for many years, because it does a lot of good and no harm.  The &amp;#34;lot of good&amp;#34; is that it is an effective deodorant which works (on me) all day if I put it on in the morning.  The &amp;#34;no harm&amp;#34; is that it is never caused any skin irritation, and has never to my knowledge stained my clothes.  It travels nicely, lasts a long time, and is usable almost to the last bit.  Like other reviewers, I have had more and more trouble finding it, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy in bulk at a great price.</li>
            <li> when you find that thing that works, buy a 6 pack!  Plus, great value. Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great no stink. This lasts all day. It&#x27;s not over powering like a body spray or a perfume. Very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fresh and creates a cool feeling. I used to use Old Spice - Original which was good. But this smell is far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is economic as well. I can use 1 pc in nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s very favorite deodarant and it is so hard to find in any local stores anymore - all they have is the High Endurance and he does not like those because they leave stains under the arms of your undershirts.  You cannot beat this Classic Fresh Old Spice.  So glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Over the past year or so Old Spice keeps trying to move you to other similar products.  In my area almost all strores quit stocking this Classic Men&#x27;s Deodorant in the Fresh scent so I tried on-line and found I could save money by buying the six pack.  I like this product as it is a deodorant not an anti-perspiration product which I seem to have a slight reaction to.  After this product was no longer available in my area, for about 10 to 12 months guess what.  Old Spice evidently started makeing it again and now I see it in most grocery and drug stores.  And, it is still a better buy on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this but deodorants and anti-perspiration products are pretty personal.  You have to find what works best for you.</li>
            <li> been using OS since I started shaving and my father used it as well.  a classic that never goes out of style</li>
            <li> Best scene of old spice that there is, and don&#x27;t be fooled, the classic alcohol-based version IS better. If you&#x27;ve gotten deodorant burn/irritation like me, it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re using the new non-alcohol deodorants. Stick to the classic, and you&#x27;ll be golden!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying writing reviews for some of the stuff I buy, but this time it&#x27;s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This.  Is.  The.  Only.  Deodorant.  Worth.  Buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(...for the average guy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off all, the size has been perfectly travel safe at the airport (I fly a lot), so to heck with the tiny travel deodorants that never come in your favorite kind.  And then, past that, there&#x27;s something prideful about having a clean, Old Spice smell to you.  Smells like straight business.  Hang it from the chandelier, Dolly, Imma take a shot at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidding aside, the 6-pack is a perfect and simple buy.  Screw buying it at the grocery store, this is better and cheaper and more convenient.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Thought I was getting the old round deodorant.  The new one just isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> What I love most is the tag line on the tube: If your grandfather had not used Old Spice, you would not be here! And it is still true. Always a great product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the classic Old Spice deodorant. Keeps me from smelling and the ladies love it as well.</li>
            <li> I like the classic scent of this and it does what it is designed to do as an effective deodorant, my only complaint is the scent seems much better and stronger when it first opened and seems to diminish in strength as you use it up and I do keep it capped tightly.</li>
            <li> A classic scent for a neoclassic gentlemen. As mysterious as it is basic it possesses the power to make sweat smell good instead of just giving you cancer by using aluminum to stop it in it&#x27;s tracks. Also the no aluminum factor means your dryer won&#x27;t burn those yellow stains into the armpits of your light colored shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it almost 20 years and the label says it all: &amp;#34;If your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it you wouldn&#x27;t exist.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I actually bought these guys by accident. I don&#x27;t normally get the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; brand so be careful if you&#x27;re in the same boat. The first morning I used these, boy was I surprised! They give a slight (2/10) burning pain for me where I applied. I had to double check it wasn&#x27;t something else different from my morning routein but sure enough the same thing happened the next morning! The only thing I can figure is the alcohol ingredients that are used. You may be asking, why with this burning side effect would I still give it a good rating? First, the burning went away for me after the 3rd day, milder each day. I&#x27;ve been known to have sensitive skin (most body products I can&#x27;t use) so this reaction may not happen with everyone. Most important, this stuff works and works GREAT!. Normally by the end of a hot day you could say my old deodorants &amp;#34;wore off&amp;#34;. Not in this case! I&#x27;ve never been so surprised by how good this deodorant works. Bottom line, this is great stuff if you can get past the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Benn using this formula since 1958. Don&#x27;t need to smell any better! I like deodorant, not anti-perspirant....&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re suppose to sweat!!!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Material Quality is amazing . Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Stuck on this product and scent, but looses out in the shelf space war to 1,001 varieties of AXE!  No bargain, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice for years (long before the amazing commercials), so got exactly what I wanted with this.  Was able to buy in bulk and save a ton of money over buying in  a brick and mortar store at $3-5/pc.</li>
            <li> Great idem no messy stain or white residue</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the regular Old Spice \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent, which always keeps me smelling nice and, well, fresh. This is not regular Fresh scent! It is completely useless - thanks to this deoderant, I smell when I&#x27;m barely even sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The right one is here, but way too expensive on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F51UEE/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake - six bottles wasted.</li>
            <li> For those of us who do not want lots of anti-perspirant aluminum, this is a good stick for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The quote on the back of the cylinder says it all &amp;#34;If your Grandfather didn&#x27;t use it - you wouldn&#x27;t be here.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant since I started using deodorant.  That was about 20 years ago.  I can&#x27;t find this in my local stores anymore, just thirty different other kinds of old spice with really stupid names marketed towards kids.  Buying this in bulk saved me money and since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anyway, this is really the best deal around.  Just a note based on some of the other reviews, this is NOT High Endurance, or &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; scent.  This is the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; version of the FRESH scent.  Don&#x27;t be fooled though, I&#x27;ve used this version and the &amp;#34;High Endurance&amp;#34; version and to me atleast this version first of all smells 100% better, and will last me all day long doing a hard day&#x27;s work.  The High Endurance version seems to last until you take your next shower and is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I guess I am somewhat to blame (thus 2 not 1 star).  I thought Fresh scent was the same whether it is the Endurance version or this non-endurance version.  I was wrong.  I didn&#x27;t mind not having the turbo strength version...but have always had trouble finding this Fresh scent.  However these are a totally different smell, AND not as strong...so a waste for me.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake too thinking this was the Endurance Fresh product I picked up at my drug store.  It is not, but now I&#x27;m stuck with a 6-pack.  It wasn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s fault but my own so lesson learned to read the (online) label carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two ingredients to this product are denatured alcohol and propylene glycol.  That is why it has a unique reaction with some people&#x27;s sensitive skin, a different scent than what most are used to, and will produce a burning sensation if applied over any scrapes or wounds on the skin.  It isn&#x27;t terrible, but if you&#x27;ve never used this deodorant before then it might take some getting used to.  Pick up a single stick locally and give it a try before getting married to a 6-pack.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years, this is a mild flavor, alcohol based deodorant, it has a much more subtle, unoffensive smell and will keep you fresh and dry. Missing from stores lately, thank God for Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! Manly sent the girls like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they keep making the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for many years now!</li>
            <li> I thought classic meant that it was original scent Old Spice.  This is fresh scent which, in case you haven&#x27;t noticed is as useless as water against men&#x27;s body odor.  Big mistake buying this six pack.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Its really basic and gets the job done. I do not like high endurance because it seems like it stays on for more than 18 hours. This works well.</li>
            <li> Prices wasn&#x27;t as low as purchasing it separately.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant,I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon.I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic-Fresh deodorant for years...it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering scent...very subtle...Thanks for keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> Kept me smellin fresh and feelin nice.</li>
            <li> my favorite.  Great service!</li>
