            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review which in no way influenced my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>So far they work perfectly</li>

            <li>I love having a heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I love the heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>However, most of the time it wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>They need to redesign this product better.</li>
            <li>2 like rating i love love all the product</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I messaged the company with a concern and they responded very quickly, my issue was resolved (user error).</li>
            <li>so I strongly suggest using reusable ones.</li>
            <li>and it would work fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>These work great, but the packaging is in spanish and with permanent marker writing on them.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>The AAA battery wouldn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap, is cheap.</li>
            <li>It curls nicely without having to use much pressure.  </li>
            <li>(i have straight lashes that have a more downward slope).</li>
            <li>My lashed were still lifted after a night out and half of a day of &#x27;recovery&#x27; lol</li>
            <li>Gets just warm enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool for my first heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>they had some success but not too much</li>
            <li>and I did not realize that I needed to put batteries in it first.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend this item.</li>
            <li>It really curls the lashes.</li>
            <li>Mine only worked sometimes and went through batteries quick.</li>
            <li>i love these, but this one is a little unstable in that it never stays on</li>
            <li>I prefer normal metal curlers.</li>
            <li>It worked alright but didnt live up to my expectations</li>
            <li>so I just had to order a new one-</li>
            <li>I would try using it in the mornings,  change batteries putting in brand new ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it is easier to get all the eyelashes if you use a regular curler first</li>
            <li>This one is cheap and takes a while to arrive; i&#x27;ve had it a few months and the silicone has ripped</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time on it.</li>
            <li>You will not get a natural curl, maybe with A LOT of work</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised how well it works.  </li>
            <li>looks, feels, acts like an Asian knock off of something that could have been decent.  </li>
            <li>And if you are brave or dumb enough to hold it to your eye, it means the contraption basically traps your eyelashes with the rubber part completely stuck behind the white bar and doesn&#x27;t let go until you wriggle the slider free.</li>
            <li>The slider you push up to curl your eyelashes wobbles in its track, so when it reaches the top, the pink rubber part does not fit properly with the white plastic bar.</li>
            <li>It is a bit frustrating because you have to really push with your nail to get the right amount of pressure to curl your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;End result</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very awkward to use, and the instructions are in Spanish, so this makes it doubly hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes that have gone crazy curly on one side due to sleeping on them!  </li>
            <li> It was poorly made and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This item sucks!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It worked alright but didnt live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> So effective for curling lashes!  I ues it daily</li>
            <li> These work great, but the packaging is in spanish and with permanent marker writing on them. I had planned to use in a gift but now cannot.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic piece of junk.  I put new batteries in it and there was no light, no heat.  I tried it manually and lost a few eyelashes. All the writing on the package is in what looks like spanish, no english.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very awkward to use, and the instructions are in Spanish, so this makes it doubly hard to use. Don&#x27;t leave it on too long or you&#x27;ll burn your eyelids. Can&#x27;t really recommend this item. I&#x27;m sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> The opening is much too small and I can&#x27;t get all of my eyelashes through it.</li>
            <li> My item didn&#x27;t work what so ever! The AAA battery wouldn&#x27;t even fit. It was poorly made and didn&#x27;t work. I caution against purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> It sucked it does not work I guess I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one day.  I might have just got a lemon. I guess I need to try more of the products. Good prices. I ordered another one and it didn&#x27;t work at all. Not a lemon they just don&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, works great thanks!</li>
            <li> Somewhat cheaply made but works great on stubborn eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I love having a heated eyelash curler. It gives a great curl. This one is cheap and takes a while to arrive; i&#x27;ve had it a few months and the silicone has ripped so I just had to order a new one- this time around i&#x27;ve ordered 2. It has an on/off switch that I prefer. Also keep in mind that it eats through AAA batteries so I strongly suggest using reusable ones. I&#x27;ve also found that it is easier to get all the eyelashes if you use a regular curler first (i have straight lashes that have a more downward slope).</li>
            <li> bought for wife and three teenage daughters... they had some success but not too much</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT!! THIS IS MY SECOND TIME BUYING BECAUSE MY LAST ONE BROKE BUT THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO SHIP.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes that have gone crazy curly on one side due to sleeping on them!  I&#x27;ve been using this to get them back to where they should be.  It&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I love the heated eyelash curler. My lashes stay curled all day. I would recommend this product to my friends</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews that it worked. Mine only worked sometimes and went through batteries quick. When it worked it warmed up quickly and curled my eyelashes perfect. However, most of the time it wouldn&#x27;t come on. I would try using it in the mornings,  change batteries putting in brand new ones but it didn&#x27;t come on then later in the day if I had to shower and redo makeup and it would work fine. Sometimes it would come on and 5 minutes later it would go off and not come back on. Finally about 2 months after I got it one day it didn&#x27;t turn on ever again.</li>
            <li> Amazing. It really curls the lashes. Even falsies</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these with low expectations considering the price, but what I got in the mail was ridiculous. The slider you push up to curl your eyelashes wobbles in its track, so when it reaches the top, the pink rubber part does not fit properly with the white plastic bar. This means it gets stuck. And if you are brave or dumb enough to hold it to your eye, it means the contraption basically traps your eyelashes with the rubber part completely stuck behind the white bar and doesn&#x27;t let go until you wriggle the slider free. Completely useless, going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler does the job. Pretty cool for my first heated eyelash curler. I messaged the company with a concern and they responded very quickly, my issue was resolved (user error). Cheap price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me the end results I had when using a different heated eyelash curler. It is a bit frustrating because you have to really push with your nail to get the right amount of pressure to curl your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;End result, lashes do not stay up all day, if you even get them to properly curl at all. They need to redesign this product better.</li>
            <li> So far they work perfectly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this thing actually works.  Gets just warm enough to make a difference.  Doesn&#x27;t go through tons of batteries.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....looks, feels, acts like an Asian knock off of something that could have been decent.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my time/money</li>
            <li> 2 like rating i love love all the product so product it okay i love it thank maybe  all to it</li>
            <li> i love these, but this one is a little unstable in that it never stays on</li>
            <li> This item sucks!! Do not waste your time on it. It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not work properly</li>
            <li> This is great. I was skeptical, but this really works. My lashed were still lifted after a night out and half of a day of &#x27;recovery&#x27; lol</li>
            <li> Looks cheap, is cheap. You will not get a natural curl, maybe with A LOT of work you get an acceptable curl... I use it 3 days or a maximum a week and I leave it forgotten in a drawer. I prefer normal metal curlers.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a heated eyelash curler before so I was pleasantly surprised how well it works.  It takes a little practice to use but after several times I have gotten the hang of it.  It curls nicely without having to use much pressure.  My only negative part was that the package was not in English and I did not realize that I needed to put batteries in it first. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review which in no way influenced my unbiased opinion.</li>
