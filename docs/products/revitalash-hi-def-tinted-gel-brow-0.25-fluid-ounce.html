            <li> Mabelline offers a nice brow mascara that is less expensive without the sticky finish...though not as long lasting.</li>
            <li> Helps fill in grey hairs and makes brows look fuller</li>
            <li> The color is too dark and not enough</li>
            <li> The only negative is the sticky feeling after it dries.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very thin, this product really maximizes what I have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
            <li> As I age, my eyebrows turn white and thin out.</li>
            <li> The brow comb should be cleaned after each use, which is inconvenient; and the gel can&#x27;t fill in the sparse areas.</li>

            <li> Helps fill in grey hairs and makes brows look fuller</li>
            <li> finely a good solution for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Works well to color stray greys, and to hold brows in place all day.  The brow comb should be cleaned after each use, which is inconvenient; and the gel can&#x27;t fill in the sparse areas. I have used brow mascara/pencil combos, which are okay, but 2 steps (I have a 4 minute makeup routine). I am now going to try the Anastasia dip pomade with an angle brush to see if I can get the results I need in one step.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky. Not all that natural looking but once you take time to brush it out it seems to feel ok!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite eyebrow products.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best inventions in beauty products ever. As I age, my eyebrows turn white and thin out. This product gives my brows immediate results for the day and takes care of the color and thickness.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very thin, this product really maximizes what I have.  Exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> I like this and the coverage is pretty good.... It&#x27;s only been open for about 3 weeks and I feel it may be &amp;#34;drying up&amp;#34; already...</li>
            <li> Would have given it a 5 but too many steps. Comb, apply brus . Wish I had one with only one step . Otherwise it stay in place all da . Great projec .</li>
            <li> The color is too dark and not enough so you have to use it over and over again!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good thing! My brow in full control)</li>
            <li> Very good at keeping wild brows tame.  The color is perfect for dark brows, and does not tint the skin.</li>

            <li> One of best brow mascaras out there.  Looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that actually works. Give it 2-3 months. I have lashes and eyebrows again!</li>
            <li> A nice soft way to fill in eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It goes on smooth, not flaky.  Grooms brows and they stay put.  Like hair gel for your eyebrows. It fills in the gaps and provides great coverage.</li>
