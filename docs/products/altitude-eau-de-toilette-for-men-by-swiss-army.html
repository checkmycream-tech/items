            <li>I came as such it offered excellent recommend</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>When you order swiss army be sure to get the victorinox as there more thanone swiss army.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I got home and checked the price on amazon and found the Prime shipping and sell price considerably better than the department store.</li>
            <li>i love the smell.</li>
            <li>it comes in an awesome bottle that only swiss army does it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME FOR YOUR FRAGRANCE AND DURABILITY .</li>
            <li>muy bu eno el pro ducto llego en poco tie mpo lo recom iendo 100% confi able sigan asi exito</li>
            <li>It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army</li>
            <li>I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very good perfume for daily use, but not as well as others, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>She is fearless when it comes to destroying my dreams of wearing a great cologne, so I trust her when she says this smells great.  </li>
            <li>good quality care 100% recommended very responsible 100% secure</li>
            <li>What a sexy and unique bottle</li>
            <li>This is an easy to wear cologne, without worrying if it will be too strong.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle comes out of the casing too easily.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.</li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and am thrilled to have saved the dough.</li>
            <li>When you are using for the first time, it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on.</li>
            <li>It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li>Very good everything I expected.</li>
            <li>Those will be important details in a minute.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s light and not overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was really cheap.</li>
            <li>So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no es original....</li>
            <li>This is the original, no knock off.</li>
            <li>exellent 100% original q q q q</li>
            <li>Always original never damaged.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product as expected</li>
            <li>In 1993, when I was 17, Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water was all the rage at my school.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell</li>
            <li>It evoked feelings of clean, fresh and full of life.</li>
            <li>Its a light, crisp, clean smell with notes of citrus, spices, and the slightest of musks all together presenting an image of sophistication and refinement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fresh and unique without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>However, the smell diminishes rather quickly and seems gone by mid-day.  </li>
            <li>And honestly, Swiss Army Classic most likely will not become your signature scent</li>
            <li>Clean crisp scent.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I purchase a product from this brand, all are quality fragrances, particularly this is the one I like more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it is still my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 year old guy who&#x27;s married to my high-school sweetheart--a gorgeous, sweet 28 year old gal.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice smell.</li>
            <li>As we&#x27;ve been together for 12 years and have an honest relationship, she has no problem telling me when I smell good (or worse).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and clean and original and super high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice light fresh scent for everyday.</li>
            <li>From the first spray I could tell it didn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li>you very much greetings...</li>
            <li>One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne.</li>
            <li>This edt is nice and smells very clean, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>Got it as a present from my wife and love every oz.</li>
            <li>Most likely it&#x27;s going to displace Calvin Klein&#x27;s &amp;#34;Man&amp;#34; I used for ages.</li>
            <li>I am married</li>
            <li>since i tried this many years back till today i never stop using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago.</li>
            <li>Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li>super high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Must be a new version, have had my old one for quite a while, well over a year for sure, if not two, so</li>
            <li>Very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about cologne.</li>
            <li>Large bottle size can last for a good long while</li>
            <li>I certainly will not be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li>The original Swiss Army Classic (created by Victorinox--the one on this page) and the new Swiss Army Classic, or, the redone-formula-type Swiss Army Classic, sold by Swiss Army.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>If you fancy yourself a real man, put the firepower of the world&#x27;s lone, permanently neutral country in your arsenal and buy it today.</li>
            <li>thank you you are very punctual</li>
            <li>thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like the smell of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>It is similar to the original in ways although I believe the same quality can come from cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve purchased new ones from Amazon.com; all of them smell just like the first though the labeling has changed.</li>
            <li>for performance, Swiss Army is better than average.</li>
            <li>Buy the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic and you are guaranteed the real/original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The notes of Swiss Army Classic include mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger.</li>
            <li>Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br</li>

            <li>100% genuine products, every single time.</li>
            <li>It has a certain old school classy touch to it, generally lasting for a good 7-8 hours, which is good enough for me (I generally apply it behind the ears and on my neck).</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Will do a little more research and pass on the results.</li>
            <li>Plus, since I was really into Snoop Dogg at the time, and he plugged it in his song \\&quot;Lodi Dodi\\&quot;, I had to get it, and that was my scent until my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased, now, over half a dozen signature fragrances directly from Amazon.com and have been 100% satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li>I have purchased, now, over half a dozen signature fragrances directly from Amazon.com and have been 100% satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li>Most cologne is unappealing and overpowering, but the Swiss Army Classic seems to have done everything just right.</li>
            <li>I think when it was new it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>It seems like every 10 years I pick up a new scent.</li>
            <li>Checked the almost empty one I have and sure enough, the label on the bottom says Victorinox</li>
            <li>I personally like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this fragrance for my husband at the department store and not many stores carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>The hint of mint is a little strong.</li>
            <li>Hard to review a scent, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I still had an old bottle I compared it to</li>
            <li>fragrance is masculine but not of &amp;#34;hey-smell-my-fragrance&amp;#34; type.</li>
            <li>It really works for all occasions and it does last pretty long too.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a medium powered scent that is very Versatile.</li>
            <li>No missing serial number.</li>
            <li>So make sure it says: \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; or else you risk the chance of getting a counterfeit or shoddy</li>

            <li>So make sure it says: \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; or else you risk the chance of getting a counterfeit or shoddy product.</li>
            <li>my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I felt alive again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reminds me of my frequent trips to Switzerland.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review.</li>
            <li>so I bought this one and can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference, though the label is different (it actually says Victorinox right on the front of the bottle)</li>
            <li>But as long as you are purchasing Swiss Army Classic (or any other fragrance) directly from Amazon.com and not some 3rd party retailer--you will be fine.</li>
            <li>But as long as you are purchasing Swiss Army Classic (or any other fragrance) directly from Amazon.com and not some 3rd party retailer--you will be fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so.</li>
            <li>I had to pause though when I saw that there are apparently two different brands, both with the exact same look and everything...</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is the original Swiss Army or not</li>
            <li>Forward roughly 10 years and enter Victorinox Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li>you smell the caps of several bottles and pass on all his generic already-been-done-to-death signature Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren Polo fragrances and stumble upon Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li>Swiss Army Classic is a casual fragrance, so the longevity already isn&#x27;t THAT long (6 hours average), but with this new Swiss Army formula, it smells super synthetic and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original Victorinox concoction.</li>
            <li>Back to being young and single.</li>

            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> When you order swiss army be sure to get the victorinox as there more thanone swiss army.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I got home and checked the price on amazon and found the Prime shipping and sell price considerably better than the department store.</li>
            <li> i love the smell.</li>
            <li> it comes in an awesome bottle that only swiss army does it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> muy bu eno el pro ducto llego en poco tie mpo lo recom iendo 100% confi able sigan asi exito</li>
            <li> It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army</li>
            <li> I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very good perfume for daily use, but not as well as others, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> She is fearless when it comes to destroying my dreams of wearing a great cologne, so I trust her when she says this smells great.  </li>
            <li> good quality care 100% recommended very responsible 100% secure</li>
            <li> What a sexy and unique bottle</li>
            <li> This is an easy to wear cologne, without worrying if it will be too strong.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle comes out of the casing too easily.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.</li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and am thrilled to have saved the dough.</li>
            <li> When you are using for the first time, it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on.</li>
            <li> It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li> Very good everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Those will be important details in a minute.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s light and not overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was really cheap.</li>
            <li> So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no es original....</li>
            <li> This is the original, no knock off.</li>
            <li> exellent 100% original q q q q</li>
            <li> Always original never damaged.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> In 1993, when I was 17, Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water was all the rage at my school.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell</li>
            <li> It evoked feelings of clean, fresh and full of life.</li>
            <li> Its a light, crisp, clean smell with notes of citrus, spices, and the slightest of musks all together presenting an image of sophistication and refinement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fresh and unique without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> However, the smell diminishes rather quickly and seems gone by mid-day.  </li>
            <li> And honestly, Swiss Army Classic most likely will not become your signature scent</li>
            <li> Clean crisp scent.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I purchase a product from this brand, all are quality fragrances, particularly this is the one I like more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it is still my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old guy who&#x27;s married to my high-school sweetheart--a gorgeous, sweet 28 year old gal.  </li>
            <li> Such a nice smell.</li>
            <li> As we&#x27;ve been together for 12 years and have an honest relationship, she has no problem telling me when I smell good (or worse).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp and clean and original and super high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice light fresh scent for everyday.</li>
            <li> From the first spray I could tell it didn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li> you very much greetings...</li>
            <li> One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne.</li>
            <li> This edt is nice and smells very clean, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Got it as a present from my wife and love every oz.</li>
            <li> Most likely it&#x27;s going to displace Calvin Klein&#x27;s &amp;#34;Man&amp;#34; I used for ages.</li>
            <li> I am married</li>
            <li> since i tried this many years back till today i never stop using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago.</li>
            <li> Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li> super high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must be a new version, have had my old one for quite a while, well over a year for sure, if not two, so</li>
            <li> Very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about cologne.</li>
            <li> Large bottle size can last for a good long while</li>
            <li> I certainly will not be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> The original Swiss Army Classic (created by Victorinox--the one on this page) and the new Swiss Army Classic, or, the redone-formula-type Swiss Army Classic, sold by Swiss Army.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> If you fancy yourself a real man, put the firepower of the world&#x27;s lone, permanently neutral country in your arsenal and buy it today.</li>
            <li> thank you you are very punctual</li>
            <li> thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this cologne.  </li>
            <li> It is similar to the original in ways although I believe the same quality can come from cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve purchased new ones from Amazon.com; all of them smell just like the first though the labeling has changed.</li>
            <li> for performance, Swiss Army is better than average.</li>
            <li> Buy the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic and you are guaranteed the real/original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The notes of Swiss Army Classic include mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger.</li>
            <li> Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br</li>

            <li> 100% genuine products, every single time.</li>
            <li> It has a certain old school classy touch to it, generally lasting for a good 7-8 hours, which is good enough for me (I generally apply it behind the ears and on my neck).</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Will do a little more research and pass on the results.</li>
            <li> Plus, since I was really into Snoop Dogg at the time, and he plugged it in his song \\&quot;Lodi Dodi\\&quot;, I had to get it, and that was my scent until my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased, now, over half a dozen signature fragrances directly from Amazon.com and have been 100% satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased, now, over half a dozen signature fragrances directly from Amazon.com and have been 100% satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> Most cologne is unappealing and overpowering, but the Swiss Army Classic seems to have done everything just right.</li>
            <li> I think when it was new it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> It seems like every 10 years I pick up a new scent.</li>
            <li> Checked the almost empty one I have and sure enough, the label on the bottom says Victorinox</li>
            <li> I personally like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this fragrance for my husband at the department store and not many stores carry it any more.  </li>
            <li> The hint of mint is a little strong.</li>
            <li> Hard to review a scent, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I still had an old bottle I compared it to</li>
            <li> fragrance is masculine but not of &amp;#34;hey-smell-my-fragrance&amp;#34; type.</li>
            <li> It really works for all occasions and it does last pretty long too.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a medium powered scent that is very Versatile.</li>
            <li> No missing serial number.</li>
            <li> So make sure it says: \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; or else you risk the chance of getting a counterfeit or shoddy</li>

            <li> So make sure it says: \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; or else you risk the chance of getting a counterfeit or shoddy product.</li>
            <li> my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I felt alive again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my frequent trips to Switzerland.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review.</li>
            <li> so I bought this one and can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference, though the label is different (it actually says Victorinox right on the front of the bottle)</li>
            <li> But as long as you are purchasing Swiss Army Classic (or any other fragrance) directly from Amazon.com and not some 3rd party retailer--you will be fine.</li>
            <li> But as long as you are purchasing Swiss Army Classic (or any other fragrance) directly from Amazon.com and not some 3rd party retailer--you will be fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so.</li>
            <li> I had to pause though when I saw that there are apparently two different brands, both with the exact same look and everything...</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the original Swiss Army or not</li>
            <li> Forward roughly 10 years and enter Victorinox Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li> you smell the caps of several bottles and pass on all his generic already-been-done-to-death signature Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren Polo fragrances and stumble upon Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li> Swiss Army Classic is a casual fragrance, so the longevity already isn&#x27;t THAT long (6 hours average), but with this new Swiss Army formula, it smells super synthetic and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original Victorinox concoction.</li>
            <li> Back to being young and single.</li>
            <li> and so is the cap (but as far as the picture goes, so is the other one).</li>
            <li> The new formula is a little bit cheaper (cheaper than the Victorinox bottle on this page)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m also into Jovan Musk, Drakkar, and Grey Flannel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> department store bottle has long since run out</li>
            <li> I might try the other one next time just for a test, but eh, might not.</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to last as long as the last one I had (a few years ago).</li>
            <li> I have tried a few expensive brands which do last much longer but do not smell half as decent.</li>
            <li> its a fake without any doubt , the fragrance don&#x27;t last 10 minutes , in the the bottle at first sight you recognize</li>
            <li> That lasted me from my single 20&#x27;s until settling down in the suburbs and getting married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Swiss Army Classic is that cologne you find in your sorta-good friend&#x27;s dorm room one night while you&#x27;re waiting for him to come out of the shower so you can meet up with the rest of your sorta-real friends, after you haphazardly forgot to put some cologne on yourself, so you take a gander at his somewhat modest collection of fragrances and realize the usual crap just doesn&#x27;t cut it for you anymore, and you&#x27;d maybe like to try something different, or more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super soapy-smelling.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price of the dept. stores.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it could be remixed and repackaged slightly to help with these shortcomings.  </li>
            <li> This sad, fat man picked up a tester bottle of Victorinox Swiss Army Classic, and smelled the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 12 years using the product, so, I can say that this article is not original ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;You spritz a little on your wrist and voila</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for the daylight!</li>
            <li> I usually use it for gym and when I stay at home or after the shower.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll usually still smell it at night when I go to bed unless I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for some hard facts: There are two types of Swiss Army Classics.</li>
            <li> I spray 2 or 3 pumps on my chest, one on a wrist and then rub my wrists together, and once behind each ear</li>
            <li> (sorry girls...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> #34;normally hate men&#x27;s cologne.&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is the first time I purchase a product from this brand, all are quality fragrances, particularly this is the one I like more</li>
            <li> Great price for this cologne.</li>
            <li> The fragrance it is exquisite and it is smells very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;The package of delivery it is ideal size.&lt;br /&gt;My rating is four stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1-Product Quality&lt;br /&gt;2-Shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;3-Time Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulation!</li>
            <li> After 12 years using the product, so, I can say that this article is not original ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despues de 12 años usando el producto, aproximadamente, puedo decir que este artículo no es original....</li>
            <li> Got it as a present from my wife and love every oz. of it! Most likely it&#x27;s going to displace Calvin Klein&#x27;s &amp;#34;Man&amp;#34; I used for ages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for years and love it.  From the first spray I could tell it didn&#x27;t smell right.  I still had an old bottle I compared it to and they smell very different.  I would return it, but I guess because it&#x27;s flammable Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and have used it on a daily basis since then.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is masculine but not of &amp;#34;hey-smell-my-fragrance&amp;#34; type. It has a certain old school classy touch to it, generally lasting for a good 7-8 hours, which is good enough for me (I generally apply it behind the ears and on my neck). I have tried a few expensive brands which do last much longer but do not smell half as decent. It is not overpowering but has good presence without being vulgar - if you know what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this out, especially at this price you won&#x27;t feel bankrupt !</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance that is loved by men &amp; WOMEN.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my son who swears he receives great&lt;br /&gt;reviews from the ladies</li>
            <li> I came as such it offered excellent recommend</li>
            <li> a very nice clean daytime or office cologne.  This is an easy to wear cologne, without worrying if it will be too strong.</li>
            <li> superb, the product arrived on time and good conditions. Irecommend it</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. This is the original, no knock off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected. comprenlo - guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Great price and a great scent! It really works for all occasions and it does last pretty long too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a medium powered scent that is very Versatile. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the pitch. Swiss Army Classic is that cologne you find in your sorta-good friend&#x27;s dorm room one night while you&#x27;re waiting for him to come out of the shower so you can meet up with the rest of your sorta-real friends, after you haphazardly forgot to put some cologne on yourself, so you take a gander at his somewhat modest collection of fragrances and realize the usual crap just doesn&#x27;t cut it for you anymore, and you&#x27;d maybe like to try something different, or more original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you smell the caps of several bottles and pass on all his generic already-been-done-to-death signature Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren Polo fragrances and stumble upon Swiss Army Classic. What a sexy and unique bottle design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spritz a little on your wrist and voila~you are sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for some hard facts: There are two types of Swiss Army Classics. The original Swiss Army Classic (created by Victorinox--the one on this page) and the new Swiss Army Classic, or, the redone-formula-type Swiss Army Classic, sold by Swiss Army. The new formula is a little bit cheaper (cheaper than the Victorinox bottle on this page) but there&#x27;s a reason! Swiss Army Classic is a casual fragrance, so the longevity already isn&#x27;t THAT long (6 hours average), but with this new Swiss Army formula, it smells super synthetic and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original Victorinox concoction. Buy the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic and you are guaranteed the real/original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to buy this fragrance because you will receive compliments (from men and women alike). This is more of a daytime &amp; office-type fragrance but you can wear Swiss Army Classic whenever you want--it&#x27;s that good! And honestly, Swiss Army Classic most likely will not become your signature scent but it is 100% something I think every man should have as part of his collection. It&#x27;s not musky. It&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s not super soapy-smelling. It&#x27;s crisp and clean and original and super high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: This is something I wish reviews would actually say sometimes. I like to worry a lot. I like to think that if I am buying a fragrance on the internet for 1/3 of the retail price, I am going to be ripped off. This does happen, quite a lot, frankly. But as long as you are purchasing Swiss Army Classic (or any other fragrance) directly from Amazon.com and not some 3rd party retailer--you will be fine. I have purchased, now, over half a dozen signature fragrances directly from Amazon.com and have been 100% satisfied with all of them. No tampered package. No half-opened container. No missing serial number. 100% genuine products, every single time. So make sure it says: \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; or else you risk the chance of getting a counterfeit or shoddy product.d super high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: This is something I wish reviews would actually say sometimes.

            <li> I love this perfume! I use it everyday for the daylight! It is a good fragrance that everybody loves and always ask What perfume is that? It is just perfect!</li>
            <li> Hard to review a scent, but this one is my favorite.  I am married (sorry girls...) so I have not tested this in pick up bars.</li>
            <li> This edt is nice and smells very clean, but it does not last long. Now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there once I&#x27;m in public. I think when it was new it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my husband love this perfume, came perfect package an everything else was wonderful. Great for the price</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself a \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; guy. It seems like every 10 years I pick up a new scent. In 1993, when I was 17, Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water was all the rage at my school. Plus, since I was really into Snoop Dogg at the time, and he plugged it in his song \\&quot;Lodi Dodi\\&quot;, I had to get it, and that was my scent until my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my early 20&#x27;s, I found Polo Sport. That lasted me from my single 20&#x27;s until settling down in the suburbs and getting married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Forward roughly 10 years and enter Victorinox Swiss Army Classic. I found myself bald, fat and holding a bag and scolding my kids at a Kohl&#x27;s while my wife squandered our hard-earned savings away. This sad, fat man picked up a tester bottle of Victorinox Swiss Army Classic, and smelled the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me back. Back to being young and single. It evoked feelings of clean, fresh and full of life. I felt some long-dead hair follicles on my traditional horseshoe pattern of male-pattern baldness tingle. I felt alive again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got home and checked the price on amazon and found the Prime shipping and sell price considerably better than the department store. It looked like the same thing from the store, and smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the scent for a week now, and while no one has commented or asked me about my cologne, I&#x27;ve lain with a woman, in Biblical terms, once during that time period. So something must be working. If you fancy yourself a real man, put the firepower of the world&#x27;s lone, permanently neutral country in your arsenal and buy it today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it is still my favorite by far. FWIW, I&#x27;m also into Jovan Musk, Drakkar, and Grey Flannel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and am thrilled to have saved the dough. I had to pause though when I saw that there are apparently two different brands, both with the exact same look and everything...WTH??? Checked the almost empty one I have and sure enough, the label on the bottom says Victorinox so I bought this one and can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference, though the label is different (it actually says Victorinox right on the front of the bottle) and so is the cap (but as far as the picture goes, so is the other one). Must be a new version, have had my old one for quite a while, well over a year for sure, if not two, so whatevs, am sticking with Victorinox. I might try the other one next time just for a test, but eh, might not. If anyone else has already, definitely let me know your thoughts.</li>
            <li> It was to my boyfriend, now he smells delicious.! he is happy and of course I like this! thank you you are very punctual</li>
            <li> smells great  i get alot of compliments from women.. cant beat it for the price either&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I used it for years, but not forever fragrance use. When you are using for the first time, it&#x27;s nice and I like it, but eventually tend to reject it. Smells good but not for me, this time I bought it for my uncle on him he smells good and likes! Just try it and see if you like!</li>
            <li> i love the smell. it comes in an awesome bottle that only swiss army does it. it came early than expected in a secured package.</li>
            <li> I had a girlfriend buy this for me several years ago now. She said she smelled it and at once knew it was for me. Its a light, crisp, clean smell with notes of citrus, spices, and the slightest of musks all together presenting an image of sophistication and refinement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The department store bottle has long since run out and I&#x27;ve purchased new ones from Amazon.com; all of them smell just like the first though the labeling has changed. I&#x27;ve had several girlfriends since then all of them have loved the smell, it has become my smell and I love it.</li>
            <li> it was a gift, and like so much, this amazing, great smell, very nice product. to use diary. recommended :D</li>
            <li> since i tried this many years back till today i never stop using it&lt;br /&gt;with all my collection i have this always will be around</li>
            <li> its a fake without any doubt , the fragrance don&#x27;t last 10 minutes , in the the bottle at first sight you recognize that is a fake , pay 10 dollars more and buy another fragrance but not for this seller (amazon)</li>
            <li> Whenever I need to buy something to make me smell good this is always in the top three.  Smells good and get many complements about what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old guy who&#x27;s married to my high-school sweetheart--a gorgeous, sweet 28 year old gal.  Those will be important details in a minute.  I was running low on my more expensive colognes (D&amp;G, Versace, Kenneth Cole, etc.) so I ordered this in an effort to smell nice and not break my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loved it.  As we&#x27;ve been together for 12 years and have an honest relationship, she has no problem telling me when I smell good (or worse).  She is fearless when it comes to destroying my dreams of wearing a great cologne, so I trust her when she says this smells great.  I like it because it&#x27;s light and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the low price, there is no way to beat this.  I could have paid twice what I did and still be happy.</li>
            <li> buenas tarde gracias por todo muy buena esta colonias  estoy encantado con el servicio prestado sin mas nada que decir me despido</li>
            <li> Satisfacely me, the expectative  is Ok</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell. Large bottle size can last for a good long while</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was really cheap. For $20 bucks you can used it for daily use. I usually use it for gym and when I stay at home or after the shower.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this fragrance for my husband at the department store and not many stores carry it any more.  Was so happy to find it on Amazon and it&#x27;s half the price of the dept. stores.  It&#x27;s one of his very favorite fragrances. Clean crisp scent.</li>
            <li> good product, fulfilled my expectations, thank the seller for me to get my time item. thank you</li>
            <li> very good and responsibility</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived in good condition, meets all requirements widely recommended. thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my frequent trips to Switzerland.  When I can find a good price on this fragrance - I snap up a bottle.  It is fresh and unique without being overpowering.  I personally like this product very much.  Like any cologne - beauty is in the nose of the beholder.  I do get compliments from the ladies!  and that is the best endorsement any guy could get.</li>
            <li> I ordered the standard Swiss Army cologne and received this instead. Not a bad smell but I prefer what I have been using for years. The hint of mint is a little strong. Initially it smells like mint soap. It is similar to the original in ways although I believe the same quality can come from cheap aftershave. I certainly will not be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
            <li> This is a very good perfume for daily use, but not as well as others, but it&#x27;s ok. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Always excellent! Always original never damaged. Highly recommend! I have never been disappointed. Keep up the great job! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Most cologne is unappealing and overpowering, but the Swiss Army Classic seems to have done everything just right. A spray a day does the trick. I lasts forever, and I receive many compliments from people who &amp;#34;normally hate men&#x27;s cologne.&amp;#34; Bargain price to boot.</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend the most</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s ever. None of the newer products come close to this one. When I have it on everyone asks, what cologne do you have on.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME FOR YOUR FRAGRANCE AND DURABILITY . I am apacionado TO THIS BRAND . EXCELLENT SELLER RESPONSIBLE IN THE DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the original Swiss Army or not but it does not seem to last as long as the last one I had (a few years ago). I have a feeling this is either a knock off or they are diluting the concentration. Will do a little more research and pass on the results.</li>
            <li> excellent product reached me in time</li>
            <li> it was perfect for a Christmas gift. my husband satisifed, smells delicious .. I came in perfect condition. recommend this product</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this cologne.  Very fresh and masculine. However, the smell diminishes rather quickly and seems gone by mid-day.  Also, the bottle comes out of the casing too easily.  Perhaps it could be remixed and repackaged slightly to help with these shortcomings.  Regardless I will purchase again since I like the smell.</li>
            <li> excellent product I love</li>
            <li> muy bu eno el pro ducto llego en poco tie mpo lo recom iendo 100% confi able sigan asi exito</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about cologne. More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on. So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so. I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review. One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne. It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago. And in all those years of wearing it, I still get compliments (especially from women) just about every time I leave the house. What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, Swiss Army is better than average. I spray 2 or 3 pumps on my chest, one on a wrist and then rub my wrists together, and once behind each ear and it last all day, about 12 hours (give or take). And I&#x27;ll usually still smell it at night when I go to bed unless I&#x27;ve showered. It also projects quite well; I was about 8 people back in a Starbucks line when the cashier remarked that someone in the store &amp;#34;smells freaking amazing&amp;#34;, then identified me as the source when I (finally) made it to the register.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriends have always said this was the sexiest cologne I use, and even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy. Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ideal scent is crisp, refreshing and somewhat citrusy with notes of musk and a touch of warm spice. If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette. The notes of Swiss Army Classic include mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger. Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby. It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.hat I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ideal scent is crisp, refreshing and somewhat citrusy with notes of musk and a touch of warm spice.
