    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product, it does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling as well.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>the bht works great for my purposes.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking to shear off your man-hair-sweater, this is probably a great bet for you...</li>
            <li>I use this as a shaver and it&#x27;s a great price for a beard trimmer and shaver...</li>
            <li>The warranty is great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy-</li>
            <li>According to him its a really good trimmmer and does a good job.</li>
            <li>good experience, although I&#x27;m using ......</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product.    </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Even with that drawback I am very happy with my purchase as it is a great value, and compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li>, I bought this machine and used it effectively</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a body hair shaver for a while, and this did the trick nicely.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really liked.</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For twelve bucks it&#x27;s great - if the price were higher though I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I find the trimming capability of the Remington to be better than the Bodygroom.  </li>
            <li>would recommend that if you plan to simply trim your groin area, then your best bet is to go with the Remington as it is the better trimmer.  </li>
            <li>You cannot bring it with you when traveling to Europe or most part of the world.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my beard mostly and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better groomer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>If your desire is to shave your groin area as smooth as possible with an electric instrument, than your best bet is to go with the Norelco Bodygroom as it is the better shaver.  </li>
            <li>It looks good, it seems to hold a charge very well, not too many parts, and it comes in a neat pouch.  </li>
            <li>cool!</li>
            <li>The blades cut well, but don&#x27;t bite into your skin and the adjustements work fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>but this is fine for me.</li>
            <li>I HAD A TIMMER WITH NO COMB, which would have been fine.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as the Norelco foil head, nor is it as irritation free as the Norelco foil head.  </li>
            <li>In order to keep the groin region hair free, you would have to shave that area every day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It gets it smooth, but not as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this thing is today.  </li>
            <li>First product I bought off Amazon, and it is amazing, the delivery was quick and on time.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can take it in the shower is a plus and it comes with a nice brush and decent sized oil bottle.     </li>
            <li>A good clean cut, the dial for adjustments is easy and the setting doesnt change on you in mid stroke.</li>
            <li>Get a can of oil though to keep clipper teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower to trim body hair and to keep my beard, mustage and sideburns clean every day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer is able to cut hair well to different lengths, and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>it works great - but it is a bit sharp -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy and you can clean it with water.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>The BHT-2000 works great in this area, but when it comes to the more sensitive areas (yes, the crotch area), then the fun stops and the careful (time consuming) trimming/</li>
            <li>/&gt;i hope they can have a new stronger model with better plastic.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better quality then a lot of other stuff out there that costs a lot more.</li>
            <li>Overall I like this product, and think it does a decent good job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for touch ups, small areas, you can even get a passable shave if you&#x27;re patient.  </li>
            <li>Product is good, I wish it had a clipping option less than 3mm, say 1 mm or something</li>
            <li>after JB welding it and CAREFULLY resetting the pieces, i was able to get it to function, but i could never take the blades out to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin, I find the Remington to be more solidly built than the Bodygroom.</li>
            <li>I like how the Remington has a dial-type head (similar to what you see in most beard trimmers) in which you can choose from 5 setting for hair trimming.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to take overseas and unfortunately it is not dual voltage as it claims to be on Remington&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>first off i bought it to shave excess body hair    </li>
            <li>I look better now because I can keep my hair looking how I like it rather than having it grow too long before I go to the barber.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for several years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to do a large area like say your chest.  </li>
            <li>The downside of the clipper&#x27;s ability to handle thicker hair is that the teeth are rather large...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver yet, but it is a nice little accessory.  </li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t beat this thing for the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these from a local store thinking I could take care of some light body hair</li>
            <li>I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade.</li>
            <li>Even trying that method took too much effort to cut</li>
            <li>also thought since it was advertised as a wet/dry that maybe it did better wet.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was to Hawaii and it was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>A very well built item, I would buy this model again if I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li>highly recommmend this product to anyone who trims their body hair!</li>
            <li>, this thing caused numerous cuts and significant loss of blood in an area that a man really does not want to see any blood.  </li>
            <li>I had another Remington model -- one of those multiple, trimmer accessory deals (the one with the nose hair clipper attachment) that finally had to be replaced because the rechargeable battery finally gave out after years of superior, reliable service.  </li>
            <li>This is a great clipper for facial hair as well as for other areas of the male body.  </li>
            <li>My previous trimmer from Panasonics was much better.</li>
            <li>The guard performs decently around the pubic area, but go any further and you are most likely going to remember your high school sweetheart and her braces and inexperience</li>
            <li>The only problem occurs if you aren&#x27;t careful when you remove the adjustable trimmer head, as it can cut sensitive areas pretty easily, so watch out!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t trim the hair first to as short as possible, the shaving head on each unit will not be able to shave the hair properly.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty small and easily stored, and it looks sleek as well.  </li>
            <li>For trimming Body Hair the Remington BHT-2000 does a fine job, but using the Shaver head to Shave one&#x27;s Face is another story, since the head is quite small, shaving takes a long time and it is easy to \\&quot;miss a spot&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I live abroad, I have to put the timmer in a bag to go the the  showers trailer whenever i needed it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and sleek and after all the time I&#x27;ve had it, looks exactly the same as when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t shave fast or like a blade, but tremendous for less then $12.  </li>
            <li>The hair starts flying around after they&#x27;re cut making a huge mess.    </li>
            <li>i use it to trim my body hair, not shave it completely.</li>
            <li>It is my old reliable.</li>
            <li>so u need to be careful with it as u can cut yourself    clearly a HQ item at a very reasonable price    </li>
            <li>I purchased the Bodygroom earlier this year and have a review of it on Amazon from around the first or second week of February.</li>
            <li>If you plan to shave large areas find something bigger or just use regular hair clippers.    </li>
            <li>First of all let me tell you that this trimmer is tiny at only 5 inches long.</li>
            <li>A little rough the first few times I shaved with it, but it become much more gentle after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I only purchased this after downloading the user guide on their website which clearly shows it as 120-240 VAC 50-60Hz on pg. 11 of the user guide; what I received is only 120 Volt 60Hz.  </li>

            <li> The battery seems to last a really long time after it&#x27;s been charged!  </li>
            <li> Maintenence is minimal, and I must give  Remington kudos for making a product that isn&#x27;t  intended to break down eventually so you need a new one.  </li>
            <li> Its&#x27; only downfall is that when it sits for a few days it loses all charge so if you want to be able to use it every day you basically need to charge it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received an older model which has since been updated or if this is just an error; either way I have to return it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have very thick, coarse, straight body hair.  </li>
            <li> Still holds charge for a very long time,  even sill is usable before it runs out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a lot smaller than I expected and comes with a travel pouch, a tiny brush and a small bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a constant maintainer of what hair I have,  but when it&#x27;s time, this little guy does the trick.  </li>
            <li> line, if you&#x27;re traveling, or not REALLY carefull dont EVER think of buying it.  </li>
            <li> be careful when you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> On other parts of the body</li>
            <li> Takes care of thick, bushy chest and belly hair as well as delicately clips facial hair of sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into detail, but even used very carefully</li>

            <li> Really can&#x27;t beat this thing for the price.  Its&#x27; only downfall is that when it sits for a few days it loses all charge so if you want to be able to use it every day you basically need to charge it everyday.  I just charge for a few hours the day before I know I&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li> i got the bht 2000 about a month ago, and it works well. i use it to trim my body hair, not shave it completely. it comes with a foil head to shave closer, but i do not use it. the bht works great for my purposes.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that this trimmer is tiny at only 5 inches long. If you plan to shave large areas find something bigger or just use regular hair clippers.    Overall I like this product, and think it does a decent good job. The blades cut well, but don&#x27;t bite into your skin and the adjustements work fine. The adjustment wheel is a little hard to turn, but not a big deal. The shaver didn&#x27;t work for me, but then again no electric shaver ever has. The fact that you can take it in the shower is a plus and it comes with a nice brush and decent sized oil bottle.     For twelve bucks it&#x27;s great - if the price were higher though I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from a local store thinking I could take care of some light body hair that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing didn&#x27;t do anything but mess my hair up.  Here is what I mean...I thought..cool! I will test this bad boy out.  I tried to trim some hair on my wrist to test it out.  It just pushed my hair around.  I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade. Even trying that method took too much effort to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also thought since it was advertised as a wet/dry that maybe it did better wet.  Again..same results.  Needless to say, I returned it within a day of buying it.</li>
            <li> Nice product. A little rough the first few times I shaved with it, but it become much more gentle after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Hello,     i actually have this shaver, but from europe. now i am in the USA and i can&#x27;t charge it, even though i got a converter to 110 volt. so if anyone knows how to get the cord for it. than it will be work</li>
            <li> This review will compare the benefits and disadvantages of the Remington BHT-2000 and the Norelco Bodygroom for shaving the groin.  I purchased the Bodygroom earlier this year and have a review of it on Amazon from around the first or second week of February. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To begin, I find the Remington to be more solidly built than the Bodygroom. Plus, the Remington&#x27;s smaller design makes it easier to maneuver around the groin area than the Bodygroom for trimming that area.  Advantage: Remington. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I find the trimming capability of the Remington to be better than the Bodygroom.  What I don&#x27;t like about the Norelco is that is comes with flimsy detachable heads to use for trimming.  I like how the Remington has a dial-type head (similar to what you see in most beard trimmers) in which you can choose from 5 setting for hair trimming.  Advantage: Remington &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I found the shaving capability of the Remington to be quite poor compared to the Norelco.  For either unit, it is recommended to trim the hair to the lowest setting before attempting to shave using the foil head.  If you don&#x27;t trim the hair first to as short as possible, the shaving head on each unit will not be able to shave the hair properly.  Getting back to the review...the Remington dual head shaver attachment is unsatisfactory.  It does not shave as close as the Norelco foil head, nor is it as irritation free as the Norelco foil head.  I used the foil head on the Remington as gently as possible on both my testicles and part of the shaft, and I felt a stinging razor burn on two separate occasions.  Eee-yowch.   This did not happen with the Norelco Bodygroom.  Advantage: Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that if you plan to simply trim your groin area, then your best bet is to go with the Remington as it is the better trimmer.  If your desire is to shave your groin area as smooth as possible with an electric instrument, than your best bet is to go with the Norelco Bodygroom as it is the better shaver.  Please understand, however,  that even with the Norelco being used as a shaver, you will not experience a shave as close as you would by using a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I find trimming the groin area to be the way to go instead of shaving the area.  In order to keep the groin region hair free, you would have to shave that area every day.  I find I can get by with trimming that area to a very short length once a week to keep it rather well maintained.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Here is the deal....I bought this so that I could trim my body hair.  And yes it works, but not too well.  It takes forever to do a large area like say your chest.  Partly because it is pretty small, and also because it somehow doesn&#x27;t grab the hair too well.  But, saying all that, I am still keeping it as a traveling groomer.  It looks good, it seems to hold a charge very well, not too many parts, and it comes in a neat pouch.  So for touch ups, or doing areas like your sideburns, or your pubic hair, then hey..it&#x27;s fine.  But if you are a looking to trim your leg hair, it&#x27;s going to take 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> For trimming Body Hair the Remington BHT-2000 does a fine job, but using the Shaver head to Shave one&#x27;s Face is another story, since the head is quite small, shaving takes a long time and it is easy to \\&quot;miss a spot&#x27;. Even with that drawback I am very happy with my purchase as it is a great value, and compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this product at least 4 stars, but just couldn&#x27;t do it.  This is an attractive-looking, but average performing product.  I had another Remington model -- one of those multiple, trimmer accessory deals (the one with the nose hair clipper attachment) that finally had to be replaced because the rechargeable battery finally gave out after years of superior, reliable service.  Sleek looks and waterproofing are not what I would consider \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; so I have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed with the BHT-2000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have very thick, coarse, straight body hair.  The BHT-2000 works great in this area, but when it comes to the more sensitive areas (yes, the crotch area), then the fun stops and the careful (time consuming) trimming/self-torture begins.  The guard performs decently around the pubic area, but go any further and you are most likely going to remember your high school sweetheart and her braces and inexperience (please don&#x27;t bite it!).  The downside of the clipper&#x27;s ability to handle thicker hair is that the teeth are rather large... I think &#x27;nuff said here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking to shear off your man-hair-sweater, this is probably a great bet for you... but if you&#x27;re looking for more tedious applications, go with smaller teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this as a shaver and it&#x27;s a great price for a beard trimmer and shaver... there might be fancier ones out there but this is fine for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to take overseas and unfortunately it is not dual voltage as it claims to be on Remington&#x27;s website.  I only purchased this after downloading the user guide on their website which clearly shows it as 120-240 VAC 50-60Hz on pg. 11 of the user guide; what I received is only 120 Volt 60Hz.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received an older model which has since been updated or if this is just an error; either way I have to return it. The shaver seems like it would&#x27;ve worked for my needs but I didn&#x27;t get to use it.  It&#x27;s actually a lot smaller than I expected and comes with a travel pouch, a tiny brush and a small bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it does what it advertises. The shipping was to Hawaii and it was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I wonder why this groomer cannot be produced in dual voltage(110/220Volts)... You cannot bring it with you when traveling to Europe or most part of the world.  I had to return it immediately.  Also: Amazon sells you the item which is photographed in CHROME but what I received in the mail was different: it was with a greyish dull finish.</li>
            <li> Works well for beard trimming.  Holds a charge.  Easy to clean.  Haven&#x27;t tried shaving with it because I never shave.</li>
            <li> This trimmer meets all the minimum requirements for a starndard trimmer.  i would give this timmer 5 stars if the build was solid, HOWEVER, I bought this machine and used it effectively only several time before it broke times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I live abroad, I have to put the timmer in a bag to go the the  showers trailer whenever i needed it.  after about a month or so, the PLASTIC COMB SNAPPED ON THE SIDE. (PROB # 1) because of the small surface area, it was impossible to glue it.  I kept it just to protect the rest of the timmer, but soon enough, it had to be taken out.  I HAD A TIMMER WITH NO COMB, which would have been fine.  i started putting the shaver in a plastic bubble wrap just to protect it, BUT THE PLASTIC BACKING WHERE THE BLADES SIT IS VERY POORLY MADE (PROB #2).  it broke.  I had a totally useless trimmer.  after JB welding it and CAREFULLY resetting the pieces, i was able to get it to function, but i could never take the blades out to clean.  later i found out it had a 2yr warranty  i sent it back to the manufacturer and they replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;four months later, i&#x27;m walking in TJ MAXX and find it for 12$ !!!  Now i&#x27;m stuck with two of these timmers that I dont even want !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;botton line, if you&#x27;re traveling, or not REALLY carefull dont EVER think of buying it.  you have to treat it like glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope they can have a new stronger model with better plastic. backing</li>
            <li> Have had the same one of these for years.  Still holds charge for a very long time,  even sill is usable before it runs out.  I use it for some recreational body trimming.  I&#x27;m not a constant maintainer of what hair I have,  but when it&#x27;s time, this little guy does the trick.  I don&#x27;t use the foil shaver on my body, but on my face  those days that a razor would make my face sore.  It gets it smooth, but not as smooth as a razor.  Definately to clean-shaven, though.  The warranty is great.  It&#x27;s compact and sleek and after all the time I&#x27;ve had it, looks exactly the same as when I bought it.  Maintenence is minimal, and I must give  Remington kudos for making a product that isn&#x27;t  intended to break down eventually so you need a new one.  It is my old reliable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this thing is today.  Sure it&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t shave fast or like a blade, but tremendous for less then $12.  I paid over twice that and I&#x27;m happy- it&#x27;s great for touch ups, small areas, you can even get a passable shave if you&#x27;re patient.  It may be small but it&#x27;s better quality then a lot of other stuff out there that costs a lot more.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with this product.  I had been searching for a body hair shaver for a while, and this did the trick nicely.  The adjustable trimmer is able to cut hair well to different lengths, and it is very easy to clean.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver yet, but it is a nice little accessory.  The only problem occurs if you aren&#x27;t careful when you remove the adjustable trimmer head, as it can cut sensitive areas pretty easily, so watch out! The product is pretty small and easily stored, and it looks sleek as well.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This body hair trimmer is really bad quality.    The hair starts flying around after they&#x27;re cut making a huge mess.    The dial has only 5 settings.    My previous trimmer from Panasonics was much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really liked.According to him its a really good trimmmer and does a good job.The length adjustment feature is a plus.I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard mostly and it works like a champ. A good clean cut, the dial for adjustments is easy and the setting doesnt change on you in mid stroke. A very well built item, I would buy this model again if I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li> good experience, although I&#x27;m using ......</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is reliable and has one(!) adjustable attachment. Perfect for traveling as well. I miss it when I forget it while on the road. I have yet to find a better groomer.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper for facial hair as well as for other areas of the male body.  Takes care of thick, bushy chest and belly hair as well as delicately clips facial hair of sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve had mine for several years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Get a can of oil though to keep clipper teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever owned!  It&#x27;s fast, easy and you can clean it with water.  The battery seems to last a really long time after it&#x27;s been charged!  I use it in the shower to trim body hair and to keep my beard, mustage and sideburns clean every day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommmend this product to anyone who trims their body hair!</li>
            <li> I had never used a clipper before and was a little nervous.  The adjustable comb makes it very easy to use.  I look better now because I can keep my hair looking how I like it rather than having it grow too long before I go to the barber.  Because it is waterproof, I can use it in the shower and take care of the clippings.  I have had it two weeks and have already paid for it.</li>
            <li> i like the item    first off i bought it to shave excess body hair    it works great - but it is a bit sharp - so u need to be careful with it as u can cut yourself    clearly a HQ item at a very reasonable price    be careful when you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> Product is good, I wish it had a clipping option less than 3mm, say 1 mm or something, the shaver head that comes with it, is oustanding too. I am very satisfied with the product.    First product I bought off Amazon, and it is amazing, the delivery was quick and on time. No errors this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Philips Bodygroom for years without any problem, but I wanted give something else a try.  I won&#x27;t go into detail, but even used very carefully, this thing caused numerous cuts and significant loss of blood in an area that a man really does not want to see any blood.  On other parts of the body it&#x27;s just OK. I will be going back to the Bodygroom, and throwing this thing in the trash.</li>
