            <li>it might not be for you or it might be the best thing you&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>love this stuff!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Works best if worked into hair before styling with dryer.</li>
            <li>Great at defining and enhancing curls without the frizz!</li>
            <li>Probably the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Seasons Beauty Boutique through the Amazon shopping website seems to have the best prices on this product that I have found and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li>The hold and body that it gives my hair is great...</li>
            <li>Great product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mousse at a great price!</li>
            <li>and I got this hoping it would be a good volumizer.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that the search for a good mousse is over!</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It is also good for colored hair because it is alcohol free and has anti-fade extracts in it!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>What more is there to say, it is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It appears thicker and lifted, as if I have more hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across this product.</li>
            <li>With the foam I can definately feel more volume and my hair becomes easier to style.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Good natural hair product for a good price.  </li>
            <li>But I still love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This mouse is better than the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This will give it a lot more definition and control, but will lose some of the softness I gained by using the foam alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>perfect for a good scrunching thats not too stiff!</li>
            <li>I travel extensively and it is important that my hair looks the best at all times.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; need a non-toxic mousse -- this &amp;#34;Volume Foam with Argan Oil&amp;#34; works well.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh light smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this complete product line and the pricing is far better than my beauty salon!  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different kinds and this is the one I will be sticking with for sure!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the spray, harder to apply, makes my hair feel a bit coated.</li>
            <li>This hair product works wonderfully whether I dry my hair or allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li>It also gives my hair just the right amount of volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super straight</li>
            <li>It smells nice enough, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>(my favorite is Matrix Vavoom loosely defined texture cream).</li>
            <li>Controls frizz and helps mold hair in either a matte or shine finish depending on how much you play around with it.</li>
            <li>I give it one last 15 second shot with the blow dryer to fluff it up a bit, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot more manageable, and with a nice wave.</li>
            <li>They also have a pump spray curl lifter that is also a good product for thick wavy\curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it, but not a single one of these worked properly.</li>
            <li>(pretty sure that&#x27;s impossible, but I keep dreaming), but this one is pretty close. :)</li>
            <li>I still use it occasionally in spite of the mild itchy reaction</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is vegan, the main reason I tried it, but it feels heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li>It enhances by natural waves and helps in blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length fine hair (but lots of it) that will dry completely straight if left untouched.</li>
            <li>It does not dry hair, and it does not leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as so many other products do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, not quite as messy as a normal foam mousse.  </li>
            <li>This gives my fine limp hair some volume while having natural ingredients &amp; no aerosol.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I need more control because my hair isn&#x27;t cooperating, or I plan on spending some time outside, I&#x27;ll add a little texture gel/cream</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money</li>
            <li>I do have to say as my hair has grown somewhat &amp; is more all one length, it is slightly harder to run a brush through wet hair with this mousse on while blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>BUT I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it seems to work well for my wavy, soft shoulder-length styles.  </li>
            <li>It really holds if you use enough of it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it before I bought this, but I think it&#x27;s for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff but too expensive.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY hair product that makes my perm feel soft and not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>you can find a local salon that uses this haircare line and you have sensitive skin, I recommend having your stylist use it on you or request a sample to test at home on your skin</li>
            <li>I like this product but have to be careful to not use too much.</li>
            <li>The subtle scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all (unless I use too much) and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I HIGHLY recommend the Shampoo and Leave-in Treatments in this same line those are FABULOUS even with my crazy skin &amp; scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and only used one pump, maybe even a little less than a full pump, and when I blow my hair out, you can just feel it on my hair, the weightiness of it</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my Hair Stylist, I was surprised because it is not a super pricey product, yet it works so well.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and it seems to take longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I smear it over my hands and work it through my hair by scrunching it upside-down, then blow dry it until it&#x27;s about halfway dry.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry the rest of the way (about 30 min).</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely humid area (south Florida) and this is all I usually need to handle the flyaways and frizzies.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, so I have to be careful to use a small amount of it so as not to make it too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have longer, straight and thin hair, but I have lots of it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful in the application,.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use about a pump and a half of this product after washing, towel-drying and combing my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it would work for \\&quot;high\\&quot; or really firm hairstyles</li>
            <li> This product does provide a firm hold just as it indicates without making my hair feel stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I find that this foam does very little for that section.</li>
            <li> If you have particularly thick hair, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> I am angry that products in this atagory can&#x27;t be returned.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the 3 I just received wouldn&#x27;t foam.  </li>
            <li> Just a terrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product makes your hairstyle shiny and bouncy BUT I have sensitive skin and it made me itch a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find a local salon that uses this haircare line and you have sensitive skin, I recommend having your stylist use it on you or request a sample to test at home on your skin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it would work for \\&quot;high\\&quot; or really firm hairstyles but it seems to work well for my wavy, soft shoulder-length styles.  I still use it occasionally in spite of the mild itchy reaction I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review &amp; product could go either way for you- caveat emptor !  \\&quot;Let the buyer beware\\&quot;...  it might not be for you or it might be the best thing you&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a SIDE NOTE - I HIGHLY recommend the Shampoo and Leave-in Treatments in this same line those are FABULOUS even with my crazy skin &amp; scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Four Seasons Beauty Boutique through the Amazon shopping website seems to have the best prices on this product that I have found and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this! My limp hair really sits up and takes notice. It appears thicker and lifted, as if I have more hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my Hair Stylist, I was surprised because it is not a super pricey product, yet it works so well. My hair is fine and thin, so I have to be careful to use a small amount of it so as not to make it too greasy.</li>
            <li> This product need something else added. It did nothing for my hair. I have type 3c hair with ringlets. This product left my hair feeling dry. I needed moisture with this product. I will not be purchasing this product again.   Thank you</li>
            <li> Good stuff but too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this product. I have been using Deroganic shampoo and conditioner and decided to give the volume foam a try. I have longer, straight and thin hair, but I have lots of it. With the foam I can definately feel more volume and my hair becomes easier to style. The subtle scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. I highly recommend to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious when using a mousse...I love this product.  it&#x27;s easy to use, not quite as messy as a normal foam mousse.  The hold and body that it gives my hair is great...I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Just a terrible product.  It smells like something used on an automobile engine.  evn the tiniest bit makes hair greasy. I wishi could give it zero stars.  I am angry that products in this atagory can&#x27;t be returned.  Huge waste of money</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair product that makes my perm feel soft and not stiff or sticky.  I have tried a lot of different kinds and this is the one I will be sticking with for sure!

            <li> Good natural hair product for a good price.  I have fine hair &amp; need a non-toxic mousse -- this &amp;#34;Volume Foam with Argan Oil&amp;#34; works well.</li>
            <li> This gives my fine limp hair some volume while having natural ingredients &amp; no aerosol.  Has a fresh light smell.  I do have to say as my hair has grown somewhat &amp; is more all one length, it is slightly harder to run a brush through wet hair with this mousse on while blow-drying.  You have to do it in sections.  But I still love the product.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll try others with a softer feel &amp; the hold isn&#x27;t enough.  I always come back to this one!</li>
            <li> This product is beyond words. I travel extensively and it is important that my hair looks the best at all times. This product endures all weather conditions. I would definitely recommend this product to all those who are in need of their hair having a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hold at all times.  Sheryl</li>
            <li> I love this complete product line and the pricing is far better than my beauty salon!  Try it, you will love it!</li>

            <li> This product does provide a firm hold just as it indicates without making my hair feel stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> it feels sticky at times..</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Unfortunately the 3 I just received wouldn&#x27;t foam.  I have used this product for years and love it, but not a single one of these worked properly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It really holds if you use enough of it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the spray, harder to apply, makes my hair feel a bit coated. Didn&#x27;t like it. Will use in a pinch though.</li>
            <li> My favorite mousse at a great price! A little goes a long way. Works best if worked into hair before styling with dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great at defining and enhancing curls without the frizz!</li>
            <li> This mouse is better than the shampoo and conditioner. They also have a pump spray curl lifter that is also a good product for thick wavy\curly hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it before I bought this, but I think it&#x27;s for naturally curly hair.  My hair is super straight and I got this hoping it would be a good volumizer.  It smells nice enough, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  No extra oomph, nothing.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my curls and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  I only wish there was a travel-size one that I could carry on a plane.</li>
            <li> This hair product works wonderfully whether I dry my hair or allow it to air dry. It enhances by natural waves and helps in blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li> Probably the best hair product I have ever used. I wish the product would come in a travel size, I travel a lot and use carry on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now, and it&#x27;s the one product I always use every day. I have shoulder-length fine hair (but lots of it) that will dry completely straight if left untouched. I use about a pump and a half of this product after washing, towel-drying and combing my hair. I smear it over my hands and work it through my hair by scrunching it upside-down, then blow dry it until it&#x27;s about halfway dry. I let it air dry the rest of the way (about 30 min). I give it one last 15 second shot with the blow dryer to fluff it up a bit, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot more manageable, and with a nice wave. I live in an extremely humid area (south Florida) and this is all I usually need to handle the flyaways and frizzies. Often this is all I use on my hair and it will last all day, unless I spend a lot of time outside. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all (unless I use too much) and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I feel like I need more control because my hair isn&#x27;t cooperating, or I plan on spending some time outside, I&#x27;ll add a little texture gel/cream (my favorite is Matrix Vavoom loosely defined texture cream). This will give it a lot more definition and control, but will lose some of the softness I gained by using the foam alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some thicker hair on the underside of my head (the lower part just above the neck), and I find that this foam does very little for that section. If you have particularly thick hair, this may not work for you. I suggest getting a sample from a salon if possible, or ask for it to be used the next time you go in for your cut/style appointment if it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never found one product that does everything for my hair that I want (pretty sure that&#x27;s impossible, but I keep dreaming), but this one is pretty close. :)</li>
            <li> I like this product but have to be careful to not use too much. I am on my second pump. My hair is thin so I have to be careful in the application,.</li>
