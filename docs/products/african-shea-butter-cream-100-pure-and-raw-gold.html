            <li>It was not the first time for me in the use of shea butter when using your product</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my batches weren&#x27;t the best this time.  </li>

            <li>long love it</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>it looks funny until its really rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but it does seem to be of very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very grainy even after trying different attempts to try and make it smooth.</li>
            <li>was very day  </li>
            <li>find the real thing.</li>
            <li>It is legitimately real shea butter.</li>
            <li>u will really like it</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So much so that my clothes and a mattress to sleep and the place sit in it trace of lipid spots.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very crummy in my hands when I ATTEMPTED to emulsify and soften it.  </li>
            <li>It has improved my skin more then I expected&#x27;</li>
            <li>And I use it on my legs at night which works really well.  </li>
            <li>Smelled right, all look the same and worth the price.</li>
            <li>been using the Raw Shea butter African Soap which is really alkaline and works great.</li>
            <li>It is really the original African Shea Butter</li>
            <li>So grateful for finding this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Works so great for dry irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on old cigarette burns that seem to never really go away from 20 something years ago</li>
            <li>and it is great but is to difficult to evenly distribute</li>
            <li>Is it normal or damage?</li>
            <li>Seems like the normal stuff..</li>
            <li>Nothing close to what I purchased from the local farmers market, which smells fresh and semi soft to touch.  </li>
            <li>It turns to me that the product was not raw shea butter</li>
            <li>My hands take a beating while wearing rubber gloves when cleaning firearms and doing other messy chores and this product is the best I have ever used to bring my dried wrinkled skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>and it melts smoothly and will not &#x27;dry up&#x27; like any other lotions containing shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin being soft.</li>
            <li>This shea butter makes my skin feel extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It was the only think that really healed my severely chapped lips and stopped them from cracking and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will order the ivory shea butter, because the gold, really looks like playdough.</li>
            <li>wish sent as soon as possible, I need it very much😢😢😣</li>
            <li>and they are pretty much gone as they should be as I have had them burned off w/liquid nitrogen at the Doctors offices a few times.</li>
            <li>Shipping was decent, I am definitely gonna order again !!!</li>
            <li>Where shea butter was quick absorption in previous times.</li>
            <li>, it does not wash off easily and absorbs into the skin slowly.</li>
            <li>I struggle a bit with adult acne, I&#x27;m one of those women whose face breaks out if her skin is too dry (oil glands try to overcompensate) and I find sleeping with Shea Butter on my face at night in place of night cream or lotion leaves it so supple in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>as before&lt;br /&gt;Kindly send other new and to be&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad, kind of a earthy natural smell.  </li>

            <li> I struggle a bit with adult acne, I&#x27;m one of those women whose face breaks out if her skin is too dry (oil glands try to overcompensate) and I find sleeping with Shea Butter on my face at night in place of night cream or lotion leaves it so supple in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> as before&lt;br /&gt;Kindly send other new and to be&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad, kind of a earthy natural smell.  </li>
            <li> Pure raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 4 8oz tubs and it&#x27;s going to last a LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> The first winter my hands aren&#x27;t cracked and dried out!!</li>
            <li> Regular lotions for dry skin or extra dry skin doesn&#x27;t work but goes a long way to soften my skin and make it look like i have lotioned my skin.</li>
            <li> what I do is melt it, mix it with some coconut oil and a little natural lilac oil to improve the smell.  </li>
            <li> Take a little bit, hold it in your hand or rub it directly on the skin</li>
            <li> There is a problem where there is a strange color in the box</li>
            <li> I only been using it for a little while, I&#x27;ll see in the next month or two.</li>
            <li> and i recommend anyone wanting to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use at first.</li>
            <li> so I am looking for it in an oil form but seems as tho to get it into and oil form they have to fractionalize it which is a concern because it will loose</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and see a big differance in my dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not check the Shea butter right away.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to use so much to do a single area because it does not go along way.</li>
            <li> I mix it with some other oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to combine with other ingredients</li>
            <li> I had to send it back, it was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin has not absorbed by.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little intense and difficult to cover up if you&#x27;re using this to make other products (I made a whipped body butter with it).</li>
            <li> so it would be  less  grainy.</li>
            <li> The color of it is changed to black.</li>
            <li> so the smell isnt so odd</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for the dark marks on my body.</li>
            <li> I mix mine with organic cocoanut oil Nd a little olive oil.</li>
            <li> I put it into a little tub and add a few drops of vitamin e oil into it overnight.</li>
            <li> and she said it was one of the few things that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not even waste my money  </li>
            <li> I just tried, after reading a few reviews.</li>
            <li> The gold color does rub in, but since I&#x27;m pale</li>
            <li> It is hard and not fresh at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good as expected.</li>
            <li> as I don&#x27;t use makeup, I don&#x27;t mind being a bit shiny for a while and the reduction in the small lines is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;winter time&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had an issue, however I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it with olive oil.</li>
            <li> Its thick and non greasy</li>
            <li> Some other comments about the smell are crazy.  </li>
            <li> The 4 for $12 deal was hard for me to pass up!</li>
            <li> My partner also uses it for his severe eczema and it really helps eliminate the vicious symptoms he has with the condition.</li>
            <li> The product is greate but the shipping is so poor</li>
            <li> It smells horrible, like old rotten wood.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I applied it to my hair and was again amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a foreign substance has a very bad smell</li>
            <li> Weird smell but works!  </li>
            <li> I have not received anything from the goods and I am very sad not being sent on time</li>
            <li> Shea Butter has reached two packs which change color Kbaka which means damaging or bad storage</li>
            <li> Bad Product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> gave some to my daughter as she had a painful rash after the birth of her daughter</li>
            <li> All three bins were bad. :(</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY BAD SMELL!  </li>
            <li> The smell is very bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very bad consistency.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is good  subject .I was very day  long love it</li>
            <li> Love it! Lasted 2 years</li>
            <li> There is a problem where there is a strange color in the box</li>
            <li> I added  coconut oil  to  it  so it would be  less  grainy. I also  added  lavender  essential  oil for  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is great for skin conditioning and is natural.  I don&#x27;t like the smell, however, so what I do is melt it, mix it with some coconut oil and a little natural lilac oil to improve the smell.  I put it on after showering leaving my skin still wet as I find that helps keeps the natural moisture in.  I also use it on my face; as I don&#x27;t use makeup, I don&#x27;t mind being a bit shiny for a while and the reduction in the small lines is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave some to my daughter as she had a painful rash after the birth of her daughter and she said it was one of the few things that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I don&#x27;t like the smell of the product itself, I will keep buying it and mixing it, as I do like the end result.</li>
            <li> Were not butter as in the picture and there is no any logo or seal of the product as the color of butter yellow is not the color as it is written, it did not like it and will not come back to buy again</li>
            <li> Cured my hard-to-cure eczema!  Great stuff!  It&#x27;s thick (I use a blow dryer to melt the top layer in the container, then smooth it on), doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but I am so thankful for this stuff!  Works better and faster than my steroid cream.  It&#x27;s also cheaper.</li>
            <li> i buy this in bulk ; great product and keeps skin very smooth; great for living near the surf, sand, and sun It is really the original African Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for the dark marks on my body. I even mix it with my cocoa butter and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> So grateful for finding this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Works so great for dry irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on old cigarette burns that seem to never really go away from 20 something years ago and they are pretty much gone as they should be as I have had them burned off w/liquid nitrogen at the Doctors offices a few times. Makes you wonder about what is in cigarettes!!! Also works great on scars and other skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it as hair conditioner and it is great but is to difficult to evenly distribute so I am looking for it in an oil form but seems as tho to get it into and oil form they have to fractionalize it which is a concern because it will loose some of it&#x27;s almost magical qualities from being processed.&lt;br /&gt;Also been using the Raw Shea butter African Soap which is really alkaline and works great.</li>
            <li> Nothing close to what I purchased from the local farmers market, which smells fresh and semi soft to touch.  These, I placed the order for four pack from the store African Shea Butter, but received from Nature and Herbs.  It smells horrible, like old rotten wood.  It is hard and not fresh at all.  I placed a second order for a 8 oz from Plant Guru and just received it today.  Again, received the same stinky stuff from Nature and Herbs.  Now, it isn&#x27;t refundable.</li>
            <li> i buy this in bulk ; great product and keeps skin very smooth; great for living near the surf, sand, and sun</li>
            <li> happy i made this purchase i will have this to last me awhile</li>
            <li> It came the way it was supposed to. Smelled right, all look the same and worth the price. And yes, the Shea butter is organic.</li>
            <li> Beautiful butter cream</li>
            <li> The color of it is changed to black. The smell is very bad. Is it normal or damage?</li>
            <li> It would crumble in your hands and it felt like sand.  I would not even waste my money  find the real thing.</li>
            <li> It is legitimately real shea butter. It works wonders on getting rid of acne scars and keeping my skin smooth, young, and glowing! My partner also uses it for his severe eczema and it really helps eliminate the vicious symptoms he has with the condition. This product is a lifesaver for topical solutions for the skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I just opened my order and I used it already and LOVE It!  NO IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY BAD SMELL!  My skin absorbed the creme like a sponge.  I will use it daily.  My husband saw it and of course he wanted some! :)</li>
            <li> The product was excellent.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am new to the benefits of shea butter, but I love the quality of this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on my natural hair.  It keeps my hair his and health feeling.  I mix it with some other oils.</li>
            <li> This is great for EVERYTHING!!! I bought it to use as a skin moisturizer and it did wonders on my skin. It moisturizes and smoothens my skin. After reading more reviews on Shea butter cream, I found that it is also good for your hair. Needless to say, I applied it to my hair and was again amazed by the results. Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> I like this item. I only been using it for a little while, I&#x27;ll see in the next month or two.</li>
            <li> Shea butter used in a variety of things.</li>
            <li> Wish i had more stars.&lt;br /&gt;The product is amazing. It cleared up marks on my skin i had for months in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My wife swears by it and how it keeps skin moist all day even when sitting in Air conditioning for hours.&lt;br /&gt;It does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Have used shea butter or years.  Wonderful moisturizer for all types of skin .  I use on face, body and especially feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and see a big differance in my dry skin on my hands. It is great.</li>
            <li> Pure raw Shea Butter.  For me the 8oz tubs are the absolute best size for around the house and travel.</li>
            <li> That the product is damaged&lt;br /&gt;And I want the request of many of this product, but I am worried that the product be corrupted like the last time</li>
            <li> I just tried, after reading a few reviews. It&#x27;s an amazing moisturizer, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I still can&#x27;t believe the price. It works for both hair and skin, it tamed my hair in seconds! I&#x27;m back to buy some more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is wonderful.  I swear it is like miracle cream I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful this butter is.  It is like a cure all use all.</li>
            <li> I like it,&lt;br /&gt;... it works well if I blend it with some almond oil.&lt;br /&gt; I get compliments on my skin being soft.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it often</li>
            <li> There have reached shea butter, but all expired and musty smell too bad&lt;br /&gt;Not as before&lt;br /&gt;Kindly send other new and to be&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect product... u will really like it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in great condition. This shea butter makes my skin feel extremely soft. No more &amp;#34;winter time&amp;#34; ash for me!!! Will order more soon!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best stuff on earth.  Every night I put it on my lips, sometimes my face or legs.  It protects against drying and sets up a good moisture barrier.  It was the only think that really healed my severely chapped lips and stopped them from cracking and bleeding.  This was a gread deal on it as well.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter has reached two packs which change color Kbaka which means damaging or bad storage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;زبدة الشيا وصلت علبتين فيها تغيير باللون كالبقع مما يعني تعرضها للتلف او سؤ التخزين</li>
            <li> The whole family is hooked! A little hard to use at first. I use something to scrape it out. The first winter my hands aren&#x27;t cracked and dried out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna need to reorder daughters &amp; girlfriend took all that I ordered</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought raw shea butter. Its thick and non greasy but I did not think it was great as a moisturiser. I put it into a little tub and add a few drops of vitamin e oil into it overnight. It then becomes softer and easier to apply. I carry it around as a hand cream. Price-performance vice, this is an excellent hand cream!</li>
            <li> very good . i put it on my legs and i found a really good different &amp;#60;3 love it ..</li>
            <li> Shea butter is ideal for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquidate and open skin color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to my hair after that combined with wheat germ oil and cocoa butter and almond oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick and effective results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of ​​4 for the price of one, save a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;زبدة الشيا هي مثالية لجميع أنواع البشرة&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;تصفي البشرة وتفتح اللون&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;استخدمتها لشعري بعد أن دمجتها مع زيت جنين القمح وزبدة الكاكاو وزيت اللوز&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;النتائج سريعه وفعالة&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;فكرة ٤ بسعر واحد، توفر الكثير</li>
            <li> I have been using Shea Butter for many years.  This is the first time that I have uses this company to purchase…and I am very pleased with the product.  The price is excellent and the product came within 3-4 days.  The product came in four compact 8 ounce packages which is also good for travel.</li>
            <li> Really its shea  butter so nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this product!! It&#x27;s amazing on my skin, I also use it on my daughter &amp; son. Shipping was decent, I am definitely gonna order again !!!</li>
            <li> The only problem was the pack is not fully sealed</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not check the Shea butter right away. It&#x27;s a very bad consistency.  Very grainy even after trying different attempts to try and make it smooth. I&#x27;ve bought Shea products from this seller before and I&#x27;ve never had an issue, however I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.  All three bins were bad. :(</li>
            <li> My shea butter arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Works better than Desitin for diaper rash.  Tip place it on top of wipes warmer and it will be soft and ready to use when you are.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth very much the price that was paid. Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 8oz tubs and it&#x27;s going to last a LONG TIME. I use it for my face and hair (I whip it with oils).</li>
            <li> Used to make chapstick.  Smells great.  Works great.</li>
            <li> It was not the first time for me in the use of shea butter when using your product I found that my skin has not absorbed by. Where shea butter was quick absorption in previous times. I have noticed that your product stays on the skin for hours without absorption. So much so that my clothes and a mattress to sleep and the place sit in it trace of lipid spots. As you can see in the attached picture It turns to me that the product was not raw shea butter</li>
            <li> My hands take a beating while wearing rubber gloves when cleaning firearms and doing other messy chores and this product is the best I have ever used to bring my dried wrinkled skin back to normal. My wife has also  found this product is one of the best skin moisturizer she has used for all skin surfaces as well as her hair.</li>
            <li> Next time I will order the ivory shea butter, because the gold, really looks like playdough. I found a simple whipped recipie and its great, just wish I had ordered the ivory. The gold color does rub in, but since I&#x27;m pale it looks funny until its really rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of shea butter and love the feel of it on my skin.  It does make skin softer and more supple. My only complaint is that you have to use so much to do a single area because it does not go along way. I don&#x27;t mind that it is a bit greasy because it does go away after the shea soaks in but some may not like the greasiness.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Shea Butter! The 4 for $12 deal was hard for me to pass up! I struggle a bit with adult acne, I&#x27;m one of those women whose face breaks out if her skin is too dry (oil glands try to overcompensate) and I find sleeping with Shea Butter on my face at night in place of night cream or lotion leaves it so supple in the morning. Something worth trying!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product</li>
            <li> Seems like the normal stuff.. Works well with my hair and skin. A great deal overall</li>
            <li> We use this for personal massages.  Best. Thing. Ever.  Take a little bit, hold it in your hand or rub it directly on the skin and it melts smoothly and will not &#x27;dry up&#x27; like any other lotions containing shea butter.  Be prepared though, it does not wash off easily and absorbs into the skin slowly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my batches weren&#x27;t the best this time.  Very crummy in my hands when I ATTEMPTED to emulsify and soften it.  :(  On a positive note:  Gave my sister a container from this stock and she said she loves hers.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> horrible...I had to send it back, it was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Bad Product&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise buying the product does not match the picture&lt;br /&gt;Quite different&lt;br /&gt;Butter smell very bad&lt;br /&gt;I do not think as shea butter&lt;br /&gt;There is a foreign substance has a very bad smell&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise buying</li>
            <li> I will be getting more when I need it. I&#x27;m going to combine with other ingredients so the smell isnt so odd and so it will be easier to use as a lotion. But its helping my eczema!</li>
            <li> It has improved my skin more then I expected&#x27;</li>
            <li> The price was right and I love Shea butter. I mix mine with organic cocoanut oil Nd a little olive oil. It is great for dry heals and skin. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> love it and i recommend anyone wanting to moisturize dry skin. i not only use it but gave it away as gifts.</li>
            <li> Weird smell but works!  Apply when no one around you.</li>
            <li> Excellent everything delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! This is just as described and an incredible price. I couldn&#x27;t find pure Shea butter anywhere local and am very very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product.  Some other comments about the smell are crazy.  It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad, kind of a earthy natural smell.  This stuff is great on my face, no breakouts.  And I use it on my legs at night which works really well.  Better then other lotions that have all that junk and mostly water .  Store it in the cooler part of your house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good as expected.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for use as a hand repair cream!  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> love, love, love it, its the only thing I use because I have really dry skin so much to the point where my legs look like Im always wearing stocking. Regular lotions for dry skin or extra dry skin doesn&#x27;t work but goes a long way to soften my skin and make it look like i have lotioned my skin. I usually use it with olive oil.</li>
            <li> The product is greate but the shipping is so poor</li>
            <li> I have not received anything from the goods and I am very sad not being sent on time wish sent as soon as possible, I need it very much😢😢😣</li>
            <li> Great product with a great price.</li>
            <li> I get it for my sister and she loves it. I don&#x27;t care for the smell and consistency. But it does wonders on her skin and dogs paws..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but it does seem to be of very high quality. The smell is a little intense and difficult to cover up if you&#x27;re using this to make other products (I made a whipped body butter with it). Otherwise, it works great!</li>
            <li> My wife learned about this through a friend and now swears by its powers.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter and how its packaged it come with 4 neatly sealed cup like tubes. This shea butter should last me for a year !!!!</li>
