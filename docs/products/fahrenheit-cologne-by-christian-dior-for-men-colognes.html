            <li>This has a good smell.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing, I wear it, and pants fall off.</li>
            <li>My husband likes Fahrenheit because it smells nice</li>
            <li>When I think of those places I don&#x27;t picture something that people would want to smell, but I own a bottle now..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of addicting in a way.</li>
            <li>But this one smells like these things called \\&quot;rose</li>
            <li>Use this for years now and it&#x27;s great and worth the money!</li>
            <li>but now I love him more!</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from men with this fragrance than most of my others!</li>
            <li>This product is an all time great and the price was good and the packaging was brand new</li>
            <li>I have always loved this sweet smelling fragrance, and people like it on me.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get surprisingly many compliments for this fragrance :)</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite cologne he wears.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>- Longevity is ok.</li>
            <li>I still love Dior&#x27;s 32, and will get another bottle, too.</li>
            <li>It would be safe to say that this fragrance would fall into the top 5 fragrances I&#x27;ve smelled.  </li>
            <li>My fiance love&#x27;s the smell</li>
            <li>Love this , my husband has worn this cologne since 1997.</li>
            <li>Can say the person who received it has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>if you followed my demands, I really love this lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful and romantic gift.</li>
            <li>Gotta love this ol&#x27;skool cologne.</li>
            <li>My signature fragrance was no longer available after 30 yrs!  </li>
            <li>Just have to say that many ladies have asked what cologne I have on, every time I use this.</li>
            <li>I will always buy more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This is definitely in interesting fragrance.</li>
            <li>It was in that time I realized that I actually really enjoyed the smell, and it was that curiosity that drew me to smell it more and more.</li>
            <li>Fahrenheit has been my favorite cologne for years now.</li>
            <li>My wife and I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice clean refreshing</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume but the 3.4 ounces, i had it before and it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Great masculine cologne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I like all types of colognes, but I haven&#x27;t scene any strong cologne like this one.</li>
            <li>Some people smell a strong petrol note, which is my experience.</li>
            <li>The first time I took a sample of this cologne, I have to be honest, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>But as time pass (very quickly by the way), the scent became unique.</li>
            <li>These are accurate representations of what this cologne smells like.  </li>
            <li>now my kid can enjoy..</li>
            <li>and he feels comfortable wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Just place it lightly around the neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of cheap colognes, and the fatal flaw of them all is the lack of variety in the presentation . . .</li>
            <li>I can really see why it became so popular.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also own two of the flankers, Absolute and Aqua Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>The fahrenheit box looks authentic when compared to the other two; I also tested a spray on my wrist and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Really deserves 5 star rating!!!</li>
            <li>I use it  on special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing from this vendor as I prefer to pay more for the real thing...</li>
            <li>I had about ten samples of this and used up the majority just trying understand why it was so loved.</li>
            <li>Great scent at a reasonable cost; will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Absolute is pretty good, it&#x27;s darker and more mysterious in my eyes .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think everyone will love it right off the bat, but with time it&#x27;s a fragrance that will really grow on you.</li>
            <li>overall, I am very satisfied to buy it.</li>
            <li>and I get a lot of compliments on it and for those reasons only, I purchased it and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll surely go down as one of the all time great designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty unique.</li>
            <li>and it was brand new in a box which was great since it was a&lt;br /&gt;birthday present.</li>
            <li>I finally bought the cologne at an amazing here in Amazon</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I strongly advise against this particular Dior scent.</li>
            <li>Thank you kindly as my husband kept bugging me to purchase for x-mas present</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but well worth it,</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed, and, though I have about 20 fragrances to choose from on a daily basis, this has become one of my favorite go-to scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many excellent men&#x27;s fragrances out there, that it is hard to shop for colognes, so I suggest you take your significant other shopping with you, to help you decide . . .</li>
            <li>As a rule of thumb, I&#x27;ve found the more &amp;#34;subtly interesting&amp;#34; a fragrance is, the more refined, pleasing, and generally acceptable it is to women (which is extremely important because women are literally the only reason men have ever felt a need to wear cologne).  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>but I (a very feminine female) love it and wear it myself!</li>
            <li>This is a classic, unique fragrance for the type of man who handles his business, gets things done, calls it like he sees it, and shoots from the hip.</li>
            <li>He has used for some time and still enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li>It is durable and makes people aware of it.</li>
            <li>The first purchase was Fahrenheit Aqua in which I still have the box</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; smell is almost exactly comparable to the Yankee Candle Leather scent</li>
            <li>ever since I got it for him for the first time</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last twenty years, do I need to say more.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is for sure different, but I like it....</li>
            <li>I thought I lost my first bottle</li>
            <li>so I bought another one, then I found the first one.</li>
            <li>To me, the first thing I thought of was a gas station or mechanic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also something that has held up pretty well with time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell, not heavy at all..</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve repurchased a cologne, I really like this myself and it&#x27;s favorably received by all women I&#x27;ve met.</li>
            <li>The perfume smelled like a combination of &#x27;new car smell&#x27; air freshener that Uber taxi drivers spray in their cars and fresh gasoline from a petrol station.</li>
            <li>I bot this for my boyfriend and he really loves it.</li>
            <li>it shipped really fast</li>
            <li>Not really a nighttime cologne but more of a daytime cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe too much.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES.</li>
            <li>The smell is very enticing I do recommend this product</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really get the petrol opening though, but that might just be me.</li>
            <li>Also the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I find this fragrance to be very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>at least to me, it seems like every cheap cologne has just one overwhelmingly power scent and a heavy dose of alcohol (which is used in most colognes to intensify the smell by increasing its volatility).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I dont want to rate it to high, because I dont want everybody using it, if you get my drift.....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few Dior perfumes in the past, mostly as gifts to my female friends and family and have loved their selections.</li>
            <li>I guess the reason I enjoy this fragrance so much is because it took me such a long time to really figure it out.</li>
            <li>This particular perfume, however, was my first mens&#x27; scent purchased for personal use</li>
            <li>This is really just a more expensive and higher quality version of Axe Peace!</li>
            <li>Came quickly, boxed - absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Infact I have the entire collection of Christian Dior and love each and every single one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>; however, leaks a bit near the nozzle part</li>
            <li>It has a lot of subtle undertones that make the fragrance varied and interesting.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be watered down if that is possible, as my fiancee confirmed with her keen sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is subtle, and the 32 seems to last longer, so it appeals to me in a different, more intimate way,&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I agree with everyone that it does smell like the original Fahrenheit, but has anyone noticed that scent does not really last more than a few seconds or is extremely weak????</li>
            <li>when you first spray it all you smell is alcohol and after that dies down</li>
            <li>I do not care for colognes/perfumes typically, but I really like this cologne on my partner!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne if your curious and into something different concerning scent.</li>

            <li> Absolute is pretty good, it&#x27;s darker and more mysterious in my eyes .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think everyone will love it right off the bat, but with time it&#x27;s a fragrance that will really grow on you.</li>
            <li> overall, I am very satisfied to buy it.</li>
            <li> and I get a lot of compliments on it and for those reasons only, I purchased it and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll surely go down as one of the all time great designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unique.</li>
            <li> and it was brand new in a box which was great since it was a&lt;br /&gt;birthday present.</li>
            <li> I finally bought the cologne at an amazing here in Amazon</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I strongly advise against this particular Dior scent.</li>
            <li> Thank you kindly as my husband kept bugging me to purchase for x-mas present</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but well worth it,</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed, and, though I have about 20 fragrances to choose from on a daily basis, this has become one of my favorite go-to scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many excellent men&#x27;s fragrances out there, that it is hard to shop for colognes, so I suggest you take your significant other shopping with you, to help you decide . . .</li>
            <li> As a rule of thumb, I&#x27;ve found the more &amp;#34;subtly interesting&amp;#34; a fragrance is, the more refined, pleasing, and generally acceptable it is to women (which is extremely important because women are literally the only reason men have ever felt a need to wear cologne).  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> but I (a very feminine female) love it and wear it myself!</li>
            <li> This is a classic, unique fragrance for the type of man who handles his business, gets things done, calls it like he sees it, and shoots from the hip.</li>
            <li> He has used for some time and still enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li> It is durable and makes people aware of it.</li>
            <li> The first purchase was Fahrenheit Aqua in which I still have the box</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; smell is almost exactly comparable to the Yankee Candle Leather scent</li>
            <li> ever since I got it for him for the first time</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last twenty years, do I need to say more.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is for sure different, but I like it....</li>
            <li> I thought I lost my first bottle</li>
            <li> so I bought another one, then I found the first one.</li>
            <li> To me, the first thing I thought of was a gas station or mechanic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also something that has held up pretty well with time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean smell, not heavy at all..</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve repurchased a cologne, I really like this myself and it&#x27;s favorably received by all women I&#x27;ve met.</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled like a combination of &#x27;new car smell&#x27; air freshener that Uber taxi drivers spray in their cars and fresh gasoline from a petrol station.</li>
            <li> I bot this for my boyfriend and he really loves it.</li>
            <li> it shipped really fast</li>
            <li> Not really a nighttime cologne but more of a daytime cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe too much.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES.</li>
            <li> The smell is very enticing I do recommend this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really get the petrol opening though, but that might just be me.</li>
            <li> Also the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I find this fragrance to be very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> at least to me, it seems like every cheap cologne has just one overwhelmingly power scent and a heavy dose of alcohol (which is used in most colognes to intensify the smell by increasing its volatility).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I dont want to rate it to high, because I dont want everybody using it, if you get my drift.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few Dior perfumes in the past, mostly as gifts to my female friends and family and have loved their selections.</li>
            <li> I guess the reason I enjoy this fragrance so much is because it took me such a long time to really figure it out.</li>
            <li> This particular perfume, however, was my first mens&#x27; scent purchased for personal use</li>
            <li> This is really just a more expensive and higher quality version of Axe Peace!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, boxed - absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Infact I have the entire collection of Christian Dior and love each and every single one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> ; however, leaks a bit near the nozzle part</li>
            <li> It has a lot of subtle undertones that make the fragrance varied and interesting.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be watered down if that is possible, as my fiancee confirmed with her keen sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is subtle, and the 32 seems to last longer, so it appeals to me in a different, more intimate way,&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone that it does smell like the original Fahrenheit, but has anyone noticed that scent does not really last more than a few seconds or is extremely weak????</li>
            <li> when you first spray it all you smell is alcohol and after that dies down</li>
            <li> I do not care for colognes/perfumes typically, but I really like this cologne on my partner!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne if your curious and into something different concerning scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too unique to smell outdated.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll either love or hate because the first time I smelled Fahrenheit</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> and all i got was compliment after compliment on the scent, long lasting a bit pricey compared to others</li>
            <li> Aqua is a pass for me as it loses most of the petrol note and dries down a little strange on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a woodsy/leathery scent that is a little &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; on the senses (e.g., step down from the heaviness of a Drakkar Noir or similar cologne).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, this stuff smells very refined, complex, and inviting.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Caveat, be careful to only wear it around women</li>
            <li> I have been using Fahrenheit for as long as I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> Classic &amp; modern scent, that drives the ladies crazy.</li>
            <li> i had previously purchase this cologne a while back</li>
            <li> am not one to spray so much cologne on as to choke the people around me, so it is frustrating to have to spray repeatedly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a wet grassy odor underneath - moist jungle.</li>
            <li> Starts out sharp with flowers and moist jungle, as it drys down the mechanic shop reveals itself.</li>
            <li> Came in a black box with a sticker on it</li>
            <li> just a little FYI.</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily my favorite smelling cologne but it lasts on me longer than any other</li>
            <li> We have had trouble finding it in the department stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll provide another update in a few days once I test out the longevity.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> is that they sent me the wrong item a white bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 12 years and get complimented on it all the time.</li>
            <li> I can still faintly smell it on my skin about 9 hours later.</li>
            <li> Birthday presents for someone is a hard gift to find.</li>
            <li> Never ever had a complaint about his fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell outdated at all.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> This is expensive stuff</li>
            <li> Not to crazy about it</li>
            <li> you have this horrible smell with a faint smell of Fahrenheit .</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> was very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> and I would have to say I was disgusted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great scent at a reasonable cost; will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume but the 3.4 ounces, i had it before and it smells pretty good a must buy the thing is that they sent me the wrong item a white bottle! Very disappointed but im not gonna waist my time returning it!  Next time i&#x27;ll go to a store</li>
            <li> The first time I took a sample of this cologne, I have to be honest, I didn&#x27;t like it. But as time pass (very quickly by the way), the scent became unique. Every time I stop by Macy&#x27;s, I have o take a sample because it is to irresistible. I finally bought the cologne at an amazing here in Amazon and I don&#x27;t look back on my decision. I highly recommend this cologne if your curious and into something different concerning scent. I like all types of colognes, but I haven&#x27;t scene any strong cologne like this one. Great for wearing in the winter, night out with friends, getting girls. Whatever!!!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve repurchased a cologne, I really like this myself and it&#x27;s favorably received by all women I&#x27;ve met. You&#x27;ll get surprisingly many compliments for this fragrance :)</li>
            <li> This has a good smell. It is durable and makes people aware of it. overall, I am very satisfied to buy it.</li>
            <li> I bot this for my boyfriend and he really loves it. i couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in the stores so i was happy to see&lt;br /&gt;that i could buy it online. it shipped really fast and it was brand new in a box which was great since it was a&lt;br /&gt;birthday present.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, always get compliments!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance from Christian Dior. We have had trouble finding it in the department stores so my husband was very happy when we found it at Amazon. This has always been my favorite cologne he wears. We would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I never smelled this before i bought it..but i&#x27;m glad i did smells great , lasts a while..  def in my rotation</li>
            <li> Fake. Came in a black box with a sticker on it</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Fahrenheit. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 12 years and get complimented on it all the time. Not really a nighttime cologne but more of a daytime cologne.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering using Fahrenheit just know that once you do you&#x27;ll have to deal with all the ladies swooning over you.. just a little FYI.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGANCE, SMELL VERY NICE</li>
            <li> My teen loves this cologne...maybe too much. This was my fav in the 90s now my kid can enjoy..but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> My husband likes Fahrenheit because it smells nice and he feels comfortable wearing it.  He has used for some time and still enjoys it very much.  He will definitely recommend it to his friends.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Lasts a really long time.  Worth the price.  On a side note it also makes the bedroom smell awesome with a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> SMELL JUST LIKE IT USE TO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.. IT WAS AND OLDIE BUT GOODIE . THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES.</li>
            <li> I do not care for colognes/perfumes typically, but I really like this cologne on my partner!  Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I wear it, and pants fall off. Highly recommended. *Caveat, be careful to only wear it around women you WANT the pants to fall off of.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling product.  I use it  on special occasions.  It is not over powering and could be used daily.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle the following day after I clicked \\&quot;checkout\\&quot;. Outstanding service!. This is my second cologne purchase within 5 weeks from Amazon. The first purchase was Fahrenheit Aqua in which I still have the box AND I also have my box of Fahrenheit 32 which I bought at Macys. The fahrenheit box looks authentic when compared to the other two; I also tested a spray on my wrist and it smells great. I&#x27;m only typing this to alleviate any concerns you may have about the authenticity of the bottle. I&#x27;ll provide another update in a few days once I test out the longevity. I&#x27;m happy so far with the purchase. I got the 1.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 13th 2014 - Longevity is ok. Obviously this varies for people. I get about 8 hours with one spray.</li>
            <li> I had run out of Dior&#x27;s Fahrenheit 32, and decided to try this instead. I am NOT disappointed, and, though I have about 20 fragrances to choose from on a daily basis, this has become one of my favorite go-to scents. It is a challenge not to wear it daily, but that would be greedy! I still love Dior&#x27;s 32, and will get another bottle, too. The difference between the two is subtle, and the 32 seems to last longer, so it appeals to me in a different, more intimate way,&lt;br /&gt;One smell is all it takes. You have to spray it on your wrist to see how it enhances your body&#x27;s essence, because it does not smell the same in the bottle as on me . . .&lt;br /&gt;There are so many excellent men&#x27;s fragrances out there, that it is hard to shop for colognes, so I suggest you take your significant other shopping with you, to help you decide . . .</li>
            <li> Never ever had a complaint about his fragrance. Just place it lightly around the neck. And yes it help me get laid but you can&#x27;t saturate you body with it though (just project insecurity).</li>
            <li> I just bought a bottle of the 1.7 ounce (50 ml) Fahrenheit cologne from WalMart.  This stuff smells great!  Right off the bat, I thought &amp;#34;this smells manly.&amp;#34;  It would be safe to say that this fragrance would fall into the top 5 fragrances I&#x27;ve smelled.  It would take second place only to Polo Romance Silver for men.  Some reviews use the words &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;balsam&amp;#34; to explain its smell.  These are accurate representations of what this cologne smells like.  The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; smell is almost exactly comparable to the Yankee Candle Leather scent (I&#x27;m making reference to the actual wax candle sold by Yankee Candle for home use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this stuff smells very refined, complex, and inviting.  It does not overload your olfactory sensory perception.  It has a lot of subtle undertones that make the fragrance varied and interesting.  As a rule of thumb, I&#x27;ve found the more &amp;#34;subtly interesting&amp;#34; a fragrance is, the more refined, pleasing, and generally acceptable it is to women (which is extremely important because women are literally the only reason men have ever felt a need to wear cologne).  I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of cheap colognes, and the fatal flaw of them all is the lack of variety in the presentation . . . at least to me, it seems like every cheap cologne has just one overwhelmingly power scent and a heavy dose of alcohol (which is used in most colognes to intensify the smell by increasing its volatility).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne provides a great manly scent!  I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a woodsy/leathery scent that is a little &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; on the senses (e.g., step down from the heaviness of a Drakkar Noir or similar cologne).</li>
            <li> Birthday presents for someone is a hard gift to find. but when my friend mention how much he love Fahrenheit and could not find it I knew Amazon would make me happy</li>
            <li> Great price, smells great.</li>
            <li> I had this back in the day so i know how this smells. This item is definitely a knock off. when you first spray it all you smell is alcohol and after that dies down you have this horrible smell with a faint smell of Fahrenheit . was very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> My fiance love&#x27;s the smell ever since I got it for him for the first time</li>
            <li> I have always loved this sweet smelling fragrance, and people like it on me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fahrenheit for 15+ years, the result have been constantly good.  They offer different sizes to accommodate your needs.  This size is perfect for travel.  Really deserves 5 star rating!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my boyfriend for his Birthday and he just loves it and so do I The smell is very enticing I do recommend this product</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but it sure does smell good!</li>
            <li> Love this , my husband has worn this cologne since 1997.</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily my favorite smelling cologne but it lasts on me longer than any other and I get a lot of compliments on it and for those reasons only, I purchased it and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone that it does smell like the original Fahrenheit, but has anyone noticed that scent does not really last more than a few seconds or is extremely weak???? It seems to be watered down if that is possible, as my fiancee confirmed with her keen sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to spray so much cologne on as to choke the people around me, so it is frustrating to have to spray repeatedly. I will not be purchasing from this vendor as I prefer to pay more for the real thing...</li>
            <li> I love this cologne one of the best brands an make ever. Good price good fragrance I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few Dior perfumes in the past, mostly as gifts to my female friends and family and have loved their selections. This particular perfume, however, was my first mens&#x27; scent purchased for personal use and I would have to say I was disgusted. The perfume smelled like a combination of &#x27;new car smell&#x27; air freshener that Uber taxi drivers spray in their cars and fresh gasoline from a petrol station. I had to open my room&#x27;s window to get the horrid smell out. I strongly advise against this particular Dior scent.</li>
            <li> Cannot review the product.  Sent it as a present. Can say the person who received it has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> if you followed my demands, I really love this lotion</li>
            <li> Great Cologne for Men</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it on another man and asking about the scent.  It&#x27;s a wonderful and romantic gift.</li>
            <li> Gotta love this ol&#x27;skool cologne. This product is an all time great and the price was good and the packaging was brand new</li>
            <li> You can buy all of the imitations you want, but nothing is even close to the chemistry in the original Fahrenheit!!!</li>
            <li> Use this for years now and it&#x27;s great and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last twenty years, do I need to say more.  Great longlasting scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a classic, unique fragrance for the type of man who handles his business, gets things done, calls it like he sees it, and shoots from the hip. Stop wasting time with Axe and upgrade your kit.</li>
            <li> Oh my...hubby and I both wear this fragrance.  My signature fragrance was no longer available after 30 yrs!  Fahrenheit took it&#x27;s place.Nice clean refreshing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping great!&lt;br /&gt; Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Not to crazy about it but it&#x27;s a good one too</li>
            <li> This stuff is for sure different, but I like it.... I dont want to rate it to high, because I dont want everybody using it, if you get my drift.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tommy Of Texas</li>
            <li> Just have to say that many ladies have asked what cologne I have on, every time I use this. I will always buy more. It&#x27;s a clean smell, not heavy at all..</li>
            <li> One of hubby&#x27;s favorites! Came quickly, boxed - absolutely no complaints.  Thank you kindly as my husband kept bugging me to purchase for x-mas present and I waited for the last minute (the actual week of x-mas) and I think I got it like overnight!!! Wow!!! Kuddos to the seller! Great customer service and satisfaction!!! Make hubby happy, keeps me happy &amp; sane! Thank YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> Just classic.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle; however, leaks a bit near the nozzle part</li>
            <li> I love my husband! but now I love him more! jeje</li>
            <li> This is expensive stuff but it&#x27;s worth it. I thought I lost my first bottle so I bought another one, then I found the first one. That&#x27;s okay, now I just have a longer supply. This stuff SMELLS GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is definitely in interesting fragrance. I can really see why it became so popular. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll either love or hate because the first time I smelled Fahrenheit I thought why on earth would anyone wear this. Some people smell a strong petrol note, which is my experience. To me, the first thing I thought of was a gas station or mechanic. When I think of those places I don&#x27;t picture something that people would want to smell, but I own a bottle now.. so lol. I guess the reason I enjoy this fragrance so much is because it took me such a long time to really figure it out. I had about ten samples of this and used up the majority just trying understand why it was so loved. It was in that time I realized that I actually really enjoyed the smell, and it was that curiosity that drew me to smell it more and more. It&#x27;s kind of addicting in a way. I don&#x27;t think everyone will love it right off the bat, but with time it&#x27;s a fragrance that will really grow on you. It&#x27;s also something that has held up pretty well with time. It doesn&#x27;t smell outdated at all. It&#x27;s too unique to smell outdated. It&#x27;ll surely go down as one of the all time great designer fragrances. Oh, I also own two of the flankers, Absolute and Aqua Fahrenheit. Absolute is pretty good, it&#x27;s darker and more mysterious in my eyes . Aqua is a pass for me as it loses most of the petrol note and dries down a little strange on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is really just a more expensive and higher quality version of Axe Peace! Love it though!</li>
            <li> i had previously purchase this cologne a while back and all i got was compliment after compliment on the scent, long lasting a bit pricey compared to others but well worth it, ordered thru amazon and received as stated on ad, very happy with this purchase, thank you guys</li>
            <li> I have been using Fahrenheit for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;Infact I have the entire collection of Christian Dior and love each and every single one.&lt;br /&gt;This one stands out best when I am out for workout or in humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just love these products, yum!</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Fahrenheit. Everytime I wear it, somebody stops me and compliments me. Great scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he uses the same one since we met. I wanted him to try something different and he loved it too.</li>
            <li> Fahrenheit has been my favorite cologne for years now. Classic &amp; modern scent, that drives the ladies crazy.</li>
            <li> Always loved Fahrenheit!!</li>
            <li> product complies with the specifications&lt;br /&gt;no to claims&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend to all</li>
            <li> I know this scent is for men but I (a very feminine female) love it and wear it myself! I get more compliments from men with this fragrance than most of my others!</li>
            <li> For those of you unfamiliar with fragrance notes and things, it smells great. Like a bundle of flowers in a mechanic shop. There&#x27;s also a wet grassy odor underneath - moist jungle. Starts out sharp with flowers and moist jungle, as it drys down the mechanic shop reveals itself. Don&#x27;t really get the petrol opening though, but that might just be me. I can still faintly smell it on my skin about 9 hours later. Great masculine cologne! Don&#x27;t worry about reformulations and things if you&#x27;ve never smelled it. It&#x27;s pretty unique.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a replenishment for my depleted supply. My wife and I really love this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the item that I received and I just kept spraying it because I loved the smell. Also the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I work in a field dominatd by men. I find that when I wear feminine fragrances the guys tend to lean back when working closely with me. When I wear men&#x27;s fragrances they are not offended. I find this fragrance to be very pleasing. I tend to prefer spicy, musky, woodsy smells myself. But this one smells like these things called \\&quot;rose nuts\\&quot; I used to get at a tourist shop. Very pleasant. I still feel feminine when I wear it.</li>
