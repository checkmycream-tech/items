            <li>Perfect for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li>But the size is great for travel - just under the TSA size limit, and buying by the case means I am not scrambling the night before a flight.</li>
            <li>great size for carry on luggage</li>
            <li>These are good for more than a week!!  </li>
            <li>but when I ran out my own preferred toothpaste I tried this product.</li>
            <li>It fits great in my backpack and does a good job of leaving my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are not the travel size carried in most supermarkets (which are .85 ounce).  </li>
            <li>Do enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t able to locate an expiration date but something didn&#x27;t appear right.</li>
            <li>This brand also keeps my teeth shiny clean and feeling so smooth and mouth so clean.  </li>
            <li>The tooth paste is normal Colgate and fine, but that&#x27;s not why most people will buy this size of tube, so</li>
            <li>Listed as travel size pack of 12...was full size tubes of toothpaste...</li>
            <li>these are a great size, the toothpaste is tasty, I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaks due to cracking (fill up this 10 times and I would bet it would crack) and overall a good value IMHO.</li>
            <li>Filp top cap convenient, not messy and doesn&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li>Not as economical as the large sive tubes, but travel sizes never are.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>These are larger and much more reasonable to keep in a makeup bag for travel.  </li>
            <li>This size tube of toothpaste is much easier to handle if needing to travel or to hospital.</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>I have been traveling a lot for work and have been going through the smaller travel size tubes of toothpaste way too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Although I bought this for a charity my wife loves Colgate and is pretty much the only toothpaste she will buy.</li>
            <li>will pole my guests when a new tube is provided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot lately, and these are perfect to bring for a family of four for ~ a week (vs. the really little dinky ones that last for 2-3 brushes).</li>
            <li>&quot; long which is about the same size as a normal tube.  </li>
            <li>I really like it &amp; I like the size of it, very convenient for a small bag!</li>

            <li> This is small enough to meet TSA requirements but big enough that you aren&#x27;t having to buy toothpaste on your trip.  </li>

            <li> Perfect for cramming into the Quart Baggie you need to travel with</li>
            <li> I got these for travel so I could carry them on planes. Not a single complaint. Perfect for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s toothpaste. But the size is great for travel - just under the TSA size limit, and buying by the case means I am not scrambling the night before a flight.</li>
            <li> This size tube of toothpaste is much easier to handle if needing to travel or to hospital. They stay fresher for us single people then the largest tubes of toothpaste.  This brand also keeps my teeth shiny clean and feeling so smooth and mouth so clean.  Do enjoy using it.  Thank you for this product!</li>
            <li> Listed as travel size pack of 12...was full size tubes of toothpaste... Falsely tagged as travel sized on packaging</li>
            <li> Although technically these are under the 3 ounce limit set by TSA, the tube is just under 6 1/2\\&quot; long which is about the same size as a normal tube.  It&#x27;s just smaller around (circumference or diameter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the travel size carried in most supermarkets (which are .85 ounce).  It would be like carrying a regular sized tube of toothpaste but slightly thinner. The tooth paste is normal Colgate and fine, but that&#x27;s not why most people will buy this size of tube, so one star unless you need something that will last a month.</li>
            <li> great size for carry on luggage</li>
            <li> I really like it &amp; I like the size of it, very convenient for a small bag!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. I used to buy one or two tubes every 6 months and just refill from a larger size (I travel for work a lot). Not anymore ... these are a great size, the toothpaste is tasty, I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaks due to cracking (fill up this 10 times and I would bet it would crack) and overall a good value IMHO. I will buy more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to work with me so I could brush my teeth after lunch. It fits great in my backpack and does a good job of leaving my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh!</li>
            <li> I just ordered another 12 pack. Excellent for travel. Filp top cap convenient, not messy and doesn&#x27;t get lost. Not as economical as the large sive tubes, but travel sizes never are.</li>
            <li> Although I bought this for a charity my wife loves Colgate and is pretty much the only toothpaste she will buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if this product has a shelf life. I purchased for company in the spare bathroom but when I ran out my own preferred toothpaste I tried this product. The taste seemed very different and the texture seemed clumpy yet stringy if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to locate an expiration date but something didn&#x27;t appear right. Perhaps it was just that one tube.&lt;br /&gt;I will pole my guests when a new tube is provided.</li>
            <li> Usual travel sizes are too small for me if the trip is longer than several days.  This is small enough to meet TSA requirements but big enough that you aren&#x27;t having to buy toothpaste on your trip.  Delivery was timely.</li>
            <li> Just under the limit to use for travel without having to buy those teeny tiny little tubes that last only days.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  They are larger than the little tubes I used to buy that could go in my carry on that would only last a couple of days.  These are good for more than a week!!  Would buy again</li>
            <li> I have been traveling a lot for work and have been going through the smaller travel size tubes of toothpaste way too quickly.  These are larger and much more reasonable to keep in a makeup bag for travel.  If you travel at all, (and you like Colgate toothpaste), you should definitely go for this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot lately, and these are perfect to bring for a family of four for ~ a week (vs. the really little dinky ones that last for 2-3 brushes). By the end of the trip, you can just leave it behind!</li>
