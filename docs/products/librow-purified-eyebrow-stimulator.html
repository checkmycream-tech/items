            <li>I am so happy!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>When I got my makeup done for my wedding, the makeup artist was floored and said he&#x27;d never seen brows so wonderful.</li>
            <li>and my brows are still perfect.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because it DOES WORK!!!</li>

            <li>When I grew up and started to understand what was beautiful on a woman I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have that great of eyebrows</li>
            <li>, I have to admit, very lovely and nearly perfect brows.</li>

            <li>This is the most incredible product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Ordered LiBrow because of the good reviews and the return policy.  </li>
            <li>I used this from September 21 to November 18th being that they say it takes a good 6 weeks to start the growth of your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>The Ardell product is fairly well-reviewed here on Amazon and seems to work for a lot of folks</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and has produced significant growth of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love this librow and will continue to use it !</li>
            <li>And I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>This product was amazing befor, yet this time it did not seem to work.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing - in just 4-5 weeks</li>
            <li>My eyebrows, which were once envious, have taken on a life of their own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product and will keep using it as it directs you too.</li>
            <li>I no longer use any kind of product to darken or fill in my brows, even when wearing make-up.</li>
            <li>It is also easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much more sexy now!</li>
            <li>I only do them for the really GREAT products that I&#x27;ve loved, or someone in my family has loved.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I&#x27;m still pleased with this product&#x27;s performance, and possibly more than I was at first.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I&#x27;m still pleased with this product&#x27;s performance, and possibly more than I was at first.  </li>
            <li>What a huge regret!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>We are satisfied.</li>
            <li>just make sure you get it on your skin and not just on the brow hairs.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Make sure to use as directed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>but after reading the fabulous reviews, I am going to purchase this and see!</li>
            <li>I love the blending/natural look....</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>It does seem to have covered most of that problem gray hairs.</li>
            <li>I love LiBrow.  </li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed!!</li>
            <li>and i have a lot more in then</li>
            <li>SURELY it would be more well known.</li>
            <li>My wife can tell that my eyebrow appearance is much better using this serum</li>
            <li>Librow has also darkened my eyebrows, making them more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And make sure you get the product on your SKIN - applying it to just the hairs of your eyebrows won&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and used them faithfully, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully you will have better results.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to make the distance between my brows more symmetrical.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews convinced me to try LiBrow, even though I had just finished up another product(RevitaBrow)and had good results with it.  </li>
            <li>But overall this is very good.</li>
            <li>It had come to the point where I was honestly considering tatooing in the end of my right eyebrow because it was so sparse.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and it really works!  </li>
            <li>I can believe that after one more month I will have full eyebrows again just like the product claims.</li>
            <li>The hairs themselves that are growing are really fine, but thank God there is beginning to be alot of them.</li>

            <li>Mind you, I also let my eyebrows grow free.</li>
            <li>I can almost go without any type of powder or pencil for the first time in like 30 years!!</li>
            <li>I even got to \\&quot;cut/trim\\&quot; my eyebrows for the first time in my life!!</li>
            <li>this product is nothing short of Amazing!</li>
            <li>I have bald spots that are noticable.. but have gotten pretty experienced in the \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; effect to make them look natural and full...</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>

            <li>After about 6-8 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were significantly thinner and lighter.  </li>
            <li>Within 4 weeks I noticed significant improvement in both my brows &amp; lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look great and my lashes are SO long, my husband &amp; I laugh about them!</li>
            <li>the part between the brows at the top of my nose, and this habit even carried into my first year of college.</li>
            <li>I bought Librow full price from their site, and was so excited for it to work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have been very sparse for many years</li>
            <li>With full knowledge,and hope that this product would have some dye in it I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really been \\&quot;MAGIC</li>
            <li>, They look MUCH thicker and better.</li>
            <li>I will give it the full five months as suggested, and then re-review this product.</li>
            <li>It has been two full months since I have been using LiBrow</li>
            <li>I gave one more star to make 5 stars instead of 4 because my eyebrows have become gorgeous like the time I was little.</li>
            <li>same results for a much more palatable price. :)</li>
            <li>The company shipped the product out quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I have brows like Brooke Shields, but it&#x27;s enough to make me feel a lot more confident.</li>
            <li>now after 2 years of using this I still have the same great results, thanks Mirical grow, oooops</li>
            <li>Now i have nice healthy dark eyebrows</li>
            <li>I truly hope my first review is as exciting sounding as the majority here!</li>
            <li>Definitely give this a try if you want to look more youthful!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been for years about it because when they would say something, I&#x27;d try to laugh with them.</li>
            <li>After years of frustration because of the toxic combination of super-fine blonde hair and the over-plucking of the 90&#x27;s, I searched the web for any kind of remedy that might help fill in those bald spots.</li>
            <li>I have not seen a real color change in them yet, but it&#x27;s still to early to give honest results.  </li>
            <li>it IS WORTH the price.</li>
            <li>so I purchased it not expecting to see anything remarkable to happen in one month, and I have to say WOW was I wrong and happy about what was happening</li>
            <li>Because I am naturally blonde with fine hair, when I put on full make-up, I do still darken my brows a bit with pencil, but even then, they look more natural than ever before</li>
            <li>You will have to keep them trimmed up more often to keep them groomed, but hey, I would rather be a little more diligent about keeping up my eyebrows than fretting over them dwindling away.  </li>
            <li>The literature that comes with the product does say that you need to have some kind of root there, which I did, but it was so super fine and blonde, that it was totally invisible, even to me, unless I used a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you spend money on a product, that it actually does what it claims to.</li>
            <li>This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.  </li>
            <li>This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot adequately explain the transformation of my brows.</li>
            <li>My daughter was going to be married and while I could pencil my brows in and look fairly natural, I really wanted to have more brows.  </li>
            <li>I can now swim without washing away my brows and be out on a hot day without smearing them.      </li>
            <li>So please do not be fooled, and if you do choose to buy this product make sure there is a money back guarantee!!</li>
            <li>It looks promising!</li>
            <li>The funny thing about this product is that its purified eyebrow seram</li>
            <li>For the first time in I don&#x27;t know how many years, I actually had to trim and do some cleaning up of my eyebrows and believe me, I&#x27;M NOT COMPLAINING!!</li>
            <li>and I am sure over time the rest will come back in.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product whole-heartedly, but you must use it exactly as directed and be patient.</li>
            <li>This is my first review</li>
            <li>BUT, I can tell you for sure that this stuff has made my eyebrows grow longer than I thought possible.  </li>
            <li>It really, really works!</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews I figured I would take a chance</li>
            <li>ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY the STAFF THAT WORKS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am noticing that some people are leaving positive reviews, saying their brows are darker</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all the positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>I started using La Brow the second week in March and feel like my current brows have grown out more in length, but I have not seen \\&quot;new growth\\&quot; yet,and that is what I need more than anything, to thicken up my brow line.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about the results of tera few more weeks!</li>
            <li>While Librow won&#x27;t give you full voluminous eyebrows--uh, do people describe eyebrows as voluminous?--it will certainly enhance whatever natural eyebrow you have by stimulating growth.  </li>
            <li>After reading the mostly glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided that being able to go grocery shopping without having to draw on brows would be worth the risk of the price, so I bit the bullett and spent the money.</li>
            <li>For years i was plucking my eyebrows in a certain way.  </li>
            <li>The only thing: more than new growth, I think librow takes the eyebrows you already have and makes those hairs grow longer and thicker</li>
            <li>Use it nightly and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>but the ends of my eyebrows were very sparse and my eyeborws just didn&#x27;t pop.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any and everyone who wants to grow their eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really believe this could help</li>
            <li>NOW I see how much this product helped--or hurt--cause my brows are thinner than they were even before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>This product absolutely does what it claims, but you must be patient.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to darken them nearly as much as I used to; basically just filling in here and there.</li>
            <li>I figured if something had really been invented to help eyebrows grow</li>
            <li>Then after the two months my eyebrows got really itchy maybe from the formula.  </li>
            <li>I know some people think it just darkens the brows and doesn&#x27;t really make them grow...</li>
            <li>: I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, maybe this really is working for some of you.</li>
            <li>I think it really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks to librow</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much luck</li>
            <li>Librow is REALLY working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My niece had tried this product and it worked very well to fill in an area of her brows that had thinned.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that once the hair gets longer it will not stick straight out.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school, I used to shave (gasp!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, I leave that to other people, but this product in particular needs honest feedback.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that my brows are back to their original fullness.</li>
            <li>I have experienced a dramatic loss of my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I waited more then 2 months and let as much grow back as possible.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked new hairs and I&#x27;m not sure if it helped much with that.</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks new growth has appeared!</li>
            <li>This product worth the price, and I only wish this product was available long time ago...  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little more than a year now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but was willing to try it because I am a sucker when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s new growth, I started using Librow about two months</li>
            <li>After six weeks, with one application each day, I noticed new growth appearing.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully as directed for four months, and during that time lost all the new growth I&#x27;d gained from RenewBrow®.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is that there is definitely new growth.  </li>
            <li>I really hope that it&#x27;s only gonna take much time to make a change...</li>
            <li>I mean I wouldn&#x27;t except a miracle if you are completely eyebrow-less, however it honestly does help.</li>
            <li>They definitely have that pop now and my whole family noticed!</li>
            <li>I still have to pencil in my brows, but I have more brows now than I have had in the past 10 months.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 year old man and not only have many of the brow-lashes gone dye resistant gray, but they have lost their shape and stick out like little tooth picks.</li>

            <li>I am not seeing nearly the results with the LiBrow.</li>
            <li>After nearly 40 years of over plucking my eye brows were ruined.  </li>
            <li>but you really have to have patience, for me it took about two months to actually see my eyebrows getting thicker.  </li>

            <li>About one year ago there was a sudden death in our family that was very traumatic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i overplucked my brows as a teenager and over waxed as an adult.....</li>
            <li>I stopped plucking entirely but they weren&#x27;t really growing in that well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>now after 3 months they are dark and full.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the LiBrow for 3-4 weeks, and while I know not to expect results right away, I assumed since I&#x27;ve been using a brow conditioner every day for the last several months that I wouldn&#x27;t have any lapses in growth just because I switched products.  </li>
            <li>After the amazing regrowth of my eyebrows, I have discovered that it requires less and less of the product to maintain the growth.  </li>

            <li>I literally went from having about one hairs width of half an eyebrow over each eye, to having full width, thicker, normal shaped eyebrows like I did when I was younger!</li>
            <li>In the first three months three months my eye brows did actually got thicker and darker, but as the year continued some of the hair starting to fall out and none grew anymore.</li>
            <li>I recently looked through some photos of myself from last year, and compared my eyebrows then to now, and was really blown away.</li>
            <li>I am a major skeptic-</li>
            <li>I wonder how well these soft new hairs will come in and how long they will get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Resist the urge to speed up the process by using more of the product or applying it more than once a day; it&#x27;s just not needed, and would be a waste of such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li>My thin, sparce, sickly looking brows are once again full and beautiful!</li>

            <li>So far I can see growth, Obviously it takes a while to come in, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve grown back completely.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon varies almost daily, but is often $30-$40 cheaper than buying it directly from LiBrow -</li>
            <li>When used as directed (sparingly and on the bare areas)</li>
            <li>Hair grew back thick and full!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased the Lilash eyelash stimulator for my other daughter who wants longer thicker eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I am still giving Librow 5 stars because the little bit of eyebrows that I had before the product, is really thick now and looks nice.</li>
            <li>I anticipate using LiBrow daily for another week to complete the regrowth I want, then switching to only three times a week for maintenance.  </li>
            <li>so, I will order tonight and review every few weeks for you who are interested.</li>
            <li>thick, full eyebrows and this product made my eyebrows fuller, thicker, and darker in a short time.</li>
            <li>i started using librow the second week of february....and actually have a bare section of my brow grow back in.  </li>
            <li>I just think that there are other elements at play that mislead a lot of people that have nothing to do with new brow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is the most incredible product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Ordered LiBrow because of the good reviews and the return policy.  </li>
            <li> I used this from September 21 to November 18th being that they say it takes a good 6 weeks to start the growth of your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The Ardell product is fairly well-reviewed here on Amazon and seems to work for a lot of folks</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and has produced significant growth of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this librow and will continue to use it !</li>
            <li> And I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> This product was amazing befor, yet this time it did not seem to work.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing - in just 4-5 weeks</li>
            <li> My eyebrows, which were once envious, have taken on a life of their own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product and will keep using it as it directs you too.</li>
            <li> I no longer use any kind of product to darken or fill in my brows, even when wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> It is also easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much more sexy now!</li>
            <li> I only do them for the really GREAT products that I&#x27;ve loved, or someone in my family has loved.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I&#x27;m still pleased with this product&#x27;s performance, and possibly more than I was at first.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I&#x27;m still pleased with this product&#x27;s performance, and possibly more than I was at first.  </li>
            <li> What a huge regret!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> We are satisfied.</li>
            <li> just make sure you get it on your skin and not just on the brow hairs.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> Make sure to use as directed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> but after reading the fabulous reviews, I am going to purchase this and see!</li>
            <li> I love the blending/natural look....</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> It does seem to have covered most of that problem gray hairs.</li>
            <li> I love LiBrow.  </li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed!!</li>
            <li> and i have a lot more in then</li>
            <li> SURELY it would be more well known.</li>
            <li> My wife can tell that my eyebrow appearance is much better using this serum</li>
            <li> Librow has also darkened my eyebrows, making them more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And make sure you get the product on your SKIN - applying it to just the hairs of your eyebrows won&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and used them faithfully, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully you will have better results.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to make the distance between my brows more symmetrical.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews convinced me to try LiBrow, even though I had just finished up another product(RevitaBrow)and had good results with it.  </li>
            <li> But overall this is very good.</li>
            <li> It had come to the point where I was honestly considering tatooing in the end of my right eyebrow because it was so sparse.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and it really works!  </li>
            <li> I can believe that after one more month I will have full eyebrows again just like the product claims.</li>
            <li> The hairs themselves that are growing are really fine, but thank God there is beginning to be alot of them.</li>

            <li> I can almost go without any type of powder or pencil for the first time in like 30 years!!</li>
            <li> I even got to \\&quot;cut/trim\\&quot; my eyebrows for the first time in my life!!</li>
            <li> this product is nothing short of Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have bald spots that are noticable.. but have gotten pretty experienced in the \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; effect to make them look natural and full...</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that it is worth every penny!</li>

            <li> After about 6-8 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were significantly thinner and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks I noticed significant improvement in both my brows &amp; lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great and my lashes are SO long, my husband &amp; I laugh about them!</li>
            <li> the part between the brows at the top of my nose, and this habit even carried into my first year of college.</li>
            <li> I bought Librow full price from their site, and was so excited for it to work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been very sparse for many years</li>
            <li> With full knowledge,and hope that this product would have some dye in it I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really been \\&quot;MAGIC</li>
            <li> , They look MUCH thicker and better.</li>
            <li> I will give it the full five months as suggested, and then re-review this product.</li>
            <li> It has been two full months since I have been using LiBrow</li>
            <li> I gave one more star to make 5 stars instead of 4 because my eyebrows have become gorgeous like the time I was little.</li>
            <li> same results for a much more palatable price. :)</li>
            <li> The company shipped the product out quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I have brows like Brooke Shields, but it&#x27;s enough to make me feel a lot more confident.</li>
            <li> now after 2 years of using this I still have the same great results, thanks Mirical grow, oooops</li>
            <li> Now i have nice healthy dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> I truly hope my first review is as exciting sounding as the majority here!</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a try if you want to look more youthful!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been for years about it because when they would say something, I&#x27;d try to laugh with them.</li>
            <li> After years of frustration because of the toxic combination of super-fine blonde hair and the over-plucking of the 90&#x27;s, I searched the web for any kind of remedy that might help fill in those bald spots.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a real color change in them yet, but it&#x27;s still to early to give honest results.  </li>
            <li> it IS WORTH the price.</li>
            <li> so I purchased it not expecting to see anything remarkable to happen in one month, and I have to say WOW was I wrong and happy about what was happening</li>
            <li> Because I am naturally blonde with fine hair, when I put on full make-up, I do still darken my brows a bit with pencil, but even then, they look more natural than ever before</li>
            <li> You will have to keep them trimmed up more often to keep them groomed, but hey, I would rather be a little more diligent about keeping up my eyebrows than fretting over them dwindling away.  </li>
            <li> The literature that comes with the product does say that you need to have some kind of root there, which I did, but it was so super fine and blonde, that it was totally invisible, even to me, unless I used a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you spend money on a product, that it actually does what it claims to.</li>
            <li> This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.  </li>
            <li> This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.  </li>
            <li> I really cannot adequately explain the transformation of my brows.</li>
            <li> My daughter was going to be married and while I could pencil my brows in and look fairly natural, I really wanted to have more brows.  </li>
            <li> I can now swim without washing away my brows and be out on a hot day without smearing them.      </li>
            <li> So please do not be fooled, and if you do choose to buy this product make sure there is a money back guarantee!!</li>
            <li> It looks promising!</li>
            <li> The funny thing about this product is that its purified eyebrow seram</li>
            <li> For the first time in I don&#x27;t know how many years, I actually had to trim and do some cleaning up of my eyebrows and believe me, I&#x27;M NOT COMPLAINING!!</li>
            <li> and I am sure over time the rest will come back in.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product whole-heartedly, but you must use it exactly as directed and be patient.</li>
            <li> This is my first review</li>
            <li> BUT, I can tell you for sure that this stuff has made my eyebrows grow longer than I thought possible.  </li>
            <li> It really, really works!</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews I figured I would take a chance</li>
            <li> ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY the STAFF THAT WORKS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am noticing that some people are leaving positive reviews, saying their brows are darker</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> I started using La Brow the second week in March and feel like my current brows have grown out more in length, but I have not seen \\&quot;new growth\\&quot; yet,and that is what I need more than anything, to thicken up my brow line.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about the results of tera few more weeks!</li>
            <li> While Librow won&#x27;t give you full voluminous eyebrows--uh, do people describe eyebrows as voluminous?--it will certainly enhance whatever natural eyebrow you have by stimulating growth.  </li>
            <li> After reading the mostly glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided that being able to go grocery shopping without having to draw on brows would be worth the risk of the price, so I bit the bullett and spent the money.</li>
            <li> For years i was plucking my eyebrows in a certain way.  </li>
            <li> The only thing: more than new growth, I think librow takes the eyebrows you already have and makes those hairs grow longer and thicker</li>
            <li> Use it nightly and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> but the ends of my eyebrows were very sparse and my eyeborws just didn&#x27;t pop.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any and everyone who wants to grow their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really believe this could help</li>
            <li> NOW I see how much this product helped--or hurt--cause my brows are thinner than they were even before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> This product absolutely does what it claims, but you must be patient.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to darken them nearly as much as I used to; basically just filling in here and there.</li>
            <li> I figured if something had really been invented to help eyebrows grow</li>
            <li> Then after the two months my eyebrows got really itchy maybe from the formula.  </li>
            <li> I know some people think it just darkens the brows and doesn&#x27;t really make them grow...</li>
            <li> : I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, maybe this really is working for some of you.</li>
            <li> I think it really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks to librow</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck</li>
            <li> Librow is REALLY working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My niece had tried this product and it worked very well to fill in an area of her brows that had thinned.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that once the hair gets longer it will not stick straight out.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school, I used to shave (gasp!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, I leave that to other people, but this product in particular needs honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my brows are back to their original fullness.</li>
            <li> I have experienced a dramatic loss of my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I waited more then 2 months and let as much grow back as possible.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked new hairs and I&#x27;m not sure if it helped much with that.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks new growth has appeared!</li>
            <li> This product worth the price, and I only wish this product was available long time ago...  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes...</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little more than a year now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but was willing to try it because I am a sucker when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s new growth, I started using Librow about two months</li>
            <li> After six weeks, with one application each day, I noticed new growth appearing.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully as directed for four months, and during that time lost all the new growth I&#x27;d gained from RenewBrow®.  </li>
            <li> What I can say is that there is definitely new growth.  </li>
            <li> I really hope that it&#x27;s only gonna take much time to make a change...</li>
            <li> I mean I wouldn&#x27;t except a miracle if you are completely eyebrow-less, however it honestly does help.</li>
            <li> They definitely have that pop now and my whole family noticed!</li>
            <li> I still have to pencil in my brows, but I have more brows now than I have had in the past 10 months.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 year old man and not only have many of the brow-lashes gone dye resistant gray, but they have lost their shape and stick out like little tooth picks.</li>

            <li> I am not seeing nearly the results with the LiBrow.</li>
            <li> After nearly 40 years of over plucking my eye brows were ruined.  </li>
            <li> but you really have to have patience, for me it took about two months to actually see my eyebrows getting thicker.  </li>

            <li> About one year ago there was a sudden death in our family that was very traumatic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i overplucked my brows as a teenager and over waxed as an adult.....</li>
            <li> I stopped plucking entirely but they weren&#x27;t really growing in that well.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> now after 3 months they are dark and full.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the LiBrow for 3-4 weeks, and while I know not to expect results right away, I assumed since I&#x27;ve been using a brow conditioner every day for the last several months that I wouldn&#x27;t have any lapses in growth just because I switched products.  </li>
            <li> After the amazing regrowth of my eyebrows, I have discovered that it requires less and less of the product to maintain the growth.  </li>

            <li> I literally went from having about one hairs width of half an eyebrow over each eye, to having full width, thicker, normal shaped eyebrows like I did when I was younger!</li>
            <li> In the first three months three months my eye brows did actually got thicker and darker, but as the year continued some of the hair starting to fall out and none grew anymore.</li>
            <li> I recently looked through some photos of myself from last year, and compared my eyebrows then to now, and was really blown away.</li>
            <li> I am a major skeptic-</li>
            <li> I wonder how well these soft new hairs will come in and how long they will get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Resist the urge to speed up the process by using more of the product or applying it more than once a day; it&#x27;s just not needed, and would be a waste of such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> My thin, sparce, sickly looking brows are once again full and beautiful!</li>

            <li> So far I can see growth, Obviously it takes a while to come in, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve grown back completely.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon varies almost daily, but is often $30-$40 cheaper than buying it directly from LiBrow -</li>
            <li> When used as directed (sparingly and on the bare areas)</li>
            <li> Hair grew back thick and full!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased the Lilash eyelash stimulator for my other daughter who wants longer thicker eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I am still giving Librow 5 stars because the little bit of eyebrows that I had before the product, is really thick now and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I anticipate using LiBrow daily for another week to complete the regrowth I want, then switching to only three times a week for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> so, I will order tonight and review every few weeks for you who are interested.</li>
            <li> thick, full eyebrows and this product made my eyebrows fuller, thicker, and darker in a short time.</li>
            <li> i started using librow the second week of february....and actually have a bare section of my brow grow back in.  </li>
            <li> I just think that there are other elements at play that mislead a lot of people that have nothing to do with new brow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The only reason I decided to try a different product is because I don&#x27;t think the RevitaBrow lasted as long as I was told to expect.)</li>
            <li> Definitely going back to another product after this one did not do a single thing after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t even have to fill them in as much as i have in the past.</li>
            <li> Addtionally, within a few days I did begin to see new hairs growing in were there were none.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I&#x27;m having is getting the hairs that grow towards the center of my face from about halfway of my eyebrows to grow back in thicker.</li>
            <li> I went a little too aggressive the first time and they became a little \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Ofcourse I cleaned it up with a few plucks here and there, but I was completely amazed.</li>
            <li> However, I it reamins to be seen what will happen in the long run.</li>
            <li> I had a minor accident where I burned my eye brows and lashes off</li>
            <li> I decided to get the regular librow due to a finacial bind, yet when i recived it it stated it was purified, yet it did not work, or stop working.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day only now to help with the itchiness and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Now when I wake up I have brows and can leave the house with a very minor touch up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just me, but the hair does not lay down, it sticks straight out.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a victim to over-plucking.</li>
            <li> I believe in it now and can&#x27;t wait to see if at the end of the three months my poor brows will be back to normal.</li>
            <li> I doubt that my brows will ever return to their previous fullness, but I definitely see improvement.  </li>
            <li> I still have to color in my eyebrows because they are not full enough yet.  </li>
            <li> I now have thick lush eyebrows!          </li>
            <li> I was also a victim of the \\&quot;overplucked\\&quot; early 80&#x27;s eyebrows and have hated it for many years.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful where you put the lotion and how you shape the brow.</li>
            <li> I had to fill them in each morning and they always looked drawn on no matter how careful I was.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days (2-3), I&#x27;ve noticed my eyebrows regrowing and getting darker.  </li>
            <li> and i saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of everyday application, my eyebrows are back!!!  </li>
            <li> IT IS A TOTAL SHAM 100%.  </li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no brow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was faster than I expected, and</li>
            <li> I tried another product with minimal result over that course of time (Talika).  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant due to the cost but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Other products I have used did not give results that even came close to LiBrow.  </li>
            <li> This product works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I have never had eyebrows since I was small, and I actually had an appointment set up to get eyebrow implants done.</li>
            <li> I guess due to gene pool</li>
            <li> The 1st few days, I noticed minor itching &amp; redness...but that went away.  </li>
            <li> It seems expensive but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrows that are regrowing are dark, as they should be.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, eyes, eybrows already</li>
            <li> and yes if you don&#x27;t want dark brows, don&#x27;t use this product.  </li>
            <li> I began plucking and waxing to the point where I had well-shaped brows, but really far too thin.</li>
            <li> I was down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> They kinda just stopped half way</li>
            <li> But nobody would spend this amount of money for slightly darker brows.</li>
            <li> (v) Purchaser has not received a refund for Product previously.</li>
            <li> I now apply LiBrow only twice a week to the skin beneath my brows, and one tube now lasts me ABOUT ONE YEAR ... seriously.  </li>
            <li> (v) Purchaser has not received a refund for Product previously.</li>
            <li> I now apply LiBrow only twice a week to the skin beneath my brows, and one tube now lasts me ABOUT ONE YEAR ... seriously.  </li>
            <li> Well, I saw results in less than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I now have brow hairs growing where they previously did not grow at all.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow makeup requires less time now.  </li>
            <li> and she said because of all the little hairs, and</li>
            <li> Yes my eyebrows got a little darker, but they did not grow faster.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over a month ago.</li>
            <li> I have had to pencil them in everyday of my life.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So, after using this product for a few weeks I recommend it.</li>
            <li> If purchaser is not completely satisfied with Product, then purchaser may return the remainder for a full refund less shipping and handling, provided that: (i) Purchaser returns Product within 90 days of purchase date.</li>
            <li> If purchaser is not completely satisfied with Product, then purchaser may return the remainder for a full refund less shipping and handling, provided that: (i) Purchaser returns Product within 90 days of purchase date.</li>
            <li> Its only been about two months (a little less) and they are growing in like crazy in places</li>
            <li> She said those products usually take 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> (I was anxious</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure yet if this will cause the result to reverse itself.</li>
            <li> Another thing, I did notice tiny fuzz growing under my eyes which is weird because the serum was never put there.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to do alot of these.</li>
            <li> because, let&#x27;s face it, you try enough \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products that don&#x27;t work you get skeptical.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive purchase, and personally I feel as though I was \\&quot;had.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> But be careful not to get this product anywhere else on your face, that I am noticing some thin hair started to grow by my eyes where I never had any hair before..</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years</li>
            <li> I am a skeptical about products that claim such incredulous results.  </li>
            <li> I get at least a few compliments on them every week...</li>
            <li> random people, friends, women at makeup counters in the mall, the facial woman, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad because I recomended it to over a dozen people, they even notice how thick my brows became, only to find out this time around it stoped working.</li>
            <li> Previously, my eyebrows had been very thin and sparse due to overplucking.</li>
            <li> and I certainly do not want to look fake while out for the day...</li>
            <li> I mean LIBROW</li>
            <li> no more.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about this company is they say it takes 6 weeks to take effect and the return policy is only for ONE MONTH.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I have tried other products.   </li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable!!  </li>
            <li> the day\\&quot; thin brows were in</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I had thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> so.. my poor eyebrows have def.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that my eyesight is getting poor</li>
            <li> I was not happy.  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows were thin and gray.  </li>
            <li> but, alas, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> They went from well-shaped but way too thin to</li>
            <li> They were ridiculously hairy!</li>
            <li> Well, it did very, very little for me at all which is really a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> it is so expensive</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I figured for over $100, it couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it delivers the result I wanted.</li>
            <li> l@@ked totaly fake when I found this product</li>
            <li> But...it was extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive product to use all of the time, but I have to say...</li>
            <li> All, I have always been rather obsessed with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and once i hit the 5-week mark they started growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> But the product was very expensive, and when it ran out I thought I&#x27;d try  </li>
            <li> I agree it is too bad</li>
            <li> bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ago\\&quot; and she was shocked.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My advice to you: be ye not so stupid.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have grown like crazy!!  </li>
            <li> That is a miserable idea for brow maintenance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the most incredible product I have ever purchased. It works, period! It is also easy and pleasant to use. I will be buying more of this. It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you spend money on a product, that it actually does what it claims to. Bravo!</li>
            <li> So, basically I can say I have noticed a darkening of my brows but not any noticeable difference in thickness.  The website touts this as a thickening serum but when you get it the disclaimer states it is not intended to promote growth.  HMMM.  In my opinion, save your money and go to a salon instead to have the brows darkened...same results for a much more palatable price. :)</li>
            <li> The positive reviews convinced me to try LiBrow, even though I had just finished up another product(RevitaBrow)and had good results with it.  I&#x27;ve been using the LiBrow for 3-4 weeks, and while I know not to expect results right away, I assumed since I&#x27;ve been using a brow conditioner every day for the last several months that I wouldn&#x27;t have any lapses in growth just because I switched products.  I am not seeing nearly the results with the LiBrow. As soon as it runs out, I&#x27;m going back to using RevitaBrow...should have stuck with it to begin with!  (The only reason I decided to try a different product is because I don&#x27;t think the RevitaBrow lasted as long as I was told to expect.)</li>
            <li> I over plucked my eyebrows throughout my entire teenage years and they stopped growing. I have had to pencil them in everyday of my life. I saw this product&#x27;s reviews so I gave it a shot and thank God I did! Its only been about two months (a little less) and they are growing in like crazy in places they haven&#x27;t grown in years. I even had to get them waxed today, and they lady asked if I cut my lashes. I asked why and she said because of all the little hairs, and I said \\&quot;No that&#x27;s new growth, I started using Librow about two months ago\\&quot; and she was shocked. She said those products usually take 4 or 5 months. I am soooo happy! If you have think or close to no eyebrows you should definitely try this. It is working wonders for me!</li>
            <li> No question this product works. It worked for me and worked for my wife. I can only relate our personal experience. We have no affiliation with the manufacturer or vendor. The 2 buts--you must be very diligent and apply everyday (I was anxious so I applied it am and pm) and it will take 4 weeks minimum to work. Plus, if you stop using the product the eyebrows will go away again. Also, be careful where you put the lotion and how you shape the brow. I went a little too aggressive the first time and they became a little \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;. I agree it is too bad it is so expensive but I know of no viable alternative. We are satisfied.</li>
            <li> After nearly 40 years of over plucking my eye brows were ruined.  I had to fill them in each morning and they always looked drawn on no matter how careful I was.  Ordered LiBrow because of the good reviews and the return policy.  Was hesitant due to the cost but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Incredible!  Used as directed - just make sure you get it on your skin and not just on the brow hairs.  Now when I wake up I have brows and can leave the house with a very minor touch up.  Hair grew back thick and full!  I&#x27;m hooked now. I can now swim without washing away my brows and be out on a hot day without smearing them.      I would highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have plucked and waxed my brows for years. Back \\&quot;in the day\\&quot; thin brows were in and I did everything I could to get rid of my brows. What a huge regret! That is, until I discovered Librow. I saw results within a few weeks. My eyebrow esthetician is amazed every time I come to get my brows styled. They are growing like weeds. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It seems expensive but it really does work.  Use it nightly and don&#x27;t use too much. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does work !! Try it and you&#x27;ll see with your own eye !! I love this librow and will continue to use it !</li>
            <li> While Librow won&#x27;t give you full voluminous eyebrows--uh, do people describe eyebrows as voluminous?--it will certainly enhance whatever natural eyebrow you have by stimulating growth.  It also tints your eyebrows so that it&#x27;s a darker color.  After only a few days (2-3), I&#x27;ve noticed my eyebrows regrowing and getting darker.  After two weeks, the regrowth was undeniable.  Now I only have to use my eyebrow makeup sparingly (though make no mistake that if you have sparse eyebrows, you will still have to fill in your eyebrows with a bit of eyebrow makeup).</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any result yet. I really hope that it&#x27;s only gonna take much time to make a change...</li>
            <li> So far I can see growth, Obviously it takes a while to come in, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! I can&#x27;t believe how fast it worked. I wouldn&#x27;t say I had thin eyebrows but the ends of my eyebrows were very sparse and my eyeborws just didn&#x27;t pop. They kinda just stopped half way and I would always have to draw the ends on. But after about 4 to 5 weeks of using librow, hair was growing all over the place (even on the ends where I NEVER grew hair before). They were ridiculously hairy! Ofcourse I cleaned it up with a few plucks here and there, but I was completely amazed. I LOVE thick, full eyebrows and this product made my eyebrows fuller, thicker, and darker in a short time. They definitely have that pop now and my whole family noticed! I recommend this product to any and everyone who wants to grow their eyebrows. Worth every penny spent. Make sure to use as directed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Definitely going back to another product after this one did not do a single thing after weeks of use.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Ok.. this isn&#x27;t a product review \\&quot;yet\\&quot;.. but after reading the fabulous reviews, I am going to purchase this and see! I was a shaver and plucker from the 80s and 90s so.. my poor eyebrows have def. taken a toll. they do not grow and I fill in where it&#x27;s sparce.. without makeup.. I have bald spots that are noticable.. but have gotten pretty experienced in the \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; effect to make them look natural and full... it&#x27;s just that my eyesight is getting poor and I certainly do not want to look fake while out for the day... I love the blending/natural look.... so, I will order tonight and review every few weeks for you who are interested. I truly hope my first review is as exciting sounding as the majority here! Till then..... PS.. I rated it 5 STARS in hopes of because it wouldn&#x27;t let me post without rating..!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I purchased this product through the Librow/Lilash company because I received my money back.  I used this product for 90 days and did not notice any eyebrow growth.  Yes my eyebrows got a little darker, but they did not grow faster.  I even informed my eyebrow lady who plucks and trims my eyebrows, and she informed me there is no known product that actually makes your eyebrows grow faster.  So please do not be fooled, and if you do choose to buy this product make sure there is a money back guarantee!!</li>
            <li> I purchased librow about 3 months ago and started using it according to the instructions. After about 3 weeks i started noticing a change and once i hit the 5-week mark they started growing like crazy. Now i have nice healthy dark eyebrows and I can actually shape them without the fear of them disappearing. I use it now every 2 days but I&#x27;m not sure yet if this will cause the result to reverse itself. This product definitely does work. The only thing: more than new growth, I think librow takes the eyebrows you already have and makes those hairs grow longer and thicker so they seem fuller. I would have liked new hairs and I&#x27;m not sure if it helped much with that. Another thing, I did notice tiny fuzz growing under my eyes which is weird because the serum was never put there. At the same time however, I never applied librow to my eyelashes and those grew a lot too in length since I started using librow. Overall, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After 2.5 months I have noticeable eyebrows!  I was down to almost nothing.  The eyebrows that are regrowing are dark, as they should be. Other products I have used did not give results that even came close to LiBrow.  I can believe that after one more month I will have full eyebrows again just like the product claims.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been very sparse for many years and I didn&#x27;t really believe this could help but I was wrong. After about 3 weeks new growth has appeared! I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I figured for over $100, it couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I used it every day, for over 4 months and i saw absolutely no results. It&#x27;s a total waste of money. I would NOT recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows, which were once envious, have taken on a life of their own. I am 56 year old man and not only have many of the brow-lashes gone dye resistant gray, but they have lost their shape and stick out like little tooth picks. With full knowledge,and hope that this product would have some dye in it I made the purchase. It does seem to have covered most of that problem gray hairs. Addtionally, within a few days I did begin to see new hairs growing in were there were none. So, after using this product for a few weeks I recommend it. However, I it reamins to be seen what will happen in the long run. I wonder how well these soft new hairs will come in and how long they will get. It looks promising!</li>
            <li> I used this from September 21 to November 18th being that they say it takes a good 6 weeks to start the growth of your eyebrows.  Well, it did very, very little for me at all which is really a disappointment.  I had high hopes...no more.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about this company is they say it takes 6 weeks to take effect and the return policy is only for ONE MONTH.  Just note that if you buy this product to try.  I am stuck now with a big bill for an eyebrow stimulator that does not grow my brow hairs...bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I quit using anything.  NOW I see how much this product helped--or hurt--cause my brows are thinner than they were even before I started using this product.  I am now trying another brand and will try and update this again.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well.  I&#x27;ve used it over 8 months now &amp; my lashes are thicker &amp; longer.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore.  The company shipped the product out quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product as directed for one month and have not seen any difference in the growth of my brows.  They are the same as if I had never used anything on them.  In short, this product has not worked for me at all.  I will continue using it, but if there is no change, I will purchase Latisse and see if that will give me the results I am looking for.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing befor, yet this time it did not seem to work. The funny thing about this product is that its purified eyebrow seram they have diffrent prices FOR THE SAME PRODUCT! I decided to get the regular librow due to a finacial bind, yet when i recived it it stated it was purified, yet it did not work, or stop working. It&#x27;s sad because I recomended it to over a dozen people, they even notice how thick my brows became, only to find out this time around it stoped working.</li>
            <li> I have used everything you could imagine to get my eyebrows back to what they used to be even rogaine, but nothing worked.  Used Li Brow as a last resort and in a matter of weeks my eyebrows got darker and fuller so Thank You Li Brow!!</li>
            <li> I have been over-plucking my eyebrows for several years to where the hair stopped growing.  After reading the great reviews on this product, I decided to try it and I can tell you that it is worth every penny! After 2 months of everyday application, my eyebrows are back!!!  Fuller, thicker, and yes....darker.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love LiBrow.  I won&#x27;t let myself run out.  Saves me 10 minutes a day putting on eyebrow make up.  My eyebrows are beautiful!!  : )</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to do alot of these. I only do them for the really GREAT products that I&#x27;ve loved, or someone in my family has loved. I was also a victim of the \\&quot;overplucked\\&quot; early 80&#x27;s eyebrows and have hated it for many years. I had actually talked to several hair restoration places about getting eyebrow transplants but was dreading the $3,000.00 cost that I was quoted for it. I went online and searched and eventually decided as a last resort to try this product. I was NOT disappointed!! I started using it twice a day (morning and night) mid February (2011), so it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks. I literally went from having about one hairs width of half an eyebrow over each eye, to having full width, thicker, normal shaped eyebrows like I did when I was younger! I am SOOOO elated!! I feel so much better about my eyebrows!! Even my family picked at me about \\&quot;not having eyebrows\\&quot;. They didn&#x27;t realize how self conscience I&#x27;ve been for years about it because when they would say something, I&#x27;d try to laugh with them. They are not FULLY IN yet, but it&#x27;s a GREAT START!! I can almost go without any type of powder or pencil for the first time in like 30 years!! The only problem that I&#x27;m having is getting the hairs that grow towards the center of my face from about halfway of my eyebrows to grow back in thicker. The hairs themselves that are growing are really fine, but thank God there is beginning to be alot of them. I&#x27;ve been using Godfroy (Sp?) eyebrow dye to darken that part of them up and that seems to help. I&#x27;m loving this product and will keep using it as it directs you too. I believe in it now and can&#x27;t wait to see if at the end of the three months my poor brows will be back to normal. I&#x27;m thinking that they are gonna be! For the first time in I don&#x27;t know how many years, I actually had to trim and do some cleaning up of my eyebrows and believe me, I&#x27;M NOT COMPLAINING!! This stuff has really been \\&quot;MAGIC JUICE\\&quot; for my brows (as it states on the box), and it is easier to justify the $140.00 compared to $3,000.00!! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars was because it claims to darken your brows but it didn&#x27;t do that for me.sier to justify the $140.00 compared to $3,000.00!!

            <li> I have been using LIBROW for over 2 months. I cannot even begin to tell you how well this product works.  For years i was plucking my eyebrows in a certain way.  I wanted them to be thicker. Before i used this product only some of them came in. I waited more then 2 months and let as much grow back as possible.  I was not happy.  I started using LIBROW and i have a lot more in then i did before.  They arent all back yet but I am still using the product and I am sure over time the rest will come back in.</li>
            <li> After years of frustration because of the toxic combination of super-fine blonde hair and the over-plucking of the 90&#x27;s, I searched the web for any kind of remedy that might help fill in those bald spots. I came across this product and was hesitant because of the price. After reading the mostly glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided that being able to go grocery shopping without having to draw on brows would be worth the risk of the price, so I bit the bullett and spent the money. This product absolutely does what it claims, but you must be patient. I began using it about 10 weeks ago and I now have fuller, thicker brows. I started seeing results after about 10 days of daily use. Because I am naturally blonde with fine hair, when I put on full make-up, I do still darken my brows a bit with pencil, but even then, they look more natural than ever before and I don&#x27;t have to darken them nearly as much as I used to; basically just filling in here and there. When I am not wearing make-up, I actually have brows! I would recommend this product whole-heartedly, but you must use it exactly as directed and be patient. IT DOES WORK!  UPDATE: I have been using this product for a little more than a year now. I no longer use any kind of product to darken or fill in my brows, even when wearing make-up. They&#x27;ve grown back completely. This product is, in my experience, an excellent investment in self-esteem. It also saves me 15 minutes of make-up application time because I don&#x27;t have to draw on or darken my brows. I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube in a year, which is a hell of a lot cheaper than those treatments that cost thousands! The literature that comes with the product does say that you need to have some kind of root there, which I did, but it was so super fine and blonde, that it was totally invisible, even to me, unless I used a magnifying mirror. Now that the hair has grown back, it is progressively getting darker. I believe I will keep this product in my make-up case always.</li>
            <li> I am a major skeptic- I figured if something had really been invented to help eyebrows grow SURELY it would be more well known. After reading the positive reviews I figured I would take a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did because it DOES WORK!!! It took about six weeks, but now my once sparse bows are thicker AND darker. I&#x27;m not saying I have brows like Brooke Shields, but it&#x27;s enough to make me feel a lot more confident. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks and I have noticed a difference in the growth.  My eyebrows were almost gone and since I have been using LiBrow you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> This formula works but you really have to have patience, for me it took about two months to actually see my eyebrows getting thicker.  Then after the two months my eyebrows got really itchy maybe from the formula.  I use it every other day only now to help with the itchiness and it seems to help. Everybody has a different reaction. My wife can tell that my eyebrow appearance is much better using this serum and I&#x27;m much more sexy now!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and has produced significant growth of my eyebrows. After six weeks, with one application each day, I noticed new growth appearing. Previously, my eyebrows had been very thin and sparse due to overplucking. Librow has also darkened my eyebrows, making them more noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows were thin and gray.  now after 3 months they are dark and full.  you have to give it atleast 2 months of daily use to see the difference.  i will keep using this and plan to by the lash product too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting Li Brow to work because, let&#x27;s face it, you try enough \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products that don&#x27;t work you get skeptical. But I decided to fork over my $96 and give it a whirl. I know some people think it just darkens the brows and doesn&#x27;t really make them grow...but I do believe they&#x27;ve grown. Bottom line, They look MUCH thicker and better.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY LIBROW!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS A TOTAL SHAM 100%.  ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY the STAFF THAT WORKS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK, NOT EVEN SLIGHLTY.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, I leave that to other people, but this product in particular needs honest feedback. I bought Librow full price from their site, and was so excited for it to work. I diligently applied it to my brows just as instructed, daily. I waited months (5 or 6, until I used up the entire supply). I saw absolutely no brow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am noticing that some people are leaving positive reviews, saying their brows are darker and therefore it must be working. Yes, Librow has a tinting agent and it did tint my brows darker. But nobody would spend this amount of money for slightly darker brows. We expect growth! I&#x27;d just urge people to think about why they think this product is working--are your brows truly getting thicker, or just darker? Also, consider this: did you occasionally pluck brow hairs before using Librow, and stopped plucking during the time you were using Librow? This is another reason I suspect some people think it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, maybe this really is working for some of you. I just think that there are other elements at play that mislead a lot of people that have nothing to do with new brow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think twice, and read all the reviews of this product before you buy. This is an expensive purchase, and personally I feel as though I was \\&quot;had.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After applying it once a day for about 3 weeks, I saw the difference. Now I just apply a couple times a week as maintenance. It is expensive but it delivers the result I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I think it really works. and It was shipped to me on time. Awesome. Love it.</li>
            <li> I started using La Brow the second week in March and feel like my current brows have grown out more in length, but I have not seen \\&quot;new growth\\&quot; yet,and that is what I need more than anything, to thicken up my brow line.    I will give it the full five months as suggested, and then re-review this product.</li>
            <li> I have never had eyebrows since I was small, and I actually had an appointment set up to get eyebrow implants done. Then I found this product, and since it had 90days money back guarantee, I decided to give it a try. The result was remarkable, I canceled my appointment and even sent them my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; pics!! I even got to \\&quot;cut/trim\\&quot; my eyebrows for the first time in my life!! and I still have to maintain.  This product worth the price, and I only wish this product was available long time ago...  This product gave me my confidence, and I am so happy with the result.   But be careful not to get this product anywhere else on your face, that I am noticing some thin hair started to grow by my eyes where I never had any hair before..</li>
            <li> Thanks to librow I now have thick lush eyebrows!          When I grew up and started to understand what was beautiful on a woman I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have that great of eyebrows I guess due to gene pool I didn&#x27;t have much luck so I would have to draw my eyebrows on with a pencil in wich l@@ked totaly fake when I found this product I thought the price was ungawdly, then  I started to read the reviews I was like maybe I&#x27;ll take a chance plus it had a money back garuntee so I purchased it not expecting to see anything remarkable to happen in one month, and I have to say WOW was I wrong and happy about what was happening it was like mirical grow I had never seen anything like and now after 2 years of using this I still have the same great results, thanks Mirical grow, oooops I mean LIBROW I&#x27;m commited for life!</li>
            <li> Librow is REALLY working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I tried RenewBrow® by Metics.  The results were amazing - in just 4-5 weeks my sparse and thinning eyebrows grew back like gangbusters.  But the product was very expensive, and when it ran out I thought I&#x27;d try  [[ASIN:B000VDUOFM Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator]] hoping to get the same results. . .on the cheap.  The Ardell product is fairly well-reviewed here on Amazon and seems to work for a lot of folks but, alas, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it faithfully as directed for four months, and during that time lost all the new growth I&#x27;d gained from RenewBrow®.  So back to the drawing board...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but when I tried to buy another tube of RenewBrow® I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere - it was even discontinued on Amazon.  When I tried to visit the Metics website (metics-dot-com), I was automatically redirected to the LiLash/LiBrow website. What??? I phoned them and was told they&#x27;d acquired Metics and that LiLash® and LiBrow® were the same formulas as the former RenewLash® and RenewBrow®, but without the paraben (preservative).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my brows back, so bit the bullet and paid the big price for LiBrow.  The price on Amazon varies almost daily, but is often $30-$40 cheaper than buying it directly from LiBrow - but there&#x27;s a reason for that...read on.  I started using it the day it arrived, and in just three weeks my brows are back.  That was faster than I expected, and even faster results than RenewBrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resist the urge to speed up the process by using more of the product or applying it more than once a day; it&#x27;s just not needed, and would be a waste of such an expensive product.  And make sure you get the product on your SKIN - applying it to just the hairs of your eyebrows won&#x27;t do anything.  I anticipate using LiBrow daily for another week to complete the regrowth I want, then switching to only three times a week for maintenance.  At that rate I&#x27;m guessing the tube will last about 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ABOUT THE 90-DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEE &amp;lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;*  This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.

After the amazing regrowth of my eyebrows, I have discovered that it requires less and less of the product to maintain the growth.  I now apply LiBrow only twice a week to the skin beneath my brows, and one tube now lasts me ABOUT ONE YEAR ... seriously.  The price of this product has come down considerably since I first bought it, and with minimal use for maintenance, it&#x27;s truly affordable to have a full crop of eyebrows.about 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ABOUT THE 90-DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEE &lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;*  This guarantee is only good if you buy LiBrow directly from their website/company.

            <li> This worked great for me.  I have dark hair, eyes, eybrows already and yes if you don&#x27;t want dark brows, don&#x27;t use this product.  This product works for some people but not for everyone.</li>
            <li> About one year ago there was a sudden death in our family that was very traumatic.  After about 6-8 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were significantly thinner and lighter.  This started my quest for a product that would help regrow my brows.  I have tried so many products and used them faithfully, but to no avail.  My niece had tried this product and it worked very well to fill in an area of her brows that had thinned.  But...it was extremely expensive.  My daughter was going to be married and while I could pencil my brows in and look fairly natural, I really wanted to have more brows.  My husband and son encouraged me to try this product.  It came about one month before the wedding.  I can&#x27;t say that my brows are back to their original fullness. What I can say is that there is definitely new growth.  Also, my brows are darker because this product contains an ingredient that gradually darkens the brows.  When used as directed (sparingly and on the bare areas) this product will last about five months.  I still have to pencil in my brows, but I have more brows now than I have had in the past 10 months.  I doubt that my brows will ever return to their previous fullness, but I definitely see improvement.  Also, the product has a 90 day refund policy.  You have nothing to lose...try it.</li>
            <li> This product has produced excellent results for me within 3-4 weeks.  Over the past 10 years (I&#x27;m 53) I have experienced a dramatic loss of my eyebrows.  I tried another product with minimal result over that course of time (Talika).  Then I searched the net for an alternative and came across Librow.  It was 3x the cost, but after reading a number of testimonials I figured I would give it try.  This stuff works! Period!  My daughter (18yr) came home from college and wondered what I did to my eyebrows.  \\&quot;They are too bushy and look darker\\&quot;?  She&#x27;s been used to seeing me in my sparse stage.  Buy the product.  It should last about 4-5 months.  Your brows will improve, but can return to the sparse state over time if you stop applying. They should make this for the scalp, too.</li>
            <li> This is my first review but I am just so ecstatic about this product I had to write about it. I&#x27;m a victim to over-plucking. It had come to the point where I was honestly considering tatooing in the end of my right eyebrow because it was so sparse. Then I read in a magazine that some women use rogain to regrow hair. So I thought I would search amazon and low and behold, my SAVIOR! In my case I saw almost immediate results... like 3 weeks. Mind you, I also let my eyebrows grow free. So I was sporting the shaggy look for a while. Also, I started shaving my eyebrows instead of tweezing it... this combination saved my eyebrows.... I HIGHLY recommend this product. I mean I wouldn&#x27;t except a miracle if you are completely eyebrow-less, however it honestly does help.</li>
            <li> I purchased not believing if would make such a difference on my brows.&lt;br /&gt;it also darkens the hair over time, product last a couple of months enough time to see if it works for you. I will be reordering in the future...Thanks</li>
            <li> seriously......it works&lt;br /&gt;i overplucked my brows as a teenager and over waxed as an adult.....they have never been the same.....i started using librow the second week of february....and actually have a bare section of my brow grow back in.  i don&#x27;t even have to fill them in as much as i have in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable!!  It \\&quot;said\\&quot; it would take 4-6 weeks to see results.  Well, I saw results in less than 2 weeks.  My eyebrows have grown like crazy!!  I have not seen a real color change in them yet, but it&#x27;s still to early to give honest results.  BUT, I can tell you for sure that this stuff has made my eyebrows grow longer than I thought possible.  You will have to keep them trimmed up more often to keep them groomed, but hey, I would rather be a little more diligent about keeping up my eyebrows than fretting over them dwindling away.  This product WORKS!!</li>
            <li> i had this for maybe 4 weeks applying as said on the directions but didnt see any results. I was discouraged, but once i started applying a much larger amount it was ch-ch-ch-chia pet on my brows!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff works and im one of those people that NOTHING works for me. get it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the positive feedback.  It did nothing for me.  Hopefully you will have better results.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptical about products that claim such incredulous results.  I had a minor accident where I burned my eye brows and lashes off, I purchased LiLash &amp; LiBrow.  The 1st few days, I noticed minor itching &amp; redness...but that went away.  Within 4 weeks I noticed significant improvement in both my brows &amp; lashes. My eyebrows look great and my lashes are SO long, my husband &amp; I laugh about them! It&#x27;s an expensive product to use all of the time, but I have to say...it IS WORTH the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over a month ago. I have had tattooed eyebrows for about 10 years and the hair has always grown in white after they were over-plucked. Librow definitely made the hair grow in darker.  I still have to color in my eyebrows because they are not full enough yet.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is just me, but the hair does not lay down, it sticks straight out.  I am hopeful that once the hair gets longer it will not stick straight out. I am still giving Librow 5 stars because the little bit of eyebrows that I had before the product, is really thick now and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter whose eyebrows had become sparse and she was having to use a lot of pencil to draw them in.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks and already there are actually tiny hairs growing in where there were none.  It is amazing and it really works!  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results over time.  I have purchased the Lilash eyelash stimulator for my other daughter who wants longer thicker eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve seen great reviews for that as well.  I&#x27;ll follow-up with a review on the Lilash after we&#x27;ve had a chance to try it out.</li>
            <li> I hesitated purchasing this product, but because my brows were so sparce (and I had already had tatoos on my brows done several years ago) I took the leap. And I am so glad I did! this product is nothing short of Amazing! It works! It really, really works! My thin, sparce, sickly looking brows are once again full and beautiful! I am so happy!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but was willing to try it because I am a sucker when it comes to beauty products. It has been two full months since I have been using LiBrow and it is working! I started to see results after about a month of use. I do admit that there have been days here and there when I forgot to apply the product. My eyebrows did not come to the same distance between my eyes so I wanted to make the distance between my brows more symmetrical. I now have brow hairs growing where they previously did not grow at all. I no longer need to fill my brows with a pencil or gel. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> All, I have always been rather obsessed with my eyebrows. When I was in high school, I used to shave (gasp!) the part between the brows at the top of my nose, and this habit even carried into my first year of college. My advice to you: be ye not so stupid. That is a miserable idea for brow maintenance. I began plucking and waxing to the point where I had well-shaped brows, but really far too thin. When I got engaged, I decided to finally do something about my brows. I stopped plucking entirely but they weren&#x27;t really growing in that well. With three months to go until the wedding, I decided to try this, just to see what happened. I really cannot adequately explain the transformation of my brows. They went from well-shaped but way too thin to, I have to admit, very lovely and nearly perfect brows. I get at least a few compliments on them every week...random people, friends, women at makeup counters in the mall, the facial woman, etc. When I got my makeup done for my wedding, the makeup artist was floored and said he&#x27;d never seen brows so wonderful. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it is absolutely worth it. I haven&#x27;t used it in about a month and my brows are still perfect. Invest in this if you need face framing brows...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I have tried other products.   I have been using for a month now.   But overall this is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and have definitely been seeing results. What used to be sparse hairs towards the forehead of both brows are now hairier. Eyebrow makeup requires less time now.  d can actually gout with no makeup on even. I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about the results of tera few more weeks! Definitely give this a try if you want to look more youthful!    Update: I gave one more star to make 5 stars instead of 4 because my eyebrows have become gorgeous like the time I was little. I recently looked through some photos of myself from last year, and compared my eyebrows then to now, and was really blown away. This formula works!</li>
            <li> I have beeen using this product for a year on a daily basis. In the first three months three months my eye brows did actually got thicker and darker, but as the year continued some of the hair starting to fall out and none grew anymore. After stopping to use this product all the hair that grew fell out. This product does not deliver what promises.</li>
