            <li>An excellent product but ouch.</li>
            <li>Price is great!</li>
            <li>This is the best epilator I have used in terms of speed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially glad I started using this in the off season when my legs weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I felt this worked perfect on the pits.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in 24 years and this is the best \\&quot;plucker\\&quot; I have ever used.  </li>

            <li>the tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great!</li>
            <li>but* I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it pulled my skin in with the hairs.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been doing epilators for a while, so the hairs are use to being pulled out, but the difference is so impressive!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for the pits!</li>
            <li>My cost/benefit analysis saw this as the best option.</li>

            <li>So this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.</li>

            <li>love this!!!!</li>
            <li>After researching online looking for the best one, I decided to purchase this one, the Emjoi Emagine.</li>
            <li>The best I have used - bar none!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it can also be used on lip and chin!</li>
            <li>it is the best epilator I have tried so far,totally beat out the Braun silk epilator 7.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it!</li>
            <li>EPILATE LOL!!! .&lt;br</li>
            <li>After weeks of research online and talking with others, I thought this would be the best purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was impressed by the 72 tweezer system.</li>
            <li>It is the best.</li>
            <li>Happy with it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>I researched to see which epilator would be the best</li>
            <li>They were wonderful.</li>
            <li>I got this product in perfect time.</li>
            <li>I Think it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it over all types of skin and it has performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>BEST PURCHASE I&#x27;VE</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful epilator.</li>
            <li>This one is the best.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was the best one for me.  </li>
            <li>perfect.  </li>
            <li>Best Epi ever.</li>
            <li>of this considered, I will change my rating to 4 stars since this does work wonderfully on my legs.</li>
            <li>If you can tolerate pain and have tougher skin this would work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li>so I am impressed with that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either increasing the width of the gears or improving materials would make this the best epilator we have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for 5 years now and it still works great!</li>
            <li>This Epilator was rated number one for best buy when I went on line to find the best Epilator for 2015.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>

            <li>I bought this in hopes of thinking it would be the best epilator out there!</li>
            <li>Great quality!</li>
            <li>I have to apply a mix of vitamin E oil and tea tree oil (anti-bacterial) to the aggravated area for days and still do not look flawless for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Great, works as described!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Emjoi Emagine!!</li>
            <li>lol!</li>
            <li>Best investment you can make for women!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best epilator ever!</li>
            <li>It is perfect!</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but the end product wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best epilator ever!  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>At about 1/4&amp;#34; in length I thought it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>It works best for my underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the supplier.</li>
            <li>I read a blog pertaining to epilators being a girl&#x27;s best friend and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>This was definitely best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought in regards to hair removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this removes that hair from under arms and bikini area perfectly</li>
            <li>So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating.  </li>
            <li>So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great invention!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with this epilator.</li>
            <li>But I can compare it to my before furry body and my after, and I am VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Happy hair removal!!!</li>
            <li>This Emjoi is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent, I loved it the minute I got it.!!</li>
            <li>Even though I had a gut feeling it might not be the best one for me</li>
            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the Emjoi AP-18.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT &amp; I HOPE THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT!</li>

            <li>THis is one of the best epilators I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>If you want that perfectly shaved feel, you would have to spend hours with the braun.  </li>
            <li>That is the best system for me.  </li>
            <li>I can say it is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Not the perfect color, but who cares.</li>
            <li>Tried razors, tried the no-no, but this is perfect for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!!</li>
            <li>Works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The service was great, and they even upgraded it!</li>
            <li>The product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The best in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought another one for 1/4 the price, and it&#x27;s been working wonderfully for years.</li>
            <li>excellent machine !!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever I&#x27;ve had 3 in 5 years</li>

            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Best product ever!</li>
            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>I think I made the best decision.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!!!</li>
            <li>Love this machine!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li>It is just sooo pleasant!</li>
            <li>It does a very good job removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>So I checked into the epilators and this one had very good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Over all i think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li>It was a very good investment.  </li>
            <li>It is very good and tolerable.</li>
            <li>The Emagine is a great epilator-I&#x27;m impressed with how thorough it is.</li>
            <li>Great epilator, great customer service and Amazon is #1!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t feel like it does a good job of getting every hair, even the thicker ones!</li>
            <li>(she loved it too!).  </li>
            <li>I really loved my Emjoi epilator that I had for years!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It works so good, and is way faster!</li>
            <li>Loved it!  </li>
            <li>We used it a couple times and feel this is a good epilator at its pricepoint!</li>
            <li>good luck!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find out that it was cordless and that it held a charge!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to have people staring at my legs because they&#x27;re hairy but rather because of my sweet booty!!!!</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I got it, my best epilator yet.</li>
            <li>works good very happy</li>
            <li>IT WORKES PERFECTLY AND MAINTAINED GOOD CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;WILL</li>
            <li>I read many reviewers saying Emjoi AP-18 was the best, i also read some reviewers saying it was NOT the best.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before purchasing and decided to get the best of the best, which the Emjoi was considered to be by most reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and have already recommended it to many of my friends and family!</li>
            <li>So I decided to upgrade, &amp; I am very glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li>AND AM VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH IT!  </li>

            <li>I was happy with the results until I used it again.</li>
            <li>all I am happy with this product because I dont have time to visit salons that often</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing the Braun Xpressive, which I am completely happy with.</li>
            <li>The Emagine may be a great device for a lot of people, it just depends on your needs.</li>
            <li>But, I did it anyway; I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>Did a great job on my arm pits though.</li>

            <li>Let me start by saying this thing works great.</li>
            <li>so I am really happy with Emjoi.</li>
            <li>This one does great under the arms and on the legs and even in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Always a great product.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>It works great, I use it once a week</li>
            <li>After years of waxing I found a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try this one since it seemed like our would do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I think is a great product.</li>
            <li>The theory was great, but the pain stronger.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>product with 72 tweezer heads works great.</li>

            <li>It does work great on the armpit but again, you have to run this over it a couple of times to get everything out.</li>
            <li>It works great because of the head style.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the service.</li>
            <li>I also thought I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with the cord b/c</li>

            <li>love this razor!!</li>
            <li>However.... way better than shaving or using hair removal creams!!</li>
            <li>I will be very honest with you, it hurt like heck.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very effective</li>
            <li>Epilator is very effective at removing 100% of hair however depending on where you use the epilator</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just received my Emjoi AP-18 and have to say it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing !</li>
            <li>So after consideration I purchased this, and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Results truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>the time I am saving is astounding!    </li>
            <li>I thought it would take me a week or more to get used to the feeling of an epilator, so I&#x27;m incredibly happy that I&#x27;m adjusting to it so well in just two days!</li>
            <li>This is the latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Good luck and happy hairlessness.</li>
            <li>Delightfully lightweight, the plug-in operation is better than dealing with the undue heaviness of a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice not to have to shave with a razor and cut myself!</li>
            <li>Otherwise is nice product!</li>
            <li>from what i researched this is one of the best on the market with the most tweezer heads.</li>
            <li>and it works perfect for more than 5 years..</li>
            <li>Constructed better , faster, excellent contour!!</li>
            <li>The best one I have owned and I have purchased many</li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s the best Epilator  </li>
            <li>Nice surprise feature!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>The nice part is, over time it gets easier!  </li>
            <li>this epilator makes my underarms sexy, flawless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited, I could spit! :D</li>
            <li>have just good things to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Emjoy for making this amazing product!</li>
            <li>What a wonderful product, easy to use, no pain.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the results I was sure I heard a choir of angels singing!  </li>
            <li>It sure isn&#x27;t very good at pulling all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best epilator I have ever had, works the best and the fastest.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this to a huge range when I say it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Good product, the best corded available.</li>
            <li>it works great and effectively as advertized.</li>
            <li>My legs remain good for 2 weeks before they need another run with the epilator.</li>
            <li>It is good for a year.  </li>
            <li>I admit that my girlfriend gave me a good tip.</li>
            <li>I have an emjoi with 32 tweezers that works just as good.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair shot</li>
            <li>Its so good.</li>
            <li>Paid for itself already vs waxing, and a good price on amazon.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing the hairs with one or two swipes.    </li>
            <li>this is a good epilator..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using this great epilator &amp; loving it.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t do a good job on legs, which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I owned a Braun Silk-Epi for a while which I loved.  </li>
            <li>72 Tweezer Head Epilator did a fair job for me.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>My legs felt good for about a day, until stubble would start to grow.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Well, it kind of stings, but that is about all I experienced.  </li>
            <li>I have found some of the suggestions helpful, and have followed them with good results.  </li>
            <li>My Braun Silk epil died after giving me 3 awesome years of smooth, hair-free legs, arms, and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Now the good thing about this is that when I started on one leg at 8:23 p.m., I was done with both legs probably before 8:56 p.m..  </li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I loved the predecessor to this item and think I would like this one just as well if it wasnt&#x27; a defective item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works good...</li>
            <li>When it arrived everything looked  good.</li>
            <li>The construction I would rate as fair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ability to remove hair: Not so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  </li>
            <li>I also used it on my underarms with good results.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product as a good hair removal tool</li>
            <li>So i decidid to do some research and try to find one with good reviews and that looked like it would do the job.</li>
            <li>i wish now that i had sticked to what i know works good.</li>
            <li>on your &amp;#34; happy place anatomy&amp;#34; , figure out a way to hold the skin nice and taught.</li>
            <li>i kind of like how it feels lol.  </li>
            <li>in all, if you are a beginner and have the time and patience to use the Emjoi, it might be a good machine for you.</li>
            <li>But in reality it does not even come closer to giving a good epilation.</li>
            <li>bought a Braun epilator 6 months ago and found it worked, but not as good as the Emjoi on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten how good it was.</li>
            <li>decided to try it on my leg after trimming the hair to 1/8th inch, it&#x27;s good at plucking the hair</li>
            <li>I took good care of it</li>
            <li>And does not remove hair as good either.  </li>
            <li>I saw this Emjoi Emagine with the 72 tweezer head and thought it would be a good replacement if it did the job as well and was faster.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to my friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>It is a good hair removal maintenance product.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise I think I made a good investment.</li>
            <li>Good bye shaving.</li>
            <li>It has a good ergonomic design, too, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I suppose it depends on the person&#x27;s hair and skin, but in my case it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Emagine Epilator is a good device for removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>This product works good for your legs, underarms, bikini line and</li>
            <li>so you have a good amount of maneuverability without the cord being a hassle (something I was concerned about.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly hairy</li>
            <li>Good quality and nothing to complain about after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Got this product on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>This one is really good.  </li>
            <li>Good thing it was still under the warranty, so I sent it in and they sent a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I like the 72 tweezer head, does a good job, not mush pull or pain w/</li>
            <li>I loved the woman jumping around and throwing herself off the couch as she screamed in agony...</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>was cheap, I immediately wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>But it is good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it does a good job.</li>
            <li>After having this product for 6 months I feel like I can write a good review on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Emjoi Golf for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a good product</li>
            <li>That seemed like a good plan.  </li>
            <li>So maybe I need to learn some tricks, but I keep getting a fair amount of hair remaining after using it.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my health</li>
            <li>Letting it glide over your skin lightly works best.</li>
            <li>Maybe this would be a good one to start with since you have a barrier of running water and soap to get used to it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Models that are cordless tend to lose their strength so this was a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li>This is what makes it so good.  </li>
            <li>My daughter got me this one to replace my epilator that I&#x27;ve had for a number of years, and was no longer giving me as good a &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this, but the truth is that it hurts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used epilators for 25 years and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First the good</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the good</li>
            <li>I used Braun Silk Epil for 15 years and i loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved this epilator, when it was working.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this thing thinking it would be a good compromise.  </li>
            <li>in all, if your leg hair is thicker than mine, this would probably be a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting a good hair removal product and this is it.</li>
            <li>either it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good epilator that removes hair from the root</li>
            <li>He surprisingly got it for me....</li>
            <li>But a good product.</li>
            <li>I have Phillips &amp; I loved</li>
            <li>it was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews and did research on how to prepare your skin for epilation (by exfoliating!).  </li>
            <li>I keep it clean and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It comes out during use but it works best if you keep stopping here and there and just clean it out a bit sometimes.</li>
            <li>But honest I am thrilled!    </li>
            <li>Anyway, not totally bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that has been removing my chest hair for many years (before it became commonplace), About 20 yrs ago, I wa informed that I needed to wear support hose for my leg problems,I found out that it was best to remove leg hair to have the hose stay up better.  </li>
            <li>I think it is excellent and possibly the best hair removal product on the market.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and does a great job at pulling most of the hairs out, diffinitely would recommend to buy it!!</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT AND LEAVES YOUR UNDERARMS VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I got this.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the Emjoi 72 Tweezer Head Epilator.  </li>
            <li>use my epilator once a week fresh out of the shower for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>After using it, I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is very handy and keeps up a very smooth surface.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not instantaneous, but I&#x27;m confident that if you dedicate yourself and are determined, you will eventually get great results.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and priced economically for what it does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that brave yet :)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the end result.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my Braun Silk-Epil was dying after many years of great service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with item and performance.</li>
            <li>Used it 3 times now and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would be this happy :)</li>
            <li>LOL really I am So pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the prompt delivery sevice of the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual....  as well with the product, everything was as specified.</li>
            <li>I then turned to waxing and was very satisfied with that.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance as well as no-pain quickness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I am very glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Good price and quality manufacture with a nice design.  </li>
            <li>and this seems to be one of the best out there right now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not found the hair removal brilliant, it requires a number of repeated visits to the offending area in order to remove a significant (and still not all) proportion of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and does a very good job and fast.</li>
            <li>the Emjoi AP-18 72 Tweezer Head Epilator seems to do the best job of removing the hairs, and the hair re-growth seems to be much finer and they are removed fairly well.</li>
            <li>This product is very fast and works great!.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this emjoi!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this device!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried my under arms again and was much more successful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried my under arms again and was much more successful.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I ended up choosing this one!</li>
            <li>but once I used it I feel in love!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it for my underarms!</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first,  but does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li>it pulls the hair out from the roots (most of the time)!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re worried that you won&#x27;t be able to handle the pain, you might just surprise yourself!</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago and at first it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing epilator I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Well, for the most part it does!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it also doesn&#x27;t grab most of the hair!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>It worked even better!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Will probably spend more and go with a seller that has a longer return time!</li>
            <li>am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I did use it on my arms and LOVE being hair-free there!</li>
            <li>Much better!</li>
            <li>Trust me, this is a much better buy!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>How does this have outstanding reviews!</li>
            <li>I love these emjoi products!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it!     </li>

            <li>This Emjoi epilator is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product!</li>
            <li>I could not emagine another epilator being any better!</li>
            <li>AND the hair removal was even better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>those who swim in salt water, which is why I started in the first place, it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this epilator!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Then after that it is so much more tolerable!</li>
            <li>This is the amazon purchase I regret the most!  </li>
            <li>Anyone ok else has this problem let me know!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE that!  </li>
            <li>It works fine...much better than plucking!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with this one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt me, but for someone who has never used this type of hair removal, it may hurt at first, but once you get used to it, it is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is much better!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I think this is because the epilator didn&#x27;t successfully pull out many of the hairs from the root but instead broke off.</li>
            <li>Really love this product!</li>
            <li>best epilator thus far!!!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve found the product that will help you retire those troubles allow you to have a much more pleasant hair-removal experience.</li>
            <li>a great product, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This epilator pulls the hairs out MUCH more quickly and with a great amount of ease!!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for legs or large areas.  </li>
            <li>The price at Amazon was amazing.</li>
            <li>And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the pain issue, its amazing.</li>
            <li>Emjoi is amazing.</li>
            <li>I began using it on my legs six weeks ago and have great difficulty in getting my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does the job amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and had amazing results.</li>
            <li>Amazing what 72 opposing rotating tweasers can do.</li>
            <li>This is definitely an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This device is amazing.</li>
            <li>This emulator is amazing.</li>
            <li>On the bright side it does seem to get better</li>
            <li>it is  amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smooth transaction great product</li>
            <li>I have heard so many great reviews on this product and how it has the MOST tweezers of any epilator out there, so i decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  </li>
            <li>They faded on thier own after a while though.</li>
            <li>I have to say that they look good, much better than shaved.</li>
            <li>I am fairly pain tolerant though, so if you are more sensitive-use with caution.</li>
            <li>I did use an exfoliating sponge with warm soapy water on my skin</li>
            <li>I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed that area before, so I&#x27;m not used to that kind of pain.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
            <li>All have been good, but they keep getting better.</li>
            <li>I have found that exfoliating with a loofah and salt or sugar scrub in a warm shower helps a lot before epilating.</li>
            <li>The best hair removal I have ever used on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Good quality love it</li>
            <li>Overall great quality and magnificent product.</li>
            <li>a hint, make sure you keep the skin taunt, as this allows a good grip but also reduces pain.</li>
            <li>Effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m impressed and that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I purchased this epilator and after paying this much money I thought it would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li>All in all the epilator is good but could be better.</li>
            <li>my own legs/body cause</li>
            <li>It was also fairly noisy, and I was sure the neighbors could hear me \\&quot;landscaping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but , if you have somewhat aggressive hair breakage on the face ( females) I think esthetically it looks better and cleaner if you find a good threading</li>
            <li>that wasn&#x27;t as effective as it had once been.  </li>
            <li>this one is ok just not as good as the one i&#x27;ve been using for the pass 5yrs</li>
            <li>you  are done, apply whatever kind of lotion or gel or whatever on it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it when it worked.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I had been to a lot already.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful, quieter, and best of all it won&#x27;t pinch your skin!!!</li>
            <li>has only caused me great joy!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>The emjoi is definitely better and surprisingly</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I took a warm bath and exfoliated all areas that I was going to use the device on with a loofa&lt;br /&gt;-Made</li>
            <li>bought this Emjoi because I liked that it was corded, which meant unlimited power that wouldn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li>and then I make sure to moisturize with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it came with some kind of suction system that would suck up the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s included: The epilator, power cord, loofah, cleaning brush and a handy pouch that fits all of these.</li>
            <li>So, handy and convenient.</li>
            <li>the reviews said so many good things, but to be honest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another tool in my arsenal in my war against my own body hair.</li>
            <li>I took a warm shower before I used my epilator.</li>
            <li>Keep some solarcaine handy for afterwards if you think you&#x27;ll need it.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have found a leg hair removal system that works for me.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper models that take longer because they don&#x27;t have as many tweezers might actually be a good way to start.  </li>
            <li>dual opposed 72 tweezer head because I liked that it would work faster on my girlfriend than the others.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of it.</li>
            <li>But I must be honest here.  </li>
            <li>Would never buy another kind</li>
            <li>I found it was quieter than the Panasonic, but not as effective as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I liked to try another brands, I might buy another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>My legs are nice and silky for days/weeks after.</li>
            <li>a warm shower, exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Might come in handy someday</li>
            <li>I used to own one that was cordless, and I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>thing is a really nice machine</li>
            <li>Oh boy ... one of those good intended products that will pave the road to oh well :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But honestly - who freaking cares that it&#x27;s not one swipe and done?</li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>It really is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never epilated before and so was hesitant to spend this kind of money on a first-time buy.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to buy my own, and came across the tweezer .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe sticking to a good traditional/messy wax would be better than this.</li>
            <li>Nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>so have some cortisone cream handy and use it IMMEDIATELY after epilating.</li>
            <li>Next day I notice my chin felt smooth and no stubble; I was impressed and very happy.</li>
            <li>Still hurting too much to write a review, lol!  </li>
            <li>It comes in handy for dress season.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s travelable with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li>very powerful, works great.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice shape for handling and it really does a great job getting ALL the hair.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel very nice but not 100% smooth, as i shaved before and i heard hair grows in cycles</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This particular product stopped being awesome after about 6 months to a year of use.  </li>
            <li>This particular one received the best reviews</li>
            <li>Incredible, really!</li>
            <li>Works great for full legs, underarms and even arms, virtually painless.</li>
            <li>I have used an epilator for many years and was very pleased with the Emagine dual head version.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this means it would be ideal for first time</li>
            <li>Amazon has most certainly the best price I could find.</li>
            <li>It worked best when new but progressively declined in performance.</li>
            <li>or if you&#x27;re new to epilating, it might not be the best one to start with.  </li>
            <li>Best epilator made I couldn&#x27;t live without it .  </li>
            <li>I am a new epilator, but this is the best investment.  </li>
            <li>Although she was very happy with Braun, we decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>I am just so happy I was able to return it for free.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it after a warm shower, since the hairs will be pulled out easier and more effectively.  </li>
            <li>After a really quick delivery I have been using the product now for about 5 weeks and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this.  </li>
            <li>Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun Silk Epil for many, many years, which was already a good epilator.</li>
            <li>Easily cleaned, all around good product.</li>
            <li>Not  very painful, does a great job I love it!</li>
            <li>But the proces is very strong feel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to do around my mouth very easily  with the Emjoi</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve get shaved, the maintenance is very easy, just go over the spots that need to be shaved and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>epilator seems to be well built and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Once the hair does regrow it pulls very easily with tweezers</li>
            <li>very easy to use, I would recommend this product to anyone who hates to shave.  </li>
            <li>What I love most is that I don&#x27;t get razor burn!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!  :-)</li>
            <li>and when I went online to get another one, I started reading the customer reviews (I love Amazon most for these reviews!)</li>
            <li>can see how this might not do as good a job if you have really fine hair.</li>
            <li>Quick and very effective.</li>
            <li>This is also a great product comes in handy very much</li>
            <li>I figured, with 72 tweezers, this was bound to be more effective and faster than models I&#x27;ve used since.  </li>
            <li>Hubby is a body builder/power lifter, and they too, go for the smooth groomed look, so our epilator gets a GOOD workout!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I splurged for this it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best epilator I have bought to date.  </li>
            <li>you want an epilator that will remove unwanted hair post-haste, then it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>but I did research and chose this one because I liked that it had the most tweezer things.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold the attachment on its own, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li>the best so far.</li>
            <li>A light would make it great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good epilator.</li>
            <li>I used to own the Remington ep1060 and that broke off more hairs than it pulled out which was inexcusable.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this works the best on me.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t get ingrown nowadays, but do not expect smooth skin when running your hands on it</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far the Braun Silk Epil, Xelle is the best one.</li>
            <li>, I look forward to things getting easier, and more Effective ....</li>
            <li>this is my 6th epilator and its from far the best...</li>
            <li>The best I had so far.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li>I liked that it had the most tweezer heads.  </li>
            <li>I love this Emjoi, though, for the ease of use and the improved appearane of my legs, not to mention how nice it is not to have to shave.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>All in all, I do think this is the best hair removal technique I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>If you are going to home wax, it is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>so, i don&#x27;t have long-term experience with it, but so far so great!</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best on the market as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond pleased with my purchase and hope to get many, many years of good service from it.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean!!!</li>
            <li>The product is good and very useful.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair on the arms</li>
            <li>So if you have very fine hair, I&#x27;d say that the Emagine (or epilating altogether?) may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so that may be the reason.  </li>
            <li>Very quick and painless removal!</li>
            <li>Very fine (leg) hairs tend to just break instead of being pulled out by the root, so stubble in a day or two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s all I have, it&#x27;s good, nothing to get excited about, and it hurts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s all I have, it&#x27;s good, nothing to get excited about, and it hurts.</li>
            <li>I had an Emjoi caress gold for many years, it did a fairly good job, if slow,and I used it primarily on legs.  </li>
            <li>The best so far I have it or more than one year</li>
            <li>I have tried many epilators and this one is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li>It was a great epilator, but this one is far superior.</li>
            <li>I could wish for a bright light on the device so that I may see the hairs better.  </li>
            <li>This epilator is AMAZING and it leaves my skin feeling great soooo much</li>
            <li>which im pretty happy with.</li>
            <li>Everything was great for the first week or so.</li>
            <li>Online tips are great, hot shower, intermittent shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a great item, works very well!</li>
            <li>The Braun worked great, as my first epilator</li>
            <li>If you use the slower speed it works great but with the higher price of this epilator...</li>
            <li>It broke after 6-7 times of using First days it was great but one of the gears got worn out after 6-7 times of using.</li>
            <li>It held up pretty well, and if you consider the cost of waxing, this is a great value.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product and enjoy not having stubble to contend with.</li>
            <li>First, it is great for longer hair and areas that have been ignored or never had epilation before.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the bikini line was not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>My Epilady, when new did a very good job of getting the hairs ...</li>
            <li>And although I do love the Braun, this epilator is easily 2X faster!  </li>
            <li>- Very smooth, very smooth.    </li>
            <li>It does leave my legs, and bikini line VERY Smooth.  </li>
            <li>And it came on time ^-^ Very comfortable to use ^-^</li>
            <li>I am very surprised But very happy at what A good job it did the first time.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this model because I had been happy with the first 2, and I figured 72 tweezer heads had to be better than 36, since epilating is so time-consuming.  </li>
            <li>I was very enthusiastic and determined in using it at first</li>
            <li>Okay, so this is my very first time using an epilator and ouch!!</li>
            <li>For me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, which I love.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using epilators for many years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to my friends but you definately need to make sure someone has to sign for their orders because it was not delivered to my house and it was a week or so after Amazon informed me it was delivered before I received it.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to epilate as often as I shaved.</li>
            <li>The one I like it most on is my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did well removing the hair and the pain did get better over time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle the pain it causes on my arms and legs, but I use it mostly on my underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li>Doc told me not to shave for a while, so I thought I would upgrade to a newer and better epilator than the one I had</li>
            <li>I really like it and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does cover more surface area since it&#x27;s \\&quot;bigger\\&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job in removing my underarm hairs.  </li>
            <li>I did however, because of manufacture&#x27;s claim expect a more smoothend result (again take my hair type into consideration</li>
            <li>There still is the stubble, and there was more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Emjoi seems to just break off most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried my under arms and that lasted a whole 15 seconds, LOL.</li>
            <li>I tried my under arms and that lasted a whole 15 seconds, LOL.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically much better than the Optima too, so you can get a better grip on it.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to trying to tweeze the remaining stubborn hairs instead of running the epilator over it too many times.</li>
            <li>It advises that you use this in the direction of hair growth and that&#x27;s what I did for the most part.</li>
            <li>but after I did them both, I was SO PLEASED.</li>
            <li>could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase it there as i found a way better price here on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s more hair coming in.</li>
            <li>Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.  </li>
            <li>Tell ya what, I was hoping this was better than what I was led to believe.</li>
            <li>I do appear to have better luck using the lower setting, it seems to get more hairs.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the twenty or so dollars more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>The has to be the best invention in the last 500 years!</li>
            <li>since the Emjoi has more tweezer heads I thought it would be quicker for removing leg hair</li>
            <li>they \\&quot;expect\\&quot; to be able to ship it within 30 days</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>way more better thn all I had before</li>
            <li>I started developing more razor burns than I did with waxing.</li>
            <li>For almost $90.00, I would expect a much better performance.</li>
            <li>I really love this epilator.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>But it gets better with time.</li>
            <li>So we ordered this one because it is more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s longer, it will hurt more, so trim what you need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>I loove the feel of smooth skin!  </li>
            <li>But I would guess it&#x27;s getting better than an eighty percent pull rate.</li>
            <li>With 72 tweezer heads, I thought the product would deliver faster and/or more efficient epilating.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cute bag and cover for the top.  </li>
            <li>Nothing too challenging.</li>
            <li>But after buying this last week, i had to write how impressed I was.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tweezing for many years now</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt in the slightest any more.</li>
            <li>It arrived yesterday and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall excellent.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working as described; however, more time for evaluation is needed.</li>
            <li>Lots of power, efficient, quicker than most, tolerable pain.</li>
            <li>I was trying to decide between this one and one of the cheaper cordless Emjoi models, but I&#x27;m glad I went for this one.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped, there was no lingering pain, and my legs were smooth!    </li>
            <li>and there’s a lot more of it on my chin.</li>
            <li>It took no time at all and was baby smooth in minutes!  </li>
            <li>I know that this will go away the more that I use it in this area.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying a razor-free summer.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like the corded unit because it saves on batteries and seems to have more power.  </li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Much better then tweezing.</li>
            <li>The cord is very lengthy and it is great for arms, underarms, and legs:)</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years to remove hair</li>
            <li>I just wish that it did a better job of getting just one hair.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed the more I use it, the longer it takes for my hair to grow back, which is great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than waxing.</li>
            <li>i did a lot of research online before deciding on an epilator, and even more before deciding to try this one.</li>
            <li>Legs were stingy but worked in mostly one pass.</li>
            <li>I have owned this product over a year now, and love love love it.  </li>
            <li>the more you go over the area, the more hairs it picks up.  </li>
            <li>):)</li>
            <li>I fell in love with epilating</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I wanted to get what I thought would be a more high-end epilator.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this over waxing.</li>
            <li>I took a shower and made sure to use a buffpuff on my legs</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely better than shaving</li>
            <li>I have been using a epilator for over 15 years, this is my favorite one.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>This is OK.</li>
            <li>I find it works better on coarser hair vs finer hair.</li>
            <li>It worked better on my legs than the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Motor feels more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>caution don&#x27;t use it on your face though it says it is safe ..</li>
            <li>After seeing many of the beauty gurus of Youtube give reviews about the epilator, I had to have one.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to take your time when using this tweezer device, and treat yourself with your favorite body lotion when done.</li>
            <li>found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most.</li>
            <li>The head spins sofast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall</li>
            <li>just love this product.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it&lt;</li>
            <li>I thought that this would be an upgrade for 20 dollars more with two spinning heads.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am getting better results over time, but I still wish the hair didn&#x27;t break off as often.</li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing.</li>
            <li>Of all the epilators out there, the eMagine by Emjoi has the most aggressive design, including 72 tweezing elements that Emjoi boasts is the most on the market.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH much better.</li>
            <li>I HOPE THE MORE</li>
            <li>THE BETTER</li>
            <li>This epilator broke most hairs instead of pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>It was hardly better than shaving,</li>
            <li>For example, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wax being antimicrobial or the aesthetician dipping the spatula in it more than once</li>
            <li>Love the color too.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Emjoi for many years.  </li>
            <li>If taken care of, the product lasts for many years.</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
            <li>I wont say though that it hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li>As for my legs, because I&#x27;m skinny, I think it hurts more on my lower legs than thighs.   </li>
            <li>It does not \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; hair out 100% of the time, more like 80-90%.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I would say you will be hair free for 2-3 days max!  </li>
            <li>so I feel better without it.</li>
            <li>but for the most part it gets everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly probably hair that was in the &amp;#34;just budding&amp;#34; phase (anagen phase?).</li>
            <li>I think that the more you keep up with epilating your (talking about legs here)</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li>I had to take so many breaks</li>
            <li>Hopefully if I keep using this epilator it will get better and better.</li>
            <li>Gets better each time you use it.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Satinelle, and I used it for over ten years with awesome results.</li>
            <li>If you wax then you would love the convenience of the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Also, the opposed tweezer heads make shaving the bikini area MUCH more comfortable!</li>
            <li>(more passes with the device), so I splurged on this model.  </li>
            <li>Had to go over the hairs many times to remove them, and as it&#x27;s quite bulky, it doesn&#x27;t work well over bony areas.</li>
            <li>Time is precious and I would rather not spend hours doing my legs if it can be avoided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of replacing it and hope that will go well to make this a better experience.</li>
            <li>After you have tapped an area about 3-5 times, the \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; is infinitely more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to give your skin a break to heal.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this item but it is much better than most for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>I just shaved most the time.</li>
            <li>I really love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>Its mostly plasticky and flimsy.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think an expert could make this approach a better method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   </li>
            <li>I found that when the hair is longer it hurts more for some reason.</li>
            <li>So to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li>: This is what was most concerning to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For an epilator that is touted to get more hairs in fewer passes</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It gave me so many ingrowns</li>
            <li>price of this is way better than the Braun</li>
            <li>I am so glad it dropped</li>
            <li>72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They are perfectly conceived, so they&#x27;ll solidly clip the hair and pull it so swiftly that you don&#x27;t even notice it is gone.</li>
            <li>I must say I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it, works well.</li>
            <li>I love that I dont have to shave them anymore.</li>
            <li>relatively pain-free ... great results!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Was better than my razor, no pulling or nicks.</li>
            <li>using many different epilators I can say that this one is the fastest and best one ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the dual head you never miss an unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure on which one to get, but by reading reviews, I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I got a nice smooth shave</li>
            <li>But I understand that gets better.  </li>
            <li>Okay, yes it uses electricity.  </li>
            <li>For many of my appliances, that will not do.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the results...</li>
            <li>I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>so I thought a 72 tweezer would be that much better.</li>
            <li>trim the hairs (longer hair will hurt A LOT more).</li>
            <li>that way you&#x27;re not gobbling up too many hairs all at once.</li>
            <li>That will hurt more.</li>
            <li>I made sure I knew how to use it and was prepared for the pain that people talked about.</li>
            <li>I could still feel the hair on my legs, it wasn&#x27;t much better than shaving, and it hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad that</li>
            <li>and I love it!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I can already see it getting better with time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once  you learn how to hold it and let it do the work on its own it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and haven&#x27;t had to shave in days.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has two rotating heads</li>
            <li>I still have to go over some areas more than once, but I&#x27;ve had much better results than I did with the Braun epilator.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THAT WORD..</li>
            <li>i think im adicted  to epilating, i love it.  </li>
            <li>I found epilating to be a better choice</li>
            <li>That was okay.  </li>
            <li>Smooth leg wishes to you all!</li>
            <li>Since I heard it gets better the more</li>
            <li>and no it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>Never I had been so hair-less confident during Summer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow directions about how to use it.</li>
            <li>Faster isn&#x27;t always better........</li>
            <li>the most epilators.</li>
            <li>Boy do I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator after watching one of my favorite Youtube Beauty Gurus.</li>
            <li>After that, smooth sailing!</li>
            <li>You will love this product.  </li>
            <li>Beauty is pain :)</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It does get better as you get use to it</li>
            <li>It works faster and gets more hair becaue of the additional tweezers.  </li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>, made sure the logo faced me, and began epilating in the direction the hair grew&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am hoping that it gets better</li>
            <li>After many years of shaving and waxing I decided to take a plunge and try epilation again.  </li>
            <li>and I really, really love it.</li>
            <li>(I have many)</li>
            <li>I will affirm what many others have noted.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a guy and have a tad more hair than the ladies</li>
            <li>, i gave it a try and am glad i did.</li>
            <li>You would assume with more tweezer heads it would be able to remove more hairs, but compared to my Brauns, this one does not pick up as many hairs and works a lot slower.  </li>
            <li>I guess more money doesn&#x27;t always equate to better quality...</li>
            <li>just go for it :)</li>
            <li>Also, I rather suspect it is breaking off more hairs than it is pulling out.  </li>
            <li>I used the Emjoi gently silken epilator for about two years before getting the Emagine - definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I figured to use this once every week or so was better than shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will, except that for me there is no use in it at all.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s more about me getting use to it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>I like it better than shaving</li>
            <li>It is ok.  </li>
            <li>I would like to share that the more you use it</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this item.  </li>
            <li>While it was working it did an ok job</li>
            <li>and i was able to remove my legs and hands in just 15 mins..</li>
            <li>i love the product .</li>
            <li>I even youtubed this device to make sure I was using it to</li>
            <li>So glad we got the corded version.  </li>
            <li>I understand that the more I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li>I looked online for different ones, and the Emjoi had the best reviews so as always, I trusted the reviewers, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li>Nor does it pull out most of the hair, the rest it cuts it like a razor would.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one because it covers a lot more area in a shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>gave it to my niece, who seems satisfied with it, but she is used to shaving, so for her this probably seems like an improvement.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this epilator.</li>
            <li>It does remove most of them as it was supposed to, but part of them brake.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I would&#x27;ve preferred it to be more efficient than fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working ok</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it works ok</li>
            <li>It seems a bit noisey but not any more than the others Ive used.</li>
            <li>I think because there are so many tweezer heads it makes it quicker</li>
            <li>and I think it gets more hairs.</li>
            <li>I like it alot :-)</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I love my Epilator.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how many heads this thing has.</li>
            <li>no matter how many passes I make.</li>
            <li>, I thought I could find an even better one.</li>
            <li>Much better than the piece of garbage I just bought.</li>
            <li>more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Emjoi works like a top.....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Having more tweezers does not seem to add to the performance of the product.</li>
            <li>I find Braun epilators much better quality and performance.</li>
            <li>This is 100% better then waxing.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>try it  :-)</li>
            <li>this product has led to so many in-grown hairs that I almost considered going to the hospital.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi has the gears located on the sides which makes more sense, but time will tell if this design is better.    </li>
            <li>It also takes more passes over the skin to remove the hairs.  </li>
            <li>but i did not find it.first time epilating :-)</li>
            <li>I did and I&#x27;m glad that I did because with a couple of minutes use</li>
            <li>More hairs are picked up faster.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t always get every hair, but that may be more my fault.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Emjoi epilators.  </li>
            <li>I had to get another as I love the way it works.  </li>
            <li>Compared to shaving, though, this is much better for me.</li>
            <li>Probably better on legs than contoured areas.</li>
            <li>I bought the gen 1 version over a decade ago and it was still working but wanted this one as it seemed better with the two rotating heads.  </li>
            <li>And I can also say it is a million times better than the &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>An excellent choice for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>Use with confidence :)</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>This product is much better than any you will find in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>So...not really sure.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just read instructions and be sure to keep skin taught.  </li>
            <li>Cant say more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>it misses so many hairs on my legs and does not remove hair from my bikini line at all.</li>
            <li>I love the twin heads making it quicker to do my legs.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>But as your hair grows back thinner this device becomes your best friend.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your Emjoi!</li>
            <li>It works so much better than any epilator that I&#x27;ve used (</li>
            <li>We like it much better.  </li>
            <li>It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have use a Braun epilator for many years and decided to try a newer one.  </li>
            <li>I have smooth legs!  </li>
            <li>Should have invested more money.</li>
            <li>Love this model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painless, but not horrible either....</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>I thought the  dual heads of this product would work better.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I kept using bc</li>
            <li>week it all got much better, quicker &amp; easier.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>(under the nose still takes my breath away)  :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the Remmington model I started with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>This one has more  tweezers</li>
            <li>- Optomini is much better.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>We all know that, for the most part, epilating isn&#x27;t a pleasurable experience, but it works wonders vs. shaving.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a wonderful job at getting the smaller hairs.</li>
            <li>BUT, I do still love it.</li>
            <li>I tried my bikini line with the Emjoi and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>As I use it more I expect the redness from irritation to lessen and lessen.</li>
            <li>The headlight on it was probably my favorite feature.  </li>
            <li>If I was able to return this model I would, but I kept it for a while to try it out.</li>
            <li>Even with the sale it was over $4,000 which is more than I care to spend.  </li>
            <li>It still works better than this one did.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research and decided on the emjoi, because it had the most tweezers heads, and well, I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Love their products, and they are made well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating  for more than 5 years,  and have used a Remington,  </li>
            <li>and my latest was a Braun.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this one.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the speed of it</li>
            <li>For now, I am glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;strays\\&quot; All in all, I love this product and am thinking of buying another, just for back-up in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li>-  Took (possibly) more then 60% of the Hairs away.</li>
            <li>After tapping it a bit on my hand I was able to get the motor running</li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>and I had better luck with my legs (and maybe armpits).  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the Panasonic better.</li>
            <li>Price never guarentess better resul</li>
            <li>so I let it grow out for a couple of days more and tried again.  </li>
            <li>I think I tried it a couple more times on my legs with even longer hair</li>
            <li>Many of the reviewers that did not like</li>
            <li>and i love that it is corded because i do not have to worry about the battery dying.</li>
            <li>but it has the most tweezers and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>She also went by many youtubers recommending this one</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the model with the 72 tweezers.</li>
            <li>This is a great epilator but fast and aggressive and maybe not for beginners.</li>
            <li>I have been epilating for many years now</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but this is better.</li>
            <li>but the more you use it tge les</li>
            <li>It works like magic and the pain is more like a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>my favorite part is that it plugs in</li>
            <li>I have used the Emjoi AP-18 for about three weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have liked to see a light.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>And I should give it 3 stars for the more misleading advertisement that \\&quot;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This gets the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>This gets the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>with more ergonomic issues.</li>
            <li>The thicker the hair, the better it works, I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were better</li>
            <li>I will keep trying it, but if I don&#x27;t start getting better results, I will return it.</li>
            <li>It may need more hair length in those areas.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Emjoi Emagine a couple of years ago and was originally pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It was much more bearable to use</li>
            <li>I love this epilator</li>
            <li>This is my second Emjoi and it&#x27;s the best way I have found to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love not having to charge it.  </li>
            <li>Found it here and love it , can not do without this item.</li>
            <li>This one removes more hair better and faster.  </li>
            <li>And if you epilate more often (hair are shorter)</li>
            <li>you are better off.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ll put this way, my skin feels more bumpy/rough than when I use a Braun Silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>whatever reason, despite the opposing rotating heads, the 72 twezers, the speed and the brutality :-)</li>
            <li>I think you get better power and time with a corded product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it does a better job than my razor because it has a tendency of breaking the hair off when you go in the direction it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have to run this over my legs more than once to get everything out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who is will to rip their hair out :)</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this has definitely has me in love.  </li>
            <li>I found that it broke off most hair rather than pulled it by the root.</li>
            <li>This epilator is a must have if you want silky smooth legs!</li>
            <li>Waxing is way better.</li>
            <li>I felt it needed to replaced after more than 5 years and thought the AP-18 would be even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using an epilator, but after buying it and taking the risk, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just glide it across lightly in different directions for the best results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast with great coverage.</li>
            <li>Look no further this is the best thing since sliced bread...    </li>
            <li>LOVE IT  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li>pain aspect of an epilator is what terrified me the most.</li>
            <li>IT SOUNDS EVEN BETTER THAN THE OPTIMA AND</li>
            <li>I though it would pick up more hairs since it&#x27;s has a 72 tweezer head</li>
            <li>but it was just okay.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi was a top pick after some research and seemed to offer everything I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I made the leap and was glad I did.  </li>
            <li>the more I use it.  </li>
            <li>that I am 100% pleased with the results I am getting on both my underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The emjoi did not hurt me at all because my body had been used to epilating for many</li>
            <li>The Emjoi AP-18 is the most effective and comfortable epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s still better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take out as many hairs as it says.  </li>
            <li>But they were smooth!  </li>
            <li>(I was prepared after reading reviews), I was fairly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>Plus I figured it would get better the more</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I like this one better than the others.  </li>
            <li>After many years of reliable use I needed to replace my epilator.</li>
            <li>so I cannot say that there were any products better than this, but I can believe there are some better ones out there.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better it is, I used to look at my hairs and then wait for the pain of it being pulled out to know it was gone,</li>
            <li>I returned this and bought an eighty dollar Braun, which is SO much better.</li>
            <li>I have done it both ways many times.  </li>
            <li>and you will love it.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper brands by Phillips etc doa much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my Emjoi  as it is safer than shaving, and it does not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I do still prefer using the epilator over the razor, but don&#x27;t expects baby smooth skin in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have used an epilator for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>:).  </li>
            <li>so no worries about charging it :-).</li>
            <li>Gets more hair</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>But in that case it&#x27;s easier to wax :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do love this tool.</li>
            <li>Time and repetition - epilation takes more time than shaving and you do need to go over the area more than once to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>I use the slower speed on the device because I thought the faster speed was causing more hair breakage.</li>
            <li>Now I use the epilator and although I&#x27;ll never be an underarm model, I am hair free in this area and loving it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Epilator is the best personal grooming device I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>and it is doing a much better job.  </li>
            <li>The duel head catches more hair so you do not have to go over your legs so many times.  </li>
            <li>Once I set my mind to the thought of waxing again I was more able to tolerate the feeling.</li>
            <li>I feel like if a spend $80 on an epilator it should work more than 17 times.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to go to walmart and buy some bump patrol or something at the self checkout</li>
            <li>Best facial hair remover I have ever used!</li>
            <li>it will not pick up even longer hairs, I had to circle around some of them more than 10X to get it to grab (maybe).</li>
            <li>This one does a better job.</li>
            <li>and now I can not use it any more.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE I WAS SURE</li>
            <li>IF I GOT ONE WITH MORE TWEZZERS</li>
            <li>I ENDED UP PAYING MORE MONEY FOR THIS EMJOI</li>
            <li>Need more practice I guess.  </li>
            <li>This worked ok.  </li>
            <li>and I am able to listen to a talk show on the radio while I epilate.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>The plastic head is kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>Try it ... :)</li>
            <li>Ok so I am a guy</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product</li>
            <li>And what can I say I freakin love it.  </li>
            <li>This one, requiring the cord to work, is might lighter, has more tweezers, and works even faster.  </li>
            <li>It does a much better job of removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I have had better experience with lower price epilators..  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Could have gotten better faster results by shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this emjoi  removed more than 2 hairs from my chin.  </li>
            <li>(Braun does a better job in</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it, it gives me another option to shaving, and I can throw away my wax kit.</li>
            <li>(Doctor&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a sign of a healthy heart.</li>
            <li>And oh, to have that smooth feel and look again!</li>
            <li>It worked on the cheeks, but I&#x27;d put the pain more along the lines of a 3.</li>
            <li>Nothing more was needed; no ice the way I would after waxing.</li>
            <li>being said, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll take a couple of attempts to pluck most of the hair out.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a bit of a task getting most of the hair out,</li>
            <li>I got this to upgrade my Panasonic epilator thinking it would grab more hairs and be an all around quicker experience</li>
            <li>I said the next best thing because I think my hair removing problems will be solved by Laser Hair Removal, and since I cannot afford that yet, the next best thing is an epilator.</li>
            <li>But as you go on, each time will be a lot more tolerable.</li>
            <li>But i must say i was throughly satisfied with Emjoi....</li>
            <li>But, it is very powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do both legs in one day and my first leg took me hours to do because of the pain!!!</li>
            <li>I did end up buying the newest Braun Silk Epil 7 recently, and I love it!!!</li>
            <li>I was VERY excited to recieve this product</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this when I took it out of the box</li>
            <li>After researching epilators i choose to get this one, so i ordered it and was very excited.</li>
            <li>I was very excited (and somewhat scared) to use this monster of a machine.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy 2 use and very smooth, better than others I tried.</li>
            <li>It also kind of grossed me out that there&#x27;s no way to really clean the tweezer heads.  </li>
            <li>Great result, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I got used to the pain quickly and am so glad I took a chance and tried it!</li>
            <li>I think it is especially nice in the bikini line areas, where razor bumps are often a problem, there was no redness except for the initial one mentioned before, which is gone very quickly.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful on this epilator and is great for getting course hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>okay ladies, and gents this a great tweezer, emjoi is awesome my hair was very thick, and would grow everytime</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The shape is easy to hold and very light.</li>
            <li>I had more fun watching some of the goofy videos!</li>
            <li>I owned the Emjoi Optima first, for 6 years, and loved it.</li>
            <li>One of the Braun reviewers (Mark Twain) has good advice for the first time users: shave (with a razor)</li>
            <li>so I feel that after 20 years, I&#x27;m a pretty good judge off them.   </li>
            <li>And the best part is, you don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to get long.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I read, it sounded pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job on my underarms but can also take some skin with it, and I end up with a brush burn.</li>
            <li>I was more comfortable and was able to work faster and more</li>
            <li>Its actually pretty good</li>
            <li>It does pretty good on my legs.</li>
            <li>This was pretty pricey, but I loved it until my cat chewed the power chord up.</li>
            <li>It may be wise to keep searching if you are a first time user or if noise is a problem for you.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED the emjoi at first.  </li>
            <li>It works best with hair around 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, and seems to get even the finest hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hurt and you can use every time, it&#x27;s so easy and safe, I really like it, and my family too!!!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I bought this particular model as my first epilator.</li>
            <li>Even though I’ve had to replace two units after 2.5 and 4 years, I still feel that the Emjoi works great and is worth the $80 (which has not gone up in price since the first one I bought 10 yrs ago)!   </li>
            <li>For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine)</li>
            <li>For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worth the money and pain!!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!!  </li>
            <li>This one works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, even on new areas that have never been done like the tops of my feet and toes.</li>
            <li>This is the best way to remove hair I have found in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and I love that I can &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; without the blood-letting I experience with a razor.</li>
            <li>I tried on my face just to try and was pleasantly surprise that it does not hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>liked that this product works quick and if they are used to the pain than they will  remove hairs</li>
            <li>love it and easy to use</li>
            <li>The cord honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me since I just use it quickly in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>So I do like this product, but most of all I love being a bit smooth.</li>
            <li>To be fair, the hair there was much shorter, having been shaved the day before, but I suspect I was mostly experiencing skin pinching not hair</li>
            <li>This epilator works twice as fast and twice as good as the one I had (a braun), love it</li>
            <li>what made me happy and encouraged me to do my whole legs, and now, they are just smooth with almost no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great as far as removing all hair but the case on top scratches and leaves a mark</li>
            <li>Works great and really is very pain free for me ..</li>
            <li>It does not hurt at all, it is confortable and very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I am 110% happy with this purchase so far!</li>
            <li>I wish they made a higher quality product, but as it stands, it&#x27;s more cost effective and more convenient than waxing....</li>
            <li>both enjoy this product and my girlfriend is very smooth</li>
            <li>That said, most of the time and on legs it&#x27;s totally fine.    </li>
            <li>The Braun epi&#x27;s are much better at one time pass and fine hair removal</li>
            <li>I think these work better on fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better on coarser hair than fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other epilators before this one and I have to say this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>There were suggestions given in the instruction manual and in the reviews of other users, I will eventually try most  to find out what works best for me.</li>
            <li>but the goofy ones were much more fun!</li>
            <li>I had never used an empilator before, but after reading so many good reviews on this particular epilator</li>
            <li>Works very good, had a different brand before.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this tool as a great way to stay hair-free and smooth this summer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a hairy girl, but I am very fair skinned, so when I shave, the fast regrowth is pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li>For the most part though your legs will be hair free.</li>
            <li>As far as epilators go, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>You can use this epilator any time of the day, as many times in a day you want, and you do not have to &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; in more ways than one, like wax, and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick to my pink BaByliss (bought in Israel and truly excellent), and chalk this one up to a dud.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly sceptical that something like this would actually work.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product that sure beats threading or waxing.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most important steps.</li>
            <li>This might be the most important thing.</li>
            <li>I was able to epilate my underarms completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Maybe an epilator with attached massager would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Sure I can&#x27;t get 100% silky smooth legs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame if they haven&#x27;t since it was our favorite of 3 epilators and isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>fantastic thing is that this is not a cordless epilator, requiring it to be plugged in, using more power, for faster moving tweezers.</li>
            <li>One improvement I would make is the addition of a light since most room lighting is eye to ceiling level, not in the shadow areas of the body or below the shoulder level.</li>
            <li>When searching for it&#x27;s replacement I was happy to find this newer model but wondered if it was worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>After using this epilator my skin was smooth and most of the hair was removed.</li>
            <li>It does require many passes to get a area smooth.</li>
            <li>It works better after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li>It does a great job in getting the soft baby hair and the stubborn one too.</li>
            <li>This latest product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But the best thing about this model is, absolutely no pain.  </li>
            <li>So far, so great.</li>
            <li>Pfsh, after this many years of shaving (20+) I&#x27;m pretty handy with my safety razor and sometimes that just can&#x27;t be beat with a machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this to keep me smooth this summer.</li>
            <li>Kind of fun to use</li>
            <li>I used to have a cordless dry/wet Panasonic and a Braun Silk Epil - both good machines but none nearly as fast as this one.  </li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>which really bothered me for good reason.</li>
            <li>Good product and thanks again.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping,</li>
            <li>Works super fast, does a great job.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a good buy, and I liked the positive reviews this epilator had.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and with a bit of discomfort pain wise, it wasn&#x27;t getting much of the hair as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>Though epilators will never replace razors in terms of removing every hair right down to the skin, this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - better than a spa wax!  </li>
            <li>Partial Bikini Area - Removed quite a bit, maybe more then 60%!!!</li>
            <li>(many of which are after a significant period of use), i would say yes.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>even if that was my first time with an epilator :)! ).  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this epilator and it is really good!  </li>
            <li>This is the best epilator - and I&#x27;ve used two other brands over the years.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for bikini line and legs, if you are able to let it grow a little.  </li>
            <li>My best friend recommended this unit to me, we did the necessary research, and I think I got a killer deal buying exactly what I was looking for in a epilator product!</li>
            <li>I have used several generations of Epilady, then a Phillips and then a Braun, on which the light was a very good feature, but decided to try the Emjoi when the Braun died.</li>
            <li>It could not get easier, extremely easy to use....</li>
            <li>* Is it easy?</li>
            <li>easy as shaving with this one.    </li>
            <li>Is it easy to use?</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.    </li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for making the return so easy.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it out is easy; I just use the brush provided and sweep through it after each use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite easy...</li>
            <li>The device was easy to use and has two speeds.</li>
            <li>It was so easy , I just kept going and was finished with both, legs armpits in 30-to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy this one make your life easy.</li>
            <li>Even cleaning out this epilator is easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy ...</li>
            <li>then use powder so the epilator will glide easily over the skin...</li>
            <li>and the tweezers got all gooey for a while, but I was able to clean them with a Q-Tip and some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>i do wish i can clean the head of the emjoi a bit better.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it so much we bought two more for gifts.</li>
            <li>so I could easily see what I was doing</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really easy to use</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Broke after three years - The motor died and that was with infrequent use??</li>
            <li>for the pros: it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>easy 7 on the pain scale...</li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you clean it well afterwards.</li>
            <li>but there rest was easily nicked with a razor.</li>
            <li>I think it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this, although I wish the instructions on how to actually use were better explained.</li>
            <li>tweezer head make the job easy</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator, which also has the wireless option, works a lot better and appeared to be more powerful this this product .</li>
            <li>, it makes for an easy sitting session in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is also stated on the instruction manual, but it can be easy to miss.</li>
            <li>It easily grabbed and removed hair in areas that are often times touched, grabbed, etc.  </li>
            <li>machine itself is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can return it easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The brush that&#x27;s included makes cleaning the epilator easy.</li>
            <li>I have strong hair and wax</li>
            <li>Devil\\&quot; because it&#x27;s strong and fierce when it comes to hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Strong motor.</li>
            <li>However, this is not foolproof -- I thought that because it stops when it touches my skin, it could not burn me if I applied strong pressure repeatedly.</li>
            <li>and I loved it, fast &amp; smooth results.</li>
            <li>This particular one is a good value.</li>
            <li>and I thought the Emjoi corded version would be more powerful and more effective at taking the hair out on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife and she liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Worked great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the braun and only required 2 passes.    </li>
            <li>The item is easy to use and not painful, but you are better of shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, pulls out the hair from the roots and leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>in the bathroom, feeling more brave if not very numb, I begin again, my husband in audience for his own personal amusement.  </li>
            <li>This worked amazing on my armpits about thd first 7 times...smooth for about 5 days</li>
            <li>This is honestly the first epilator I&#x27;ve purchased or used.  </li>
            <li>Take a shower first -- warm up the skin....</li>
            <li>It honestly feels exactly like getting a tattoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it gets kind of hot?</li>
            <li>It is great when it is new and working, but the plastic gear will wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi for years now and this is hands down the best one!!  </li>
            <li>Emjoi is hands down the best ever.</li>
            <li>Hand down, it is one of the best investments I have made.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Emjoi Optima is still hands down the best for me.</li>
            <li>The 72 tweezers all work excellent and cut down on my epilating.  </li>
            <li>if you are on this page because you want to cut down on epilating time and get excellent results... this is the epilator for you!  </li>
            <li>I only have to shave about once a month right now and love it!!!</li>
            <li>Great with more sensitive regions of the body that require more gentle removal of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>so there i was shopping for a new epilator and this one had really good reviews.</li>
            <li>Shaving is fine with me.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not super impressed with this epilator (esp</li>
            <li>Not so easy to keep engaging however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am not super impressed with this.  </li>
            <li>fine hair on arms and stomach:  </li>
            <li>This is the second Emjoi epilator I have purchased (kids lost my first one) and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The eMagine is comfortable in the hand, glides easily across the skin, and has two power settings for fine or coarser hair.</li>
            <li>It works fine everywhere else, but my legs are another story....</li>
            <li>I have fine sparse hair and am used to this technique of removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Emjoi AP-18 is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>One for fine hair and one for course hair.    </li>
            <li>I have dark kind of course hair and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp really fine hairs as well</li>
            <li>It does not run on battery and therefore always has to be plugged in, but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only epilator I have purchased and it works great!</li>
            <li>I tried the Epilady many many years ago when i first came out and felt like my skin was being ripped off.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy at first, since this is an epilator with a cord, so I thought it should definitely last longer.</li>
            <li>Emjoi AP-18 is a fine piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li>it is baby fine and sparse.  </li>
            <li>It works fine on my darker bikini line.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a week, and that is perfect for me, especially when I would shave in the AM and at the first sign of goosebumps</li>
            <li>I bought this last summer and the first time i used it, it was awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine just running, but as soon as you apply any pressure, you can hear and feel it struggling.  </li>
            <li>the motor works fine, but the blade rotators don&#x27;t catch.  </li>
            <li>I rung up the fine folks at HS and they told me I had to have proof of purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now it is fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine tho, and the purple has cord, but is also can work cordless as well.</li>
            <li>This may be best for people with pretty coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this I thought it would tear me up but after watching many you tube videos I love it.</li>
            <li>It hurts to do my face, and leaves bumps, however legs and armpits are fine.</li>
            <li>: 72 tweezers have a better chance of a quick efficient process than 20 or 40, for a 72 tweezer-head epilator</li>
            <li>Once or twice a week a quick once over and done!  </li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>At seven months pregnant, this product is a life saver!</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy with is that it does not cashes fine hair as easy</li>
            <li>While the Emagine worked INCREDIBLY on the dark hair, I didn&#x27;t get quite as astonishing results on the light hair</li>
            <li>I was very enthusiastic about this product, at first I thought it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I must say though that the very first time you will use it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world.</li>
            <li>I bought mine for $78.90 plus i got free super saver shipping!</li>
            <li>This little tool is awesome.</li>
            <li>I did hear that you might want to let your hair grow out a little longer for best results.</li>
            <li>also make sure of you plan on using this in a area that has not been groomed in awhile, TRIM the hair first!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m real happy with this little gizmo.  </li>
            <li>To top it all off, it really HURTS too!!</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this epilator for those of you who are familiar with epilating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order it since it looks HUGE on the ad/listing.</li>
            <li>Being corded is a HUGE plus too.</li>
            <li>I have not had to shave my legs for 10 years using this product and my legs remain smooth, stubble free and hair free.</li>
            <li>I am (was) a huge fan of waxing.</li>
            <li>Since I keep it unplugged when not in use, I don&#x27;t find this a huge problem.</li>
            <li>Well as a woman with a huge side tattoo that hurt like the rays of a thousand suns, I&#x27;d choose a tattoo any day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, The Emjoi is a HUGE improvement over my Braun.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt that much and really did a great job.</li>
            <li>Therefore, just like with shaving, you have to deal with needing to re-epilate in a few days if you want that perfect smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap Emjoi one that I&#x27;ve had for a while</li>
            <li>Just the epilator itself and a cheap bag</li>
            <li>My area is smooth and has been completly hairless for 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is cheap in comparison and it takes me 45 minutes max to do my arms, legs, and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my Emjoi AP-18</li>
            <li>Hair free.</li>
            <li>does a fabulous job-</li>
            <li>I also used the epilator for my legs but didn&#x27;t like it because my legs didn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this for my underarms</li>
            <li>The epilator rapidly pulls out hairs by the root, leaving your legs, arms, or wherever you choose to use it, smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and store.  </li>
            <li>It took another two weeks for the hairs to get to the point where they could be shaven smooth agai .</li>
            <li>it was cheaper with free shipping vs paying sales tax for [...]</li>
            <li>Seeing the great and not-so-great reviews, I was having second thoughts after I placed my order for the Emagine epilator.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially fantastic for getting all those tiny chin hairs!</li>
            <li>I was brave enough to do my underarms.</li>
            <li>so I can get plenty light</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I purchased it AGAIN,thinking maybe I had just received a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is great not to need to shave daily.</li>
            <li>I am virtually hair free.</li>
            <li>However, after a ton of waxing, laser, and electrolysis treatments, it honestly doesn&#x27;t phase me much.</li>
            <li>How smooth are you afterwards?</li>
            <li>* Is it easy to clean? -</li>
            <li>It would be great if you could remove the guard as the guard prevents you from pulling the real short hair.  </li>
            <li>This got such great reviews</li>
            <li>Light Caress, Corded]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they won&#x27;t replace their cheap plastic gears with metal if they&#x27;re charging 90$ for this machine?</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT A SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
            <li>GIVE A SMOOTH SHAVE LIKE RAZOR.</li>
            <li>and my skin is smooth as silk now.</li>
            <li>not from catching the skin, just from the tweezers rotating over my skin without me applying much pressure at all</li>
            <li>I wish this epilator had a LED light like my Braun unit has.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great quality product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product and this is my 4th one in 10 years.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also recently started doing my underarms with it too which is awesome to finally see them look nice and practically hairless</li>
            <li>Arms, legs, underarms, bikini area, even my lower back and happy trail.</li>
            <li>and my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li>it in a smooth motion.</li>
            <li>So the lack of this feature in the Emojoi does not bother me, but might be important to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>No pressure, light pressure.  </li>
            <li>, it just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this epilator primarily to remove the hair fuzz on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was a Braun fan for years although I wasn&#x27;t happy with the second braun silk 7 (in/ out of water.)</li>
            <li>The size and position of tweezers allow for the hair never to break, leaving the skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>My under arms now feel extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I ended up at walgreen buying a $25 Remington smooth and silky</li>
            <li>I have tried a few epilators but this one is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving over the years almost never gave me the smooth legs I wanted.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t wait to have the smooth legs I had desired for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to my dismay, the results were not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely takes some practice, but at this point I am incredibly happy with how my legs feel and</li>
            <li>Exfoliating also helps to maintain smooth skin when there isn&#x27;t hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li>I even use this thing on my husband&#x27;s back (sometimes I find pleasure in torturing him, LOL)</li>
            <li>makes for easy clean up as well.&lt;br /&gt;*depending</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think I would, but I miss the light I had on the Silk Epil, which helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li>Otherwise, never get a totally smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>It efficiently does a detailed job on my legs.  </li>
            <li>They are mailing me a replacement tweezer free of charge.</li>
            <li>, I use it in my legs, underarm and facial hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get me as smooth as a razor</li>
            <li>I have been using epilators during the last 10 years of my life and I am happy with this one.</li>
            <li>and I was hair free for 2 almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Emjoy epilators are great they last and work well.</li>
            <li>I used to wax my  upper lip and that worked great</li>
            <li>Fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>will start with the cons: it lacks a light.</li>
            <li>Around $70 for something that had better be worth it.</li>
            <li>Why must everything be made so cheaply?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you smooth like shaving, but it creates an acceptable situation.  </li>
            <li>, I liked it so much</li>
            <li>One can have almost a smooth body appearance during the summer tanning and swimming season.  </li>
            <li>It is heavier and does not move smoothly on bony areas like the knees.</li>
            <li>Why they price this item at $100 is beyond me, it might be worth $45 at the most.</li>
            <li>Fast and effective hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Does it have all the bells and whistles available - no,</li>
            <li>The gears are made of cheap plastic and one of the teeth on the gear in the head piece broke.</li>
            <li>I think I still have to train myself not to expect the perfectly smooth results of shaving, though.</li>
            <li>so they upgraded me for free to the cordless one.</li>
            <li>Really cheaply made, get a braun instead.</li>
            <li>My legs stay smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li>Gets all the hair &amp; leaves area so smooth.</li>
            <li>With the dual head system I don&#x27;t think they could put a light on this model though.</li>
            <li>I found that a glass of wine before, then enjoy one during helps a ton with the pain.</li>
            <li>It is corded and more powerful.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My legs stay stubble free all week.</li>
            <li>The twizlers didnt move anymore,there was the sound</li>
            <li>If you are looking to be hair free for a season, or an occasion -</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I searched at malls for an Epilady replacement and learned they were no longer available at Brookstone etc.  </li>
            <li>Its amazing and fast but after about a year....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  have a light,  </li>
            <li>Takes some more time, but to me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I figured that epilating would be the way to go and would keep me hair free longer.  </li>
            <li>after reassuring my legs are still smooth, my girlfriend mentioned,</li>
            <li>The pain is almost incomparable.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I gave this epilator 4 stars, because it doees not have the light, the massaging head</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I gave this epilator 4 stars, because it doees not have the light, the massaging head</li>
            <li>but then I continued without stopping and it just felt like being lightly pinched.</li>
            <li>and my chest felt smooth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still that smooth.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliate, epilate, get an alcohol free toner (witch hazel), and moisturize with cocoa or Shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it not as smooth as it is described..</li>
            <li>I agree with all others that say when using an  epilator, exfoliating is important.</li>
            <li>Virtually pain free epilation.</li>
            <li>For one, they offered FREE one-day shipping</li>
            <li>and I was getting it totally smooth</li>
            <li>Does a great job and pain level is low!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it hurts my skin and leaves light scars on it.</li>
            <li>Works great on thicker hair, such as underarms.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, fast, affordable, clean, and effective.</li>
            <li>I get them primarily in the bikini area and they still seem to occur.  </li>
            <li>I used it 2 weeks before my wedding and still had smooth legs on my honeymoon.  </li>
            <li>But it definitely does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and I am hair free</li>
            <li>Your legs will never be as smooth as shaving with epilating.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I do recommend both the emjoi and the braun, as well as the Clean and Easy home waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>results are great, chin hairs are disappearing, upper lip....hurts, but eventually I get them off.  </li>
            <li>I figured since it was such a great product, I&#x27;d purchase the Emjoi</li>
            <li>Although I received free shipping when I purchased the device, I had to pay $10 to return it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the smooth factor!</li>
            <li>Those puffy plastic mesh things don&#x27;t work at all, too smooth.</li>
            <li>But I decided to try epilating them with the Braun and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Emjoi is fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Why is almost everything (including moving mechanical parts!) made from cheap plastic today?  </li>
            <li>I think all of the reviews saying this just broke the hairs off were primarily from females with thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>This was the firt time in my life that I got the smooth legs you see on women in shaving commercials.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean -</li>
            <li>I bought the emjoi optima at sharper image because I knew at the time is was the most powerful epilator I could buy.</li>
            <li>but your legs will be hair free for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>have used many different epilators and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>So overall I am really happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li>My body hair is so light in color</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my toes; yes, us blondes do get light colored hair on our feet.</li>
            <li>A convex design would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li>if I had done it more often &amp; regularly, I&#x27;m sure the hair would be much sparser.</li>
            <li>So far - so good.</li>
            <li>but it actually works best (in my opinion) to go somewhat fast in circular motions over the hair you want to get.</li>
            <li>So maybe this isn&#x27;t a good choice epi for natural blondies.</li>
            <li>The Emojoi is FAR superior.</li>
            <li>A plus, the opposed tweezer heads do a good job of getting more done in one swipe, and have a rubber element that tries to lift flatter hairs for better removal.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it has too many tweezers and it goes too fast, but it breaks hairs more often than it pulls them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, very reliable and lasting</li>
            <li>This one for sure is more gentle while removing the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see if I have any problems with ingrown hairs or not, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I actually found that to be quite nice and handy.</li>
            <li>It really does get most of the hair, and I haven&#x27;t noticed more ingrown hairs than I would get from waxing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the placement of the cord plug in, which is more towards the top rather than the end.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun Silk Epil for nearly 8 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, it&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li>I have two other corded Emjoi epilators, both of which I am happy with, and particularly satisfied with the Emjoi Divine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  recently biught the Braun and  love it!!</li>
            <li>A very powerful and sturdy machine that I can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li>so i just use the lower setting which is still very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and very fast.  </li>
            <li>but if you follow the MANY internet instructions on how and how often to use this, you&#x27;ll be just fine after the first week or so.</li>
            <li>These epilator is super easy to use, pain free</li>
            <li>If your desired result is for smooth finish this will be a significant flaw.</li>
            <li>I still love mine, but this is my first epilator, so there may be better on the market, this one does work though and for anybody who has never used one its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use and seems fairly powerful.</li>
            <li>but I really think that&#x27;s good because it has sooo much power!  </li>
            <li>I love being hair free longer than shaving, but like I said, if it&#x27;s your first time, just take your time.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the hair removal pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great, is easy to clean, and has a cute little storage bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already had a single tweezer autoplucker that worked splendidly</li>
            <li>(though in most areas it lasts a month or more because it is new growth, not cut razor stubble</li>
            <li>Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is comfortable in my hand, light, and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>its super easy to clean as well which i</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal since the original Epilady came out.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure as i use this more and more the hair will grow back a lot slower.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>but you remove more hairs per pass on the higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness</li>
            <li>OK, so this is my first epilator ever, that I have never used one or even held one in my hand before this one, so I cant compare.</li>
            <li>but over time..it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>Today, I was even able to use it on stray hairs under my chin (thanks, birth control pills!)</li>
            <li>I stuck with this brand because I was satisfied the first time.  </li>
            <li>I wish it worked better on the first try though.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have used Epilady, Braun and now the Emjoi Emagine and for the first time in three years I love the fact that I epilate my legs over shaving.  </li>
            <li>If this only works on my underarms, I will be beyond thrilled with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Successful for upper lip, chin, underarm, bikini line, legs...</li>
            <li>But I was familiar with waxing and threading before I started epilating.</li>
            <li>I do make sure that I have a hot shower and exfoilate before I epilate.  </li>
            <li>and then will go around in circles (which is usually what works best).</li>
            <li>So worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I bought it for about $90, and it was well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun silk epil for many years, and although it worked well, I figured this newer Emjoi epilator with more tweezers would work even better.</li>
            <li>Originally 5/5 stars, now 1/5**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is my original review from June 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this is that it absolutely gets the hair by the roots!</li>
            <li>I was excited to skip shaving for a couple weeks, vs having to shave every day.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, this gets better.</li>
            <li>and I love love love only having to epilate once a week or so.</li>
            <li>I was excited, though nervous, to try the Emjoi Emagine (AP-18</li>
            <li>All worth it!</li>
            <li>It is entirely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had one of the original &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; epilators from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I heard about emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Despite that, I was so excited and used it minutes after it arrived</li>
            <li>The best part about this one is it never pulls your skin like my past ones have.  </li>
            <li>It was OK for the first 6 months</li>
            <li>I would return it except that I do not have the original packaging  &amp; receipt.  </li>
            <li>Wanted this as a backup until my original one dies.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator and it is ok.  </li>
            <li>Even the bikini area was pretty okay.</li>
            <li>At first it does hurt but after continuous use it get a lot better.</li>
            <li>The original words well...</li>
            <li>I bought this item a long couple of years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li>and I am really excited to have it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I originally started epilating.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit and it works great because it has double tweezer heads, but its only good for the legs.</li>
            <li>Worth not having to shave for a week or two!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the Emjoi!  </li>
            <li>I owned one of the first epiladys many years ago.</li>
            <li>Better than my first Emjoi epilator which lasted me 3 years.</li>
            <li>By the end, I was more relieved it was over than the birth of my first child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more notes about first use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this epilator, I was able to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my legs completely in about thirty minutes while sitting in a comfortable, safe chair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not always the one who thinks the more you spend the better is the quality.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>My review compares this product to the original Epilady coil epilator (made in Israel) and to the Braun Silk-Epil model</li>
            <li>This device is the best for getting into nooks and crannies and works well in the underarm area, because its head is fairly small and its a bit curved.</li>
            <li>Does pull out fine hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts the first time because you&#x27;re pulling so many hairs at one time, but it&#x27;s bearable.  </li>
            <li>i was excited.</li>
            <li>Glad I waited for the 72 tweezer head, as both legs were done in 20 minutes first time around.  </li>
            <li>I have heard good things about Emjoi and saw this beast of an epilator that had pretty decent reviews.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super happy with it, so I decided to try another brand, especially after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Now, I must say that I had to wait a little longer than anticipated for the delivery, but in the end it was worth it, so I could experiment the tool on &amp;#34;overdue&amp;#34; hair, and I was extremely happy!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and the cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li>I am a newbie using an epilator and this is my first time and first epilator and let me tell you it hurts like HELL!!!</li>
            <li>After using and loving a Braun Silk-epil epilator for over a year I thought it might be time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect keeping a current customer happy is more important than trying to make new ones to disappoint.     </li>
            <li>so need clean legs</li>
            <li>I have found that corded ones are better because they last longer than the rechargable kind.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Emjoi epilators for the last 15 years, but this one by far is the best one yet!  </li>
            <li>Previously I owned Brown (which was good , too but not as quick and effective as Emjoi).  </li>
            <li>Also, remember to clean out the hair that was pulled or else</li>
            <li>But one it is removed, you skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>or maybe I wasn&#x27;t keeping them clean</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it since it&#x27;s handy to have something at home for touch ups and between waxing sessions</li>
            <li>I had a Gently Gold foe over 10 years that could catch the tiniest hairs til it finally refused to charge where as this couldn&#x27;t even catch ideal hair length according to its manual on my legs.</li>
            <li>But I found the best way to clean the epilator, was to use an old toothbrush to actually scrub out any build up in there.</li>
            <li>The blade housing can be removed from the unit, and I clean it with keyboard air-based cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Well built unit,.. powerful motor easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have been using several kinds of epilators and this one is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>i use a q-tip with alcohol or witch hazel to clean the tweezer heads.</li>
            <li>a shower bath or whatever you use to keep your self clean.</li>
            <li>After many years (I am 29 years old &#x3D;)) of shaving</li>
            <li>though there are more tweezers than my old Braun, I feel that I have to pass over the area more times.</li>
            <li>smooth and quick</li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean because of the sealed head.  </li>
            <li>The AP-18 is so fast and does a great job, even on the sensitive bikini line.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Emjoi and the best one so far.</li>
            <li>So what is the point of going over and over for many times and spend much time trying to get a smooth skin even if epilator would still miss A LOT of hairs?</li>
            <li>Then within about 3 months, the rotating blades would periodically seize up and jam, even though there was nothing caught in them and I would clean it after every use.  </li>
            <li>and I really thought I&#x27;d miss the light that&#x27;s found on many others, but these are both non-issues.</li>
            <li>My old one only had 20 tweezers, so this one was a awesome upgrade.</li>
            <li>it cut up my skin, leaving me all red and marked up for days afterwards and wasn&#x27;t even effective!!!</li>
            <li>Legs look smooth but do not feel as smooth as a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>Had to use a tweezer afterward to clean up.</li>
            <li>This Epilator has more power and a more efficient tweezer action than any Epilator I have owned before.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Does not impress me with ability to grab more hair, but does work better on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, it works pretty good at removing the hair, needs to be used only once or twice a week,</li>
            <li>I read quite a few reviews before deciding on this epilator, and for once in my life, I made the best choice right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and is fast .  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and whips the hair right off.</li>
            <li>I used the higher speed right away even though my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I get better results from this thing on my bikini line, than on any other part of my body.</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic before, and I liked it a lot , but I love that this one can be used while its plugged in  and I love the 72 tweezers it gets my legs done in half the time.</li>
            <li>The light on the Braun is very handy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Emjoi for the first time last night, and let me tell you, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you do have to go over certain areas more than once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that with time and more experience using the Emjoi, I&#x27;ll become a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; at hair removal.</li>
            <li>Certainly, I would expect better for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say that I love it -- on certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li>Does any on know of a special way to epilate under the arms?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to get it all right away!</li>
            <li>If I could change the purchase of the Emjoi, it would be to get one with a light on it which REALLY makes a difference !!</li>
            <li>I was excited by the speed of this epilator but quickly realized it was breaking a majority of my hairs rather than removinging them from the root.</li>
            <li>just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.    </li>
            <li>MY LEGS ARE NOW AS SMOOTH AS A BABIES BOTTOM HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)</li>
            <li>Sometime after my last update in 2013 the tweezers head on the first Emjoi started catching, i.e. stopped turning, at first it was every once in a while, then more often, until I just couldn&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
            <li>At first, my shins never felt fully smooth after epilating, but now that the hair is thinning out, they&#x27;re finally smooth.</li>
            <li>the first time was great and got all of the hair,  however a week later itI had stubble used it again.</li>
            <li>Is as expected a great product for legs</li>
            <li>I am bright red under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend exfoliating your skin regularly and using a good lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>as soon as I developed a nice rhythm with it, it took no time at all and my legs were immaculate.</li>
            <li>Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting.</li>
            <li>+ it is not painful at all, I didn&#x27;t feel anything even at that parts where I never used an epilator before  </li>
            <li>In my case, I got good results only on my underarms.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun one before, but this one is much quicker and removes much more hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon:)</li>
            <li>If I say I did lower legs, arms (that I rarely do  since hair light) and underarms,(usually shave)</li>
            <li>The Brauns are only good for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>My last one was a braun and that one was good but there was still a bit of pain involved when using it.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely fast, not that noise as many others and does the work.</li>
            <li>I tweezer out some of the leftovers myself if they aren&#x27;t too many or if they are bothering me too much.    </li>
            <li>Because of that, it&#x27;s not painful at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a LOUD, but effective workhorse.</li>
            <li>And thanks to this product, my legs are now scab and itch free for 2 months!  </li>
            <li>It is not extremely painful but for the results that it gives, there should be no pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Final results good but not like the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I am confident I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer with this thing.   </li>
            <li>This is definitely a good investment if you want lasting results that you can do yourself at home.</li>
            <li>most of all FAST.</li>
            <li>I say this OK because it is fast</li>
            <li>I bought this as an upgrade for my current epilator, but it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li>It felt weighty in my hand and it looked sleek and cool, but I knew I would never use it again</li>
            <li>Sure, that&#x27;s what helps this be painless for me, but it is a much gentler epilator than others.  </li>
            <li>I find it much more comfortable and does a better job on really short hairs.</li>
            <li>Some areas it doesn&#x27;t hurt, others it REALLY hurts, but mostly its tolerable.</li>
            <li>only good thing I found is that using the Emagine is relatively painless, which would be good for beginners.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much faster it is and how much more hair it removes.</li>
            <li>The last Braun was good for 8 months before it started to act up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful but you can feel it.</li>
            <li>I really hope this review helps you. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>works better and twice as fast.</li>
            <li>(although, it&#x27;s much thinner and more sparse</li>
            <li>It was able to keep my legs smooth in a way that the Emjoi had not, feels more solidly built, plus it has a two-year warranty.</li>
            <li>It works good, but it does truly miss a lot of hairs, big hairs.</li>
            <li>I love this so much I told my mom and sister about it.</li>
            <li>This works really quickly, so it&#x27;s not nearly as painful as the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>Was Really hesitant about buying but love it.</li>
            <li>This is a better product with a wider surface area that really grips the hair.</li>
            <li>And it did not even hurt that much :) I would always recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had my last Emjol for over 20 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It still works, but this Emjol is much faster and better.</li>
            <li>The overall performance of this product is good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>So I continued torturing myself and managed to make a full circuit around the bottom part of my leg.  </li>
            <li>It is not painful at all for me, however I do not have an abundance of hair.</li>
            <li>She warned me it hurts, a lot, but told me I should start to shave in the least, and at best to get one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this in May, and LOVED it, until I took it with me to Australia, plugged it in to the proper converter</li>
            <li>I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works).</li>
            <li>I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works).</li>
            <li>my old Braun Epilady lasted over 8 years (and still works, just too slowly to be effective).  </li>
            <li>but I stay on top of my bikini like because I absolutely cannot tolerate stubble there.</li>
            <li>I give it my full endorsement.</li>
            <li>And I have to question the real source of so many glwoing reviews for the product on this site.</li>
            <li>I think for speed, this is an okay epilator, but it doesn&#x27;t work that much faster</li>
            <li>I like the Gently Gold better.</li>
            <li>and I never have to have legs full of hair.  </li>
            <li>I found it works well and is not painful which I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li>I love this item, it makes my hair removal so much easier and faster</li>
            <li>They worked very well and they seemed to remove more hair in one pass than the newer designs.</li>
            <li>And after using it for a month I&#x27;ve already saved what I would have paid to get a full leg and bikini wax.</li>
            <li>This product is really fast, which I love about it.</li>
            <li>This epilator is not as good as my former one.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been through a full 6 weeks growth cycle yet...</li>
            <li>I use it on my underarms, legs, and my bikini area, full Brazilian.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s soooooo much quicker than shaving and it leaves my body feeling as smooth as silk!</li>
            <li>The product itself is not bad</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li>&#x27;s what so amazing, though: the heads on this Emjoi seem to run much faster than my Braun, and because of this, I experienced a LOT less pain!  </li>
            <li>I must say the Emagine is so much faster and more efficient than my loyal Gold Caress...</li>
            <li>Maybe I felt less discomfort with the warm water, but honestly speaking, it takes 20 minutes to epilate my legs</li>
            <li>The Emjoi AP-18 is pricier than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very user friendly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>As with most epilators, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs on my legs (they are fine and blonde), but definitely enough to keep me happy.</li>
            <li>As a frame of reference, I epilate my legs, arms and am pretty adventurous with the bikini line (I use it for a Brazilian - which is why I own 3 epilators, one is for my nether region only, and I clean it with alcohol after each use.</li>
            <li>This is actually a very effective efficient epilator however it breaks consistently after about a year of regular use.  </li>
            <li>The motor makes the right sound, but the tweezers don&#x27;t spin at all.  </li>
            <li>right before it changes sound.</li>
            <li>My legs would be smooth right after although it took HOURS to get them that way.  </li>
            <li>Just hold it to your skin close but not pushing and its pretty easy to follow the directions and all so just hold it to where the button is closest to your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator after much research and review-reading, hoping that it would be the perfect replacement for my older epilator (used regularly for 3 years)</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend reading up on tips and tricks of epilator use before using this for the first time...</li>
            <li>the legs very smooth if you make sure to go back and get those spots you missed at first&lt;br /&gt;*Even</li>
            <li>Also, epilating will not leave you as smooth as shaving, but it is pretty darn great because you will only have to do it once a month (after the first 4 weeks which you should do it once a</li>
            <li>excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, fine hair &amp; have been using epilators for many years.  </li>
            <li>The instructions tell you not to use it on your face - but if you use the side blade and are very gentle it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it works great other than that.</li>
            <li>This works great on legs and other areas.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with the final results, of course the first time takes some time but it is worth.</li>
            <li>At first, I was very happy with it because it was very fast and powerful comparing to other epilators I had before.</li>
            <li>Sounds to me like it is less than comfortable to use but better than others of its kind.</li>
            <li>so I was lucky.</li>
            <li>works great and much faster than smaller models</li>
            <li>But, even though the epilator took out many hairs by the roots on my legs, it broke off just as many, which left stubble.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>; (after shaving, more hair will grow at the same stage which will look like more hair).</li>
            <li>&quot; I keep telling myself that six weeks&#x27; worth of smooth legs is worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My epilator arrived quickly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>and I probably would have had to put in time later to go back over any areas that weren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>That would improve it tremendously.</li>
            <li>I purchased this epilator to replace an older Emjoi one that didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers.</li>
            <li>epilator gets the job done quickly and</li>
            <li>yea, don&#x27;t be too intimidated by how quickly the tweezers rotate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many before and after having read the many reviews I finally bought it</li>
            <li>This particular model does an okay job, but it&#x27;s noisier than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Also it was super noisy.  </li>
            <li>My leg hair is pretty fine, I think I will just use it quickly every couple of days,</li>
            <li>Wow it worked great and was the pulling wasn&#x27;t near what I was worried it would be.  </li>
            <li>It does work but seems to take many, many passes before all of the hair is removed and even then I am left with strays.</li>
            <li>I chose this to replace my old Braun because it had lots of good reviews, but I didn&#x27;t really believe the claims of one pass does the trick.</li>
            <li>I do not have hair on my legs, arms or under arms, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do have patches of hair that grow under my chin (over my top lip, around the lower sides of my mouth, and on my chin).</li>
            <li>Worked great on the bikini region, but I could only take so much discomfort on my legs.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quick</li>
            <li>awesome thing is that the Dual Opposed Head pick up the hairs from all directions of growth, instead of having to go over the same spot multiple times causing</li>
            <li>but I just want the job of hair removal done quickly and done well.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more hair I have and the darker and coarser</li>
            <li>I have only had the Emjoi Emagine for about three weeks, and already I love it so much better.  </li>
            <li>Luckily she didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s more comfortable even than my old single-tweezer head device.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t think twice ,just get it , if you want to do it yourself and quickly.</li>
            <li>This brand tends to only last a year before the motor gives out, but they are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It does not cause pain, a bit of a tightness and maybe a quick twinge, nothing earthshaking.  </li>
            <li>You CANNOT go quickly with this</li>
            <li>you get ingrowns try Tend Skin or some medicated cream from Bikini Zone, they will help tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and covers all the areas.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I was super psyched when I received it and waited until after I showered and exfoliated to try it out.  </li>
            <li>the product wasn&#x27;t Good , so Bad Product Good Seller!!!</li>
            <li>I also try and do a quick loofah every time I am in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The epilators get many more of the tiny hairs than waxing does and fewer of them break.)  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li>I used the Emjoi Emagine it plucked the hair off my chin quickly and there was pain.</li>
            <li>but my skin quickly became use to the sensation and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I even follow up with my old epilator to make sure my legs are smooth.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>The performance is adequate -</li>
            <li>Love it and would highly recommend over Brawn or Epilady.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel much discomfort, but I have fine hair like said before and exfoliate very often :)</li>
            <li>To keep it fair, I used my dominant hand (left) to hold the Emjoi and my right hand for the Philips.</li>
            <li>It does work pretty well as others have described, goes over your skin smoothly</li>
            <li>I had some different one, but this one really is the best I found so far.</li>
            <li>After using the first time I was amazed at how smooth my legs were.  </li>
            <li>I usually have stubble the day after shaving so being able to go 2 weeks after the first use was great.</li>
            <li>After carefully researching and comparing epilators, I bought this one because it seemed most ideal for my specific need.</li>
            <li>It does a good job with hands and legs, stomach, bikini line, underarms and even chin, leaving your body smooth and worry-free for at least a week or more, depending on your hair growth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product because of the longer intervals between hair removal..</li>
            <li>first two epilators I had were the Emjoi Light Caress 36 tweezer head model.  </li>
            <li>Expected it to be more efficient in retrieving hairs; I&#x27;ve never been able to get all of my hair and do have to use a razor afterwards for any remaining stray hair if I want to achieve that smooth, hairless look.</li>
            <li>and underarms the very first use.  </li>
            <li>Recently bought a much cheaper epilator made by philips and find it to be much more effective.</li>
            <li>I loved the concept although it took a long time</li>
            <li>It worked pertty good, but took way too long to use.</li>
            <li>As a long time user, I did not know it could be so good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the braun too, but it just took too long.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient.</li>
            <li>Speed level 2 almost makes hair removal a super fast and easy task.</li>
            <li>Recommend you use it in the bathroom with good light and a hard floor for easy clean up, because there is no receptacle to catch the tweezed hair.   </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this device - it works great and having the extra tweezing capacity gets the job done in less time.</li>
            <li>My underarm hairs are so light and sparse that I can pretty much get away without saving for a month or more (between living in AZ &amp; my hot flashes, I always were sleeveless blouses).</li>
            <li>i really need it completely smooth for special occasions.</li>
            <li>After that though, it is much more comfortable and the results really do last significantly longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li>When this one dies, we&#x27;re sure to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>the new one is even better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the new product</li>
            <li>GET BETTER AS I BUY NEW AND IMPROVED VERSIONS</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>, it got all the fine fair hairs that previous epilators always have missed.</li>
            <li>: fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>But the process of doing both legs could easily take 30 minutes, sometimes much longer.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how easy and fast it is.  </li>
            <li>Best to follow the instructions and do short areas rather than a long swoop.</li>
            <li>Powerful and quick.</li>
            <li>I liked the Emagine in particular because reviewers specified it was fast and powerful.</li>
            <li>I have used Epis for 12 years and this one is fast, easy and does not hurt.</li>
            <li>The dual rotating heads make the process fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Very loyal to this brand as it really does work.</li>
            <li>So fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It exfoliated my skin, but not in a good way ... and even so, it wasn&#x27;t able to remove the ingrown hair or maybe it caused ingrown hair, not sure which of the two</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, it will hurt but the more and more you use it the less it will hurt and the better the results.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product or not for it was not working very well for me.</li>
            <li>iTS GREAT.REMOVES HAIR FAST AND EASILY .THIS</li>
            <li>Really!!</li>
            <li>The gears started to chip away from consistent use!</li>
            <li>I wish I had Emjoi first!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I would guess that I hadn&#x27;t done anything to remove my arm hair in over 3 months, so there was a significant amount of hair.</li>
            <li>and I usually do not need to epilate more than twice a month.</li>
            <li>At first when I used this epilator on my leg it felt like my flesh was being ripped out!</li>
            <li>I just did my underarms for the first time and there is NO HAIR THERE!</li>
            <li>Now that I have been consistent and patient, I have no doubts!</li>
            <li>I usually only need to use the Epilator every week or 2 - much better than when I was shaving every day or 2!</li>
            <li>I considered the fact that fingers are sensitive and that plucking the 1/2 inch hairs from them first really wasn&#x27;t a good way to judge the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li>Favorite purchase from Amazon so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this epilator for 4 years now, and it has not failed me yet!</li>
            <li>And, over time, the hair gets more and more fine and less of it.  </li>
            <li>I forgot I ever grew armpit hair in the first place!</li>
            <li>Even for first time ever use!</li>
            <li>The first was the original one</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>- I had both corded and rechargeable coil Epiladies (original and &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I purchased the original epilator that first came out at Hudsons.  </li>
            <li>First time epilator!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how I am so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>In fact so fast on an area with light amount of hair that I thought it wasn&#x27;t working when the sting of the removal stopped so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I only liked that it worked quickly</li>
            <li>Have had 4 or 5 previous models and this is by far  the Best</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair out quickly and keeps my legs smooth for much longer.</li>
            <li>My course hair was removed very thoroughly and my legs were super smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, and does a good job with minimal number of passes.</li>
            <li>Love that my legs came out super soft but</li>
            <li>I watch a quick demo video on you tube and start with my right leg.</li>
            <li>I works perfectly fine and it is really fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using emjoi epilators for years and have never had any complaints I thought I would try this newer model due to the good reviews, however I think I should have stuck with the tried and true.</li>
            <li>Sure, it might not catch fine hairs, which a razor can catch and &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; things out; however, it will get the thick, noticible hairs and a good amount of fine ones if the skin is properly exfoliated, and the product will continue to get the fine hairs if the head is cleaned as the instructions say.</li>
            <li>very nice product I wish everyone can get for $30 less like myself.</li>
            <li>Also lay a towel or something to catch the hair because it tend to fly around a little when it is plucked out by the machine.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at getting those little hairs.  </li>
            <li>This little machine works great and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>The Emojoi AP-18 is an absolutely amazing spilator and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high end epilator - worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old epilator and thought the dual head was a smart choice, but for me it is too bulky to really be effective on  my bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product in hopes that I would be better able to cover large areas such as my legs and arms for longer hair removal; specifically for summer time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that no one (consumer companies/websites) has made an effort of comparing epilators by shaving one leg with one top brand &amp; the other with another top brand for easy comparison&#x27;s sake!  </li>
            <li>Also important that you trim hair to a reasonable length to allow the tweezers to grab closer to skin.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to say that this is an amazing product and that it works and that yes, it has cons like the pain, but, it pays for itself in like 1-2 uses compared to paying for waxing, it hurts about the same as waxing</li>
            <li>Legs smooth for so much longer than with shaving,like 2 weeks longer.</li>
            <li>, you know there is nothing gentle or comfortable about ripping your hair out at the root.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it should do, and often times the area stays hair free for longer than it would shaving, but some areas it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say my legs are silky smooth just yet but much much improvement.</li>
            <li>If you really want smooth legs, and you could afford it, I would suggest buying botht he emjoi and the braun.  </li>
            <li>I always epilate after I shower so that my skin is free of all lotion and deodorant, so I can&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>All in all, I honestly think it&#x27;s easier and quicker to go back to shaving.</li>
            <li>It is solid and the two tweezers epilation roles effectively.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if this realization transpires on AMAZON and potential customers in the EU be informed when buying it.</li>
            <li>Just accept that it&#x27;s a one-time deal IF you keep up with it, and that the results will be TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I love this product even though it doesn&#x27;t completely pull every hair out from the root.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll agree with some reviewers that say it&#x27;s almost too powerful.  </li>
            <li>IT was worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>is actually worth it.</li>
            <li>, I will spill my guts here, and you can decide for yourself if the pain is worth the end result.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Although I must warn those who are extremely sensitive to pinch-like pains, I absolutely love this epilator.</li>
            <li>make me hesitate to try more sensitive areas.    </li>
            <li>but I am not convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>All in all, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is truely worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>* Is it worth the money? -</li>
            <li>Sooooo worth not having to worry every morning about shaving.  </li>
            <li>but this version seems to have more power because of the direct power supply.  </li>
            <li>I had the pink emjoi epilator for a year and loved it.</li>
            <li>My trouble spots are my shins and armpits, but after 3 months of use, I honestly feel they&#x27;re getting better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter and much more comfortable to hold than my former epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about a year, I upgraded to an Emjoi Golden Caress (I think that&#x27;s what it was called) which could be plugged in or charged.</li>
            <li>Epilators also grab hair much closer to the skin level than wax can, so you can actually spend more of your time smooth!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had much success with this.</li>
            <li>and honestly I sometimes don&#x27;t even remember the last time I&#x27;ve used a shaver on my legs at all!</li>
            <li>and I hope that was useful to anyone.</li>
            <li>It sounds powerful and it looks powerful but in reality, it just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>And even so,if it did hurt the sacrifice is so worth it.</li>
            <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t effective enough to keep me motivated</li>
            <li>That alone makes this worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I rarely used my Braun in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, compared to the Braun, the Emojoi AP-18 wins.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money</li>
            <li>, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li>I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on my under arms and it does hurt but the end result was worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides my skin, my conscious feels better, too.  </li>
            <li>It helps to have a distraction ... put on a good TV show or the news, haha and DON&#x27;T try to cover big sweeping areas of skin....</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful.</li>
            <li>it hurts but it is so worth it</li>
            <li>its to early for me to note if my pubic hair has gotten finer, i would need atleast 5 more months to notice.</li>
            <li>and the motor seems so powerful it ........</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>5 stars for the two speed options, the cute travel bag, the crazy amount of tweezerheads, and the wicked awesome results.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this purchase as it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It does hurt, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>the more often I do this and that the bumps were just a result of my sensitive skin not being used to be</li>
            <li>I used this just one time so far but am already in love with it.</li>
            <li>My old epilator used to take an hour or more.</li>
            <li>Does not remove hair as good as I expected it too.  </li>
            <li>It is not painful, although it felt tingly at first to me.  </li>
            <li>I own several Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>I am not afraid to wear skirts or capris anytime of the season now.</li>
            <li>I was using my old epilator, it hurt much more than this one.</li>
            <li>It just wasnt worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The Braun is still running but had lost the necessary speed to effectively pluck and do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>- It doesn&#x27;t result in razor burn at all, and it is nice (especially during the summer) not to worry about hair removal for a week at a time.</li>
            <li>and I love it...but don&#x27;t try it on sensitive areas without using numbing cream.</li>
            <li>Yes, this removes more hair, but it lacks a light which is a necessary element.  </li>
            <li>I prefer using the slower speed as it seems to pull the hair from the root where the faster speed seems to break a lot of the hairs off at the surface, meaning a faster regrowth and more frequent usage.</li>
            <li>I love my old Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it though.</li>
            <li>It was not painful at all around nipples (I was very worried that area would hurt a lot!</li>
            <li>But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>They were correct, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It works like its suposed to and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It cuts close enough to get rid of her stubbles, making her legs nice and feminine, like woman&#x27;s leg is suppose to be.</li>
            <li>but once it was done, the results were worth it.  </li>
            <li>I would like to know how can return or replace it to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the trick is to make sure that it makes the same sound while it is on your skin that it does when it is not on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It does have a powerful motor and with the two speeds there is plenty of power.</li>
            <li>Below is only based on my own experiences after a couple times epilating.</li>
            <li>and I am able to Epilate sensitive area&#x27;s like arm pits, bikini area, face.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it</li>
            <li>I had been using a smaller one for seven years now and really liked it</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this one, including many lying lechers who noted that it was relatively pain free, I decided it met both standards and ordered</li>
            <li>overall I liked it</li>
            <li>Alas I&#x27;m Very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The Braun (liked above)</li>
            <li>The Braun (liked above)</li>
            <li>I read about this one, and how much more power it had, because it was plugged directly in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>I rarely have to deal with my leg hair anymore</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the larger epilator.</li>
            <li>But if you can handle the sting, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and so far we are quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that the head is too big to use effectively anywhere</li>
            <li>But after years of use, I&#x27;m buying the same kind again.</li>
            <li>But here it was worth it.</li>
            <li>So this if fun.</li>
            <li>but so worth it</li>
            <li>That is a blessing because I am so busy most of the time</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product with more tweezers doesn&#x27;t work as good as my older one that had less tweezers..</li>
            <li>This product is POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed this happens more frequently the longer</li>
            <li>Powerful unit,</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This HURTS but it&#x27;s worth using instead of shaving.</li>
            <li>the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the rotating tweezers don&#x27;t stick out far enough not be the most effective.</li>
            <li>If it lasts for two years, it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I found that some spots are way more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li>I liked the Caress, but this one is almost pain-free (assuming you are used to regular epilator pain).  </li>
            <li>So worth it for the self-esteem level increase alone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to miss much more hair than my old one as well, making me go over legs over and over.</li>
            <li>Because of these two things I wouldn&#x27;t say this epilator is worth the price if you don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li>I recently had to replace my Emjoi Optima (which I loved and ran many years before its motor finally wore out).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt much (just a pinching feeling), didn&#x27;t leave a rash, was Very Fast, and unbelievably Easy</li>
            <li>This works, but I feel like my hairs break off easily when used on high speed</li>
            <li>You could easily catch or tear your skin with high number of rotating tweezers.</li>
            <li>It does hurt when you first began but with more use its just a tickle but make sure to put lotion on after unless you don&#x27;t the issue of dry skin after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very powerful device, and I don&#x27;t know if a cordless device would have as much power as the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of Epilator for years and this one is greatly improved over prior versions and hopefully due to better head design it will not burn up  in 3 or 4 years as the others have.  </li>
            <li>Okay now...when I first saw this I was very surprised to come a crossed something like this and cut on cost of waxing for myself.</li>
            <li>It is a very smooth worker, specially when you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>My hirsutism is pretty mild</li>
            <li>I got used to the pulling sensation pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>But, it seemed to work pretty well...and quickly, I might add.</li>
            <li>I have owned most every generation of epilator that has hit the market in the past 25 - 30 years, and this is by far the best one, so far.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I had never used an epilator before, however, this product is easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my older emjoi of many years (which I was very found of).</li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised when I operated the new Emagine on all those area and the only feeling I had was that of a pleasant massage!</li>
            <li>for touch-ups (ie - wax under-arms or legs first in large swaths, then touch-up with epilator for smooth skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Tylenol</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Emjoi because the process really does take a lot of time</li>
            <li>Does not do as good of a job removing the hair as other models I have purchased</li>
            <li>This unit is good for the legs cause you can do them faster ,but not any other part.</li>
            <li>I had each leg done in about 4 minutes and it did just as good a job as the other</li>
            <li>If it had worked better than it did, I would consider just buying a replacement head instead of a whole new epilator, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with the performance of this one, and I am tired of replacing them every year or two,</li>
            <li>This is corded - makes sense because it does have good power on both low and high settings.  </li>
            <li>This epilator is great because it has so much power and can get the job done quickly, efficiently, and with little to no pain.  </li>
            <li>I give the item a very high rating, but not at the very top, maybe a 9 out of a possible 10.</li>
            <li>right out of the  box</li>
            <li>Just showered right after used a quality exfoliating skin soap which I think minimized the redness.</li>
            <li>BUY IT RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li>I ended up finishing off my right arm with the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Emjoi Emagine misses a lot of hair, and when it doesn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t always get it right, breaking the hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li>and I refuse to buy another epilator right now after dishing out a $100 on this one.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I end up shaving right after using it to get the rest of the hairs.</li>
            <li>and it works just right.</li>
            <li>And I was right:</li>
            <li>I wish I could say I choose the right one, but I did not.</li>
            <li>Used it right away</li>
            <li>and it is not fully water proof which the Braun is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Right after my shower, I tried it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know why, but i can&#x27;t angle this thing right so that both sides of the tweezers touch my skin.</li>
            <li>I got this and used it right away, but the pain made it to the point where it took about 3 days to get all the hair out of my legs.</li>
            <li>just right and the direction of the epilator</li>
            <li>right still hurts</li>
            <li>I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>as well right?</li>
            <li>It is substantially faster to do my full legs in comparison to my old Philips which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The Braun worked great at first but after a few months the battery would die in about 15-20 minutes - which did not work if it took an hour to do my legs.</li>
            <li>The normal cap worked just fine for my legs and armpits, though I never used the epilator on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it has been stated , it does hurt when you first use it but with frequent use , it gets better after time.  </li>
            <li>In america they are not as popular, but the rest of the world uses these all the time, its unique and does what it needs to over any other product.</li>
            <li>It also gave me a chance to gather my necessary items to accompany my epilating adventure: witch hazel, cocoa butter with aloe, and a nice salt scrub (you can make this pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a good 24-48 hours before my pits felt back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It is loud, and when I first touched it to my skin it felt like getting zapped like static electricity.</li>
            <li>I am sure they could cut down 10 cents on the profits and put in a more durable gear.</li>
            <li>My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who likes silky smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>but most definitely doesn&#x27;t clean up everything the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST epilator for those who have thick, coarse hair that needs to be removed quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live near a waxing salon and could not upkeep as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Gets less painless as you use it more and more.  </li>
            <li>She says it works great, but I didn&#x27;t really push the subject.</li>
            <li>sure all areas were dry and free of lotions, creams, powders, etc</li>
            <li>The on/off/ slider is easy to intuit, and really, its much like shaving from there, except that you&#x27;re supposed to pull your skin taut as you go.</li>
            <li>I drank two mikes hard lemonades first and got a good buzz going and went to town on my legs!</li>
            <li>My hair grows VERY quickly and so if I want to keep things fairly hairless, I need to do it at least once a week.</li>
            <li>I have used a cheaper epilator for the past two years and I have only been able to epliate the bottom of my legs, but this new one is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li>I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.    </li>
            <li>I have been epilating for many years (and I&#x27;m only 32 years old), and have gone thru many machines thru the years.</li>
            <li>It has been worth every penny as it gets just about everything on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>and i can shave with a razor or waxing quicker and come out with a lot better results without as much aggravation and unnecessary skin irritation like i experienced with this thing.</li>
            <li>Not really sure how great it works.</li>
            <li>Not really painful, just noticeable and unusual.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only once so far, and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as closely as traditional shaving does; however, the rewards of no next-day stubble are great!</li>
            <li>After the Emjoi broke, I purchased a slightly more expensive Philips Satin Perfect epilator, and I immediately noticed a marked difference in quality.</li>
            <li>It hurts at first, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>I epilate everything with the emjoi, legs, arms, tummy, mustache, underarms, and a pretty close (but not crazy) bikini line.  </li>
            <li>The thing that seemed to work best was light pressure, slow, short passes.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li>This one is advertised as 72 tweezer epilator and therefore, should quickly remove hair from a large area.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had bought a warranty with Square Trade and got a full refund, which I used to buy a new Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Of course there is some discomfort, especially to new areas, but</li>
            <li>But the more important issue is that it&#x27;s head is quite large, and flat.</li>
            <li>But the more important issue is that it&#x27;s head is quite large, and flat.</li>
            <li>I did that 6 hours ago, and I still have little red dots, I&#x27;ll see if there is a cream or something, but.. really great product!  </li>
            <li>I was able to do my legs in little more time than it takes to shave them.</li>
            <li>With this I was able to epliate my armpits and bikini area for the first time and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back for 3-4 weeks which is better than my old epilator</li>
            <li>This device was not very painful, and has not pinched my skin at all.</li>
            <li>it glows when it catches the sunlight; so my hair is fine but dense and grows very, very long (thus seeing a professional for so many years!).</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this Emjoi 72-Tweezer Head Epilator because I LOVE the Emjoi EpiSlim so much for my upper lip and underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to epilators, realize that you get what you pay for and don&#x27;t go cheap and then complain.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people familiar with this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to go over each area 3 or 4 times to make sure I got everything, which defeats the purpose of having multiple heads and a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>Still can&#x27;t believe how smooth and hair free it left me.    </li>
            <li>After seeing such great results on my legs, I decided to start epilating my upper lip and underarms.</li>
            <li>The upper lip is not bad pain-wise, definitely better than waxing (and better than the wrinkles that waxing ultimately causes), but the underarms were quite a doosie the first time.</li>
            <li>Hair removal is very quick and it did not hurt because I use the epilator quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>It has super fast rotation.</li>
            <li>The design is also easy to clean and simple to disassemble.</li>
            <li>Clean up also simple and easy.</li>
            <li>I never want permanent hair removal because it reduces skin firmness, but I do have neurological issues that cause muscle spasms and the only scars I get are keloids, so this device works great for me and the with the updated gear design in this device, I know its going to last for years to come.</li>
            <li>Honestly though, beauty is pain and when it costs only $73, and you can use AT HOME without getting ready to leave.</li>
            <li>However... the reason it hurts less is because this epilator doesn&#x27;t make good contact with your skin</li>
            <li>This is far superior compared to the emjoi portable with only 16 tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Very often, the Emjoi does not even pull hair out from the root, but just shaves it off somewhere near the top.</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair so quickly and make this process go so much faster.</li>
            <li>Good so far I only have&#x27;t for couple weeks</li>
            <li>This is quite powerful, most likely because it&#x27;s using a cord not batteries.  </li>
            <li>Not that it really matters to me but posting the accurate color would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>Overall I achieved  smooth underarms and arms, semi smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>I might start trying it on my legs in the future, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with a few passes under my arms after my morning shower and no longer feeling the scratches of razor stubble by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m getting tattoos I do yogic breathing and hum quietly and constantly to myself, like an OM for those of you who have been to yoga LOL.</li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and the plucking was easy.  </li>
            <li>The first 3 to 4 times of use it did irritate my skin for the first hour but was worth it.</li>
            <li>This is definately up do date, works quickly, and the motor is quieter so the whole house doesn&#x27;t know I am shaving.  </li>
            <li>So overall good product so far...</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more!</li>
            <li>I will keep searching for the right epilator to make my legs soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>for me, the tops of my thighs, the bottom (or underside) of the top of my calves (like right below the back of the knee), etc.</li>
            <li>and it is not fully water proof which the Braun is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.n the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light</li>
            <li>For some reason my right leg stung more than my left, no idea why.  </li>
            <li>, I followed the directions in the manual of how to take the device apart to clean it and that was fine, but in trying to put it back together, I accidentally put the silver ring that surrounds the tweezers on backwards and now it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>Aside from that I am not going to evaluate the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; issue, but one quick tip: every epilator will hurt more if you leave your hairs grow long.</li>
            <li>also love that the cord is super long</li>
            <li>you are shaving - very important especially under the arms &amp; crotch areas.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that the machine its self feels very light</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an epilator I&#x27;ve been using for several years and it has been missing more and more hairs as well as breaking many off at the skin instead of removing the root.</li>
            <li>I read a few reviews that said if the hair is short would hurt more, and seems thruth because i had longer hair on the top of my legs and hurt more.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shape to hold and point at various angles.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it really does take much longer to grow back than I would have expected which is a great side benefit!</li>
            <li>I DO VERY MUCH LIKE the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachemnt</li>
            <li>this one very much.  </li>
            <li>It removes hair very fast.</li>
            <li>A recommendation though, try your best to scrub your legs well before use.. and watch for new hairs growing shortly after use.. because its expected you may get a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>If you epilate regularly the hairs will be much finer and extract without much ado after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I am delighted with the Emjoi and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love it, i don&#x27;t have to shave every other day anymore, my skin feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing fine.</li>
            <li>The Emagine is able to remove hair much faster, more efficiently, and somehow with less pain.</li>
            <li>I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  </li>
            <li>I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  </li>
            <li>It did take a little adjusting to figure out a good angle.</li>
            <li>She likes the color and it works good, but she wishes it was a little wider.</li>
            <li>but after a little solder and tape its all good.</li>
            <li>When the product arrived at my house, I was excited to try out my new epilator.</li>
            <li>I think the pain is less because it so quickly and effectively pulls out the hair.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews that claim this product is quicker because of the two head action; this is the main reason I bought this item.</li>
            <li>It was not painful for me, but I have waxed and have a high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I was very much hoping the extra tweezers would make the hair removal process faster and more efficient, not the case.</li>
            <li>I have had great results in most areas of my body and only noticed major discomfort in the center of my chest and armpits.</li>
            <li>It was delivered to a different address on my street and Amazon insinuated some type of fraud which I feel was directed to me.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and and purchased this AP-18 epilator because it was rated number #1.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m willing to attempt to pull off the hairy look.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work great because it didn&#x27;t keep its charge long enough.  </li>
            <li>seeing how much it costs!).</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that i have used so</li>
            <li>was only be a top choice.</li>
            <li>I had about 2 days of hair growth on my legs when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this on my ummmm nether region/bikini area and again, it was a teeth clencher the first time around</li>
            <li>of warning: This will hurt the first time you do it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with this model</li>
            <li>First of all, if you follow the directions and move the machine in the direction of hair growth, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li>Second, after using Emagine&#x27;s two rows of tweezers on my thighs I can say they are more irritated than they&#x27;ve ever been with epilation.</li>
            <li>I will admit the first time I turned it on</li>
            <li>(This is my first ever epilator.)</li>
            <li>This epilator caught my eye as i first saw it on sale on [...].</li>
            <li>This area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>But then, it wasn&#x27;t removing a whole lot, either!  </li>
            <li>To first time</li>
            <li>Absolutely!  </li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I am pretty used to waxing legs and under arms.</li>
            <li>, follow the instructions about taking a hot bath or shower and exfoliating just before using the epilator.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;m a man</li>
            <li>The Braun silk-epil is so much better and actually grabs the hairs which it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I was actually able to use an epilator on my legs for the first time and I have coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This machine does exactly that.</li>
            <li>I took a hot shower before and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>The way this Emjoi is constructed, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, although only time will tell for sure.  </li>
            <li>This epilator does exactly as it states....</li>
            <li>The first one I bought died in about 11 months.</li>
            <li>glad there&#x27;s finally an epilator for us vets.</li>
            <li>I have used epilators since the first one on the market, Epilady, in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and my skin is just absolutely smooth and soft after.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes of hovering this thing over my leg and not being able to place it on my skin, I finally gathered up my courage.</li>
            <li>for the first minute or so.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all; it just scares you the first time.  </li>
            <li>Several reviewers remarked about making sure when bathing to scrub the shaved areas well to exfoliate &amp; I don&#x27;t always remember to do that.  </li>
            <li>Pretty soon it was jamming every 3-4 seconds while epilating</li>
            <li>I had bumps on my thighs after the first time , and after applying the witch hazel, they were gone in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It worked better than my last one.  </li>
            <li>I owned a Braun first, then a Panasonic, and then another Braun.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>It does take some time and at first hurts</li>
            <li>but with the epilator you can expect the consistent pain to take awhile.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator i&#x27;ve ever owned,</li>
            <li>It is far easier to see whether the you&#x27;ve been successful with  removing the hair with an epilator, and with this one, you do need to go over the same spot a few times sometimes, but mostly, it does a great job first time round.</li>
            <li>- Moderately, but quieter than many electric razors.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a seasoned epilator, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>First time epilator...</li>
            <li>you always feel the prickliness and the first epilating process...</li>
            <li>and I know it will only get better.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have ever used</li>
            <li>This epilator worked exactly like their website said it would.</li>
            <li>The first time - it hurt ALOT.  </li>
            <li>the first time i used it, it hurt like a @#$%</li>
            <li>I started with an inexpensive Braun model as my first epilator.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator</li>
            <li>and you will probably find you need more than one pass over areas, and then sometimes have to go over and over the same hair before it goes.  </li>
            <li>The factors I&#x27;m most concerned about are speed and efficiency, and in those respects it&#x27;s a big improvement over the panasonic one that it&#x27;s replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than some of the others, but handles armpits pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Ok about the same as others, but not cordless</li>
            <li>it does hurt first time using it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator though, so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring.</li>
            <li>it really works and well well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews and watched even more on Youtube.</li>
            <li>After the first month of use, I noticed the tweezers didn&#x27;t pick up the hair as well.</li>
            <li>Today was the day of discovery: I used my Emjoi AP-18 Emagine for the first time.</li>
            <li>far as pain goes, this is definitely the most comfortable epilator I have used.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than double what the Emagine cost me!</li>
            <li>word of advice, though: Don&#x27;t use an epilator for the first time if you have somewhere</li>
            <li>really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li>The dual heads work well, but the hair on any section of the body only grows mostly one way.  </li>
            <li>You cannot expect it to get them all on the first use.  </li>
            <li>being said, I would gladly pay an extra $5-10 dollars for Emjoi to get their act together and use quality materials for the gearing on the heads/body of this epilator.  </li>
            <li>First time is a killer.</li>
            <li>I did maybe the first week or 2 and haven&#x27;t needed to since.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s just more constant as you&#x27;re going on and on around and around rather than</li>
            <li>I have tried using it after a hot shower like suggested but still cannot handle the pain.  </li>
            <li>It pays for itself on the first 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s my first time</li>
            <li>It is painful,especially the first time.</li>
            <li>My current epiator works better even tho</li>
            <li>The first one burned out after 2 years, but we are hoping that was just a lemon</li>
            <li>Perhaps as far as epilators go it is a good product, but I still found it to be incredibly time consuming and painful</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time epilating, I would recommend \\&quot;tapping\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to be 100% thorough the first time.</li>
            <li>The first epilator I purchased was a Braun Silk-epil 7 for $120.00 vs $80 for the Emojoi brand.</li>
            <li>may be different from others, but my favorite thing about the Emojoi is that it is corded.</li>
            <li>, I waited for over 48 hours before trying it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Is it unbearable, even the first time?  </li>
            <li>I tried many different approaches - with the growth (as the guide says), against the growth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so</li>
            <li>My first thought upon using this was,</li>
            <li>(1-2 months after first use).</li>
            <li>This is the fifth epilator I tried since I first started using electrical epilators.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the epilator.</li>
            <li>First time epilator...</li>
            <li>I bought my first epilator two weeks</li>
            <li>So I figured one with more tweezers and the hair lifting bar would definitely do the trick</li>
            <li>Not only did I save some money but it works better that both of the emojis I bought.</li>
            <li>The Emjo Ap-18 is intimidating at first</li>
            <li>My first time ever in using a depilator</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>the Item i received does not work... pretty dissapointed when i had to have it mailed all the way over from US to Singapore, paying all the postage</li>
            <li>works much better and faster than my smaller cordless emjoi silken</li>
            <li>I tried a different type of hair remover machine (a top name) &amp; it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>This item works exactly as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>the area first....</li>
            <li>I love this thing &amp; I will never go back to shaving!  </li>
            <li>My arms &amp; bikini area always come out soft &amp; smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>My legs have thicker hair so it may not always come out silky smooth, but it gets rid of all the visible hair (which is all I&#x27;m worried about), but when I am worried about being smooth to the touch, I can always go over it with a razor and it will still last a whole week.</li>
            <li>I love that they can get the shortest of hairs, so I don&#x27;t have to grow my hair out to have it waxed, and that I can remove hair from my entire body without having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li>Epilating irritated my skin at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pleased overall</li>
            <li>This epilator removed the fine hair with less discomfort and more thoroughly than waxing; and without the redness, burning and dryness that follows the use of creams.</li>
            <li>My first epilator, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>- it gets the job done so much faster!</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is not my first</li>
            <li>However, for about the same price I truly believe you can get a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different methods and products.</li>
            <li>It is painless, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair even after several runs.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic and alarmed the first time I used the Emjoi AP-18 Epilator.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I learned to brace myself for the first 30 seconds on the first leg.  </li>
            <li>I used it several more times</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was slower, but it&#x27;s actually more efficient than my last one.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for my legs.</li>
            <li>are most likely not used to epilating.</li>
            <li>I regret ever picking up my first razor and shaving cream bottle.</li>
            <li>yes it was a bit stinging at first...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too wide for me to try and tidy up that porch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating since they first came out in the &#x27;80s  </li>
            <li>the first time-</li>
            <li>I have owned 5 Emjoi epilators over the last 15 years and this is the most flexible as it rolls over my knobby knees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now and they usually last me about 2 years.</li>
            <li>Its my first time using it,</li>
            <li>things first, I like the packaging that it comes in.</li>
            <li>I did exactly what the directions instructed that I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it seemed to break the hears more often than actually pulling them out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And since I didn&#x27;t have to wait for a charge, I was able to do my entire body all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first two were by Braun and I bought each of them in the $50-60 price range.  </li>
            <li>My first use of the Emjoi produced somewhat satisfactory results, but I still had to tweeze some hairs away.</li>
            <li>first epilator.</li>
            <li>Even in the first trial it stopped working.</li>
            <li>This leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>i m trying epilater  the first time.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever epilator.</li>
            <li>Using a corded epilator is better because there is no question of the battery charge lasting, and it is faster (as I&#x27;ve heard from friends that use battery powered ones).</li>
            <li>There is no way this would ever get all the hairs on my legs, no matter how many times I went over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>So now, I have to use it more often because parches of hair are growing at different times.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I noticed I had a lot of ingrown hairs at first after using this product</li>
            <li>and I had to use every couple of days at first.</li>
            <li>I had to send back the epilator as it did not perform any better than my 36 tweezer head.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love this product and it takes a very short time for me to epilate my legs!</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is higher quality, as you would expect with a much higher priced epilator.</li>
            <li>My first was the Braun 5270</li>
            <li>So, I knew to expect a much higher sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first saw this product review on You Tube</li>
            <li>Besides, anyone noticing that one missed hair has bigger issues to deal with :-).</li>
            <li>I just dropped and broke my first one, so I needed this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Any hair that returns after a wax is slower, and there aren&#x27;t so many hairs to pull at the same time.</li>
            <li>I guess the 72 heads help minimize the pain, although on the flip side, I find that the Emoji doesn&#x27;t get as many as the finer, smaller hairs that the Braun used to.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 18 months</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared for pain in the first use if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>It hurts a lot at first..</li>
            <li>Even the whole bikini area!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First time I used it I felt some sting but not now.</li>
            <li>Well at first anyways, I think my body turned off pain signals to prevent me from going into shock...</li>
            <li>First let me say, I don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li>It was such an improvement to waxing I ended up taking more than I started out to and taking it all off.     </li>
            <li>my first one I bought was in the 90s...</li>
            <li>At first we had to learn how to use an epilator -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 and that&#x27;s my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It works a lot better/faster than my old Braun, but I wish it had a light.</li>
            <li>I have been using this almost a year consistently, and am overall pleased with it..</li>
            <li>It is my first epilator to use and do not regret it.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>The first 3-4 weeks I was beginning to question my decision to not shave cause of the stinging pain and the time epilating took,</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>She uses it on her legs all the time and constantly says how much better using an epilator is than shaving.  </li>
            <li>My first still works after over 20 years.</li>
            <li>I love this for removing facial hair!  </li>
            <li>recommend this product to people who are trying out epilators for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun was my first epilator</li>
            <li>Does it work better enough for the price tag?</li>
            <li>but this is my First Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I had to go over several areas more than once.</li>
            <li>My first epilator was called an Epilady</li>
            <li>product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, rip the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>I read MANY reviews prior to ordering this epilator</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>Better than shaving, results last longer.</li>
            <li>I  have found much better results with exfoliating daily and using exfoliating gloves before</li>
            <li>Does in get every hair on the first pass?</li>
            <li>Again, you get used to it, and truthfully it really only hurts the first time because that is when you have the most hair.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say, this was my FIRST TIME using ANY EPILATOR, and this is my FIRST time Experience; I will Update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING ANY EPILATOR.</li>
            <li>First areas I used it on, felt \\&quot;Prickly\\</li>
            <li>I still have bumps &amp; some red pin marks where the skin was caught, more then the ForeArms.&lt;br /&gt;Lower Back/</li>
            <li>EXCEPT the closer you get to the more *fragile* Zones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets close enough to the skin to be able to pick up the hair without going over and over and over the area.</li>
            <li>and at first is a sea of red&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it sure beats shaving multiple times a week and worked well for my first epilator ever.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say this is the first epilator i have owned.</li>
            <li>but because i think i would prefer using an Epilator while i take a HOT bath.</li>
            <li>The flip side to this is buying the Braun SE7681 with the battery dying but being able to use while i take a HOT bath, so i plan to purchase the Braun SE7681 Only because i can use this while i take a bath.</li>
            <li>My first on was also an emjoi and</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>Now if ur starting out it&#x27;s going to hurt more</li>
            <li>tooooo funny.  </li>
            <li>AFTER THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>Let it lightly ride along your skin and let the tweezing action do all the work.</li>
            <li>so it comes in soft and light)</li>
            <li>It does not catch many hairs, and what hair it does catch it breaks above the surface of the skin rather than pulling it out at the root.  </li>
            <li>My old epilator had a light</li>
            <li>but you often need to go back and forth more than once</li>
            <li>So for now i will still shave my legs but at least i will have a great bikini line and underarms.</li>
            <li>Five hours later I have way more stubble than if I had shaved.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>well the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>i want one with a double head like this and more tweezers</li>
            <li>and i want one with the most tweezers on it like 40 tweezers or above</li>
            <li>It is even better than the former model.  </li>
            <li>I am a seasoned epilator, and thought I&#x27;d share my experience for those who are debating which epilator to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason I can&#x27;t stand the sensation on my armpits - IT REALLY HURTS!</li>
            <li>In addition, because of the lighting in the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light we all have so if you are there with your husband</li>
            <li>I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient when you first start using be star</li>
            <li>So I did some research and most of what I found suggested to shave and exfoliate the day before prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>but after the first month or so, there was no discomfort whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this epilator and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I did have quite a bit of irritation but I tryed benadryl spray and it cleared it up.</li>
            <li>and this was my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator (and</li>
            <li>I found worked pretty well:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as close as shaving, but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the last epilator.  </li>
            <li>They all are going to have you experience some pain when you first begin.  </li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;m deep rooted. :)</li>
            <li>of it, it still didn&#x27;t get the hair the first time around.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it five stars because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since I&#x27;m a first time user.  </li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi products and definitely prefers using tweezer head epilator to shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li>Your legs do get use to using emjoi if you use it consistently</li>
            <li>When I first used it -before</li>
            <li>After 12 months, the adaptor stopped consistently providing power to the unit and it would start and stop depending on the angle</li>
            <li>The jams became more and more frequent until it was perpetually jammed</li>
            <li>Hair grows back thinner and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>and I definitely had to go over spots more than once.</li>
            <li>First of it hurts like hell and it darkens my skin which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>After using this for so many years i actually have places where the hair is not growing anymore without doing laser treatments.  </li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>This is my first Epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a clock for a present and enjoyed it for quite a while.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They would spin when I first turned it on, but as soon as it came in contact with my skin/hair, they would freeze up.</li>
            <li>It felt exactly like someone was pulling hair from my legs one at a time.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does hurt the first time</li>
            <li>I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back to the Philips Epilator again.</li>
            <li>They worked pretty well (the first one I broke when it got too close to my towel and threads</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s powerful even when cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating using the emagine is fast and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You still have to go over the area more than once, but it does the job and such a time saver.</li>
            <li>Virtually no discomfort, easy to use and clean, and worth every penny I spent.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used an epilator it did hurt.</li>
            <li>and I tried it more than once and the pain feels the same.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth the investment for those who doesn&#x27;t really like to shave and/or wax.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>After reviewing several makes and models, this came out on top.</li>
            <li>but with this one, it is so fast that I thought it wasn&#x27;t getting the hair, but it was, it just didn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li>Well just came in and at first I thought it had cut me, well read then instructions again.</li>
            <li>I have used many different appliances.  </li>
            <li>My particular device caused mild scratches on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>If I let it go two weeks or more, then epilating becomes much more uncomfortable as you are pulling out so many hairs.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time using an epilator ever</li>
            <li>The epilator is not working as it did when I first received it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 7/2014: Recently, I have found that the epilator teeth lock up and make a loud sound when I have used it for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried using it again about 3 days later, and to my surprise I love it.</li>
            <li>Having used an epilator for many years, this is my 3rd or 4th one.  </li>
            <li>The first time I did my legs was probably the longest, maybe 30 minutes?  </li>
            <li>I love that it takes time to grow back like waxing, but I can just do touch ups once or twice a week</li>
            <li>I used to wax, this saves me so much money and no ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>First of all for some reason it takes forever to do your legs.</li>
            <li>As a woman from the Indian subcontinent, I have lots of coarse hair and hair removal is something I&#x27;ve lived with for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Too much pain!</li>
            <li>But I actually thought they worked better on longer hair than shorter hair.</li>
            <li>: it is fast!</li>
            <li>(mine are pretty boney and angular).  </li>
            <li>: it is fast!</li>
            <li>(mine are pretty boney and angular).  </li>
            <li>It definitely took some getting used to, and I had to make sure to have a razor bump gel handy for immediately afterwards, but that&#x27;s expected with something that is ripping hair out from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator because, after reading many reviews on the different products out there, it seemed to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was able to see where the hair was actually tweezed out.</li>
            <li>Do not go for perfection the first time as I did and scrapes and irritations will be avoided.  </li>
            <li>Even with that I was able to wear deodorant next day with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It does look it lot more intimating that is actually is.</li>
            <li>There are so many tweezers and it moves so fast that you can barely feel it pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li>As a first timer, the pain was bearable.</li>
            <li>It does take a minute the first time</li>
            <li>I will use it only because it has more tweezers and it removes the hair faster.</li>
            <li>The epilator is also made of a light weight plastic which really surprised me given the price.</li>
            <li>and I can say that though the difference is ignorable overall, but Braun worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;pros:</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased an epliator.  </li>
            <li>The directions say that you can use it on your face (by angling it so that only one disc is touching the area), but I haven&#x27;t tried that and will probably continue to just tweeze there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first use it: break hair and miss hair here and there.</li>
            <li>But it gets better the second time at removing the hair.</li>
            <li>It works, but you have to be willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li>I showered and used this for the first time yesterday for my arms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an epilator.</li>
            <li>I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this must-have gem!!</li>
            <li>any case, I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years (so it&#x27;s not like I just started) and it&#x27;s great, but not nearly as good as waxing (which I can usually get a good 2 weeks out of), but great for in between waxings and is much cheaper than waxing (if you go somewhere) and less of a hassle (if you wax at home, which I do).</li>
            <li>I am new to epilating but wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with the Philips&#x27; performance at grabbing the last 10% of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with my previous Emjoi when I used it while it was plugged in, but the difference between the two models is absolutely night and day!</li>
            <li>The pain on the rest of my leg was definitely less than what I had experienced with my old epilator, though I wouldn&#x27;t say there was none</li>
            <li>Design isn&#x27;t great unless you are super model thin...</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>Holy WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I had my eye on this epilator for weeks, finally made the purchase, and was very excited to get it in the mail.  </li>
            <li>What a pity, since so many other people had a good experience with it.</li>
            <li>In any case, Emjoy by far better than other epilators I had before and much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>the epilator at right angle to the area, hold the skin taut and move it gently in circular motion&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are mostly around uneven spots, like the knees and shinbone, and are usually pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>Even when my underarm skin was still delicate and in process of healing the Emagine did an excellent job, very quick and with much less discomfort than anticipated.</li>
            <li>But I noticed it had a tendency to snap off the hair rather than pulling it, and the epilator never was very good at getting all the little tiny hairs on my legs, leaving them stubbly.</li>
            <li>The box comes filled with everything from a brush to clean the device with to a full blown, down to the nitty-gritty manual.</li>
            <li>The pain is very minimal at first and now I honestly don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice safety feature that prevents you from pressing the heads down to hard upon your skin, which is a great added feature.</li>
            <li>, the extra heads do what you would expect, cover large areas more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I bought the corded type as I am certain it will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have a little  guiding light</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be getting to replace my old Braun that is on its way out.</li>
            <li>A tip for nubies to epilating, I first plucked the really stubborn hairs from my legs with regular tweezers around the ankles and the shin will be the most sensitive&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>Yes, the first hair ripping was a bit of a challenge, but I&#x27;d just do as much as I could stand and do more the next day.  </li>
            <li>I found that this model was not quite as effective as the other model I had, and it tends to break the hairs off rather than pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest for the first time not to go over the area too much and get it better on the next epilation time.  </li>
            <li>I have not had to do grooming of any kind in a week, so it is well worth the little bit of pain.</li>
            <li>My hair grows in very light and often times, I don&#x27;t realize how long it is until I sit in the sun a certain way because the hair growth is so soft and so light.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have a harder time grabbing fine hairs and doesnt do as good of a job of removing hairs after a single pass.</li>
            <li>, I felt stubble (Winter is hard on a chick!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from getting laser hair removal, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Prior to this I was a die hard fan of the Philips Satin Perfect epilator.</li>
            <li>I will also mention here that because your hair grows at different rates, the first time you clear your legs, whether it be with waxing or epilating, because all of the hairs have grown out, your legs will be much more smooth, and remain smooth for a longer period than subsequent epilations.  </li>
            <li>Even after years of doing it, I get bright red dots on the areas that I epilate and they usually last for 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Not only is it faster, but it&#x27;s also more effective and causes less pain and redness.  </li>
            <li>The pain I experienced on my upper lip was MINIMAL compared to threading.</li>
            <li>The item was received 2 or 3 days earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but so far, this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>As a waxing aficionado of having a professional set-up at home for 6 years I began to dread the once a month set-up and clean-</li>
            <li>Set realistic expectations, know that it will hurt, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>In addition it was almost completely painless, I think because the hairs were coming out cleanly instead of being tugged and missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also caused a lot of ingrown hairs and dry skin, though I&#x27;m sure I needed to exfoliate and moisturize more regularly.</li>
            <li>It also does a much better job on my armpits, but of course, you have to be sure your armpits are COMPLETELY dry (also necessary with the legs).  </li>
            <li>I also found it more quiet than my previous epilators which is nice</li>
            <li>This is a clean and not messy way to remove hair.</li>
            <li>The emjoi got the hard-to-see hair in a few minutes, where waxing could take 20 minutes or more, and I wouldn&#x27;t be 100% hair free.    </li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for approximately 18 years and this is by far the best ever.  </li>
            <li>So having brought this item as it has more heads than others I found it to be too big to really use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely cost effective and simple to use.</li>
            <li>go over my legs several times to be sure as much hair has been removed, and it takes 10 minutes tops to finish with both legs.</li>
            <li>I find the best technique is to go in slow, tiny circles in the direction</li>
            <li>I have a love hate relationship with this awesome gadget.</li>
            <li>The best thing&#x27;s how slowly the hair grew back.</li>
            <li>and you can upgrade to the Emjoi and be done much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A year later - I still love this.  </li>
            <li>This product is only good physically</li>
            <li>Over time, Emjoi is capable of permanently removing most, if not all, of the hair from the larger areas of the body, and that&#x27;s a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using depilatory for ten years and this one is light yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>I spend almost as much time as I did when I used to shave many moons ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;ve never epilated before it will likely hurt.  </li>
            <li>It went good until suddenly these red bumps started appearing.</li>
            <li>I noticed if i used it just after i take a shower when my pores are open works better and don&#x27;t pull too much.</li>
            <li>The price point is good as well because there are more expensive ones out there that can&#x27;t do what this can do.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair so for the most part, it did take most of the hair out...</li>
            <li>i am really happy of the product, i like it because it is fast and  doesn hurt comparing to the other one , i barely feels it</li>
            <li>This new model is very fast  and efficient!  </li>
            <li>So worth the price and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I had previously been using Braun&#x27;s SE 3170 silk epilator, and this was infinitely better!  </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and this product didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs on my top lip or arm.</li>
            <li>Such a clean alternative to waxing!</li>
            <li>Pain was practically non-existent(1), less than waxing that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>It is super LOUD!</li>
            <li>know a lot of people are more familiar with wax than they are with epilating, so let me compare them a little.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove a large area of unwanted body hair within a relatively short period of time, so the device is fairly fast as well.</li>
            <li>Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  </li>
            <li>Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  </li>
            <li>One positive...</li>
            <li>I decided to make the purchase because of a friend and all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased Emjoi AP-18, based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little brush that is easy to hold and easy to use on the epilator head.</li>
            <li>I have been using a single wheeled epilator for years and was happy with everything about it, except how long it took me to do my legs.</li>
            <li>The Emgaine also amazed me with the short hairs it was able to grab - it says that it will remove hairs as short as .5mm length, and that is absolutely accurate</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is advertised as being able to rip out 1 mm long hairs.  </li>
            <li>If you soak in a hot bath before you epilate, it&#x27;s much easier on your skin.</li>
            <li>At first I was intimidated by this product because I saw the tweezers rotate so fast</li>
            <li>This head is more enclosed; I can&#x27;t tell if hair is inside the head, and it&#x27;s not clear to me how well rinse water will evaporate, if at all.</li>
            <li>It also had a light which was very helpful for seeing those thin fair hairs.</li>
            <li>With the caveat that I&#x27;ve only had this epilator for a few days, so far I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as described, takes all the hair off where ever I have tried it without much discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and it takes more than twice as long.</li>
            <li>It may appear at a higher price point although consider how much time and $ you&#x27;re saving by doing it at home.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my lower legs every few days for almost a month and my last epilation was by far the best!</li>
            <li>it took me almost 45 minutes to pretty much give my self the hollywood.</li>
            <li>, it works pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The technology sure has come a long way.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi does exactly what it claims to do, which is unusual in this day and age.  </li>
            <li>I have used many Emjoi products for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it goes much easier after the first 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>However, this product is not wireless but seems to be more powerful than other emjoi</li>
            <li>It works extremely well and leaves the skin hair free and smooth, but I swear to God that I felt like punching my daughter in the face if she didn&#x27;t stop.  </li>
            <li>In 1998, I bought my first epilator, which was the Emjoi Gently Gold</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how this brand performs long term.</li>
            <li>I prepped my skin like the directions say and sat for hours the first time with my headphones in and watched a movie while I went over and over my leg without much to show for it.  </li>
            <li>and if there are many hairs you&#x27;re on for a LONG job</li>
            <li>Like you end up getting a lot of ingrown hair and you have to make sure the hair grows back enough before you can use it again to make your legs smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I removed hair was much slower to minimize the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I can wait a week or two between treatments vs shaving which I&#x27;d have to do pretty much every day</li>
            <li>Recently I purchased a cheap epilator at the drug store (in desperation, I must add, as it was the only one available!)</li>
            <li>I like the plug-in aspect, because it never loses power, and I like how powerful it is.  </li>
            <li>(It is normal to miss one or two that are super fine hairs or too short for epilation).</li>
            <li>Not bad but prefer my old Braur.</li>
            <li>So, don&#x27;t go full bore into a thicker area or sensitive area.</li>
            <li>especially now since im pregnant, with no energy to shave my legs, and being 7 months pregnant its</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the usage tips provided to care for your skin such as bathing in hot water and exfoliating with a lufa before epilating, the Emjoi AP-18 is quite accurate in removing most hairs.</li>
            <li>It sounds simple enough to hold it as instructed my Emjoi, but there is a technique to it, and you naturally get better the more you use it.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was gritting my teeth the first time I epilated my underarms.</li>
            <li>Other more sensitive areas will not be so pain free, But it&#x27;s the price of beauty.  </li>
            <li>The point tho is if you have any prior experience it is not bad at all!</li>
            <li>Dealing with a cord (which is conveniently very long) is way better than worrying about a dwindling battery life and a two hour charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after the first 5 minutes it was clear that her old epilator with almost died battery was much better than a new Emjoi.</li>
            <li>The next leg was very quick.</li>
            <li>I actually was replacing an older Emjoi - an upgrade - and am I glad I did, there is so much power -</li>
            <li>I just like it dry better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much painless to use everywhere, except the pubic area, which I think is because the hairs are so much thicker than everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the one from the first Emjoi anymore and my Square Trade warranty had expired, but I found another that fit at one of the big box stores.  </li>
            <li>Plus I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt; - after it gets warm, the epilator works even less</li>
            <li>Although I have to say that the pain is minimal, it is more the shock/surprise factor for first time use.</li>
            <li>It removed the hair quickly and completely without my having to go over a spot five or six times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, there are only 2 speed settings and an off switch.</li>
            <li>the daily upkeep is easy.</li>
            <li>if its too long it will hurt a whole lot more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;*Take</li>
            <li>hair from my arms was so easy to take off and hasn&#x27;t come back at all for over a week now!</li>
            <li>It does rotate pretty fast, and I can&#x27;t tell if it would actually pull out the fine hairs or just break them, but</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use baby powder to dry the area before using it and it seems to work better at grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient (I can do pretty much my whole body in 30 min)</li>
            <li>Overall I  am very satisfied I won&#x27;t go back to shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this one is because I wanted to do my job on my own and in less time.</li>
            <li>This epilator is not only reliable, it is easy to use and performs its job well.</li>
            <li>It started to make a loud clicking sound, and would intermittently stop running (it would run, click real loud, stop, click, run, click, etc).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems gripping it, but then I always have dry hands when I use it.</li>
            <li>Left me feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my arms super soft, however, so I keep using it (below the elbow of course).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not like getting a nice massage in a candle lit room, but it does what it advertises at much less pain than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Shaving under the arms is much easier than it seems it would be - again, make sure to keep the skin stretched.</li>
            <li>I love it because it has cut the time in 2/3rds of my old epilator, which was slow and had to make many, many passes over the same area to get all the hair.</li>
            <li>and i want an eplilator thats of good quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Seemed to do a good job.it felt like little pins ,but nothing you can&#x27;t live with .</li>
            <li>I do feel that the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t work the best on its high settings, i feel it skips over or breaks the hair</li>
            <li>the Philips&#x27; single row of tweezers felt more nimble going over bony areas.</li>
            <li>single works more persise.</li>
            <li>but when looking to do large areas the recharging is a pain.</li>
            <li>I bought the Emjoi hoping it would shorten the amount of time it takes to go over large areas like the legs.  </li>
            <li>The large head makes if diffucult to reach some areas.  </li>
            <li>- so be smart about where you use it.</li>
            <li>Large tweezer surface</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who needs to shave large areas of your body.</li>
            <li>but certainly is tolerable in some places.</li>
            <li>The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun.</li>
            <li>The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wait until the hair gets to a certain length like when IT used to wax.</li>
            <li>the head is so large that it does not reach some angles and curves.</li>
            <li>Completely defective from the very first use.</li>
            <li>Of course it hurts a bit at first use, as some reviewers have mentioned, but tweezing hair will most likely hurt,especially in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>it is so nice to not have to mess with wax anymore.</li>
            <li>It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not a man-bear, I&#x27;m a blond white male, not thick hair just fairly noticeable on the legs.</li>
            <li>in all, maybe this works better for people with lighter hair, but after using it for about 6 months, I&#x27;m buying a new braun epilator since they actually make contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>It makes removing hair from new areas nearly pain free.</li>
            <li>It works great and the hair takes much less time to come back than shaving.</li>
            <li>Another slight problem is it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs on my knee cap, but even regular shaving does not do really great job on that area for me...</li>
            <li>This is truly the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever used....and there have a few previous ones.  </li>
            <li>the cord one does not get on my nerves and it stays super powerful, so i will never go back to a rechargeable or battery EVER again.</li>
            <li>I think I have about average hair growth and density, so I cannot promise that everyone will have my same amazing results, but I cannot say enough nice things about this device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can only be used corded-that&#x27;s fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Emjoi can only be used while its connect to the cord my Pananosic works just fine without the cord n in the shower.</li>
            <li>My legs are so so as i have a mixture of fine hair and coarse on my legs.</li>
            <li>It does not last 6 weeks unless your you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with location on the body because I tried them all nor does it have to do with coarse or fine hair, tried that too.</li>
            <li>My leg hair varies between fine and medium coarse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde and perhaps my hairs are too fine to get a hold of</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because the hairs further up my shin and thigh are quite fine, so they tend to break before they can be tweezed out by the spinning discs.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this epilator did NOT work on the fine hair at all and only plucked the darker ones!</li>
            <li>All it did to the fine blonde hair is break it off.</li>
            <li>I researched and found this product to have very high ratings and so purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My own experience with most things with a built-in battery is that they start slowing down as the battery drains and eventually completely die (cell phones, Bluetooth, tablets, tooth brush, electric razor, handheld vacuum, etc.)</li>
            <li>I saw the Emagine in a catalog, (and was seduced by the snazzy, red color more than anything), and figured that my old Emjoi HAD to be less effective.</li>
            <li>It takes me more than hald an hour to finish my right leg half way to the thighs.</li>
            <li>This little machine is amazing.</li>
            <li>I already own a little Energizer battery pack that I can plug it into</li>
            <li>My skin feels warm and a little</li>
            <li>Honestly, it just stung a little bit when I used it.</li>
            <li>The double sided heads are good for one reason, not because they pluck double the hair, because any seasoned epilator knows, you have to come to hair at the right angle, but because you can go back and forth on your arm pits with out having to turn it around.</li>
            <li>It misses a lot of fine hair and the hair seems to grow back quite fast.</li>
            <li>I would say my pain tolerance is pretty high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommed Emjoi AP-18 to anyone interested in purchasing an epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epillator, read the high reviews and opted for this one.  </li>
            <li>maybe a little overwhelming because it is REALLY powerful</li>
            <li>This is just as good as waxing, expect in the hard to reach places</li>
            <li>I have very fair light skin, and very dark, course, thick (body) hair.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s because there are 72 tweezers working hard to make your skin silky smooth, :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One cannot complain about fast regrowth or ingrowns in relation to epilators, because that&#x27;s really individual to each person&#x27;s body, so the factors i believe are important are:    </li>
            <li>The Emjoi is much too bulky to fit close enough on my fingers and hands.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t really come with much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Claim: 72 Tweezer Heads for Fast, Long-Lasting Results</li>
            <li>I believe I would have been better prepared mentally, if I the manufacturer did not use \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; so often.</li>
            <li>, it was very unsightly.</li>
            <li>I was shaving 3-4 times a week to stay completely smooth, especially during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>I am really frugal and strapped for time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a reduction in ingrown hairs vs. shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have to use it about once a week because my hair grows fast</li>
            <li>so I was intimadated by everyone complaining about how much it hurts you BABIES.</li>
            <li>It was hyped up too much on the description.   </li>
            <li>The entire time the website never changed from saying \\&quot;Available for backorder ships within 10 business</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>+ it is MUCH faster than another models      </li>
            <li>I was prescribed a 4% hydroquinone cream that didn&#x27;t seem to help me much.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the epilator as hair removal lasts so much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much smoother</li>
            <li>the tweezers move reaaaally fast.</li>
            <li>Too much work.    </li>
            <li>His skin was left hairless and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I regret spending so much money on this epilator.</li>
            <li>The trick is to have a machine that works fast</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t feel it as much.</li>
            <li>Until that point, it was very unsightly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really does work well</li>
            <li>I can remove any unwanted hair so fast</li>
            <li>Most of my hair was removed with one pass, only a few areas needed to have more than one pass.    </li>
            <li>and it was MUCH faster than waxing.  </li>
            <li>It works very well but it does hurt and the machine noise does set off your nerves before and during use.  </li>
            <li>I can still highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>And, again, I can still highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that this model does not have a light and</li>
            <li>Really gals, spend the money on this</li>
            <li>Thanks to this epilator</li>
            <li>The 72 tweezers sounded great,I real time saver.</li>
            <li>I got this today and straight away took it out of the box and used it.  </li>
            <li>This definitely takes out the hair from the root, however it won&#x27;t leave your skin silky smooth like a razor does.</li>
            <li>so this did not bother me too much.</li>
            <li>But... was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li>The biggest downside to waxing is waiting that ~3 weeks for the hair to grow out so that you actually get your money&#x27;s worth when you pay for a salon waxing (and on that note, the cost of professional waxing is a huge downfall, as well)...</li>
            <li>How fast can you get it done? -</li>
            <li>- Very.</li>
            <li>Can i go out looking fab straight away?</li>
            <li>and it stays away much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>It also works fast.</li>
            <li>and it hurt so much</li>
            <li>Thanks,  Lorraine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all speeds--slow or fast</li>
            <li>you want one that&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>(haha -no</li>
            <li>Not only does it sound like I&#x27;m mowing the lawn when I turn this on, but when I tried to use it on my underarms</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com for your #10 service and prices.  </li>
            <li>As for this review specifically for the Emjoi, it was much quicker to do the job.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants to get away from shaving and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are very hairy</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t take too much online research to discover the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine.</li>
            <li>The Emagine is much faster.</li>
            <li>- it seemed to really remove the hair</li>
            <li>I also think it&#x27;s much cleaner than wax.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always ready for shorts.  </li>
            <li>I am very hairy</li>
            <li>It is fast, efficient and versatile.  </li>
            <li>I will say however that it&#x27;s too much for me to use on the thicker coarser pubic hair.</li>
            <li>I feel absolutely no pain in using it, but I&#x27;ve been epilating for more than 12 years.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much easier and cheaper than waxing,and you save money  on disposable razor costs.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of testosterone and your hair grows fast like mine</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very time consuming to me.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I was wondering if it really would do what it says and would get hairs that are like .05 cm or whatever the ad says.</li>
            <li>It hurt so much</li>
            <li>and so much</li>
            <li>It was very painless but didnt pull the hair out form the roots.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this to shaving.  </li>
            <li>when i bought it i was waiting that it would be fast becouse</li>
            <li>it was too fast</li>
            <li>, it is very painless..</li>
            <li>the Emjoi is well priced, and the product itself has a very robust design that appeals to me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an epilator, and the 72 tweezer heads do the job so much quicker...</li>
            <li>This one does the job much, much faster.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Emojoi claims to be &#x27;gentle&#x27; and if you&#x27;ve ever epilated</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really satisfiede.</li>
            <li>So much so that i didn&#x27;t think another one of their epilators could beat it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very course, think hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Now I can do it in minutes, just a touch up, really.</li>
            <li>It is fast</li>
            <li>But also, I expected more perfection from the epilation</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much the market (and the technology) has changed since 4 years ago when I purchased the (then version) Silk Épil.</li>
            <li>The dual opposing heads doing the job twice as fast as the single-head I&#x27;d owned by another manufacturer</li>
            <li>ago(it was an Emjoi gently Silken)  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The fact that there&#x27;s no stinging after I put on my &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; (lime juice) is testament to how much</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is reasonably priced for this type of item.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Things just go so fast with this epilator.</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator.  </li>
            <li>that seems like too much skin to cover.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone in need of an efficient hair removal tool!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>brace yourself ladies and gents, the pain will come but it is very brief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the emjoi in fast circles.  </li>
            <li>i change the direction of my circles in an area as pubic hair grows in different directions untill the area is smooth.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see much difference between the 2 speeds</li>
            <li>I have returned this product and ordered Braun silk epil and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li>Since I decided I respect myself ( as much as a guy who shaves his legs can)</li>
            <li>Also, in comparison to waxing you save so much time with this epilator.</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it has the dual opposed tweezers</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>jet fast speed doesn&#x27;t hurt because you&#x27;re not pulling out any/all hair...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as I don&#x27;t have much of a need for that.</li>
            <li>This gadget has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li>cheap Chinese plastic gears....</li>
            <li>It is too much money for this piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>For the price it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for cordless batteries dying even sooner, so that option is ruled out</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need the portability of a battery operated epilator, nor do I need it to be waterproof (</li>
            <li>used in my whole legs, bikini area, under arms and over my lips...</li>
            <li>-fast</li>
            <li>Using this fits into my schedule so much easier than waxing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt much</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.. at all.</li>
            <li>Works quite fast as well -</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would work out.  </li>
            <li>I need to spend twice as much time, manually trying to lift my hair so the damn thing grabs it in the end.</li>
            <li>I use this for my whole leg.</li>
            <li>It is faster than my others as well, and does an awesome job on my bikini line, though the size does make it a bit awkward in spots.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Webisites on Epilators and reviews from others.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>but i didnt feel that much pain</li>
            <li>I really like this Epilator.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering why their video ad has the woman going through the same surface area over and over, its because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in one pass regardless of how you do it (lightly over the hair or pressing into the skin as they tell you not to).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs having very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Very inefficient in removing hair.</li>
            <li>After a while your hair on your legs gets thinner and not so much.</li>
            <li>I expected better performance but this is much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the Epilady, but it also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Except that I don&#x27;t have so much hair to remove from my legs and under arms.</li>
            <li>I use it after a shower because the water and scrubbing opens the hair pores which makes it much easier to tweeze.</li>
            <li>Or if it does, there isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>This version doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>Had a braun for over 3 years (which I feel is a reasonable life for an epilator), so I bought this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my legs smooth for over a month and when the hair does grow back</li>
            <li>Underarms takes several times before it&#x27;s comfortable....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not prepared to use this device in the intimate areas of my body as the rotation of these hair pullers</li>
            <li>remind me too much of a mining device used to cut through rock walls.</li>
            <li>So you apply some triple antibiotic cream on the area after you use the epilator and that really heals things up quicker..</li>
            <li>mind you my tattoos were all 3-4s to include to one on my rib cage which is a very tender area).</li>
            <li>But I do get a much closer shave than with a manual razor.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my life and managing my leg hair is soooo much easier now.</li>
            <li>The emjoi imagine 72 tweezers epilator works fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I even used this on very tender areas.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li>This is a very well designed product, but considering the amount of pain involved, this is just not for me.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself is very sturdy, and although it did hurt, it didn&#x27;t once pinch my skin</li>
            <li>and I feel I&#x27;m saving so much money</li>
            <li>This one is so fast and does not miss a hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Got this for my wife after much nagging.</li>
            <li>works fast</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare too.</li>
            <li>and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!o mention, so is my husband!  </li>
            <li>and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!</li>
            <li>but it doesn.t work that much faster.  </li>
            <li>I think the head doesn&#x27;t contour enough to your leg to get that really smooth experience.</li>
            <li>id really like to purchase another epilator by Emjoi.....</li>
            <li>I could never do my bikini line the the Braun because it hurt way too much</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss about the Braun is the light.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi does what it is supposed to do in a very efficent manner.</li>
            <li>Those tweezers move FAST.</li>
            <li>Several days later I finally got brave, got it out and just did it.</li>
            <li>it moves fast.</li>
            <li>I expected more....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>Wish it had a light on it and was easier to use in smaller areas.</li>
            <li>Every women should have one, and they really do work well.  </li>
            <li>After over 10 years of faithful service, I had to replace my Gently Gold</li>
            <li>But the sting is really no worse if you are used to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Southern European (those that are KNOW that we have not only MORE hair in MORE areas of the BODY, and</li>
            <li>Much faster.  </li>
            <li>it goes so fast to take off hair that you dont feel the pain</li>
            <li>WITH THE WHOLE TURN OF EVENTS.</li>
            <li>This worked really well for me while it worked, but the motor died after about seven months of weekly use.  </li>
            <li>Still take several passes to get a hair free finish.</li>
            <li>This works so fast and is painless.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found out about &amp;#34;Epilating&amp;#34; a hand held device much like an electrical shaver except it plucks your hair with tweezers instead of shaves.</li>
            <li>Bought this for the fiancee, she loves it and thanks the person who invented these epilators.</li>
            <li>It is pain free enough that I don&#x27;t ever have to go get another brazilan wax again.  </li>
            <li>Fast, efficient, and</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have the genetic capability to handle this much pain.  </li>
            <li>MUCH EASIER...</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>This was so fast although there was some discomfort</li>
            <li>am used to waxing underarms and bikini and this did not hurt much, but i cannot use it for my legs yet.</li>
            <li>and I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li>It is very tolerable.</li>
            <li>This device has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>For two, this thing is an absolute GODSEND.</li>
            <li>This one is so fast because of the 72 tweezer head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>But it takes so much of time.</li>
            <li>We have spend so much of time on it.</li>
            <li>I really did my homework before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll  never shave again thanks to this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and my legs are really hairy.</li>
            <li>You have no idea how fast hair can grow.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how much it helps with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>or so you won&#x27;t feel much.  </li>
            <li>and I am thinking I am going to fast.  </li>
            <li>I will go real slow.&lt;br /&gt;Saying</li>
            <li>I dont see the dual speeds working very well, as in no difference.</li>
            <li>really like this Emjoi</li>
            <li>and I know that from taking vitamin supplements my (head) hair grows fast</li>
            <li>so maybe this had something to do with my leg hair growing fast.  </li>
            <li>but no worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t something I ever really got used to.  </li>
            <li>This 72 tweezers is really fast even on the lowest</li>
            <li>Could have been she overloaded it with TOO much leg hair, but who knows.</li>
            <li>This one takes longer to finish the job and does not pick light, short hair.</li>
            <li>I realized that if i do it like shaving my legs with a electric razor close to the skin won&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li>Plus it takes so much longer.  </li>
            <li>For me, this is much easier to do with the faster emjoi.  </li>
            <li>It was SOOOOO much faster than the braun.  </li>
            <li>One thing that has really helped me is to use a loofah both before and after epilating.  </li>
            <li>This works really well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Gave me a much nicer result.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier on the skin.</li>
            <li>And did not think much of it.  </li>
            <li>Twice as fast as the Braun Silk-Epil</li>
            <li>Much quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>You could move it in straight lines or circles.</li>
            <li>That said, this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Even though it has a 72 tweezer head, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair more efficiently, I absolutely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Also, as the hair is removed it is much easier to handle the feeling of tweeting.</li>
            <li>This epilator worked really well.</li>
            <li>the gears that allow the tweezers to rotate are made of cheap plastic and will wear out in short time, leaving you with a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I really like this thing.  </li>
            <li>I imagine if used correctly it might work very well...</li>
            <li>It does make an absolute racket when it&#x27;s used; my dogs wont come in the bathroom when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Being run on an outlet, it funs fast and with 72 Tweezers the job is done in twice the time.  </li>
            <li>for the noise, any hair dryer is much much louder than this</li>
            <li>My underarms have become much lighter in color than before because of razers.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product works every bit as well as waxing does on the legs and underarms, but for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe is was because it rotating too fast??</li>
            <li>The pain on this one compared to that one is much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and then it doesn&#x27;t happen whole lot.</li>
            <li>The hair goes really fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi 72 tweezer worked very well on my legs, underarms, and binki area.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work on my bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I dont feel much pain.</li>
            <li>It has stopped the process of daily shaving but still leaves me with smooth legs all the time.  </li>
            <li>I use this about once a week and find that to be enough to keep my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who desires smooth legs but hates the daily drudgery of shaving.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>It does a nice job removing hair, you do need to go over  the same spot several times, but once hair is removed your skin is left smooth to the touch and hairless.  </li>
            <li>Some people wrote it hurt too much for underarms, I don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li>This machine would have done too much damage to the skin trying to pull the hairs out even for a yoga contortionist who could get in there to epilate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get real, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Much louder than my Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have waxed my legs a few times and used to do my own brazillian wax with the Bliss kit.</li>
            <li>I should note that I&#x27;m not a hirsute person, and I&#x27;d imagine that a particularly hairy or coarse-haired person would find this product even less effective than I do.</li>
            <li>It felt nice to not have to shave that area everyday when I showered.</li>
            <li>Still, as a daily epilator, the Philips, and the Braun before it, were both far superior, if a tiny bit slower.</li>
            <li>I used to only be able to use epilate my armpits after applying a numbing cream because the area is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you try to use this on the back end near your back door, then good luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not blaming this on the device or company since it was MY FAULT that I put a piece back incorrectly, but I am saying that it would have been nice to have a bit of room for error since my $80 purchase is now obsolete because of one simple mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could afford to try Silk&#x27;n or Tria laser systems, but for now, a epilator will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;After more than eight years, I had to toss my old Philips epilator because it finally stop working.</li>
            <li>This later generation works even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Although I have to make a few more passes with the Emoji than I had to with the Braun, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I can use it and be finished in a matter of minutes and am good to go for at least 6 weeks after.  </li>
            <li>So be prepared to replace this item more frequently than should be necessary for its cost.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel anything really, except the Top, Inner Thighs (the wobbly, not firm bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a pretty nice past decade with ya.</li>
            <li>I did completely read the user guide prior to use, to make sure I was using it correctly.....</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve managed to do my own Brazilian w/out much trouble.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this machine is too big for such a narrow/tight area where the leg meets the trunk of the body.</li>
            <li>I do have very course thick hair, which could be part of the issue, maybe this epilator is good for people with finer hair?</li>
            <li>72 tweezers should hurt more than the little Satinelle, right?</li>
            <li>This machine left me just as smooth as if I&#x27;d been waxed by my professional!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for a good year and a half to two years, and they all work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rather loud (compared to my old epilator), but it is said to have a very powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to say that it hurts like a mother the first several times you use it, but no pain no gain, right?</li>
            <li>(More expensive is better, right??)</li>
            <li>At first, the slower speed was more efficient because the fastest speed would just tear hair in half instead of pluck the whole follicle.</li>
            <li>if one dies I have a back up so far the first one is still going strong .  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>And can I just say WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a light but other than that it does a great job for me.&lt;br /&gt;Those who say it is painful</li>
            <li>It also comes with a little brush to clean it, and a nice white pouch to keep it in, and added bonus!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt, except when I got adventurous, but that also hurts less with time ;)</li>
            <li>The larger head on this model is ideal for legs and can do other smaller areas, but with some difficulty.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to epilation, you have to expect it will hurt the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had tried the tria hair remover at a much greater cost with no positive results.  </li>
            <li>but I just showered right after and put on a soft dove deodorant and all was well.</li>
            <li>My vision is fine, I do not require glasses, but with out the light, I am straining to see the backs of my legs and lower down near the ankle.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I just wanted to point out that my epilator arrived 2 days later than it was suppose to and the seller more than made up for the delay by offering superior customer service and a small refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I would suggest not spending the extra money on the dual head because its not any more useful then the extra pass you have to make anyway to get the hair thats normally missed.</li>
            <li>so I tried it on my upper leg which had a couple weeks of growth and again, even with longer hair, very little was pulled,and  mostly it just broke off at the skin leaving my legs not at all smooth!</li>
            <li>Finally, this epilator is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>overall its worth it!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark, coarse hair that grows fast.  </li>
            <li>A lot smoother than the other epilator I had and gets more hairs.  </li>
            <li>so I have had to turn to MANY other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li>I decided to exfoliate starting with the original Epilady.  </li>
            <li>It worked much better than the other model I tried.  </li>
            <li>My armpits on the other hand, seem like the hair is breaking more than I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li>while running on the same area, your hair continue to smile in your face &#x3D; get me if you can!</li>
            <li>This is much better than the other model, but still can take a couple of passes to pick up all the hair (hence the 4, not 5 star review).  </li>
            <li>Then again, they may not be able to keep the power level consistent enough while running on battery power, which may be the reason it&#x27;s operable only while plugged in to an outlet.    </li>
            <li>Maybe other nationalities have a better response from this product, but I did not.</li>
            <li>time I noticed I had to epilate more often than waxing due to the root of hair not being pulled out.  </li>
            <li>works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Once a week 15-20 min of epilation with Emjoy is definitely better for me than every other day shaving.</li>
            <li>Originally I used it as a backup for when I couldn&#x27;t get in to get my legs waxed and it worked well enough.</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first, in some areas more then others but after the second or third use the pain decreases.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok; not a problem for me, but I saw similar comment on prior review, so be aware.  </li>
            <li>I really love this Emjoi compared to the other one I had.</li>
            <li>It hurt a little on the first use, but it got much better after that.  </li>
            <li>So the first calve that I did had way more irritation and red bumps because I was having to go over spots several times.</li>
            <li>The other brand seemed to break the hair more often than tweeze it out</li>
            <li>I have seen other reviews that mention that two metal teeth are better than one being plastic.</li>
            <li>(This is an edit to my original review for under arm hair removal- about 1 1/2 months later.  </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>better than any other i tried</li>
            <li>I do use the circle method someone else mentioned in a review and that does work much better than any other method.</li>
            <li>But for the most part my legs are pretty smooth and pulled out about 75% of the hairs but 25% were broken off.</li>
            <li>In NO time are my legs free of any hair, smooth and all of this with very little pain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to look back and laugh about when I got my FIRST epilator..</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair that is darker and more coarse on the back of my neck, ankles, and underarms.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend paying that much when you can get one that works a whole lot better for less money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been a professional cyclist for years and have shaved my legs for as long as most women.</li>
            <li>does NOT get the fine hairs like stated, and with 72 tweezers takes just as long to remove hair as my worn out one</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to get the job done, enjoy is also very noisy</li>
            <li>(Yes, hairs get all over the place, but because this is a dry epilator, the hair is easy to wipe up and throw away, the hair don&#x27;t stick to anything.)</li>
            <li>There is some minor discomfort on the most sensitive areas</li>
            <li>It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and chin.      </li>
            <li>&quot; the First few Sweeps, then, nothing notable, once in awhile, that Prickly sensation was felt.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected that since it had so many more tweezers than than my Emjoi Emagine that it would be faster and miss less hairs.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to find one that was going to be effective and last a long time.</li>
            <li>the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go over the area softly and kind of floating and don&#x27;t grind the epilator into your skin, it will bog it down anyway.  </li>
            <li>I have very corse hair this works better than any other one I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>I have exceptionally hairy legs with very dark course hair and it would take a total of 4 hours to clear my legs of hair with the Braun, if they were super hairy.  </li>
            <li>I did have to go over a few spots more than once, but in all fairness I&#x27;ve not been waxed since right before the New Year (2012)</li>
            <li>really hoped to give this a high rating, but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Caveat - I&#x27;ve been seeing my estitician for 7 years now for regular waxing of my upper thighs, full face, and full brazilian - the real deal one.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;d like my business back they can send me a new head for free.</li>
            <li>Personally, I can live with not being 100% hair free, so I epilate about once a week.  </li>
            <li>With the double sided rotation it relay does the job right!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable - was able to risk using on bikini line which hurt WAY too much with previous epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My pores did get irritated but healed quickly and the hairs are much finer and didn&#x27;t come back in immediately</li>
            <li>It is not entirely painless, for your hair is stuck to you, but because it is going so fast, you just feel it rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it really does a quick job of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>The hair that does grow back seems to be soft baby hairs that are easily removied by the emjoi emagine.</li>
            <li>Super fast and grabs teeny, tiny hairs.  </li>
            <li>Yes, when you first start using an epilator it hurts because you have so much hair, but the more you use it the less hair returns so the degree of pain lessens considerably.  </li>
            <li>I felt a mild pinching sensation while using it on the short hair of my legs and armpits; on hair that was longer it pulled and left a very pinching sensation, although not bad.</li>
            <li>Still, I expected it would be superior to the single tweeze auto-plucker</li>
            <li>I have used epilators for as long as they were available.</li>
            <li>After using the braun 5280 for a few years I can say the AP-18 is by far the better epilator!</li>
            <li>Fortunately the cord is quite long</li>
            <li>It is not completely pain free</li>
            <li>For every 2 weeks of smooth legs, I had three weeks of wearing nothing but pants or long skirts.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>First, I have to say how pleasantly surprised I was with the packaging itself.  </li>
            <li>This epilator is a good investment even though the hefty price tag looks pretty expensive at first.</li>
            <li>The key to smooth epilated skin is exfoliation, exfoliation, exfoliation; so make sure you do that everyday after you epilate to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>However I have only so far used it on my legs and arms and not dared anything more sensitive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not painful by any means, or even red.</li>
            <li>I went back to shaving because the abrasiveness of the process really irritated my skin, and when my hair grew back it hurt (for some reason it was more prickly??</li>
            <li>It is fast, easy to clean, and although bigger than other epilators, it is the size of the tweezers that matters.</li>
            <li>Fair warning, the first time you use it, it is pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, this epilator is loud, even for an epilator.</li>
            <li>The product description  says results last for six weeks; that hasn&#x27;t proven to be true.  </li>
            <li>Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  </li>
            <li>first time I have used an Epilator and I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>First off, if you are used to waxing it is pretty much the same comfort level (i.e. hairs ripping from your skin).  </li>
            <li>I expected more discomfort and was pleasantly surprised at how much it did not hurt.  </li>
            <li>You definitely want this machine working at full capacity at all times.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely faster I am done with my full arms, legs, armpits and bikini area in about 30 -35 minutes.</li>
            <li>such a great product, i think i haven&#x27;t bought  any intuition shaving heads for a long long time.</li>
            <li>Have used an epilator since they first came on the market and my old epilady still works</li>
            <li>First the thing is so LOUD.</li>
            <li>pain is not bad, you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Better to do it when your hair is short, once a week or so.</li>
            <li>Not bad enough to return it,but I would not recommend it .</li>
            <li>Last of all go back over clean areas in the perpendicular direction of what you first used to make sure you get any wild hairs growing in a different direction.    </li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get use to it so quickly and it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Given all the positive reviews perhaps my epilator is defective, but it is very noisy and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as older models I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The comfort level is high - nothing about epilation is nice - would suggest that you do follow the guidelines and bath and dry prior to use.</li>
            <li>The Doctor said I needed more air circulation below the belt to cut down on the dampness.</li>
            <li>Works better than waxing and cuts down time.</li>
            <li>I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase</li>
            <li>I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than shaving every other day!</li>
            <li>I wasted money on a product that cannot be returned at this juncture, and most certainly one that I will never use again.</li>
            <li>I say spend a little extra and get a good quality product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that this model hurts at all, but I think the fact that I&#x27;ve been waxing and epilating for a while has made me a little more tolerant of discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My esthecitian friend says that epilators aren&#x27;t good for anything but making a wax last a little longer.</li>
            <li>The pain was completely managable for a first time (the pain decreases the more you epilate)and left no red bumps.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with my new Emagine.</li>
            <li>plus I am new to this and was practicing how to hold it and how much pressure to use).</li>
            <li>Combined with the lack of an LED light (which I was really used to in my old appliance and depended on), the significant learning curve of the current angle to which you need to direct it to your skin, and the reduced efficacy, I returned this item and purchased a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would take me a very long time to epilate my legs and they never felt smooth.</li>
            <li>simply cause the grow back hair has to have time to get to the right length to epilate, but its so fine and soft that it doesn&#x27;t really bother</li>
            <li>Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using.  </li>
            <li>It is alot faster (since it has so many heads) and does alot better job than my previous ones and with less pain.  </li>
            <li>This works even better than the previous Emjoie that I owned.  </li>
            <li>The tighter the skin, the better contact it has with the hair your trying to remove, and the less it pulls at the skin, which often creates some of the pain.</li>
            <li>I bought it in desperation as I lost my precious previous one.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than my previous one, which I purchased 9 years ago, and had about a 30-40 tweezer head.</li>
            <li>My problem with this one is that instead of tweezing the hairs, it breaks a lot of them in half, so it&#x27;s not accomplishing much more than if I had shaved.  </li>
            <li>It pulls more hairs that previous ones i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>as compared to my previous epilator but seems to pull fewer hairs for sure.</li>
            <li>so i use it mostly for underarms and the lower half of my leg.  </li>
            <li>it was better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>Then I purchased the Gold Emjoi, much better, less pain and still works</li>
            <li>I do not give I love it because I only had to buy a power supply for the European market to me.</li>
            <li>Have owned older versions of the Emjoi Epilator.  </li>
            <li>My idea of a good time is not being found unconscious on my bathroom floor with a buzzing red object in my limp hand.</li>
            <li>Be realistic with any product you buy--</li>
            <li>This particular epilator does not work as stated.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly as when I use a razor.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for my underarms</li>
            <li>Of all the things on my daily personal maintenance list, shaving my legs is at the top.</li>
            <li>I wish the main gear was metal instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>and my skin was smooth and hair free for at least a week.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove hair smaller than 2-3 mm but does the job well and quickly.</li>
            <li>To top that off, after using it I can still find hair that it didnt pull out; after going over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li>Be careful in areas with more \\&quot;soft</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before deciding to stay with Emoji, and particularly this model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not,</li>
            <li>the first time epilating the pubic area will take a while, especially if its your first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought the Emjoi because of my curiosity for the dual head design.</li>
            <li>My skin was a bit red after use, but that quickly went away.</li>
            <li>I definitely like it better than my last epilator.</li>
            <li>It gets super short hairs.</li>
            <li>I will be using it on my legs and underarms but my main purpose is my face.</li>
            <li>hairs were very short and they were pulled out like that, different of wax that i would need wait they grow more to depilate.</li>
            <li>It says that you can if you manuever it correctly, but trust me its easier to use one of the smaller units made more specifically for these areas or to simply use another method of hair removal.    </li>
            <li>And if you are someone who has hair growing out of your legs every which way, then you might consider the double sided heads to be more efficient, otherwise, its really only an arm pit benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>keep trying to think of pros, and I think I might just be super irritated that this thing no longer works after 4 years, but c&#x27;mon, can&#x27;t anything last anymore?</li>
            <li>You will have to run it over the same area multiple times to get most of the hair out, even then it doesn&#x27;t get everything like some ppl claims it does.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Emjoi, so I have been used to the pain when using this.  </li>
            <li>chose the emjoi for several reasons, mostly because the tweezers got the highest ratings on several reviews I read.</li>
            <li>I love that, and that it only needs done every several weeks!  </li>
            <li>I had the much older version, and Emjoi Gold.</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t come back as quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several epilators before and i was hoping that this would be a SUPER DUPER epilator.</li>
            <li>I have been using the older Emjoi Gold model for about 10 years now, so I thought it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li>) results on this particular area.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare this particular one, too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model, particularly at its cost.</li>
            <li>Bought this mainly for chin area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that many lacked power and required several times going over the same spot to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>This product was delivered quickly and I have been using it for several months with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Even with the two heads it takes longer Than my older one.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how smooth they actually got.  </li>
            <li>I had to cover the same area, several times for it to pick up most (not all) of the hair in that area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating for six years now, and owned four different epilators from three different manufacturers, the Emjoi - Emagine is my favorite.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s too big for brows, I use it for my upper lip and I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>I am Swedish decent</li>
            <li>This epilator definitely works and manages to quickly remove all hair in any chosen spot.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older epilator I had.  </li>
            <li>This older model&#x27;s tweezers have two metal teeth vs one plastic and one metal.</li>
            <li>: I have a decent tolerance for pain, plus after a minute or two the area get desensitized.</li>
            <li>Good for flat surface where skin is tight...</li>
            <li>I have very hairy legs and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t get my soft, fine, blond hairs that tend to lie flat against the skin.  </li>
            <li>positive thing about it is that it is faster than my old one.</li>
            <li>I saw this particular epilator on YouTube and it came highly recommended by it&#x27;s reviewer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have a decent pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the hassle and mess of waxing any more</li>
            <li>The Braun epilator was my very first experience with epilation and it definitely took some getting used to dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li>Make sure you pull the skin tight while pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to place it horizontal to the area you are working on, and pull the skin tight.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider my pain tolerance to be particularly high, either, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to using wax over the years.    </li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve experienced is hairs growing back just under the skin in a leg area; I can see them, but can&#x27;t reach them until they&#x27;ve finally grown through the upper layer.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest you exfoliate before using.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this to all you ladies, your men will appreciate how your legs feel.</li>
            <li>I have a decently high tolerance to pain and yet sometimes I&#x27;m like gritting my teeth trying to just hurry and get through it.</li>
            <li>I was a swimmer in high school and always felt embarrassed for having razor burn around my bikini line and also never felt like I could show my legs unless I had shaven that day.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t epilated before, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Over all I give it high ratings.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>The sides of the epilator sit up to high</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Bought this after seeing it rated high elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After using it on high speed for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>I also would like to note i have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>High quality manufacturing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>had incredibly high hopes for this epilator, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>recommed it highly.</li>
            <li>For pain, I&#x27;d say maybe a 3 on the high side.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and takes multiple passes; however I used it on pretty short (shaved three days previous) hair that is blonde and fairly thin/fine!</li>
            <li>leaves your skin smooth and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other one i had</li>
            <li>The only sensation I experienced on my lower legs was an occasional slight scraping sensation-</li>
            <li>Yes it has all of these extra hair catching teeth, yet due to</li>
            <li>I also think I read that the fine hairs are harder to get</li>
            <li>The only positive is it really doesnt cause much pain, but I think that is because its not pulling the hairs like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>I found this one on Amazon for less than I paid 10 years ago and this new improved model is 10 times better.</li>
            <li>thorough than other epilators - gets most hairs on first pass, and strip in middle</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little machine -</li>
            <li>Love it once I got desensitized to the little &amp;#</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how this little machine tweezed every bit of that underarm hair and that skin is so smooth now!</li>
            <li>many little ones...</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for my bikini line, but, I am using it also now for my legs, the first time hurts a little, but you get used to it quickly; and in my opinion it is much better than shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li>great thing is that It takes half the time to do my legs with the 72 Tweezer Head, hence half the pain and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: At one of the spots here in Dallas that I think is clean, well-priced, professional, etc., it would cost me over $160 to get my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li>So cool, I have thick course hair and it pulls them out just fine.</li>
            <li>and most were centered on the upper right leg which is hidden under any type of clothing in the summer anyhow unless I wore a speedo, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this epilator due to the lack of pain and 72 tweezers making for a rapid and easy hair removal experience.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well but takes a little long to get the hair out.</li>
            <li>I cannot say I have tried any other brands of epilators other than Emjoi, but if you are looking for a really good one in their lineup, I highly recommendthe AP-18.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re undecided - trust me, it really does a good job and hurts less - in fact I don&#x27;t feel the pulling like with other epilators, just the pressure.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as I expected.</li>
            <li>So far it is the fastest although not quite as fast as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>The old one&#x27;s head is much easier to clean, i.e., one could see what was there and rinse it off, then set it aside to dry.</li>
            <li>and I still have a light pink discolored area (</li>
            <li>, it got old fast.</li>
            <li>, this really DOESN&#x27;T hurt as much as my old epilator!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li>I have had this epilator since the week of Christmas and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>epilating in a dim shower really has no benefits, I found).  </li>
            <li>It really does take a LOT of passes to clear an area.</li>
            <li>This works so much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li>My legs were much smoother with this one over my old one.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly quiet; not too heavy and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>but it was absolutely tolerable and in some cases a complete snooze.  </li>
            <li>One pass yields as much hair as 2 or 3 passes on my old epilator.</li>
            <li>My old Emjoi was fading fast</li>
            <li>I did my armpits and was surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>I would clear the majority of hairs with the fast emjoi and then go over it again with the braun.  </li>
            <li>I thought that my old epilator was fast...</li>
            <li>i am now trying to get a replacement directly from the manufacturer but do not have much hope.</li>
            <li>, it is much nicer to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>its worth the price not to shave daily!</li>
            <li>Ok, first off I&#x27;ve had a nightmare dealing with shaving, especially inbetween my upper thigh area and back thigh.</li>
            <li>I was bummed because it looked like how my thighs normally do.</li>
            <li>But then I read that this can be a normal reaction because your legs/skin aren&#x27;t used to this type of treatment.</li>
            <li>Overall it works pretty much as promised.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this is worth it.</li>
            <li>I decided to used on my bikini line, I normally waxed it myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I think the product build is a solid one, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price or the ingrown</li>
            <li>Of course it hurts, you are pulling hair out by the root, but for such a shorter amount of time it is definately worth it.  </li>
            <li>A nice option would be also rechargeable, but I definitely would choose electric above battery-only; you need to keep the constant power for shaving.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of whether you buy the Emjoi or the Braun, IT IS WORTH IT - especially for you ladies who have the embarrassing chin hairs!!  </li>
            <li>My chin hairs have also pretty much disappeared - I still shave every 3 or 4 days, but instead of hundreds of chin hairs, there are only about 5-10.</li>
            <li>My underarm hair barely grows back anymore &amp; between Brazilian bikini waxes, it keeps me smooth.</li>
            <li>But it was apparent the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t even comparable.</li>
            <li>The extra price is worth the time saved.</li>
            <li>As I normally shave my legs</li>
            <li>The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  </li>
            <li>The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  </li>
            <li>Even if you only plan on using this under your arms, it is completely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>how many times I went over the same small patch of skin trying to make sure that all of the hair was removed only to find that IT WOULD NOT GET ALL OF THE HAIR.</li>
            <li>and I love not having the messy wax everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to waste more money on this failing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisy, and it has no light, but it sure gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>but then again, just one trip to a salon will cost you pretty much the same</li>
            <li>On top of that, my legs always felt like I had not shaved in two days; NEVER smooth.    </li>
            <li>I found this definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The speed and performance is worth the price,  however you will need another one that gets the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>I normally pay to get waxed or use a hair removal lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different epilators and this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I just barely have any stubble and it&#x27;s been about five days since I first used it.</li>
            <li>wo it&#x27;s worth the extra time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I think I need a few more times to get the technique</li>
            <li>I haven used a normal razor in over a year</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reverted back to shaving after a while since it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying not having to shave my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li>Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40)</li>
            <li>Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40)</li>
            <li>It pulled few hairs and broke many hairs leaving stubble.  </li>
            <li>I just found waxing to be too pricey, and I&#x27;m not really skilled enough to do it myself and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>It is ok product but not fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one after I broke the first one by accident... goes to show you how much I like using this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using epilators x over 20 years, I have used emjoi brands long ago and more recently Braun, Phillips, etc.  </li>
            <li>Was able to see hundreds of long hair follicles on white towel that I had under my legs fall out.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I would have to shave every day, but with this product, I used it once and now,</li>
            <li>My skin looked absolutely normal - just fur</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never be satisfied because you&#x27;re expecting professional quality results (which you would pay a lot to get) from an at-home-use / personal use hand-held machine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as effective as waxing, and as long as I use it at least 1x a week, it&#x27;s not painful.  </li>
            <li>Overall it did a good job at catching the hairs, but it&#x27;s just too painful to use</li>
            <li>My arms and upper thighs have very fine hair, as I do not shave them, and the emjoi did not really hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this model because it has many more tweezers than most other models because I thought it would make the process quicker (albeit possibly more painful) despite being more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It took the Emjoi five minutes to clear as much hair as possible my right arm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like any other epilator meaning you have to keep going over areas because it doesn&#x27;t remove the ingrown hair, or the fine hair within one stroke like it states.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after using it for the first time, hair started growing back rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a very mild pinching sensation as each hair is removed, but its definitely well within my ability to tolerate it, and even do an entire leg at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and slightly less noisy, but who really cares about the noise anyway?</li>
            <li>I had to go over and over the same short stubbly hairs that my aging Braun could easily pluck out with no problem in one pass.</li>
            <li>I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  </li>
            <li>I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  </li>
            <li>But be aware that the pain IS more agonizing than waxing, as the process is much slower - at least with waxing a large section of hair can be removed in one second...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this nice looking shiny red little \\&quot;thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but be prepared to clean up a lot of little hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing feeling for someone like me who thought that until I spend a fortune and years on laser hair removal treatments that I was just a hairy girl that always hid my body with clothes and spent too much money and time on grooming and different things that never REALLY did enough to give me the confidence of smooth legs or no stubble or razor burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  </li>
            <li>However, when I had leftover hairs still visible, I went up, from left, from right and</li>
            <li>Only consideration might be need for power cord in right location for light/mirror since no battery option.</li>
            <li>I would use it on my upper lip and on my cheeks right under my \\&quot;side burns\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the tweezers do not open and close at the right time to grab the hair.</li>
            <li>When my Emjoi Optima AP-99 died last week, fear shot through me at the prospect of spending months shopping for the right epilator.</li>
            <li>However, again, my left arm was noticeably smoother than my right and</li>
            <li>The hair grows back right away.  </li>
            <li>This is my third epilator and the construction right out of the box</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aftercare - You will see a lot of red dots; hey, you&#x27;d see them right after getting waxed too.</li>
            <li>it just plugs in as opposed to having a battery to charge, because I have heard that batteries run down pretty quick on epilators and I never have to wait for it to charge.</li>
            <li>Now I epilate about once a week and the sparse hair that comes in at all is soft and fair - very hard to see even when it gets longish.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is that I had to pull out my old Braun epilator (which is slow, and on its last leg</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very satisfied, the only thing I can&#x27;t talk about is how long it will last.</li>
            <li>have fine blonde hair, but with the Emjoi you have to cover the same area of skin on your legs 8-10 times to pick up all hairs.</li>
            <li>Also the hair on my legs took forever to grow back and they grow back so fine not like when shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously many people love this epilator, and I love that it&#x27;s corded (doesn&#x27;t lose steam, as it were) and the pulls really are MUCH less painful,</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s truly fabulous on slower-growth areas like the bikini line.</li>
            <li>I was using a Braun before it gave up the ghost unexpectedly, and it was a little more discomforting on my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, so it&#x27;s a little early for me to be posting this review, as I just ordered this yesterday on my Prime account.</li>
            <li>Small slow circular motions most effective.  </li>
            <li>I tried an epilady back when they first came out, I was in Jr High</li>
            <li>Still working as brand new.</li>
            <li>so I was in the market for a new one and after reading reviews</li>
            <li>I epilate every couple of days to get rid of any new growth, and it takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Anyway with hubbies help, I now have a new \\&quot;look\\&quot; , although I have to say there was some distractions along the way with his help :</li>
            <li>Hence, I purchased a new one.  </li>
            <li>Since it was time to buy a new one, I thought I would try the Emjoi AP-18 Dual head.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t used a razor for my underarms in over 10 years), and decided it was time for a new epilator.</li>
            <li>I might have gotten 3 uses out of my new one before it broke, the tweezers stopped moving</li>
            <li>If you are new to using one of these it is going to hurt.</li>
            <li>I bought it 3-4 years ago and still works as new.</li>
            <li>This is a new and improved model.</li>
            <li>I needed a new hair remover.</li>
            <li>No matter what I did - shaving cream, conditioner, brand new razors, etc.</li>
            <li>I called the Emjoi company in New York.</li>
            <li>i used braun epilator for almost nine years i was looking for new one, when i read the review i wanted to give it a shot .......</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m new to the epilator</li>
            <li>With this new epilator he hasn&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li>they replaced it with a new epilator.</li>
            <li>After using for one years it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>AND WHEN I COULDN&#x27;T USE THE PRODUCE AS I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA NOT THE US (WHICH THEY DIDN&#x27;T SAY WOULD BE A PROBLEM)</li>
            <li>If you are a woman looking for a new way to remove leg hair, stick to shaving, or waxing, or Nair.  </li>
            <li>Decided I would upgrade to a fancy new Emjoi model.</li>
            <li>(until you hit a new area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(until you hit a new area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* IF YOUR ARE NEW TO EPILATING -&gt;</li>
            <li>So I ordered a new adaptor for about $20.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Braun epilator for over 5 years now and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>For me, the time savings of the emjoi justifies me having to purchase a new one every year or so.</li>
            <li>This time i decided to get something new.</li>
            <li>A new problem:  </li>
            <li>(I DON&#x27;T LIVE IN THE US)</li>
            <li>From other reviewers Baby Powder, Aloe Vera and a good Exfoliant make the process efficient and hurt less.  </li>
            <li>Now, I want to be totally honest: it does not really pull every single hair at the first shot, but even if I have to go over an area multiple times, who cares?</li>
            <li>In general terms, I like this epilator more than any other I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>It was time to get a new epilator after several years - I have only owned 2 previous ones in 15+ years so to be fair</li>
            <li>It hurts so bad lol not even fun</li>
            <li>Much better to get the Philips satinelle, been using it for the last 2 years, half the price and very efficient.</li>
            <li>Finally, what I&#x27;m left with is a surface of stubble rather than smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it on my legs, but I just feel like epilators are too small in general to effectively use on your legs.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product to use if you&#x27;re tired of shaving.</li>
            <li>A friend with lots of dark hair tested this product on a small area of his leg and had great results.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of epilating and not having hair grow back for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li>This epilator doesn&#x27;&#x27;t pinch any where near as much as the old model.  </li>
            <li>And for my legs, it gets hairs that are really short, &amp; my legs feel almost as smooth as when I used a razor blade, but this last a lot longer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it is particularly difficult to get smooth results over boney or prominent areas like shins and knees.</li>
            <li>but it may help some one who likes a complete bare look ;-) ) .</li>
            <li>It is definitely not as painful (can barely feel it, actually)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who&#x27;s experienced with epilating knows what broken hairs feel like: visually, the hairs are gone, but you can feel the tops of them at the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I have no red bumps or anything the next day and completely smooth arms.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better as far as pulling but takes longer and is not comfortable to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Gross fact: I´m very hairy (thanks, dad).</li>
            <li>My mom bought a Braun just a year ago to replace her old one and said she can&#x27;t tell much of a difference from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only problem was that it took soooo many passes to clear an area, but, even with the multiple passes, my skin didn&#x27;t really get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Emoji AP-18 to anyone looking for an efficient, low pain (no epilator will be pain free) Epilator.</li>
            <li>After using the epilator hair grows back much slower then with saving and also much finer.</li>
            <li>to contour curves&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly painless, even with sensitive skin (let&#x27;s be realistic, beauty requires some pain)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I used it primarily on my underarms, bikini area and the inner and back area of my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say that I use it about once every week or 2 just to keep tidy, but it only takes a few minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to sum up...get ready for some discomfort which only lasts while you do it and only for a few times...and then enjoy years of shave free living.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-I let myself dry off completely and took some extra time (about an hour) to get all my things together, set up my area, and made sure I had no dampness left&lt;br</li>
            <li>From many of thedescriptions I expected to feel maybe a day or two&#x27;s worth of stubble, but it only felt like a few hours&#x27; worth.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts much longer than shaving and when it grows back it grows very sparse and the hair seems somehow finer.  </li>
            <li>I used this with the Nisim Hair inhibitor and it left my skin smooth and it took the hair longer to grow back.</li>
            <li>Sorry, I have really nothing good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, so as a college aged male I am stuck in a generation where no one likes hair, even on guys.  </li>
            <li>Poor me.)&lt;br /&gt;(I also tried it on my arms on low speed and came out great without redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>use this mainly for the pubic area and underarms and both are considered sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t really use it much because of all the effort w/ just ONE leg (w/ short hair) followed by a razor.</li>
            <li>have coarse dark hair and after many many times running across my legs this pulled little to nothing out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so I decided to purchase it after some major contemplation (considering the price and the fear that it would hurt too much).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li>Even used it on my ears getting the smallest and finest of hairs without any issues or irritation - and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it is very loud but it gets rid of the hair.</li>
            <li>Very loud.</li>
            <li>My solution is to use a loofah in the shower, very frequently.</li>
            <li>I have Italian dark hair, and fair sensitive english skin, so shaving was irriating.  </li>
            <li>Many tweezer heads really does mean faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With our old epilator my husband would always complain about hairs growing back right under the skin.</li>
            <li>I am used to epilators, I have been using them for a long time, now, but I always dread the due date because I have a hard time tolerating the prickly feeling of the hairbeing pulled, especially on my most sensitive areas that are the thighs and the knees..</li>
            <li>If you have never epilated before, I STRONGLY suggest getting just breaking down and paying a one time cost of getting waxed by a professional just once before you start to epilate.  </li>
            <li>the face being VERY fine blond hair, hardly discernible).</li>
            <li>I am a male (cyclist) with course body hair, and this was my first time using an epilator, so</li>
            <li>I am used to waxing and all that so this wasn&#x27;t a very big shock when i first used this.</li>
            <li>but the fact that I don&#x27;t even get smooth skin means this is NOT worth it for me....</li>
            <li>As I said, trim the hairs short, first.  </li>
            <li>I was not able to use it in any angle maybe someone more por than me</li>
            <li>When I used to wax the facial hair, it took forever because the hairs were never removed on the first pass.</li>
            <li>Since this was the first time with my underarms there was a tiny bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really only the first time you use it</li>
            <li>The first Emjoi I had finally retired after using it for 21 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they are just breaking off instead of being plucked or if it&#x27;s just more hair that it missed, but either way I still feel like I need to shave after using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Invest in one of these for smooth, long lasting hair free legs, underarms, and other areas.</li>
            <li>got my first epilator about 10 years ago and loved the convenience, but it wasn&#x27;t that powerful and ran through batteries like crazy!</li>
            <li>It definitely hurt the first time using it</li>
            <li>If you are using an epilator for the first time, you will likely experience some pain.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the ice glove, but I love the small bag that comes with it for storage.</li>
            <li>This is my first and only epilator.</li>
            <li>Love it for small patches.</li>
            <li>This was the first and will be the last experience I ever have with an Emjoi.</li>
            <li>It worked great for that as well and really does get all the littlest hairs whether separate random hairs or tiny peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>downfall, since hair grows in waves or phases (I think thats the more technical term or what the laser hair removal technicians call it) but you can use this epilator and get all your hair but days later have a tiny bit of stubble.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>As far as pain, yes it hurts!</li>
            <li>I would expect it to last longer considering it is more expensive than most epilators.</li>
            <li>It barely hurt and didn&#x27;t take that much time.</li>
            <li>When the first one missed a hair the second one will pick him up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators since it is the only one I have used, but I&#x27;m glad that I started with this one.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>after the first week, it was a week before i noted i had hair growing back.</li>
            <li>There is always an element of pain with epilators (especially when you first start using one).  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to go over the spots several times until the hair is completeley removed but once again after the first time, the maintenance is a piece of cake.</li>
            <li>which is cheaper and pulls the hair out better and with the root. :/</li>
            <li>It works very well only missing the most stubborn hairs which I can then tweeze myself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My only quibble, and it&#x27;s not a big one, is that my old Braun had a light on the business end</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll first start by saying that I am a male, nineteen years of age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if not more for most of the hair to be picked up.  </li>
            <li>I am a seasoned user of facial wax, so I know that hair removal is not a pain-free process by any means.</li>
            <li>I normally order directly from Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something more efficient in removing short hair and ergonomic, to reach even the more difficult areas.</li>
            <li>I use it only on my arms and it leaves them smooth even when the hair is growing back because it&#x27;s soft hair instead of prickly hair like when you save.</li>
            <li>This is the second one, as the first one was bought a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>Be aware as of this date (12/31/14) there is a discrepancy in Amazon description - between violet and red.  </li>
            <li>It did pretty well, but the cord fell out constantly until I used a hair rubberband to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>But considering how much less hair I now have on my arms and legs, that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>This product is better than the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>but that is small compared to how much better it is.</li>
            <li>So to all the women and men thinking about buying your first epilator, these are my personal experiences and this may help you in your decision making with a epilator.</li>
            <li>It pulls out the hair with the root and the initial pain goes away after the first swipe.</li>
            <li>So loud!</li>
            <li>The second time I used it on areas that were almost unbearable the first time around, and I was prepard for it to hurt, it did not.</li>
            <li>So overall it does exactly what I hoped it would do, and does not irritate my skin like waxing and shaving does.</li>
            <li>When you are a first time epilator, the rolling beads  give you a different sentation and therefore \\&quot;distract\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you.  </li>
            <li>Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you.  </li>
            <li>This time I took a hot shower to open up my pores and of course exfoliated.</li>
            <li>used it the first time last  night.</li>
            <li>My leg hair is fine, and I like shaving less.</li>
            <li>It does get better after a few uses, I promise!</li>
            <li>take a shower first to open the pores, no lotion beforehand, maybe shave the day before so you&#x27;re pulling shorter hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for my legs, I did experience a lot of severe red bumps around my ankles the first time I used this, but they faded after two days</li>
            <li>This is my second epilator the first one I had stop working and decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, which I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>, it used to come back in 2 weeks (still better than coming back the same day with shaving).  </li>
            <li>like they did when they first came on the market way back.</li>
            <li>: they send a small brush with the package,  make sure you use it.</li>
            <li>Most of my ingrown hair occurs where my legs rub together since I usually sit with my legs</li>
            <li>Obviously they were pretty well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is loud!</li>
            <li>It is loud!</li>
            <li>And I was so surprised to have all the hair gone!</li>
            <li>it totally hurts at first</li>
            <li>i use it every other week to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she has to use it more often than her last one,it has 72 tweezers and is no faster than any other brands she has used.</li>
            <li>* Back of knee - Fast!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li>My armpit hair takes a bit more, likely due to the terrain.  </li>
            <li>First, you really need to us it every day for the first few weeks  in order to get maximum results.</li>
            <li>Good price, maybe one day I&#x27;ll buy the cordless, but I have so few hairs left on my legs and underarms, this one will last for years.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li>of course that hurts, but because the head is strong, you do little rounds and you know the hairs are leaving.</li>
            <li>However, I have gotten certain sensitive parts of skin &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the epilator, which sounds extremely painful but was actually not bad--their safety feature stopping the heads from spinning works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it and the only last thing I&#x27;ll say is to clean it out and sort of like use the little white bristle brush thing after every few good rounds with it to get any hair out of the tweezing area.</li>
            <li>I also find it more difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>The more serious ones were very helpful...</li>
            <li>Now I only shave every couple weeks just as a way of exfoliating and if I want an extra clean shave for shorts or a bathing suit day.</li>
            <li>It worked out fine for this product since the cord it comes with is extra long.  </li>
            <li>Something is different in this model because with the older model I never felt any discomfort just a tingling sensation , but with this one I really feel the hair being pulled.</li>
            <li>I used a nail file to smooth it down</li>
            <li>Good price, faster than average, however it is a little louder (probably because it has two heads)</li>
            <li>Also, by experience with wax and other methods, if you never had depilation pulling the hair, when we do the first time can bleed a tiny bit (specially under arms and sometimes bikini area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;d be targeting a specific hair (more on that later) and, after a pass, be thinking that it hadn&#x27;t worked because I didn&#x27;t feel anything, only to be surprised that it was gone.  </li>
            <li>Other epilators have some flexibility in how they make contact with your skin, but this one is just fixed and open faced, so even if there&#x27;s more tweezers</li>
            <li>but they have plenty of the parts to make and fill orders for complete new units.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know, I have an old Philips, I might just go and buy the new version of Philips again</li>
            <li>My old Emjoi was destroyed and I found myself searching for a new epilator.</li>
            <li>Now in comparison to the old one, this new one saves me time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was brave and tried it on my underarms and it was painful.</li>
            <li>I do find that it hurts less than my Remington Smooth and Silky to use tho...</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough to plug in the wall and sit comfortably nearby.  </li>
            <li>; it is so cheaply made compared to my previous Epilator.  </li>
            <li>I probably spent more money on the batteries on the long run.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I missed having a light like my previous one had.  </li>
            <li>It sits easily in your hand, and while the instructions state which way round you&#x27;re supposed to hold it, the shape of the body makes you want to hold it that way anyway.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use on your legs, but you&#x27;ll have to go over the area a few times for it to catch all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is now not painful at all to use on my legs, nor do I get the red bumpy reaction like I initially got.</li>
            <li>At first, I used the red one to start, and finished with the old one and the auxiliary head.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a bit harder to use on your armpits, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li>and I can get his entire back done in 20 to 30 minutes (vs a full hour with the Braun).</li>
            <li>I then, due to very limited success, tried again the next day (greater than 72 hours at that point).  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s nothing special that this does that my other epilator don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>ok so before i bought emjoy i already had braun silk epil which broke down after only two years after i bought it</li>
            <li>the appearance &amp; color is the only positive thing I can tell about this because this is the reason I got it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this about a year ago and there are only positive things to say.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and my skin remains smooth and hair free for at least a week.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from amazon after reading the reviews and deciding that I need to try something new from shaving everyday for keeping my body hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li>It only makes your legs feel smooth if you wait until your hair is very long.  </li>
            <li>If you use one side, it does nothing; if you use both you&#x27;d better be pulling your skin super tight or it will suck in half your face!</li>
            <li>With my previous model, that definitely would have been more like a 30-40 minute job</li>
            <li>I love it because my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for around a week and a half</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would work so much better than the one I was previously using that only had one head.  </li>
            <li>I love only having once a week, and sometimes less in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Also, my previous models were able to remove very short hair.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well and removes the growth quickly without to much trouble.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have very light blond very thin hair, so it&#x27;s not noticeable if I don&#x27;t also shave.  </li>
            <li>I have very course hair on my legs and moderate hair on the rest of my body, and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, the sound was a lot more frightening than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I know this may sound crazy, but it works so well that I almost miss getting to use it more often (being new and all ...)</li>
            <li>The first time I used my other epilator, it really hurt.  </li>
            <li>Some areas obviously are going to be more sensitive than others, though you might be suprised on that subject.</li>
            <li>The very first time I did both legs was uncomfortable, and because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react, I did a separate sitting for each leg.</li>
            <li>I went over an area on my legs 10 times and I could still see a number of full hair strands and many smaller broken hair strands on my red, peeling skin (thanks to the repeated tweezers exposure).</li>
            <li>Because of the large head, it is quicker, and it grabs really short hairs.  </li>
            <li>I believe that depends on the way certain hair types grow back.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi AP-18 tweezers move fast, making the epilation process a lot less uncomfortable, and it grabs the tiniest hairs, so you get a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I do miss the little light on that one,with this one you don&#x27;t need to look.</li>
            <li>A little cheaply made in construction</li>
            <li>I used Aloe Vera Gel afterward to smooth over my thighs; the cooling helped as the skin is a little tingly (again, it would be after waxing too).</li>
            <li>It takes me such a long time to get them completely clean</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough that I can use it while standing/sitting in my bath tub (so I don&#x27;t get hair all on the floor and it makes for easier clean up, I just turn the shower on to rinse away all the hair).</li>
            <li>The settings is either too fast or too slow when it comes to removing the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>With my previous epilator I was not able to stand the pain to do my bikini line or arm pits, with this I can easily do both pain free.</li>
            <li>I have never been bothered by discomfort with depilitating since getting used to original Epilady, but do find the Emjoi causes even less of a pulling sensation.</li>
            <li>So if this is your first I would suggest doing a little every day for the first couple weeks till you get used to it.</li>
            <li>They are a little red and tender, but I am sure it will heal overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something that will work and last for awhile.</li>
            <li>But more importantly for me is that other epilators have caused small cuts on the sensitive skin of my inner thighs.  </li>
            <li>At first, it was a little intimidating because I remember the pain when I first started tweezing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>When you epilate for the first time, do little bits at a time because my body had to adjust when I first epilated.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I have purchased two of these and can say that no other epilator is as reliable or removes as many hairs as efficiently as the Emjoi AP-18.  </li>
            <li>found it to be very sturdy and does exactly as expected as advertised, a little pain but what did you expect :-)  </li>
            <li>Underarms is okay, but whatever surface you use it on has to be one where the large double head can be down in a long stroke.</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s  cost more probably due to a limited market.</li>
            <li>I use this epilator daily (only because I cannot STAND feeling anything but baby butt smooth under my arms and due to my very quick hair growth and hairs having different growth cycles, it is necessary for my sanity).</li>
            <li>Disappointing but not a problem because Amazon is great about returns.</li>
            <li>Some complained about the cord, the cord is plenty long enough, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>- you could prob clear your chest hair in 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li>It also made epilating more painful because it had so many fewer tweezers and the tweezers spun at a slower rate.</li>
            <li>however its amazing for thick coarse hair!!!  </li>
            <li>it removes hair fast but unlike Braun brand, skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft and the hair grow back after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Huge minus is that it leaves short hair untouched.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s taken me 2 weeks, epilating for an hour every 2 days, to clear my legs, underarms, and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Bottoms of my pecs to my bellybutton gradually got more and more painful</li>
            <li>While it takes longer to clear a area then shaving, the area stays clear for 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi one before but it didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers, so it took longer and was more painful to use.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much difference between this product and the old, but they are totally different tools.  </li>
            <li>It took me less than 5 minutes to clean my lower leg.</li>
            <li>And I have noticed that the hair is growing back much slower.  </li>
            <li>I had to use my old epilator to remove the hairs that this one just would not remove.</li>
            <li>The only real issue I had was with in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is so loud.</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I hoped considering the discomfort associated, the process would be fast, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Gone is the rash that I would often get from shaving frequently.  </li>
            <li>As the hair grows back, it creates stubble, which nobody really wants.  </li>
            <li>It does not hurt nearly as much now, as during my initial use.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers DO NOT pull as efficiently as I hoped nor does this thing leave my legs soft.</li>
            <li>but it pulls the hairs and leaves my legs and hairs incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was going to be considerably faster, but nah.</li>
            <li>You have no choice but to buy the parts direct from Emjoi, which means you&#x27;re screwed.</li>
            <li>it is really loud device, if it matters for someone)  - maybe I&#x27;m mistaken, but it seems that it takes out longer hairs than, f.e.</li>
            <li>but I am not a fan of the cost of salon waxing which has burned my sensitive skin on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was expecting far worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old panasanoic took forever to charge and even if the charge wasn&#x27;t out all the way, it started losing power.</li>
            <li>Then, when you&#x27;re ready to use the epilator, take a bath to open the pores.</li>
            <li>Also, I find the underarm hairs that grow back are much lighter, finer &amp; fewer.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing that the hair is growing back much faster</li>
            <li>I then took the head apart (completely apart) and cleaned out the gears from debris.</li>
            <li>The postive reviews are either from people who reviwed too early or people trying to sell this to you.</li>
            <li>I have an old Emjoi Gold Caress since 2002.</li>
            <li>I thought: \\&quot;Wow, it will do the job</li>
            <li>When the hair does grow back, it&#x27;s much much thinner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far on every part of my body</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just using the old one.</li>
            <li>I had an old Emjoi gold caress rechargeable that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>It really took out the hairs quite well without having to go over the same spot repeatedly.</li>
            <li>but my old address was stuck in your computer</li>
            <li>I was really keen on the faster epilation aspect and that decided my purchase, and as others commented, overall it is</li>
            <li>, this has never been a problem with the old models.</li>
            <li>I can do everything quicker than my old emjoi.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to rebuy my old model.</li>
            <li>So far I like this epilator.</li>
            <li>What can I say except that I reordered a 2nd one, because everyone in my family wants to use mine.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because a coworker said that a similar model really works.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work on the peach fuzz on my face, and by using only the front set of tweezers, I think that it pulled them all out.</li>
            <li>I had no redness or irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if it just broke off the fuzz or really pulled it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t, however, use it in *cough, cough* more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li>loud sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t, but it DOES work</li>
            <li>far as the pain issue goes....</li>
            <li>But I have 7 children who are trying to SLEEP at night, so I have to hide in a far corner of the house so as not to keep them up.</li>
            <li>The reason I timed this was because my old epilator took me about 48 minutes to an hour to remove hair from both my legs.  </li>
            <li>so you can imagine the pain of tweezing a hair somewhere sensitive but times a million.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I got several cuts from my Braun epilator in the bikini area, but with this epilator I have absolutely nothing of the sort.</li>
            <li>and this one will last longer because she really likes it.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Braun.</li>
            <li>and i cant imagine that it mihgt be such fast</li>
            <li>Would really like to try the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; system next.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the corded operation, I would prefer cordless and don&#x27;t know how I missed that one detail, however, the AC cord provided for power supply is quite lengthy and does not interfere much.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that could leave my skin feeling soft and wouldn&#x27;t leave bumps on my skin afterward.</li>
            <li>It is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>Its very time consuming to use this one since u have to keep going over the same area over and over again...</li>
            <li>I have very curly chest hair and unless I keep it shaved or trimmed very short, its itches unbearably.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for about two months and while it still stings a bit, the pain has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li>My 10+ years old Emoji epilator, which I hadn&#x27;t treated too well, like</li>
            <li>It was fast and covered a larger area than I was used to.</li>
            <li>This is a plug in unit only, must use a cord.&lt;br /&gt;The return was fast and simple,and credit was within two days.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is the one area where I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit loud...</li>
            <li>thinking I had finally found a product that would help me not have to shave so much.  </li>
            <li>That gave me the idea to compare it to my old epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eighteen years old, and hopefully this review will help you decide whether this product is for you.</li>
            <li>This epilator is twice as fast as the last one I owned.</li>
            <li>A couple months after that I completely quit working.</li>
            <li>but just didnt pull the hairs completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard that pulling the hair out would last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>now i only really shave then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally hairy gal...</li>
            <li>By sensitive</li>
            <li>works really well anywhere else, especially underarms.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was the epilator getting too old</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get used to it, but with each use it&#x27;s much easier than the last.</li>
            <li>since I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I had the smaller one before, but this one is much quicker.</li>
            <li>and now my skin is just softly tingly.</li>
            <li>I personally find waxing these areas to be a nightmare and very hit or miss, and did not want to spend a fortune going to a salon.     </li>
            <li>You have to be in a very well lit room or outside to see the lighter or finer hairs on your legs.</li>
            <li>Hair grows back too fast to invest the time it takes and to put up with the pain.</li>
            <li>it was loud, kept getting louder and stopped working 14 months.</li>
            <li>My old one did.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely unusable now.</li>
            <li>After years of research and hesitation I decided to purchase a replacement for my 14 yr old Braun silk epil.</li>
            <li>It does get much easier if you keep it up because then you&#x27;ll only be covering 1/3-1/2 of your hair.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints nor does my old Braun owe me anything</li>
            <li>My regrowth has been reduced, a lot of the hairs don&#x27;t come back, and the ones that do seem thinner and softer, also, the weekly use in the beginning is now around every two weeks, however, there are the one or two hairs that are fast growers and the ones missed because I can&#x27;t see some areas.</li>
            <li>Also, this is a some what loud device.    </li>
            <li>and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast.</li>
            <li>why I switched all those years ago) is that, over time, the hairs grow back much thinner and weaker.</li>
            <li>In my expericence, this one won&#x27;t completely do that.</li>
            <li>I find I only really have to pass over an area twice to pull almost all of the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the Emoji 18 72 tweezers because my old 48 tweezer just wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use deodorant directly after using this</li>
            <li>Just glide it softly over the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can go by my experience as far as pain level</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, like I do, you may not have any issues with the machine.  </li>
            <li>It is so loud and clunky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of the smaller epilators which were really noisy and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Also, it only works if you hold it absolutely perpendicular to your skin, unlike an electric razor which can go off the 90-degree angle and still work</li>
            <li>I even tried at-home Brazilian waxing to try to get a cleaner hair removal at home without the expense of the professional services every month, all to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I rationalized the expense with the fact that professional leg waxing costs anywhere from $65 to $90 a visit depending on location and full/half leg services.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, for those areas I still use my old emjoi gold since the head is thinner.</li>
            <li>it was fast, removed all my hair and it didnt grow back for a longer time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>It is considerably faster than just one row of tweezers.</li>
            <li>And the thing is loud, like really loud.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is necessary to shorten the hairs and make them much easier for the tweezer heads to grab.  </li>
            <li>I have an old epilator from Braun that I have had for years.  </li>
            <li>Emjoi discourages re-growth of hair, and the hair that does grow back is much sparser.</li>
            <li>5-10 minutes) for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The hair grows in soft so there is no stubble.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kinda loud.</li>
            <li>I think that the bikini area is just a sensitive area</li>
            <li>I am by far no expert on this yet.</li>
            <li>it actually worked really well.  </li>
            <li>but it really just broke off the hair because they were stubbly the next day.  </li>
            <li>No problem so far.</li>
            <li>I have exama and using a regular razor really bothers it</li>
            <li>I AM A VERY HAIRY WOMEN ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER.</li>
            <li>Some people complain about how loud it is.</li>
            <li>So I lifted my shirt, and started near the belly button.</li>
            <li>pain in this is getting the whole tattoo done in one instant.</li>
            <li>and wow does it hurt.</li>
            <li>enough, this one is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think this pulls out hairs that my old braun missed.  </li>
            <li>It makes a loud noise when you turn it on.</li>
            <li>So far, I have done my butt cheeks,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really find that I needed it for this, but you might try it if you&#x27;ve got a low pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with skin irritation either.</li>
            <li>By the third time I was removing hair from areas much faster.  </li>
            <li>I dont agree with people who say in ten minutes they are done with both legs, it takes much longer</li>
            <li>Nowhere near childbirth on my pain scale, but it made my eyes water</li>
            <li>I have been exfoliating nearly every day during my shower to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have been exfoliating nearly every day during my shower to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Just completely unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>but again surprised that I can tolerate it and the pain</li>
            <li>Does not work nearly as well as my thirty dollar cheapo version and removes almost no hair at all.</li>
            <li>It has a rather loud motor</li>
            <li>I had waxed for years, using both professional waxers and a home waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>Instead it takes much longer to cover the same area and often never pulls out all the hairs.</li>
            <li>I am considering returning it for rather than having to use two to complete the job.</li>
            <li>Makes a loud noise</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s loud too, but if it would have worked well</li>
            <li>the old Epilady I had to shave my underarms.</li>
            <li>so I know the next treatment will go much easier.</li>
            <li>I can only stand just so much.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from Emjoi.</li>
            <li>No discomfort (I was pleasantly surprised)</li>
            <li>I think I really did a big favor to myself!</li>
            <li>But I like the convenience of taking it out from the drawer and use it for a few minutes after shower to keep myself hair free.</li>
            <li>Not everyday, but once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>We did not mistreat it in any way, yet now it is completely nonfunctional, no matter what we try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But get it near my ace</li>
            <li>but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears.</li>
            <li>Like my old one, this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing back much finer and slower.  </li>
            <li>When I travel I am able to take it with me, and it only takes a few minutes when I just need a touch up.  </li>
            <li>My only issue with it so far is that for the sensitive underarm area, sometimes I&#x27;ve had to run it over more than twice to get a few remaining stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>Since we are on our second one, we obviously believe it&#x27;s worth it, but I won&#x27;t lie.  </li>
            <li>Only with the Emjoi was I able to stand it long enough to really get the long term effects.  </li>
            <li>The problem was it died after a few months, I got two more emjois and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>It worked...but it took a solid week to build up my tolerance to use it for more than a few seconds in some places.</li>
            <li>The only trouble I had, was reaching the backs of my legs, but with some yoga positions I was able to get everything.  </li>
            <li>Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work good at all.</li>
            <li>The good news is it also gets the short, thin hairs.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the rotating tweezers of many other epilators will grab, pinch, or really irritate the skin if you don&#x27;t ensure that its pulled tight.  </li>
            <li>The growth of hair on my legs is interesting - very few from the calf down, around my knees, and thighs, but somewhat more under and above the back of my knees, but still 1/3 of what was there before I started using the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>The first use was quite intense for me, but that was because I&#x27;ve never epilated before, the second time was way less intense.</li>
            <li>In the end my legs and arms are smooth and the redness disappeared in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li>I have another model of Emjoi which I was pretty happy with, but the one I have has an odd shape and bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li>The bristles need to be about twice as long to clean the catch basin, or at least let me remove the tweezer head barrels to actually clean this thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time it did this the abrasion wasn&#x27;t too severe and having had only positive experiences with Emjoi products, I thought perhaps it was my fault and exercised extra care during my next usage attempts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, if you look at the way the head is designed, it obviously can&#x27;t get right next to your skin because of the way the head is built up around the tweezer wheels, and the wheels themselves are almost concave, so if your legs/underarms/</li>
            <li>would NOT use this on my bikini line as the large head on it doesn&#x27;t lend itself to capturing the hair on anything beyond a relatively flat</li>
            <li>Prior to this I had been using an Epilady Legend (I had it for 4 years before I thought it was becoming less efficient), so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  Motor action feels and sounds the most hollow and rickety compared to other epilators I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>What I mean is I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve smoothness on my legs and knees.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to pull the skin as taut as possible, like other reviewers and the instructions recommended, and that definitely helped.</li>
            <li>It really does take much less time to get my legs done then any epilator I&#x27;ve had previously, and I really was a huge fan.</li>
            <li>And it creates a problem that even if you&#x27;re very hairy and working in a more densely hairy area, this product will leave small fine hairs behind.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi pulled much better and did not tug on hairs but grabbed and pulled them out much more quickly, meaning a much less painful experience.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not a fast epilator, but it gets the job done right.</li>
            <li>At first, I would get little bumps on certain follicles and I almost gave up on it</li>
            <li>Even if they hairs are short, long, fine or coarse.</li>
            <li>Epilator has 2 speeds, one is fast and the other is jet fast...</li>
            <li>From there, I use it less and less now because I don&#x27;t have so much hair any more.</li>
            <li>The product is a bit noisy and it doesn&#x27;t get into small areas easily</li>
            <li>Just remember you can&#x27;t use this one in the shower so you there is a little bit of clean up.</li>
            <li>The item also came with a carry bag and a little brush to clean the tweezer head, the cord, and the cover for the tweezer area.</li>
            <li>Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epliator) because the hair on my legs grows fairly quickly, meaning that the results of shaving don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I am ahead in the long run achieving a positive body image.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive underarm skin and due to shaving, it gets very very irritated and has become discolored.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t meant for a women&#x27;s gentle use area but did well on flat part of shins and calves.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no mess like with home waxing kits.</li>
            <li>No mess no fuss and removes hair from root.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall this happening with the first two I owned, but the last two developed the same problem.  </li>
            <li>it takes far less time and gets all my hair out, for the first time ever I can go 2 weeks or more before shaving again, no more in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I finally broke down and bought a braun after my south american neighbor told me how much better it was than the epilady.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to epilating you will find that you hair really does come back slower and some will not come back again after using awhile.</li>
            <li>I had to use it a few times before getting clean underarms.</li>
            <li>or it is not able to get hold of that fine hair.</li>
            <li>The most recent was purchased on Nov 17, 2014, which equates to approximately less than 3 months of regular use before they have crapped out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper</li>
            <li>i only tried this one because it&#x27;s suppose have more tweezers than my  Panasonic ES2045P Wet Dry Epiglide Epilator.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this probably pissed me off the most.</li>
            <li>Also, Emjoi sells a Black version for \\&quot;Men\\&quot; - don&#x27;t bother, the Red one works perfectly fine, and it was $40 cheaper.    </li>
            <li>Takes just as long and just as difficult around Binet areas.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for underarms and bikini areas.</li>
            <li>I have seriously never seen a bigger wimp!</li>
            <li>Purchased this same one for the second time as the first broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and I was loosing the battle of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I miss about my old epilator is that it had a light on it... but who needs a light to search for hairs left behind when there aren&#x27;t any?</li>
            <li>However I would not recommend this one to a newbie, the first time is torture enough without 72 tweezers pulling at the same time.    </li>
            <li>I was initially going to complain about how long it took to get my emagine, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This particular model basically has two heads and the tweezers go opposite directions.  </li>
            <li>The only epilator I used before is the classic coil one (my mom got me into it).  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and not exactly slight).</li>
            <li>The product was totally worth it though , it works quickly and you may have to do it several times to get all the hair , but it keeps hair away for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re a guy and your significant other doesn&#x27;t care for hair in various places, this will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>As in it is supposed to be held a certain way to go against the hair follicles a certain way but not really anything different than how you would shave or wax, etc.</li>
            <li>And under the right conditions, it will pull the hairs faster than the other Epilators.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this epilator, but now I&#x27;m back to waxing.</li>
            <li>my estitician gives A+ service, this epilator gives a low A to high A-.</li>
            <li>Taking 30 minutes is actually probably a high estimate.</li>
            <li>Braun comes with a built in smartlight which was actually very helpful in spotting short or very light, thin hairs.</li>
            <li>Consistent use of the Emjoi will keep you smooth longer and longer, and take less and less time to use.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a shaver attachment because my old one had one, as well as a plastic piece to put on the shaver that trimmed your hair to a shorter length that was still long enough for the epilator to easily grab it, but not too long that it pulled more than it needed to, and I think that was helpful.</li>
            <li>The only reason I switched is because I thought more tweezer heads would mean less time, but I can see it would take me many times as long with this product.</li>
            <li>The next time was MUCH better, to get the little ones missed which grew up about 4days later.</li>
            <li>girlfriend has had major problems with ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>I had this machine for just over one year before it stopped working - given that this is one of the more expensive epilators, I was expecting something a little more durable.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the smaller Emjoi to get to my bikini, underarms and facial hair a little better.  </li>
            <li>This epilator really saves your time,will not hurt much and less or no ingrown hair problem</li>
            <li>My legs, left razor-blade smooth in record time, I kept turning around, half expecting the cops to pull me over for speeding.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done this personally, as I mentioned, I will tolerate less than smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>easy to do the arms and legs with only some pain after you get used to epilating a few times&lt;</li>
            <li>In comparison with my old Braun, the new epilator is pretty slow and doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair very well.</li>
            <li>The other disadvantage of design of this product is that it is not possible to open the case easily to fix it.</li>
            <li>After reading such positive reviews I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase and haven&#x27;t looked back since!</li>
            <li>After shaving it would take longer and possibly would be more painful as there will be more hair to &amp;#</li>
            <li>I recommend starting on the lower speed, even though it may be more painful, you will get better results.</li>
            <li>Suprisingly, that didn&#x27;t hurt so much as afterward, as would any minor abrasion or razor nick.</li>
            <li>It took 4 hours just to do the legs, but again, I often had let it go so long that my legs were really hairy.  </li>
            <li>* Ankle (those long hairs that I always miss with the razor and would shred myself if I tried to get) - took seconds to do and was so fast there was no pain (0).</li>
            <li>those 7 first tries...</li>
            <li>my first experience with epilating)*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself a day between receiving it and using it...for mental preparation.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for girls with dark hair like me.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it to my leg, I was braced for the pain I expected to follow.</li>
            <li>Then I became ambitious and tried to epilate again as there was not much hair there.  </li>
            <li>I do sometimes epilate my legs because the hair comes back thinner, but I don&#x27;t normally do my legs--maybe once every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Sure takes a lot longer than a regular razor since you have to pass over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li>Hurts the first time, but I expected that.</li>
            <li>Feeling accomplished, I reach down to rub what I assume will be a smooth, though very red, leg, only to find that it only removed about 70% of the hair.  </li>
            <li>The machine is not very efficient, it takes a long time to clean the hair.</li>
            <li>I used lotion, and creams to calm it down, but it was no use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly return this within the next two weeks; and will probably go for another Braun, but a corded model this time since their epilators seem to actually work well.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that I expected a little more from emjoi.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and I don&#x27;t get all the little red bumps I used to get.  </li>
            <li>Since it has almost twice as many tweezers as other epilators it works a lot faster and hurts a lot less.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she has always used one of the Braun products but they just didn&#x27;t last, between her and my 2 17 yr old daughters, it broke down too quickly.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and after I paid to ship it back to them, they replaced it with a new one.</li>
            <li>Since I thought the same thing might happen to a new one, I waited until we moved back to the US to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I dont expect this to last for years but for the price I&#x27;ll buy new ones as they die.</li>
            <li>so I finally decided to try something new -- this epilator.</li>
            <li>it was 7 days ago and have not noticed ANY new hair growth after the last session (remember your hair grows in cycles, so it takes about a week to get all of it</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I recently lost my optima but also assumed this must be a new and improved version since it&#x27;s been almost 5 years.</li>
            <li>I live that it plugs into the wall because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it losing power in the middle of de-hairing myself.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute little bag too!!!</li>
            <li>Over time I got more comfortable with the pain of tattooing, and I knew this thing couldn&#x27;t hurt that bad.</li>
            <li>The double heads actually do remove the hair more efficiently than my previous epilator that only had the one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s gotten used to the slight bit of &#x27;pain&#x27; from the tweezing action, and said it&#x27;s a lot less work than waxing was.  :)</li>
            <li>and dry off really well.</li>
            <li>As far as pain goes, yeah, it hurts, but less and less each time, and pain is beauty as my grandma likes to say. :)</li>
            <li>Unlike that one, this Emjoi is less painful and I am able to finish shaving my legs with much fewer passes (I suspect because it has more tweezers).  </li>
            <li>No matter which brand you buy, if you do it at least once a week, it will go fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>One leg took me a long time but ONLY because it was my first time.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of reviews (mostly for the Braun 5270) &amp; besides the pain a lot of women complained about, I had gotten the idea that you only had to use the epilator once every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>It did take a while to epilate both of my legs the first time (at least an hour), but after the first time it goes by a lot quicker.</li>
            <li>This replaced my old one (15-18 years old) and is a big improvement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention, even after I spend forever trying to get rid of the hairs and it finally gets a few, my legs do not feel smooth AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I will likely buy a smaller epilater for  my face if I feel that it really is removing that fuzz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These would be much better suited to have at least brass gearing to stand up to dude hairs with regular use (</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t chew on my armpits like my (previous) inexpensive tweezer did, and that&#x27;s worth the price upgrade alone.</li>
            <li>I thought I don&#x27;t really need such a big epilator for my face</li>
            <li>, what I heard from others was that it only took a few strokes for this device to get all of your hairs and leave you with smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I like using epilators because they are cheaper than waxing in the long run, and you get to the point, after consistently using it on an area, that you only have to do a touch up here or there</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth after use and the hair takes a few weeks to grow back.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that with regular use the pain is minimal and worth it for the result.</li>
            <li>I use it about every 6 weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than regular shaving, but your skin feels much softer than when using a razor.</li>
            <li>They work about the same, but without such a high price tag!</li>
            <li>( I initially did it in straight lines and all that happened was red irritated skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Braun Epilator finally died - it was old, probably 15, maybe even 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>Hair grows back 3 to 4 weeks later and much much thinner.</li>
            <li>The hair on my shoulders/arms is quite thick, and this took it out EASILY.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy guy with about 2-3 hairs hairs growing out of many of my hair follicles, I bought this epilator to remove the rather thick, coarse hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;Painful</li>
            <li>It is too thick for the upper lip, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get used to the pain on that area.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the corded models because (a) batteries create waste and (b) batteries lose charge quickly in a device like this.  </li>
            <li>I find it fun to use which might sound weird</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very exciting to know that my legs are virtually hair free and that I no longer need to be embarrassed due to poor shaving.</li>
            <li>and I thought something good, but I made a huge mistake this is not really a good one.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very slow!</li>
            <li>The reality is that this one is far less precise than the single tweez.</li>
            <li>use it all over upper and middle body as far down as the top of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is a little intense to start with</li>
            <li>Having a hard time waxing myself, I decided to purchase a couple epilators: a small one for the bikini (great product:&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover) and a bigger one for the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said for the price of a single wax or thereabouts this is a reasonable tool for its purpose</li>
            <li>Yes, the girly area hurt like a mo-fo the first time, but just like other reviews claimed</li>
            <li>They were bare and smoother than I ever remember them being!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to razors, so I have no other choice but to do depilation.</li>
            <li>Nothing major, but this emjoi epilator is so painfree</li>
            <li>I had these small patches of hair on my lower-mid back and within minutes the Emjoi devoured the hair and left my skin smooth as a baby!  </li>
            <li>As time went by, the motor got weak and the faster speed was the better choice.</li>
            <li>I saw on some other reviews there were remarks on pain at first...</li>
            <li>Like I said, nothing major.</li>
            <li>The blond hairs on my upper lip are pretty short, so I couldn&#x27;t get them all (plus I have a monroe piercing above one side and didn&#x27;t feellike taking it out)</li>
            <li>I epilated 3 days after first time due to the difference in hair growth and that lasted 6 days.  </li>
            <li>those of you expecting \\&quot;good\\&quot; results froma small, one-time expense as opposed to the regular expense of waxing to get \\&quot;great\\&quot; results - this product is a dream come true!</li>
            <li>I just ordered a new emjoi product since my old one broke after a long time of use.  </li>
            <li>Once again, I have spent many hours reading hundreds of reviews, and based on the reviews, have (once again) narrowed it down to the same Emjoi, or one of the Braun models.  </li>
            <li>My advise would be to get professionally waxed first and then epilate as hairs regrow, it would hurt way less than if you just do it after having shaved for years.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel like some hairs get broken, so there&#x27;s pretty quick re-growth still.</li>
            <li>This is NOWHERE near as painful as repeated waxing (which I did get used to over several sessions); epilating with this machine is more like having someone lightly scratch me with their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be better about pulling out hair, but I still need to do a second round later in the day or the next day, to get the stray hairs that it missed.  </li>
            <li>Think about it - Who in their right mind would subject themselves to something like this?</li>
            <li>The skin is not as smooth as it would be if you were waxing your body, but it is much easier to use and way less messy.</li>
            <li>I have taken the Bruan Epil 7 Epilator into the shower (because it is completely water proof, which this emjoi is NOT), and it really feels the same as dry epilating.  </li>
            <li>found shaving after left me with less ingrown hairs and left my legs incredibly smooth</li>
            <li>And forget the whole bit about lifting up short and flat hairs..</li>
            <li>I only wish is was half as powerful as my old one.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to get this and was so excited that it only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li>have used epilators for over 20 years and my older ones lasted a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that large at all.</li>
            <li>I was red raw by the time I&#x27;d managed to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>I rarely need to use it on my under arms any longer, as so little hair grows there now.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it and totally recommend it to any one who is a serious epilater.</li>
            <li>It will hurt less and less the more you use it.</li>
            <li>But, I know it&#x27;ll hurt less and less the more I use</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m not convinced spending the extra money on this particular model for the extra tweezers</li>
            <li>It took me a third of the time doing my entire legs compared with my epilady, granted it was an older one, so the motor did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t all that coarse, it&#x27;s fine; but I couldn&#x27;t understand how that would wear down this little machine so much?</li>
            <li>I love that it pulls the hair from the root, no more stubble!!  </li>
            <li>The charging function was kind of ridiculous because you never knew how long the charge would last</li>
            <li>I had used the Braun for several years and loved it, but like many other users, was frustrated with how long it took to epilate my legs.  </li>
            <li>After reading more about it, I figured I certainly couldn&#x27;t go wrong with almost double the number of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>3/4 of my leg was hair-free, the other 1/4 had stubble where the hair either broke off, or I just didn&#x27;t have it at the right angle to pull it out efficiently enough.</li>
            <li>I will say though, that the growth that does come in the course of the week is pretty hard to see, unless someone is really looking for it.  </li>
            <li>It is just a little unpleasant at first, not painful, but once you go over your skin a couple of times, you are ok with it.</li>
            <li>I have mostly fine blonde hair on my legs and a very few darker hairs on my shins.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction or more obvious on my skin because I&#x27;m downright pale, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive</li>
            <li>I have had a Braun epilator for years that is painful, but does a great job at ripping out the hair roots.</li>
            <li>Some spots are so painful that you need to go to your happy place to get through it.</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research before deciding to buy an epilator in general, and then before choosing this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I hunted all over Amazon, hair forums, and general google searches.</li>
            <li>5318.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some general comments:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>, I wanted my hair removed and it was, just not as smoothly, gentle, and long lasting as the manufacturer&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li>So if you go in the opposite direction (as if you were shaving), it clearly breaks off the hairs instead of pulls them by the root.  </li>
            <li>Getting the small hairs takes so much time that it negates the amount of time you thought you saved when working in the very hairy area.   </li>
            <li>That was not good because now the whiskers were coming in more  and were white.  </li>
            <li>Also realize that the first time you use it, it will be torture (unless you&#x27;re used to waxing); but before too long it&#x27;ll be just a minor discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It does not last as long as waxing, but very close</li>
            <li>It takes too many passes to do my legs completely bare, and then I have to do it again soon to get the hairs that were just broken off, not plucked.</li>
            <li>BUT REALLY, IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIMER, IT WILL HURT at least the 1st 5</li>
            <li>But because I&#x27;ve been yanking hair out from its roots for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hates razor stubble or the pain of waxing because it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, unless you&#x27;re really sensitive.  </li>
            <li>but now I barely notice the pain when I do it.</li>
            <li>SO far I have only used it on my legs,</li>
            <li>The head is detachable for easier cleaning if you wish, and comes off as a completely separate unit, with no internal working exposed on either the body or the head when it is removed.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll placed teeth, this barely catches any hairs on curvy surfaces like knees or chin.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the men&#x27;s one is the same and you should save money and just buy this version.</li>
            <li>--I apparently didn&#x27;t have the pain tolerance to use it, and so I returned it.</li>
            <li>It barely grabbed ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li>So far today I only done one leg!</li>
            <li>And its just like mowing a tall grass lawn: don&#x27;t do it while its wet and don&#x27;t move the device fast, or you&#x27;ll miss some hairs and burn out the engine.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful to try this on my underarms because it had always been way too rough for me</li>
            <li>and it disappeared for a while to come back as whiskers in my old age and not just as a mustache but whiskers on my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get far since it was leaving my skin with red bumps ,blotchy patches and bleeding hair</li>
            <li>Now this product is making a squeaking noise and barely turns....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done my arms, so far.</li>
            <li>AP-18 last May after my old epilator (Braun) bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and coarse hair</li>
            <li>The wide head makes fast work  of what I find to be a chore.</li>
            <li>Everything I had tried irritated my eczema further and caused flair-ups - shaving with a razor, shaving with an electric shaver, neet, the sandpaper type leg-hair remover, home waxing...until I began getting professional leg-waxing.  </li>
            <li>My old emjoi epilator broke several years ago.  </li>
            <li>Your hairs grow back soft</li>
            <li>but i never expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>It barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li>I made an attempt at my knees, but the curved bony area didn&#x27;t take well to the Emjoi, it barely removed any hair.  </li>
            <li>The inside was tender, but no where near as tender as the outside calf.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it didn&#x27;t seem to get the hair that was near the bony areas of my legs(shins and knees)too</li>
            <li>I am surprised how well it works and definitely wish I would have gotten one sooner.</li>
            <li>I am a 19 year old male</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a complete elimination of shaving, but I only have to shave once a week.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have tried so far, so</li>
            <li>After my old epilator&#x27;s sudden death I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I replaced it with the same brand I have been using for decades, an Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I have used several kinds of epilators, home wax kits, gotten professionally waxed etc for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Took too much time &amp; didn&#x27;t get the results expected.  </li>
            <li>I shaved them and they&#x27;re soft again , my hair hasn&#x27;t grown back , and no bumps.</li>
            <li>So I was not at all surprised that this epilator didn&#x27;t last a year...</li>
            <li>Naturally hairy female</li>
            <li>I can barely stand using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be the only thing that outweighs my old epilator.</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a replacement to my old Emjoi that finally gave out after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use blades or shaving cream for my underarms because they are extra sensitive</li>
            <li>I spent weeks researching different epilators since this would be my first one.</li>
            <li>, you DO need to go over some areas repeatedly, and you need your significant other to do your center of your back and upper back as you can&#x27;t really reach it yourself.    </li>
            <li>Sorry about that, it&#x27;s just an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It takes way too many passes for something with 72 tweezers to grab hairs and even then, it does a poor job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of wearing pants that cover my legs during the summer and not being able to wear tank tops</li>
            <li>It did pull out some of the hairs, but for the most part, it snapped the hairs instead, leaving me worse off then when shaving.  </li>
            <li>I need to use it that often because it leaves so many hairs behind.</li>
            <li>It does not pick up hair on one pass, takes 5-7 passes and even then most of hair are broken off instead of pulled from the root.</li>
            <li>THIS EMJOI IS OKAY FOR THICKER HAIR, BUT WHEN IT IS THIN (LIKE MINE IN MY LEGS), THE EPILATOR DOESN&#x27;T PULL THEM OUT FROM THE ROOT BUT CUTS THEM..</li>
            <li>I love this product , I hate doing waxing looking for something like this product, at the same time  not a razor, this works like a magic, just a note use it after you take a bath.</li>
            <li>drawback with the Emjoi is that is not great around contours like around the knees, the Epilady works better in that area.</li>
            <li>Mine also came with a sweet little carrying bag (for travel) with a plastic divider inside in the center and a little brush to help clean the tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It runs a little more than the Braun one that I had in the past, but when you consider that a leg wax is $50+ it pays for itself by the second use, on the first use if you also normally wax your arms or any other area.  </li>
            <li>I finally went back over the area with my inexpensive old Braun silk epi 3 which is on its last legs after years of use, and it still got the hairs this new one missed repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>By morning, there were NO little red dots on my legs.</li>
            <li>I did not find it any less painful or more effective, and it was just easier for me to epilate outside of the bath.</li>
            <li>This new one is much larger and can cover a larger surface area.</li>
            <li>Hurts much less than my old emjoy and is so much faster to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement, as a matter of fact, it removes even less hair than my old standby.  </li>
            <li>Keeping the lip and chin smooth has been a challenge for me, but no more!</li>
            <li>As women, I think we&#x27;ve all played around with epilators, and the love/hate division is right down the middle.</li>
            <li>On that note, it took me about 2 hours in total to epilate my full legs and entire bikini area the first time; but as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve spent only a few minutes each week maintaining since then.   </li>
            <li>I have owned an epilator for a few years and have had good success with it until more recently when I started to get nasty red bumps on my legs every time I epilate.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it it worked as good, maybe slightly better than the bruan, but even after only a few uses I could tell the piece of crap was breaking down.</li>
            <li>It hurt much less than I thought it would when I first used it.</li>
            <li>And after the first month it works even less,  even after being cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I called in and the lady told me to use a little rubbing alcohol, and that worked a little better.</li>
            <li>as I said, I&#x27;ve used 3 other models consistently over the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s my first one, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any louder or quieter than other brands, but there is definitely a</li>
            <li>Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li>Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li>takes many passes in the same area to get all the hairs and after a year it became so weak that it stops working when you push it against the skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, and I tried following the directions and all advice I could get from other reviews.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to get some of that loose skin stretched nice and tight or you may tweeze off a bit of flesh.</li>
            <li>Not knowing how long the hairs had to be (ok, .4mm, but seriously, who can measure that?)</li>
            <li>It works well if you are mainly using it for legs and arm, but a little too wide for small areas &amp; doesn&#x27;t perform as effectively as on the larger areas.</li>
            <li>4/5 because it is harder to do it in certain places and you have to go through the same spot over and over.</li>
            <li>Also, up until the last month or so, when the hair on my legs grew back, it was always soft and I could barely feel it,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the other epilator brands, but this one works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It is so much faster than the Braun or Epilady and grabs the hairs that the other epilators missed.  </li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, the thing hurt so much, I was hopping from one foot to the other while trying to remove my underarm hair.</li>
            <li>The sensation is a little like a light electric zap, not really like a pinch.  </li>
            <li>The whole process now turned into a disaster, with me spending 40 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li>All other areas of my body have responded much faster.</li>
            <li>Yes, it really does work extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I din&#x27;t believe it takes so much of time when I read other reviews.</li>
            <li>and possibly a whole lot of other folks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just so much faster and easier than any other methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of this and other epliators, I was a bit worried that it would hurt too much.  </li>
            <li>(I thought this as someone who had waxed in the past) but this actually hurt more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Few tips - make sure to stretch the skin to help reduce pain and try to do it after a shower so that the hair is a little easier to pull out.</li>
            <li>But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Product lasts a long time without damaging your skin (as razors do) or becoming dull</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, so I can only compare it to conventional women&#x27;s shaving, but I have to say I am SOLD.  </li>
            <li>Waxing of course is a little messy and a little more time consuming, but the real downfall was that you have to let your hair growout before you can do it again!</li>
            <li>My legs responded the same way that they do to a professional leg waxing as far as my skin is concerned and my eczema seems to be remaining unaffected!  </li>
            <li>Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though a lot of people will try to persuade you that a wet epilator would 1) hurt less 2) be easier to clean, i think both claims are misleading.</li>
            <li>Recently, however, I noiced that it is not picking up short fine hairs and is now missing the long, coarser hairs as well.  </li>
            <li>It does leave the area red and sensitive for a short time.  </li>
            <li>It is also simply too big to get anywhere near the bikini line.</li>
            <li>Direction seemed hair dependent - sometimes I&#x27;d have no success for several passes going in the growth direction, then I&#x27;d go against the growth and get it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, last but not least, the cord is really long, which is</li>
            <li>Since my old epilator was so, well, old, I expected technology would have improved this devices.</li>
            <li>I found that no matter how much time I spent on each leg there were always patches of hair left over.</li>
            <li>Not having the finances or local resources (only one place near me does it</li>
            <li>After several failed reattempts at starting and screaming like my 3-year old child mid-tantrum, my husband came to make sure I was still alive.  </li>
            <li>It is not going to hurt as much to pull out 1/4 inch of hair line as it would doing the entire 1 1/2 (or so) inch wide head.</li>
            <li>Minor discomfort the first time, but considering I did almost every area, it wasn&#x27;t at all as I had expected.</li>
            <li>I am now concerned that it will take my legs a LONG time to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; if they do at all.  </li>
            <li>I am now concerned that it will take my legs a LONG time to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; if they do at all.  </li>
            <li>that extra service that you&#x27;re actually paying for when you see a professional.</li>
            <li>This is the first Epilator I have purchased, so I felt it was unfair to give it a full 5 stars, since I had nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work decently on my bikini line, but I could just use my EpiSlim there, so that&#x27;s not much of a saving</li>
            <li>This works great on my mix of thin and thick hairs.  </li>
            <li>Pulls out the hair fast, I use the highest speed and because it pulls so many hairs out at once, so quickly, it seems less painful..</li>
            <li>so I only used it once, but I knew that with the pain of childbirth behind me and being used to leg waxing, I should now be able to handle epilation without a problem.  </li>
            <li>For me, I can use the emjoi in about 1/4 the time, and the time savings is definitely worth the few tiny hairs that remain.  </li>
            <li>I found them very forgiving in terms of how they had to be held against the skin, and how fast or slow you had to move them around on your skin.</li>
            <li>I had little hairs grow back right away</li>
            <li>I loved it for my bikini line and other sensitive areas because it was easy and no mess like waxing, but it would leave it with the worst ingrown hairs ever despite exfoliating, ingrown hair pads etc etc.</li>
            <li>Where is the progress in technology?&lt;br /&gt;It has a hard time grabing onto the hair, requiring more passes over the skin &amp; consequently I end up spending as much time, if not more, than with my last Braun Silk Epil</li>
            <li>This little device works really well!</li>
            <li>While using this does mean a bit if pain the results are well worth the discomfort!  </li>
            <li>IMMENSE amounts of pain while barely leaving evidence of said torture!  </li>
            <li>I did not have to shave the next day and that was a major improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did hurt a little the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>its still a little stuby the first use.</li>
            <li>It hurt a little bit the first time.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does sting a little the first time</li>
            <li>First time removal of facial hair will be painful but effective, it gets easier after the second time.</li>
            <li>It might be because I have a high pain tolerance as people state, but I never really thought I did.</li>
            <li>While researching my next model, I found most epilator reviews ridiculous and unhelpful!</li>
            <li>but since i am asian with wheatish complexion and black hair its pretty visible.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not really sure but is better than shaving and having the hair showing after less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>When I finally decided I was sick of how long it took with my old Philips (which, compared to the Braun it replaced, I&#x27;ve never been terribly happy with) and came to amazon to pick up the optima, I found this improved model and pounced on it.</li>
            <li>Mine grows fast enough in a day to shave everyday, but may have been a little short for a true trial.  </li>
            <li>Also, on the more painful spots I would go over quickly a couple of times, so the pain was in short bursts rather than constant.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews prior to buying the product so I would have a general idea of what to expect.</li>
            <li>hahaha like its not worth it at all</li>
            <li>I only have to use mine every 3-5 days to have bare underarms all the time.</li>
            <li>Barely noticed the occasional sting.</li>
            <li>This product takes twice as long to depilate as the old one.</li>
            <li>And I figured the dual head action would speed up the epilation, considering my biggest gripe is how long epilation</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the only epilator I have used on my face that does not hurt a lot, especially in the sensitive area above the lip.</li>
            <li>It took me just as long to epilate as with my old one (Braun SE 5 series.)  </li>
            <li>: I have been a long time epilator and have a 2.5yr old Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle.</li>
            <li>It’s just that they both had a very short life apparently.</li>
            <li>And when your leg hair grows back, you can barely see it.  </li>
            <li>it sounds loud and scary.my hair wasnt even long.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying some numbing spray and using that the first few times.</li>
            <li>I have to go over the same spot on my legs slowly and several times to get them really smooth</li>
            <li>it hurt the first few times, but you got used to it &amp; it stopped hurting.</li>
            <li>Now I know some people complained about they wish it was cordless but truely corded will keep its power.</li>
            <li>I believe the results are worth the small amount of pain endured.</li>
            <li>The phrase &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; came to mind a few times during my first use.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>you buy it, take care not to press firmly and brace yourself for that first 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure now if it was worth</li>
            <li>I did shave first then use the epilator everyday to get used to it</li>
            <li>But with either epilating or waxing, the hair is obviously pulled out completely, so when they do grow back, the end is a fine tip that isn&#x27;t nearly as irritating.  </li>
            <li>I can get a smooth leg just by shaving in less time with less hassle.  </li>
            <li>Hair grows much faster on legs from the knee down.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better,less painful, and very easy.</li>
            <li>It is becoming more bearable with each use, and I really less painful than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Sure, it hurts less, but that&#x27;s because it only pulls out a few hairs at a time!  </li>
            <li>The head is big enough for some major coverage too.</li>
            <li>me preface to say that I&#x27;m not a very hairy girl, and I&#x27;m actually lucky in the leg hair arena that it&#x27;s only dark below my knees.  </li>
            <li>and it is well worth a little bit of discomfort (in the beginning) for long term results.</li>
            <li>, the pain is less the second time, significantly less the third time and pretty much non-existent thereafter.  </li>
            <li>My Silk epilator has a small light near the head that clearly illuminates the fine hairs that are otherwise very difficult to see, even in a well lit room.</li>
            <li>But if you are working in an area where there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair, it has a hard time picking up the fine single hairs.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to keep your skin taut and don&#x27;t push it down hard on your skin.</li>
            <li>This new one is so great and MUCH less painful.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned before the first use is the most painful.</li>
            <li>I typically exfoliate once every three days, just to prevent ingrown hairs (I am very prone to them).</li>
            <li>It is sooooo much faster, you will finish in half the time.</li>
            <li>It works so much faster than the previous model.  </li>
            <li>Keeping up on the hair removal makes it so much faster and easier and there is noticeably less regrowth over time.</li>
            <li>MUCH FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY OWNED EMJOI.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer to take off hair and it doesn&#x27;t take off as much hair as it used to so overall, not worth my time anymore</li>
            <li>Over all, it seems to be well built and will hopefully last as long as my old Emjoi and Braun.</li>
            <li>It is loud enough that I do have to turn up the volume if I&#x27;m watching TV while I epilate, but not nearly as loud as say, a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I figured that even though it might hurt, with 72 pairs of tweezers, at least it will be over quickly.</li>
            <li>After the first few months my hair is growing back finer.</li>
            <li>There was very slight and bearable pain when I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>Even doing it once a week is thrilling for me compared to daily shaving and still not smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the epilator I only took off a few hairs then put it away while trying to get up my nerve.</li>
            <li>If you do that, then just a few hairs will grow back at first, and you can epilate them out without the torture of tearing ALL of them out at once.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt at first, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>My legs had a few days worth of razor stubble on them, so the hair wasn&#x27;t really long.  </li>
            <li>I loved it but within 60 days the one small plastic cog that joined the head to the body(motor)had broken and the epilator was unusable.</li>
            <li>Quick passes, slow passes.  </li>
            <li>The thick hairs hurt the most coming out hands down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However i have read hundreds of reviews and if my old eppi is anything to go by with a single tweezer head</li>
            <li>It hurts, that&#x27;s for sure - but no more than waxing and it hurts my wallet considerably less than waxing!</li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as shaving but my leg hair is noticeably thinned (at least 70 percent!).  </li>
            <li>when I first held it against my skin it stung a little but that last for only a second.  </li>
            <li>My back would actually hurt from doing it to long with my old one.</li>
            <li>However, after the first couple of shaves, I only have to shave my legs &amp; underarms about once a week to get the few hairs that grew in since the last shave.  </li>
            <li>and it was still painful but not bad since I was too buzzed to really care haha).</li>
            <li>Normally, I would have to shave every other day so this has been a time saver for me.</li>
            <li>but the second time I used it (which was 2 glorious, itch free WEEKS) I could hardly feel it!  </li>
            <li>I used it on my legs and arms and it took less then ten minutes, and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>now I notice not only less hair growth, but it is much thinner..</li>
            <li>It took me a solid half hour on each leg, but I really wanted to be thorough.  </li>
            <li>its easy to use, especially over time as your leg hair starts to thin out.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super thick or coarse or anything; its medium hair.</li>
            <li>If you have deep, coarse, hard rooted guy hair, you are going to tire of the pain and repetition quickly.</li>
            <li>Even after I got used to it, the areas around my ankles and knees were always the most sensitive, but not so bad with this new model.</li>
            <li>having spent so much for this I expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Especially for the armpits, it just makes all the hair grow at least 3x slower and when it does grow back it isn&#x27;t an issue waiting for it to get long enough to epilate again since it&#x27;s so light now.</li>
            <li>Not long ago I went to a local laser hair removal tech to get an estimate on getting my back and shoulders done.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that if your hair is not long enough it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Which is fine but a pain in the behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to Epilators so for me there was absolutely no pain as I&#x27;ve read in reviews for other epilators, but those people may be using them for the first time.  </li>
            <li>overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy this emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months if you use it as heavily as I do.</li>
            <li>overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy this emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months if you use it as heavily as I do.</li>
            <li>The gear in the handheld part driving the head is the weak point, Don&#x27;t expect more than 3-4 years from this machine as the gear starts slipping and eats itself up.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on I jumped a little!  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, the noise was a little intimidating, but no longer!</li>
            <li>Even when it was working I found it broke off more hairs than it pulled, the large head made it difficult to get into tight areas such as my pits and bikinis line.</li>
            <li>Even though the Emagine looks large and heavy, it&#x27;s not at all.</li>
            <li>You will have to wait for hair to grow long enough and you will have to use this often, consistently and after several weeks of using this for 45 minutes or longer sessions, you will find that the hair is sparser and less course.</li>
            <li>After only a few months and only a few uses it no longer pulls out my hairs easily.</li>
            <li>well, I was gritting my teeth and ready to scream, but as I saw this little contraption spinning around and ripping my leg hairs out, I sucked up the pain and pushed forth.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get it all done, but my skin is so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>In its defense ... I do have very fine hair, but again it is performing worse than other epilator</li>
            <li>But it is true that it hurts less and less with each use.  </li>
            <li>I would put this upwards of a 4 on the pain level for as little as I got done; the machine really was too big to get any closer than the outer edges of the bikini area.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short</li>
            <li>It leaves little bumps for a few hours but the next day your skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always started at my ankles and worked my way up because it hurts the least there and a little more the further you get up your legs, and when I started at my ankle there was almost no pain.</li>
            <li>Up near the \\&quot;bum\\&quot; on the backs of my thighs (where the \\&quot;seat\\&quot; and thigh meet) was a little sensitive; that&#x27;s probably a solid 3 for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very loud it drowns out every other noise you may have going in the room.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Emojoi only came with the cord and a cleaning brush, but considering I never once used the other attachments provided from Braun, Emojoi wins this catagory as well - less is sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but to me that would be throwing good money after the bad.</li>
            <li>Love it,not painful at all,and it is very fast.only prob is that the package says it has a shaving attachment</li>

            <li> but* I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it pulled my skin in with the hairs.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been doing epilators for a while, so the hairs are use to being pulled out, but the difference is so impressive!  </li>
            <li> Great epilator!</li>

            <li> My cost/benefit analysis saw this as the best option.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> So this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.</li>

            <li> love this!!!!</li>
            <li> After researching online looking for the best one, I decided to purchase this one, the Emjoi Emagine.</li>
            <li> The best I have used - bar none!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it can also be used on lip and chin!</li>
            <li> it is the best epilator I have tried so far,totally beat out the Braun silk epilator 7.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with it!</li>
            <li> EPILATE LOL!!! .&lt;br</li>
            <li> After weeks of research online and talking with others, I thought this would be the best purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was impressed by the 72 tweezer system.</li>
            <li> It is the best.</li>
            <li> Happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I researched to see which epilator would be the best</li>
            <li> They were wonderful.</li>
            <li> I got this product in perfect time.</li>
            <li> I Think it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it over all types of skin and it has performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!</li>
            <li> BEST PURCHASE I&#x27;VE</li>

            <li> perfect.  </li>
            <li> Best Epi ever.</li>
            <li> of this considered, I will change my rating to 4 stars since this does work wonderfully on my legs.</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate pain and have tougher skin this would work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li> so I am impressed with that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either increasing the width of the gears or improving materials would make this the best epilator we have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 5 years now and it still works great!</li>
            <li> This Epilator was rated number one for best buy when I went on line to find the best Epilator for 2015.  </li>

            <li> This works great!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of thinking it would be the best epilator out there!</li>
            <li> Great quality!</li>
            <li> I have to apply a mix of vitamin E oil and tea tree oil (anti-bacterial) to the aggravated area for days and still do not look flawless for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Great, works as described!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Emjoi Emagine!!</li>
            <li> lol!</li>
            <li> Best investment you can make for women!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator ever!</li>
            <li> It is perfect!</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but the end product wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best epilator ever!  </li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> At about 1/4&amp;#34; in length I thought it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> It works best for my underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the supplier.</li>
            <li> I read a blog pertaining to epilators being a girl&#x27;s best friend and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> This was definitely best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought in regards to hair removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this removes that hair from under arms and bikini area perfectly</li>
            <li> So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating.  </li>
            <li> So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great invention!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with this epilator.</li>
            <li> But I can compare it to my before furry body and my after, and I am VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Happy hair removal!!!</li>
            <li> This Emjoi is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent, I loved it the minute I got it.!!</li>
            <li> Even though I had a gut feeling it might not be the best one for me</li>
            <li> Awesome!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Emjoi AP-18.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT &amp; I HOPE THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT!</li>
            <li> This epilator is great!</li>
            <li> The is the best epilator I have used.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of research, this one is the greatest I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with it but</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and the product.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product!!</li>
            <li> THis is one of the best epilators I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> If you want that perfectly shaved feel, you would have to spend hours with the braun.  </li>
            <li> That is the best system for me.  </li>
            <li> I can say it is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Not the perfect color, but who cares.</li>
            <li> Tried razors, tried the no-no, but this is perfect for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The service was great, and they even upgraded it!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The best in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought another one for 1/4 the price, and it&#x27;s been working wonderfully for years.</li>
            <li> excellent machine !!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I&#x27;ve had 3 in 5 years</li>
            <li> excellent and in the time</li>
            <li> AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Best product ever!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  </li>
            <li> I think I made the best decision.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!!!</li>
            <li> Love this machine!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> It is just sooo pleasant!</li>
            <li> It does a very good job removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> So I checked into the epilators and this one had very good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Over all i think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li> It was a very good investment.  </li>
            <li> It is very good and tolerable.</li>
            <li> The Emagine is a great epilator-I&#x27;m impressed with how thorough it is.</li>
            <li> Great epilator, great customer service and Amazon is #1!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t feel like it does a good job of getting every hair, even the thicker ones!</li>
            <li> (she loved it too!).  </li>
            <li> I really loved my Emjoi epilator that I had for years!</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> It works so good, and is way faster!</li>
            <li> Loved it!  </li>
            <li> We used it a couple times and feel this is a good epilator at its pricepoint!</li>
            <li> good luck!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find out that it was cordless and that it held a charge!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to have people staring at my legs because they&#x27;re hairy but rather because of my sweet booty!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I got it, my best epilator yet.</li>
            <li> works good very happy</li>
            <li> IT WORKES PERFECTLY AND MAINTAINED GOOD CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;WILL</li>
            <li> I read many reviewers saying Emjoi AP-18 was the best, i also read some reviewers saying it was NOT the best.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing and decided to get the best of the best, which the Emjoi was considered to be by most reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and have already recommended it to many of my friends and family!</li>
            <li> So I decided to upgrade, &amp; I am very glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li> AND AM VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH IT!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with it.      </li>
            <li> But still a great model and</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before buying this product and a friend had great results with it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results until I used it again.</li>
            <li> all I am happy with this product because I dont have time to visit salons that often</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the Braun Xpressive, which I am completely happy with.</li>
            <li> The Emagine may be a great device for a lot of people, it just depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> But, I did it anyway; I am happy I did.</li>
            <li> Did a great job on my arm pits though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I won&#x27;t have to buy wax and razors anymore.     </li>
            <li> it did a great job for armpits.  </li>
            <li> but this is a great epilator.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product.</li>

            <li> love this razor!!</li>
            <li> However.... way better than shaving or using hair removal creams!!</li>
            <li> I will be very honest with you, it hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very effective</li>
            <li> Epilator is very effective at removing 100% of hair however depending on where you use the epilator</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Just received my Emjoi AP-18 and have to say it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing !</li>
            <li> So after consideration I purchased this, and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Results truly amazing!  </li>
            <li> the time I am saving is astounding!    </li>
            <li> I thought it would take me a week or more to get used to the feeling of an epilator, so I&#x27;m incredibly happy that I&#x27;m adjusting to it so well in just two days!</li>
            <li> This is the latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Good luck and happy hairlessness.</li>
            <li> Delightfully lightweight, the plug-in operation is better than dealing with the undue heaviness of a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice not to have to shave with a razor and cut myself!</li>
            <li> Otherwise is nice product!</li>
            <li> from what i researched this is one of the best on the market with the most tweezer heads.</li>
            <li> and it works perfect for more than 5 years..</li>
            <li> Constructed better , faster, excellent contour!!</li>
            <li> The best one I have owned and I have purchased many</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s the best Epilator  </li>
            <li> Nice surprise feature!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> The nice part is, over time it gets easier!  </li>
            <li> this epilator makes my underarms sexy, flawless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, I could spit! :D</li>
            <li> have just good things to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Emjoy for making this amazing product!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product, easy to use, no pain.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with the results I was sure I heard a choir of angels singing!  </li>
            <li> It sure isn&#x27;t very good at pulling all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best epilator I have ever had, works the best and the fastest.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to a huge range when I say it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Good product, the best corded available.</li>
            <li> it works great and effectively as advertized.</li>
            <li> My legs remain good for 2 weeks before they need another run with the epilator.</li>
            <li> It is good for a year.  </li>
            <li> I admit that my girlfriend gave me a good tip.</li>
            <li> I have an emjoi with 32 tweezers that works just as good.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair shot</li>
            <li> Its so good.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself already vs waxing, and a good price on amazon.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing the hairs with one or two swipes.    </li>
            <li> this is a good epilator..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this great epilator &amp; loving it.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do a good job on legs, which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I owned a Braun Silk-Epi for a while which I loved.  </li>
            <li> 72 Tweezer Head Epilator did a fair job for me.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> My legs felt good for about a day, until stubble would start to grow.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Well, it kind of stings, but that is about all I experienced.  </li>
            <li> I have found some of the suggestions helpful, and have followed them with good results.  </li>
            <li> My Braun Silk epil died after giving me 3 awesome years of smooth, hair-free legs, arms, and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Now the good thing about this is that when I started on one leg at 8:23 p.m., I was done with both legs probably before 8:56 p.m..  </li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I loved the predecessor to this item and think I would like this one just as well if it wasnt&#x27; a defective item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works good...</li>
            <li> When it arrived everything looked  good.</li>
            <li> The construction I would rate as fair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ability to remove hair: Not so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on my underarms with good results.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product as a good hair removal tool</li>
            <li> So i decidid to do some research and try to find one with good reviews and that looked like it would do the job.</li>
            <li> i wish now that i had sticked to what i know works good.</li>
            <li> on your &amp;#34; happy place anatomy&amp;#34; , figure out a way to hold the skin nice and taught.</li>
            <li> i kind of like how it feels lol.  </li>
            <li> in all, if you are a beginner and have the time and patience to use the Emjoi, it might be a good machine for you.</li>
            <li> But in reality it does not even come closer to giving a good epilation.</li>
            <li> bought a Braun epilator 6 months ago and found it worked, but not as good as the Emjoi on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I had forgotten how good it was.</li>
            <li> decided to try it on my leg after trimming the hair to 1/8th inch, it&#x27;s good at plucking the hair</li>
            <li> I took good care of it</li>
            <li> And does not remove hair as good either.  </li>
            <li> I saw this Emjoi Emagine with the 72 tweezer head and thought it would be a good replacement if it did the job as well and was faster.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to my friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> It is a good hair removal maintenance product.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise I think I made a good investment.</li>
            <li> Good bye shaving.</li>
            <li> It has a good ergonomic design, too, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I suppose it depends on the person&#x27;s hair and skin, but in my case it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Emagine Epilator is a good device for removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This product works good for your legs, underarms, bikini line and</li>
            <li> so you have a good amount of maneuverability without the cord being a hassle (something I was concerned about.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly hairy</li>
            <li> Good quality and nothing to complain about after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Got this product on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This one is really good.  </li>
            <li> Good thing it was still under the warranty, so I sent it in and they sent a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I like the 72 tweezer head, does a good job, not mush pull or pain w/</li>
            <li> I loved the woman jumping around and throwing herself off the couch as she screamed in agony...</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> was cheap, I immediately wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> But it is good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it does a good job.</li>
            <li> After having this product for 6 months I feel like I can write a good review on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Emjoi Golf for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is a good product</li>
            <li> That seemed like a good plan.  </li>
            <li> So maybe I need to learn some tricks, but I keep getting a fair amount of hair remaining after using it.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my health</li>
            <li> Letting it glide over your skin lightly works best.</li>
            <li> Maybe this would be a good one to start with since you have a barrier of running water and soap to get used to it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Models that are cordless tend to lose their strength so this was a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li> This is what makes it so good.  </li>
            <li> My daughter got me this one to replace my epilator that I&#x27;ve had for a number of years, and was no longer giving me as good a &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this, but the truth is that it hurts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for 25 years and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First the good</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the good</li>
            <li> I used Braun Silk Epil for 15 years and i loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved this epilator, when it was working.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this thing thinking it would be a good compromise.  </li>
            <li> in all, if your leg hair is thicker than mine, this would probably be a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a good hair removal product and this is it.</li>
            <li> either it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good epilator that removes hair from the root</li>
            <li> He surprisingly got it for me....</li>
            <li> But a good product.</li>
            <li> I have Phillips &amp; I loved</li>
            <li> it was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews and did research on how to prepare your skin for epilation (by exfoliating!).  </li>
            <li> I keep it clean and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It comes out during use but it works best if you keep stopping here and there and just clean it out a bit sometimes.</li>
            <li> But honest I am thrilled!    </li>
            <li> Anyway, not totally bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that has been removing my chest hair for many years (before it became commonplace), About 20 yrs ago, I wa informed that I needed to wear support hose for my leg problems,I found out that it was best to remove leg hair to have the hose stay up better.  </li>
            <li> I think it is excellent and possibly the best hair removal product on the market.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and does a great job at pulling most of the hairs out, diffinitely would recommend to buy it!!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND LEAVES YOUR UNDERARMS VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Emjoi 72 Tweezer Head Epilator.  </li>
            <li> use my epilator once a week fresh out of the shower for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> After using it, I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is very handy and keeps up a very smooth surface.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not instantaneous, but I&#x27;m confident that if you dedicate yourself and are determined, you will eventually get great results.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and priced economically for what it does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that brave yet :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the end result.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my Braun Silk-Epil was dying after many years of great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with item and performance.</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times now and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would be this happy :)</li>
            <li> LOL really I am So pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the prompt delivery sevice of the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual....  as well with the product, everything was as specified.</li>
            <li> I then turned to waxing and was very satisfied with that.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance as well as no-pain quickness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I am very glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality manufacture with a nice design.  </li>
            <li> and this seems to be one of the best out there right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found the hair removal brilliant, it requires a number of repeated visits to the offending area in order to remove a significant (and still not all) proportion of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and does a very good job and fast.</li>
            <li> the Emjoi AP-18 72 Tweezer Head Epilator seems to do the best job of removing the hairs, and the hair re-growth seems to be much finer and they are removed fairly well.</li>
            <li> This product is very fast and works great!.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this emjoi!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this device!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tried my under arms again and was much more successful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tried my under arms again and was much more successful.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I ended up choosing this one!</li>
            <li> but once I used it I feel in love!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for my underarms!</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first,  but does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li> it pulls the hair out from the roots (most of the time)!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re worried that you won&#x27;t be able to handle the pain, you might just surprise yourself!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and at first it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing epilator I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Well, for the most part it does!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it also doesn&#x27;t grab most of the hair!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> It worked even better!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Will probably spend more and go with a seller that has a longer return time!</li>
            <li> am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I did use it on my arms and LOVE being hair-free there!</li>
            <li> Much better!</li>
            <li> Trust me, this is a much better buy!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> How does this have outstanding reviews!</li>
            <li> I love these emjoi products!</li>

            <li> Love this gadget!</li>
            <li> This Emjoi epilator is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I could not emagine another epilator being any better!</li>
            <li> AND the hair removal was even better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> those who swim in salt water, which is why I started in the first place, it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this epilator!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Then after that it is so much more tolerable!</li>
            <li> This is the amazon purchase I regret the most!  </li>
            <li> Anyone ok else has this problem let me know!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE that!  </li>
            <li> It works fine...much better than plucking!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt me, but for someone who has never used this type of hair removal, it may hurt at first, but once you get used to it, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is much better!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I think this is because the epilator didn&#x27;t successfully pull out many of the hairs from the root but instead broke off.</li>
            <li> Really love this product!</li>
            <li> best epilator thus far!!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve found the product that will help you retire those troubles allow you to have a much more pleasant hair-removal experience.</li>
            <li> a great product, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This epilator pulls the hairs out MUCH more quickly and with a great amount of ease!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for legs or large areas.  </li>
            <li> The price at Amazon was amazing.</li>
            <li> And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the pain issue, its amazing.</li>
            <li> Emjoi is amazing.</li>
            <li> I began using it on my legs six weeks ago and have great difficulty in getting my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does the job amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and had amazing results.</li>
            <li> Amazing what 72 opposing rotating tweasers can do.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This device is amazing.</li>
            <li> This emulator is amazing.</li>
            <li> On the bright side it does seem to get better</li>
            <li> it is  amazing.  </li>
            <li> Smooth transaction great product</li>
            <li> I have heard so many great reviews on this product and how it has the MOST tweezers of any epilator out there, so i decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> They faded on thier own after a while though.</li>
            <li> I have to say that they look good, much better than shaved.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pain tolerant though, so if you are more sensitive-use with caution.</li>
            <li> I did use an exfoliating sponge with warm soapy water on my skin</li>
            <li> I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed that area before, so I&#x27;m not used to that kind of pain.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
            <li> All have been good, but they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> I have found that exfoliating with a loofah and salt or sugar scrub in a warm shower helps a lot before epilating.</li>
            <li> The best hair removal I have ever used on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Good quality love it</li>
            <li> Overall great quality and magnificent product.</li>
            <li> a hint, make sure you keep the skin taunt, as this allows a good grip but also reduces pain.</li>
            <li> Effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m impressed and that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I purchased this epilator and after paying this much money I thought it would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> All in all the epilator is good but could be better.</li>
            <li> my own legs/body cause</li>
            <li> It was also fairly noisy, and I was sure the neighbors could hear me \\&quot;landscaping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but , if you have somewhat aggressive hair breakage on the face ( females) I think esthetically it looks better and cleaner if you find a good threading</li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t as effective as it had once been.  </li>
            <li> this one is ok just not as good as the one i&#x27;ve been using for the pass 5yrs</li>
            <li> you  are done, apply whatever kind of lotion or gel or whatever on it.  </li>
            <li> I liked it when it worked.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I had been to a lot already.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful, quieter, and best of all it won&#x27;t pinch your skin!!!</li>
            <li> has only caused me great joy!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how effective this product is.</li>
            <li> The emjoi is definitely better and surprisingly</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I took a warm bath and exfoliated all areas that I was going to use the device on with a loofa&lt;br /&gt;-Made</li>
            <li> bought this Emjoi because I liked that it was corded, which meant unlimited power that wouldn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li> and then I make sure to moisturize with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it came with some kind of suction system that would suck up the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s included: The epilator, power cord, loofah, cleaning brush and a handy pouch that fits all of these.</li>
            <li> So, handy and convenient.</li>
            <li> the reviews said so many good things, but to be honest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another tool in my arsenal in my war against my own body hair.</li>
            <li> I took a warm shower before I used my epilator.</li>
            <li> Keep some solarcaine handy for afterwards if you think you&#x27;ll need it.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have found a leg hair removal system that works for me.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper models that take longer because they don&#x27;t have as many tweezers might actually be a good way to start.  </li>
            <li> dual opposed 72 tweezer head because I liked that it would work faster on my girlfriend than the others.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of it.</li>
            <li> But I must be honest here.  </li>
            <li> Would never buy another kind</li>
            <li> I found it was quieter than the Panasonic, but not as effective as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I liked to try another brands, I might buy another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My legs are nice and silky for days/weeks after.</li>
            <li> a warm shower, exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Might come in handy someday</li>
            <li> I used to own one that was cordless, and I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> thing is a really nice machine</li>
            <li> Oh boy ... one of those good intended products that will pave the road to oh well :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But honestly - who freaking cares that it&#x27;s not one swipe and done?</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> It really is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never epilated before and so was hesitant to spend this kind of money on a first-time buy.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to buy my own, and came across the tweezer .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe sticking to a good traditional/messy wax would be better than this.</li>
            <li> Nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> I am loving it.</li>
            <li> so have some cortisone cream handy and use it IMMEDIATELY after epilating.</li>
            <li> Next day I notice my chin felt smooth and no stubble; I was impressed and very happy.</li>
            <li> Still hurting too much to write a review, lol!  </li>
            <li> It comes in handy for dress season.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s travelable with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li> very powerful, works great.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice shape for handling and it really does a great job getting ALL the hair.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel very nice but not 100% smooth, as i shaved before and i heard hair grows in cycles</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This particular product stopped being awesome after about 6 months to a year of use.  </li>
            <li> This particular one received the best reviews</li>
            <li> Incredible, really!</li>
            <li> Works great for full legs, underarms and even arms, virtually painless.</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for many years and was very pleased with the Emagine dual head version.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this means it would be ideal for first time</li>
            <li> Amazon has most certainly the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> It worked best when new but progressively declined in performance.</li>
            <li> or if you&#x27;re new to epilating, it might not be the best one to start with.  </li>
            <li> Best epilator made I couldn&#x27;t live without it .  </li>
            <li> I am a new epilator, but this is the best investment.  </li>
            <li> Although she was very happy with Braun, we decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> I am just so happy I was able to return it for free.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it after a warm shower, since the hairs will be pulled out easier and more effectively.  </li>
            <li> After a really quick delivery I have been using the product now for about 5 weeks and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this.  </li>
            <li> Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Silk Epil for many, many years, which was already a good epilator.</li>
            <li> Easily cleaned, all around good product.</li>
            <li> Not  very painful, does a great job I love it!</li>
            <li> But the proces is very strong feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to do around my mouth very easily  with the Emjoi</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve get shaved, the maintenance is very easy, just go over the spots that need to be shaved and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> epilator seems to be well built and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Once the hair does regrow it pulls very easily with tweezers</li>
            <li> very easy to use, I would recommend this product to anyone who hates to shave.  </li>
            <li> What I love most is that I don&#x27;t get razor burn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!  :-)</li>
            <li> and when I went online to get another one, I started reading the customer reviews (I love Amazon most for these reviews!)</li>
            <li> can see how this might not do as good a job if you have really fine hair.</li>
            <li> Quick and very effective.</li>
            <li> This is also a great product comes in handy very much</li>
            <li> I figured, with 72 tweezers, this was bound to be more effective and faster than models I&#x27;ve used since.  </li>
            <li> Hubby is a body builder/power lifter, and they too, go for the smooth groomed look, so our epilator gets a GOOD workout!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I splurged for this it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best epilator I have bought to date.  </li>
            <li> you want an epilator that will remove unwanted hair post-haste, then it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> but I did research and chose this one because I liked that it had the most tweezer things.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold the attachment on its own, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> the best so far.</li>
            <li> A light would make it great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good epilator.</li>
            <li> I used to own the Remington ep1060 and that broke off more hairs than it pulled out which was inexcusable.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this works the best on me.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I don&#x27;t get ingrown nowadays, but do not expect smooth skin when running your hands on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far the Braun Silk Epil, Xelle is the best one.</li>
            <li> , I look forward to things getting easier, and more Effective ....</li>
            <li> this is my 6th epilator and its from far the best...</li>
            <li> The best I had so far.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I liked that it had the most tweezer heads.  </li>
            <li> I love this Emjoi, though, for the ease of use and the improved appearane of my legs, not to mention how nice it is not to have to shave.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> All in all, I do think this is the best hair removal technique I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> If you are going to home wax, it is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> so, i don&#x27;t have long-term experience with it, but so far so great!</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best on the market as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond pleased with my purchase and hope to get many, many years of good service from it.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean!!!</li>
            <li> The product is good and very useful.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair on the arms</li>
            <li> So if you have very fine hair, I&#x27;d say that the Emagine (or epilating altogether?) may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so that may be the reason.  </li>
            <li> Very quick and painless removal!</li>
            <li> Very fine (leg) hairs tend to just break instead of being pulled out by the root, so stubble in a day or two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have, it&#x27;s good, nothing to get excited about, and it hurts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have, it&#x27;s good, nothing to get excited about, and it hurts.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi caress gold for many years, it did a fairly good job, if slow,and I used it primarily on legs.  </li>
            <li> The best so far I have it or more than one year</li>
            <li> I have tried many epilators and this one is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li> It was a great epilator, but this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> I could wish for a bright light on the device so that I may see the hairs better.  </li>
            <li> This epilator is AMAZING and it leaves my skin feeling great soooo much</li>
            <li> which im pretty happy with.</li>
            <li> Everything was great for the first week or so.</li>
            <li> Online tips are great, hot shower, intermittent shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, works very well!</li>
            <li> The Braun worked great, as my first epilator</li>
            <li> If you use the slower speed it works great but with the higher price of this epilator...</li>
            <li> It broke after 6-7 times of using First days it was great but one of the gears got worn out after 6-7 times of using.</li>
            <li> It held up pretty well, and if you consider the cost of waxing, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and enjoy not having stubble to contend with.</li>
            <li> First, it is great for longer hair and areas that have been ignored or never had epilation before.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the bikini line was not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> My Epilady, when new did a very good job of getting the hairs ...</li>
            <li> And although I do love the Braun, this epilator is easily 2X faster!  </li>
            <li> - Very smooth, very smooth.    </li>
            <li> It does leave my legs, and bikini line VERY Smooth.  </li>
            <li> And it came on time ^-^ Very comfortable to use ^-^</li>
            <li> I am very surprised But very happy at what A good job it did the first time.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model because I had been happy with the first 2, and I figured 72 tweezer heads had to be better than 36, since epilating is so time-consuming.  </li>
            <li> I was very enthusiastic and determined in using it at first</li>
            <li> Okay, so this is my very first time using an epilator and ouch!!</li>
            <li> For me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, which I love.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using epilators for many years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to my friends but you definately need to make sure someone has to sign for their orders because it was not delivered to my house and it was a week or so after Amazon informed me it was delivered before I received it.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to epilate as often as I shaved.</li>
            <li> The one I like it most on is my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did well removing the hair and the pain did get better over time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle the pain it causes on my arms and legs, but I use it mostly on my underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li> Doc told me not to shave for a while, so I thought I would upgrade to a newer and better epilator than the one I had</li>
            <li> I really like it and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does cover more surface area since it&#x27;s \\&quot;bigger\\&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job in removing my underarm hairs.  </li>
            <li> I did however, because of manufacture&#x27;s claim expect a more smoothend result (again take my hair type into consideration</li>
            <li> There still is the stubble, and there was more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Emjoi seems to just break off most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried my under arms and that lasted a whole 15 seconds, LOL.</li>
            <li> I tried my under arms and that lasted a whole 15 seconds, LOL.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically much better than the Optima too, so you can get a better grip on it.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to trying to tweeze the remaining stubborn hairs instead of running the epilator over it too many times.</li>
            <li> It advises that you use this in the direction of hair growth and that&#x27;s what I did for the most part.</li>
            <li> but after I did them both, I was SO PLEASED.</li>
            <li> could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase it there as i found a way better price here on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s more hair coming in.</li>
            <li> Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.  </li>
            <li> Tell ya what, I was hoping this was better than what I was led to believe.</li>
            <li> I do appear to have better luck using the lower setting, it seems to get more hairs.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the twenty or so dollars more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> The has to be the best invention in the last 500 years!</li>
            <li> since the Emjoi has more tweezer heads I thought it would be quicker for removing leg hair</li>
            <li> they \\&quot;expect\\&quot; to be able to ship it within 30 days</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> way more better thn all I had before</li>
            <li> I started developing more razor burns than I did with waxing.</li>
            <li> For almost $90.00, I would expect a much better performance.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> But it gets better with time.</li>
            <li> So we ordered this one because it is more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s longer, it will hurt more, so trim what you need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> I loove the feel of smooth skin!  </li>
            <li> But I would guess it&#x27;s getting better than an eighty percent pull rate.</li>
            <li> With 72 tweezer heads, I thought the product would deliver faster and/or more efficient epilating.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cute bag and cover for the top.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too challenging.</li>
            <li> But after buying this last week, i had to write how impressed I was.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tweezing for many years now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt in the slightest any more.</li>
            <li> It arrived yesterday and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall excellent.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as described; however, more time for evaluation is needed.</li>
            <li> Lots of power, efficient, quicker than most, tolerable pain.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide between this one and one of the cheaper cordless Emjoi models, but I&#x27;m glad I went for this one.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped, there was no lingering pain, and my legs were smooth!    </li>
            <li> and there’s a lot more of it on my chin.</li>
            <li> It took no time at all and was baby smooth in minutes!  </li>
            <li> I know that this will go away the more that I use it in this area.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying a razor-free summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like the corded unit because it saves on batteries and seems to have more power.  </li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Much better then tweezing.</li>
            <li> The cord is very lengthy and it is great for arms, underarms, and legs:)</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years to remove hair</li>
            <li> I just wish that it did a better job of getting just one hair.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed the more I use it, the longer it takes for my hair to grow back, which is great!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than waxing.</li>
            <li> i did a lot of research online before deciding on an epilator, and even more before deciding to try this one.</li>
            <li> Legs were stingy but worked in mostly one pass.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product over a year now, and love love love it.  </li>
            <li> the more you go over the area, the more hairs it picks up.  </li>
            <li> ):)</li>
            <li> I fell in love with epilating</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I wanted to get what I thought would be a more high-end epilator.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this over waxing.</li>
            <li> I took a shower and made sure to use a buffpuff on my legs</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely better than shaving</li>
            <li> I have been using a epilator for over 15 years, this is my favorite one.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> This is OK.</li>
            <li> I find it works better on coarser hair vs finer hair.</li>
            <li> It worked better on my legs than the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Motor feels more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> caution don&#x27;t use it on your face though it says it is safe ..</li>
            <li> After seeing many of the beauty gurus of Youtube give reviews about the epilator, I had to have one.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to take your time when using this tweezer device, and treat yourself with your favorite body lotion when done.</li>
            <li> found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most.</li>
            <li> The head spins sofast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall</li>
            <li> just love this product.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it&lt;</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be an upgrade for 20 dollars more with two spinning heads.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am getting better results over time, but I still wish the hair didn&#x27;t break off as often.</li>
            <li> Oh, one more thing.</li>
            <li> Of all the epilators out there, the eMagine by Emjoi has the most aggressive design, including 72 tweezing elements that Emjoi boasts is the most on the market.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH much better.</li>
            <li> I HOPE THE MORE</li>
            <li> THE BETTER</li>
            <li> This epilator broke most hairs instead of pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> It was hardly better than shaving,</li>
            <li> For example, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wax being antimicrobial or the aesthetician dipping the spatula in it more than once</li>
            <li> Love the color too.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Emjoi for many years.  </li>
            <li> If taken care of, the product lasts for many years.</li>
            <li> enjoy!</li>
            <li> I wont say though that it hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li> As for my legs, because I&#x27;m skinny, I think it hurts more on my lower legs than thighs.   </li>
            <li> It does not \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; hair out 100% of the time, more like 80-90%.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I would say you will be hair free for 2-3 days max!  </li>
            <li> so I feel better without it.</li>
            <li> but for the most part it gets everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly probably hair that was in the &amp;#34;just budding&amp;#34; phase (anagen phase?).</li>
            <li> I think that the more you keep up with epilating your (talking about legs here)</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li> I had to take so many breaks</li>
            <li> Hopefully if I keep using this epilator it will get better and better.</li>
            <li> Gets better each time you use it.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Satinelle, and I used it for over ten years with awesome results.</li>
            <li> If you wax then you would love the convenience of the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Also, the opposed tweezer heads make shaving the bikini area MUCH more comfortable!</li>
            <li> (more passes with the device), so I splurged on this model.  </li>
            <li> Had to go over the hairs many times to remove them, and as it&#x27;s quite bulky, it doesn&#x27;t work well over bony areas.</li>
            <li> Time is precious and I would rather not spend hours doing my legs if it can be avoided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of replacing it and hope that will go well to make this a better experience.</li>
            <li> After you have tapped an area about 3-5 times, the \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; is infinitely more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to give your skin a break to heal.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this item but it is much better than most for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I just shaved most the time.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> Its mostly plasticky and flimsy.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think an expert could make this approach a better method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   </li>
            <li> I found that when the hair is longer it hurts more for some reason.</li>
            <li> So to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li> : This is what was most concerning to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For an epilator that is touted to get more hairs in fewer passes</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> It gave me so many ingrowns</li>
            <li> price of this is way better than the Braun</li>
            <li> I am so glad it dropped</li>
            <li> 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They are perfectly conceived, so they&#x27;ll solidly clip the hair and pull it so swiftly that you don&#x27;t even notice it is gone.</li>
            <li> I must say I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it, works well.</li>
            <li> I love that I dont have to shave them anymore.</li>
            <li> relatively pain-free ... great results!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Was better than my razor, no pulling or nicks.</li>
            <li> using many different epilators I can say that this one is the fastest and best one ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the dual head you never miss an unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure on which one to get, but by reading reviews, I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I got a nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> But I understand that gets better.  </li>
            <li> Okay, yes it uses electricity.  </li>
            <li> For many of my appliances, that will not do.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the results...</li>
            <li> I like this one much better.</li>
            <li> so I thought a 72 tweezer would be that much better.</li>
            <li> trim the hairs (longer hair will hurt A LOT more).</li>
            <li> that way you&#x27;re not gobbling up too many hairs all at once.</li>
            <li> That will hurt more.</li>
            <li> I made sure I knew how to use it and was prepared for the pain that people talked about.</li>
            <li> I could still feel the hair on my legs, it wasn&#x27;t much better than shaving, and it hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad that</li>
            <li> and I love it!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I can already see it getting better with time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once  you learn how to hold it and let it do the work on its own it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth and haven&#x27;t had to shave in days.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has two rotating heads</li>
            <li> I still have to go over some areas more than once, but I&#x27;ve had much better results than I did with the Braun epilator.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THAT WORD..</li>
            <li> i think im adicted  to epilating, i love it.  </li>
            <li> I found epilating to be a better choice</li>
            <li> That was okay.  </li>
            <li> Smooth leg wishes to you all!</li>
            <li> Since I heard it gets better the more</li>
            <li> and no it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> Never I had been so hair-less confident during Summer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow directions about how to use it.</li>
            <li> Faster isn&#x27;t always better........</li>
            <li> the most epilators.</li>
            <li> Boy do I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after watching one of my favorite Youtube Beauty Gurus.</li>
            <li> After that, smooth sailing!</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  </li>
            <li> Beauty is pain :)</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> It does get better as you get use to it</li>
            <li> It works faster and gets more hair becaue of the additional tweezers.  </li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> , made sure the logo faced me, and began epilating in the direction the hair grew&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hoping that it gets better</li>
            <li> After many years of shaving and waxing I decided to take a plunge and try epilation again.  </li>
            <li> and I really, really love it.</li>
            <li> (I have many)</li>
            <li> I will affirm what many others have noted.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a guy and have a tad more hair than the ladies</li>
            <li> , i gave it a try and am glad i did.</li>
            <li> You would assume with more tweezer heads it would be able to remove more hairs, but compared to my Brauns, this one does not pick up as many hairs and works a lot slower.  </li>
            <li> I guess more money doesn&#x27;t always equate to better quality...</li>
            <li> just go for it :)</li>
            <li> Also, I rather suspect it is breaking off more hairs than it is pulling out.  </li>
            <li> I used the Emjoi gently silken epilator for about two years before getting the Emagine - definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I figured to use this once every week or so was better than shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it will, except that for me there is no use in it at all.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s more about me getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Top notch.</li>
            <li> I like it better than shaving</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> I would like to share that the more you use it</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this item.  </li>
            <li> While it was working it did an ok job</li>
            <li> and i was able to remove my legs and hands in just 15 mins..</li>
            <li> i love the product .</li>
            <li> I even youtubed this device to make sure I was using it to</li>
            <li> So glad we got the corded version.  </li>
            <li> I understand that the more I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li> I looked online for different ones, and the Emjoi had the best reviews so as always, I trusted the reviewers, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li> Nor does it pull out most of the hair, the rest it cuts it like a razor would.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it covers a lot more area in a shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> gave it to my niece, who seems satisfied with it, but she is used to shaving, so for her this probably seems like an improvement.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this epilator.</li>
            <li> It does remove most of them as it was supposed to, but part of them brake.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I would&#x27;ve preferred it to be more efficient than fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all just ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working ok</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it works ok</li>
            <li> It seems a bit noisey but not any more than the others Ive used.</li>
            <li> I think because there are so many tweezer heads it makes it quicker</li>
            <li> and I think it gets more hairs.</li>
            <li> I like it alot :-)</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I love my Epilator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many heads this thing has.</li>
            <li> no matter how many passes I make.</li>
            <li> , I thought I could find an even better one.</li>
            <li> Much better than the piece of garbage I just bought.</li>
            <li> more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works like a top.....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Having more tweezers does not seem to add to the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> I find Braun epilators much better quality and performance.</li>
            <li> This is 100% better then waxing.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> try it  :-)</li>
            <li> this product has led to so many in-grown hairs that I almost considered going to the hospital.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi has the gears located on the sides which makes more sense, but time will tell if this design is better.    </li>
            <li> It also takes more passes over the skin to remove the hairs.  </li>
            <li> but i did not find it.first time epilating :-)</li>
            <li> I did and I&#x27;m glad that I did because with a couple of minutes use</li>
            <li> More hairs are picked up faster.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t always get every hair, but that may be more my fault.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Emjoi epilators.  </li>
            <li> I had to get another as I love the way it works.  </li>
            <li> Compared to shaving, though, this is much better for me.</li>
            <li> Probably better on legs than contoured areas.</li>
            <li> I bought the gen 1 version over a decade ago and it was still working but wanted this one as it seemed better with the two rotating heads.  </li>
            <li> And I can also say it is a million times better than the &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> An excellent choice for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Use with confidence :)</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> This product is much better than any you will find in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> So...not really sure.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just read instructions and be sure to keep skin taught.  </li>
            <li> Cant say more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> it misses so many hairs on my legs and does not remove hair from my bikini line at all.</li>
            <li> I love the twin heads making it quicker to do my legs.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> But as your hair grows back thinner this device becomes your best friend.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your Emjoi!</li>
            <li> It works so much better than any epilator that I&#x27;ve used (</li>
            <li> We like it much better.  </li>
            <li> It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have use a Braun epilator for many years and decided to try a newer one.  </li>
            <li> I have smooth legs!  </li>
            <li> Should have invested more money.</li>
            <li> Love this model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painless, but not horrible either....</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> I thought the  dual heads of this product would work better.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I kept using bc</li>
            <li> week it all got much better, quicker &amp; easier.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> (under the nose still takes my breath away)  :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the Remmington model I started with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> This one has more  tweezers</li>
            <li> - Optomini is much better.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> We all know that, for the most part, epilating isn&#x27;t a pleasurable experience, but it works wonders vs. shaving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a wonderful job at getting the smaller hairs.</li>
            <li> BUT, I do still love it.</li>
            <li> I tried my bikini line with the Emjoi and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> As I use it more I expect the redness from irritation to lessen and lessen.</li>
            <li> The headlight on it was probably my favorite feature.  </li>
            <li> If I was able to return this model I would, but I kept it for a while to try it out.</li>
            <li> Even with the sale it was over $4,000 which is more than I care to spend.  </li>
            <li> It still works better than this one did.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research and decided on the emjoi, because it had the most tweezers heads, and well, I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Love their products, and they are made well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating  for more than 5 years,  and have used a Remington,  </li>
            <li> and my latest was a Braun.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this one.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the speed of it</li>
            <li> For now, I am glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;strays\\&quot; All in all, I love this product and am thinking of buying another, just for back-up in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li> -  Took (possibly) more then 60% of the Hairs away.</li>
            <li> After tapping it a bit on my hand I was able to get the motor running</li>
            <li> and now I love it.</li>
            <li> and I had better luck with my legs (and maybe armpits).  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the Panasonic better.</li>
            <li> Price never guarentess better resul</li>
            <li> so I let it grow out for a couple of days more and tried again.  </li>
            <li> I think I tried it a couple more times on my legs with even longer hair</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers that did not like</li>
            <li> and i love that it is corded because i do not have to worry about the battery dying.</li>
            <li> but it has the most tweezers and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> She also went by many youtubers recommending this one</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the model with the 72 tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator but fast and aggressive and maybe not for beginners.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for many years now</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but this is better.</li>
            <li> but the more you use it tge les</li>
            <li> It works like magic and the pain is more like a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> my favorite part is that it plugs in</li>
            <li> I have used the Emjoi AP-18 for about three weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have liked to see a light.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> And I should give it 3 stars for the more misleading advertisement that \\&quot;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This gets the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> This gets the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> with more ergonomic issues.</li>
            <li> The thicker the hair, the better it works, I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were better</li>
            <li> I will keep trying it, but if I don&#x27;t start getting better results, I will return it.</li>
            <li> It may need more hair length in those areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi Emagine a couple of years ago and was originally pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It was much more bearable to use</li>
            <li> I love this epilator</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi and it&#x27;s the best way I have found to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love not having to charge it.  </li>
            <li> Found it here and love it , can not do without this item.</li>
            <li> This one removes more hair better and faster.  </li>
            <li> And if you epilate more often (hair are shorter)</li>
            <li> you are better off.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll put this way, my skin feels more bumpy/rough than when I use a Braun Silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> whatever reason, despite the opposing rotating heads, the 72 twezers, the speed and the brutality :-)</li>
            <li> I think you get better power and time with a corded product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it does a better job than my razor because it has a tendency of breaking the hair off when you go in the direction it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have to run this over my legs more than once to get everything out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is will to rip their hair out :)</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this has definitely has me in love.  </li>
            <li> I found that it broke off most hair rather than pulled it by the root.</li>
            <li> This epilator is a must have if you want silky smooth legs!</li>
            <li> Waxing is way better.</li>
            <li> I felt it needed to replaced after more than 5 years and thought the AP-18 would be even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and now I love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using an epilator, but after buying it and taking the risk, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just glide it across lightly in different directions for the best results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Look no further this is the best thing since sliced bread...    </li>
            <li> LOVE IT  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> pain aspect of an epilator is what terrified me the most.</li>
            <li> IT SOUNDS EVEN BETTER THAN THE OPTIMA AND</li>
            <li> I though it would pick up more hairs since it&#x27;s has a 72 tweezer head</li>
            <li> but it was just okay.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi was a top pick after some research and seemed to offer everything I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I made the leap and was glad I did.  </li>
            <li> the more I use it.  </li>
            <li> that I am 100% pleased with the results I am getting on both my underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The emjoi did not hurt me at all because my body had been used to epilating for many</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 is the most effective and comfortable epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s still better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take out as many hairs as it says.  </li>
            <li> But they were smooth!  </li>
            <li> (I was prepared after reading reviews), I was fairly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> Plus I figured it would get better the more</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I like this one better than the others.  </li>
            <li> After many years of reliable use I needed to replace my epilator.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say that there were any products better than this, but I can believe there are some better ones out there.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better it is, I used to look at my hairs and then wait for the pain of it being pulled out to know it was gone,</li>
            <li> I returned this and bought an eighty dollar Braun, which is SO much better.</li>
            <li> I have done it both ways many times.  </li>
            <li> and you will love it.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper brands by Phillips etc doa much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my Emjoi  as it is safer than shaving, and it does not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I do still prefer using the epilator over the razor, but don&#x27;t expects baby smooth skin in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used an epilator for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> :).  </li>
            <li> so no worries about charging it :-).</li>
            <li> Gets more hair</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> But in that case it&#x27;s easier to wax :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I do love this tool.</li>
            <li> Time and repetition - epilation takes more time than shaving and you do need to go over the area more than once to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> I use the slower speed on the device because I thought the faster speed was causing more hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Now I use the epilator and although I&#x27;ll never be an underarm model, I am hair free in this area and loving it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Epilator is the best personal grooming device I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> and it is doing a much better job.  </li>
            <li> The duel head catches more hair so you do not have to go over your legs so many times.  </li>
            <li> Once I set my mind to the thought of waxing again I was more able to tolerate the feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel like if a spend $80 on an epilator it should work more than 17 times.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to go to walmart and buy some bump patrol or something at the self checkout</li>
            <li> Best facial hair remover I have ever used!</li>
            <li> it will not pick up even longer hairs, I had to circle around some of them more than 10X to get it to grab (maybe).</li>
            <li> This one does a better job.</li>
            <li> and now I can not use it any more.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I WAS SURE</li>
            <li> IF I GOT ONE WITH MORE TWEZZERS</li>
            <li> I ENDED UP PAYING MORE MONEY FOR THIS EMJOI</li>
            <li> Need more practice I guess.  </li>
            <li> This worked ok.  </li>
            <li> and I am able to listen to a talk show on the radio while I epilate.  </li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> The plastic head is kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> Try it ... :)</li>
            <li> Ok so I am a guy</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product</li>
            <li> And what can I say I freakin love it.  </li>
            <li> This one, requiring the cord to work, is might lighter, has more tweezers, and works even faster.  </li>
            <li> It does a much better job of removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I have had better experience with lower price epilators..  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten better faster results by shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this emjoi  removed more than 2 hairs from my chin.  </li>
            <li> (Braun does a better job in</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it, it gives me another option to shaving, and I can throw away my wax kit.</li>
            <li> (Doctor&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a sign of a healthy heart.</li>
            <li> And oh, to have that smooth feel and look again!</li>
            <li> It worked on the cheeks, but I&#x27;d put the pain more along the lines of a 3.</li>
            <li> Nothing more was needed; no ice the way I would after waxing.</li>
            <li> being said, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll take a couple of attempts to pluck most of the hair out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit of a task getting most of the hair out,</li>
            <li> I got this to upgrade my Panasonic epilator thinking it would grab more hairs and be an all around quicker experience</li>
            <li> I said the next best thing because I think my hair removing problems will be solved by Laser Hair Removal, and since I cannot afford that yet, the next best thing is an epilator.</li>
            <li> But as you go on, each time will be a lot more tolerable.</li>
            <li> But i must say i was throughly satisfied with Emjoi....</li>
            <li> But, it is very powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do both legs in one day and my first leg took me hours to do because of the pain!!!</li>
            <li> I did end up buying the newest Braun Silk Epil 7 recently, and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited to recieve this product</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this when I took it out of the box</li>
            <li> After researching epilators i choose to get this one, so i ordered it and was very excited.</li>
            <li> I was very excited (and somewhat scared) to use this monster of a machine.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy 2 use and very smooth, better than others I tried.</li>
            <li> It also kind of grossed me out that there&#x27;s no way to really clean the tweezer heads.  </li>
            <li> Great result, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got used to the pain quickly and am so glad I took a chance and tried it!</li>
            <li> I think it is especially nice in the bikini line areas, where razor bumps are often a problem, there was no redness except for the initial one mentioned before, which is gone very quickly.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful on this epilator and is great for getting course hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> okay ladies, and gents this a great tweezer, emjoi is awesome my hair was very thick, and would grow everytime</li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The shape is easy to hold and very light.</li>
            <li> I had more fun watching some of the goofy videos!</li>
            <li> I owned the Emjoi Optima first, for 6 years, and loved it.</li>
            <li> One of the Braun reviewers (Mark Twain) has good advice for the first time users: shave (with a razor)</li>
            <li> so I feel that after 20 years, I&#x27;m a pretty good judge off them.   </li>
            <li> And the best part is, you don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to get long.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read, it sounded pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job on my underarms but can also take some skin with it, and I end up with a brush burn.</li>
            <li> I was more comfortable and was able to work faster and more</li>
            <li> Its actually pretty good</li>
            <li> It does pretty good on my legs.</li>
            <li> This was pretty pricey, but I loved it until my cat chewed the power chord up.</li>
            <li> It may be wise to keep searching if you are a first time user or if noise is a problem for you.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED the emjoi at first.  </li>
            <li> It works best with hair around 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, and seems to get even the finest hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt and you can use every time, it&#x27;s so easy and safe, I really like it, and my family too!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this particular model as my first epilator.</li>
            <li> Even though I’ve had to replace two units after 2.5 and 4 years, I still feel that the Emjoi works great and is worth the $80 (which has not gone up in price since the first one I bought 10 yrs ago)!   </li>
            <li> For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine)</li>
            <li> For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worth the money and pain!!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!!  </li>
            <li> This one works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, even on new areas that have never been done like the tops of my feet and toes.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to remove hair I have found in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and I love that I can &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; without the blood-letting I experience with a razor.</li>
            <li> I tried on my face just to try and was pleasantly surprise that it does not hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> liked that this product works quick and if they are used to the pain than they will  remove hairs</li>
            <li> love it and easy to use</li>
            <li> The cord honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me since I just use it quickly in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> So I do like this product, but most of all I love being a bit smooth.</li>
            <li> To be fair, the hair there was much shorter, having been shaved the day before, but I suspect I was mostly experiencing skin pinching not hair</li>
            <li> This epilator works twice as fast and twice as good as the one I had (a braun), love it</li>
            <li> what made me happy and encouraged me to do my whole legs, and now, they are just smooth with almost no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great as far as removing all hair but the case on top scratches and leaves a mark</li>
            <li> Works great and really is very pain free for me ..</li>
            <li> It does not hurt at all, it is confortable and very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I am 110% happy with this purchase so far!</li>
            <li> I wish they made a higher quality product, but as it stands, it&#x27;s more cost effective and more convenient than waxing....</li>
            <li> both enjoy this product and my girlfriend is very smooth</li>
            <li> That said, most of the time and on legs it&#x27;s totally fine.    </li>
            <li> The Braun epi&#x27;s are much better at one time pass and fine hair removal</li>
            <li> I think these work better on fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better on coarser hair than fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other epilators before this one and I have to say this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> There were suggestions given in the instruction manual and in the reviews of other users, I will eventually try most  to find out what works best for me.</li>
            <li> but the goofy ones were much more fun!</li>
            <li> I had never used an empilator before, but after reading so many good reviews on this particular epilator</li>
            <li> Works very good, had a different brand before.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this tool as a great way to stay hair-free and smooth this summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a hairy girl, but I am very fair skinned, so when I shave, the fast regrowth is pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li> For the most part though your legs will be hair free.</li>
            <li> As far as epilators go, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> You can use this epilator any time of the day, as many times in a day you want, and you do not have to &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; in more ways than one, like wax, and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to my pink BaByliss (bought in Israel and truly excellent), and chalk this one up to a dud.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly sceptical that something like this would actually work.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product that sure beats threading or waxing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most important steps.</li>
            <li> This might be the most important thing.</li>
            <li> I was able to epilate my underarms completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe an epilator with attached massager would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Sure I can&#x27;t get 100% silky smooth legs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame if they haven&#x27;t since it was our favorite of 3 epilators and isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> fantastic thing is that this is not a cordless epilator, requiring it to be plugged in, using more power, for faster moving tweezers.</li>
            <li> One improvement I would make is the addition of a light since most room lighting is eye to ceiling level, not in the shadow areas of the body or below the shoulder level.</li>
            <li> When searching for it&#x27;s replacement I was happy to find this newer model but wondered if it was worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li> After using this epilator my skin was smooth and most of the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> It does require many passes to get a area smooth.</li>
            <li> It works better after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li> It does a great job in getting the soft baby hair and the stubborn one too.</li>
            <li> This latest product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> But the best thing about this model is, absolutely no pain.  </li>
            <li> So far, so great.</li>
            <li> Pfsh, after this many years of shaving (20+) I&#x27;m pretty handy with my safety razor and sometimes that just can&#x27;t be beat with a machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this to keep me smooth this summer.</li>
            <li> Kind of fun to use</li>
            <li> I used to have a cordless dry/wet Panasonic and a Braun Silk Epil - both good machines but none nearly as fast as this one.  </li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> which really bothered me for good reason.</li>
            <li> Good product and thanks again.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping,</li>
            <li> Works super fast, does a great job.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a good buy, and I liked the positive reviews this epilator had.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and with a bit of discomfort pain wise, it wasn&#x27;t getting much of the hair as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Though epilators will never replace razors in terms of removing every hair right down to the skin, this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - better than a spa wax!  </li>
            <li> Partial Bikini Area - Removed quite a bit, maybe more then 60%!!!</li>
            <li> (many of which are after a significant period of use), i would say yes.</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> even if that was my first time with an epilator :)! ).  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this epilator and it is really good!  </li>
            <li> This is the best epilator - and I&#x27;ve used two other brands over the years.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for bikini line and legs, if you are able to let it grow a little.  </li>
            <li> My best friend recommended this unit to me, we did the necessary research, and I think I got a killer deal buying exactly what I was looking for in a epilator product!</li>
            <li> I have used several generations of Epilady, then a Phillips and then a Braun, on which the light was a very good feature, but decided to try the Emjoi when the Braun died.</li>
            <li> It could not get easier, extremely easy to use....</li>
            <li> * Is it easy?</li>
            <li> easy as shaving with this one.    </li>
            <li> Is it easy to use?</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.    </li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for making the return so easy.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it out is easy; I just use the brush provided and sweep through it after each use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite easy...</li>
            <li> The device was easy to use and has two speeds.</li>
            <li> It was so easy , I just kept going and was finished with both, legs armpits in 30-to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this one make your life easy.</li>
            <li> Even cleaning out this epilator is easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy ...</li>
            <li> then use powder so the epilator will glide easily over the skin...</li>
            <li> and the tweezers got all gooey for a while, but I was able to clean them with a Q-Tip and some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> i do wish i can clean the head of the emjoi a bit better.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it so much we bought two more for gifts.</li>
            <li> so I could easily see what I was doing</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really easy to use</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Broke after three years - The motor died and that was with infrequent use??</li>
            <li> for the pros: it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> easy 7 on the pain scale...</li>
            <li> Its easy to use.</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure you clean it well afterwards.</li>
            <li> but there rest was easily nicked with a razor.</li>
            <li> I think it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this, although I wish the instructions on how to actually use were better explained.</li>
            <li> tweezer head make the job easy</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator, which also has the wireless option, works a lot better and appeared to be more powerful this this product .</li>
            <li> , it makes for an easy sitting session in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is also stated on the instruction manual, but it can be easy to miss.</li>
            <li> It easily grabbed and removed hair in areas that are often times touched, grabbed, etc.  </li>
            <li> machine itself is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can return it easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The brush that&#x27;s included makes cleaning the epilator easy.</li>
            <li> I have strong hair and wax</li>
            <li> Devil\\&quot; because it&#x27;s strong and fierce when it comes to hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Strong motor.</li>
            <li> However, this is not foolproof -- I thought that because it stops when it touches my skin, it could not burn me if I applied strong pressure repeatedly.</li>
            <li> and I loved it, fast &amp; smooth results.</li>
            <li> This particular one is a good value.</li>
            <li> and I thought the Emjoi corded version would be more powerful and more effective at taking the hair out on the first pass.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Worked great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the braun and only required 2 passes.    </li>
            <li> The item is easy to use and not painful, but you are better of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, pulls out the hair from the roots and leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> in the bathroom, feeling more brave if not very numb, I begin again, my husband in audience for his own personal amusement.  </li>
            <li> This worked amazing on my armpits about thd first 7 times...smooth for about 5 days</li>
            <li> This is honestly the first epilator I&#x27;ve purchased or used.  </li>
            <li> Take a shower first -- warm up the skin....</li>
            <li> It honestly feels exactly like getting a tattoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, it gets kind of hot?</li>
            <li> It is great when it is new and working, but the plastic gear will wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi for years now and this is hands down the best one!!  </li>
            <li> Emjoi is hands down the best ever.</li>
            <li> Hand down, it is one of the best investments I have made.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Emjoi Optima is still hands down the best for me.</li>
            <li> The 72 tweezers all work excellent and cut down on my epilating.  </li>
            <li> if you are on this page because you want to cut down on epilating time and get excellent results... this is the epilator for you!  </li>
            <li> I only have to shave about once a month right now and love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great with more sensitive regions of the body that require more gentle removal of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> so there i was shopping for a new epilator and this one had really good reviews.</li>
            <li> Shaving is fine with me.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not super impressed with this epilator (esp</li>
            <li> Not so easy to keep engaging however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not super impressed with this.  </li>
            <li> fine hair on arms and stomach:  </li>
            <li> This is the second Emjoi epilator I have purchased (kids lost my first one) and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The eMagine is comfortable in the hand, glides easily across the skin, and has two power settings for fine or coarser hair.</li>
            <li> It works fine everywhere else, but my legs are another story....</li>
            <li> I have fine sparse hair and am used to this technique of removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> One for fine hair and one for course hair.    </li>
            <li> I have dark kind of course hair and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp really fine hairs as well</li>
            <li> It does not run on battery and therefore always has to be plugged in, but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only epilator I have purchased and it works great!</li>
            <li> I tried the Epilady many many years ago when i first came out and felt like my skin was being ripped off.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy at first, since this is an epilator with a cord, so I thought it should definitely last longer.</li>
            <li> Emjoi AP-18 is a fine piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> it is baby fine and sparse.  </li>
            <li> It works fine on my darker bikini line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week, and that is perfect for me, especially when I would shave in the AM and at the first sign of goosebumps</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and the first time i used it, it was awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine just running, but as soon as you apply any pressure, you can hear and feel it struggling.  </li>
            <li> the motor works fine, but the blade rotators don&#x27;t catch.  </li>
            <li> I rung up the fine folks at HS and they told me I had to have proof of purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now it is fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine tho, and the purple has cord, but is also can work cordless as well.</li>
            <li> This may be best for people with pretty coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this I thought it would tear me up but after watching many you tube videos I love it.</li>
            <li> It hurts to do my face, and leaves bumps, however legs and armpits are fine.</li>
            <li> : 72 tweezers have a better chance of a quick efficient process than 20 or 40, for a 72 tweezer-head epilator</li>
            <li> Once or twice a week a quick once over and done!  </li>
            <li> Super!</li>
            <li> At seven months pregnant, this product is a life saver!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy with is that it does not cashes fine hair as easy</li>
            <li> While the Emagine worked INCREDIBLY on the dark hair, I didn&#x27;t get quite as astonishing results on the light hair</li>
            <li> I was very enthusiastic about this product, at first I thought it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I must say though that the very first time you will use it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world.</li>
            <li> I bought mine for $78.90 plus i got free super saver shipping!</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome.</li>
            <li> I did hear that you might want to let your hair grow out a little longer for best results.</li>
            <li> also make sure of you plan on using this in a area that has not been groomed in awhile, TRIM the hair first!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m real happy with this little gizmo.  </li>
            <li> To top it all off, it really HURTS too!!</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this epilator for those of you who are familiar with epilating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order it since it looks HUGE on the ad/listing.</li>
            <li> Being corded is a HUGE plus too.</li>
            <li> I have not had to shave my legs for 10 years using this product and my legs remain smooth, stubble free and hair free.</li>
            <li> I am (was) a huge fan of waxing.</li>
            <li> Since I keep it unplugged when not in use, I don&#x27;t find this a huge problem.</li>
            <li> Well as a woman with a huge side tattoo that hurt like the rays of a thousand suns, I&#x27;d choose a tattoo any day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, The Emjoi is a HUGE improvement over my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt that much and really did a great job.</li>
            <li> Therefore, just like with shaving, you have to deal with needing to re-epilate in a few days if you want that perfect smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap Emjoi one that I&#x27;ve had for a while</li>
            <li> Just the epilator itself and a cheap bag</li>
            <li> My area is smooth and has been completly hairless for 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is cheap in comparison and it takes me 45 minutes max to do my arms, legs, and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my Emjoi AP-18</li>
            <li> Hair free.</li>
            <li> does a fabulous job-</li>
            <li> I also used the epilator for my legs but didn&#x27;t like it because my legs didn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for my underarms</li>
            <li> The epilator rapidly pulls out hairs by the root, leaving your legs, arms, or wherever you choose to use it, smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and store.  </li>
            <li> It took another two weeks for the hairs to get to the point where they could be shaven smooth agai .</li>
            <li> it was cheaper with free shipping vs paying sales tax for [...]</li>
            <li> Seeing the great and not-so-great reviews, I was having second thoughts after I placed my order for the Emagine epilator.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially fantastic for getting all those tiny chin hairs!</li>
            <li> I was brave enough to do my underarms.</li>
            <li> so I can get plenty light</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I purchased it AGAIN,thinking maybe I had just received a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is great not to need to shave daily.</li>
            <li> I am virtually hair free.</li>
            <li> However, after a ton of waxing, laser, and electrolysis treatments, it honestly doesn&#x27;t phase me much.</li>
            <li> How smooth are you afterwards?</li>
            <li> * Is it easy to clean? -</li>
            <li> It would be great if you could remove the guard as the guard prevents you from pulling the real short hair.  </li>
            <li> This got such great reviews</li>
            <li> Light Caress, Corded]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they won&#x27;t replace their cheap plastic gears with metal if they&#x27;re charging 90$ for this machine?</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
            <li> GIVE A SMOOTH SHAVE LIKE RAZOR.</li>
            <li> and my skin is smooth as silk now.</li>
            <li> not from catching the skin, just from the tweezers rotating over my skin without me applying much pressure at all</li>
            <li> I wish this epilator had a LED light like my Braun unit has.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great quality product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and this is my 4th one in 10 years.</li>
            <li> Oh, I also recently started doing my underarms with it too which is awesome to finally see them look nice and practically hairless</li>
            <li> Arms, legs, underarms, bikini area, even my lower back and happy trail.</li>
            <li> and my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li> it in a smooth motion.</li>
            <li> So the lack of this feature in the Emojoi does not bother me, but might be important to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> No pressure, light pressure.  </li>
            <li> , it just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator primarily to remove the hair fuzz on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was a Braun fan for years although I wasn&#x27;t happy with the second braun silk 7 (in/ out of water.)</li>
            <li> The size and position of tweezers allow for the hair never to break, leaving the skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> My under arms now feel extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I ended up at walgreen buying a $25 Remington smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I have tried a few epilators but this one is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving over the years almost never gave me the smooth legs I wanted.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t wait to have the smooth legs I had desired for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to my dismay, the results were not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely takes some practice, but at this point I am incredibly happy with how my legs feel and</li>
            <li> Exfoliating also helps to maintain smooth skin when there isn&#x27;t hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li> I even use this thing on my husband&#x27;s back (sometimes I find pleasure in torturing him, LOL)</li>
            <li> makes for easy clean up as well.&lt;br /&gt;*depending</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think I would, but I miss the light I had on the Silk Epil, which helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> Otherwise, never get a totally smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> It efficiently does a detailed job on my legs.  </li>
            <li> They are mailing me a replacement tweezer free of charge.</li>
            <li> , I use it in my legs, underarm and facial hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get me as smooth as a razor</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators during the last 10 years of my life and I am happy with this one.</li>
            <li> and I was hair free for 2 almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Emjoy epilators are great they last and work well.</li>
            <li> I used to wax my  upper lip and that worked great</li>
            <li> Fast and effective.  </li>
            <li> will start with the cons: it lacks a light.</li>
            <li> Around $70 for something that had better be worth it.</li>
            <li> Why must everything be made so cheaply?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you smooth like shaving, but it creates an acceptable situation.  </li>
            <li> , I liked it so much</li>
            <li> One can have almost a smooth body appearance during the summer tanning and swimming season.  </li>
            <li> It is heavier and does not move smoothly on bony areas like the knees.</li>
            <li> Why they price this item at $100 is beyond me, it might be worth $45 at the most.</li>
            <li> Fast and effective hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Does it have all the bells and whistles available - no,</li>
            <li> The gears are made of cheap plastic and one of the teeth on the gear in the head piece broke.</li>
            <li> I think I still have to train myself not to expect the perfectly smooth results of shaving, though.</li>
            <li> so they upgraded me for free to the cordless one.</li>
            <li> Really cheaply made, get a braun instead.</li>
            <li> My legs stay smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li> Gets all the hair &amp; leaves area so smooth.</li>
            <li> With the dual head system I don&#x27;t think they could put a light on this model though.</li>
            <li> I found that a glass of wine before, then enjoy one during helps a ton with the pain.</li>
            <li> It is corded and more powerful.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My legs stay stubble free all week.</li>
            <li> The twizlers didnt move anymore,there was the sound</li>
            <li> If you are looking to be hair free for a season, or an occasion -</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I searched at malls for an Epilady replacement and learned they were no longer available at Brookstone etc.  </li>
            <li> Its amazing and fast but after about a year....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  have a light,  </li>
            <li> Takes some more time, but to me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I figured that epilating would be the way to go and would keep me hair free longer.  </li>
            <li> after reassuring my legs are still smooth, my girlfriend mentioned,</li>
            <li> The pain is almost incomparable.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I gave this epilator 4 stars, because it doees not have the light, the massaging head</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I gave this epilator 4 stars, because it doees not have the light, the massaging head</li>
            <li> but then I continued without stopping and it just felt like being lightly pinched.</li>
            <li> and my chest felt smooth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still that smooth.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliate, epilate, get an alcohol free toner (witch hazel), and moisturize with cocoa or Shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it not as smooth as it is described..</li>
            <li> I agree with all others that say when using an  epilator, exfoliating is important.</li>
            <li> Virtually pain free epilation.</li>
            <li> For one, they offered FREE one-day shipping</li>
            <li> and I was getting it totally smooth</li>
            <li> Does a great job and pain level is low!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it hurts my skin and leaves light scars on it.</li>
            <li> Works great on thicker hair, such as underarms.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, fast, affordable, clean, and effective.</li>
            <li> I get them primarily in the bikini area and they still seem to occur.  </li>
            <li> I used it 2 weeks before my wedding and still had smooth legs on my honeymoon.  </li>
            <li> But it definitely does a great job.  </li>
            <li> and I am hair free</li>
            <li> Your legs will never be as smooth as shaving with epilating.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I do recommend both the emjoi and the braun, as well as the Clean and Easy home waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> results are great, chin hairs are disappearing, upper lip....hurts, but eventually I get them off.  </li>
            <li> I figured since it was such a great product, I&#x27;d purchase the Emjoi</li>
            <li> Although I received free shipping when I purchased the device, I had to pay $10 to return it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the smooth factor!</li>
            <li> Those puffy plastic mesh things don&#x27;t work at all, too smooth.</li>
            <li> But I decided to try epilating them with the Braun and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Emjoi is fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Why is almost everything (including moving mechanical parts!) made from cheap plastic today?  </li>
            <li> I think all of the reviews saying this just broke the hairs off were primarily from females with thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> This was the firt time in my life that I got the smooth legs you see on women in shaving commercials.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean -</li>
            <li> I bought the emjoi optima at sharper image because I knew at the time is was the most powerful epilator I could buy.</li>
            <li> but your legs will be hair free for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> have used many different epilators and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> So overall I am really happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li> My body hair is so light in color</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my toes; yes, us blondes do get light colored hair on our feet.</li>
            <li> A convex design would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li> if I had done it more often &amp; regularly, I&#x27;m sure the hair would be much sparser.</li>
            <li> So far - so good.</li>
            <li> but it actually works best (in my opinion) to go somewhat fast in circular motions over the hair you want to get.</li>
            <li> So maybe this isn&#x27;t a good choice epi for natural blondies.</li>
            <li> The Emojoi is FAR superior.</li>
            <li> A plus, the opposed tweezer heads do a good job of getting more done in one swipe, and have a rubber element that tries to lift flatter hairs for better removal.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because it has too many tweezers and it goes too fast, but it breaks hairs more often than it pulls them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, very reliable and lasting</li>
            <li> This one for sure is more gentle while removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if I have any problems with ingrown hairs or not, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> and I actually found that to be quite nice and handy.</li>
            <li> It really does get most of the hair, and I haven&#x27;t noticed more ingrown hairs than I would get from waxing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the placement of the cord plug in, which is more towards the top rather than the end.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun Silk Epil for nearly 8 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, it&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li> I have two other corded Emjoi epilators, both of which I am happy with, and particularly satisfied with the Emjoi Divine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  recently biught the Braun and  love it!!</li>
            <li> A very powerful and sturdy machine that I can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> so i just use the lower setting which is still very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and very fast.  </li>
            <li> but if you follow the MANY internet instructions on how and how often to use this, you&#x27;ll be just fine after the first week or so.</li>
            <li> These epilator is super easy to use, pain free</li>
            <li> If your desired result is for smooth finish this will be a significant flaw.</li>
            <li> I still love mine, but this is my first epilator, so there may be better on the market, this one does work though and for anybody who has never used one its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use and seems fairly powerful.</li>
            <li> but I really think that&#x27;s good because it has sooo much power!  </li>
            <li> I love being hair free longer than shaving, but like I said, if it&#x27;s your first time, just take your time.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the hair removal pretty good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great, is easy to clean, and has a cute little storage bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already had a single tweezer autoplucker that worked splendidly</li>
            <li> (though in most areas it lasts a month or more because it is new growth, not cut razor stubble</li>
            <li> Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is comfortable in my hand, light, and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> its super easy to clean as well which i</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal since the original Epilady came out.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure as i use this more and more the hair will grow back a lot slower.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> but you remove more hairs per pass on the higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness</li>
            <li> OK, so this is my first epilator ever, that I have never used one or even held one in my hand before this one, so I cant compare.</li>
            <li> but over time..it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li> Today, I was even able to use it on stray hairs under my chin (thanks, birth control pills!)</li>
            <li> I stuck with this brand because I was satisfied the first time.  </li>
            <li> I wish it worked better on the first try though.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used Epilady, Braun and now the Emjoi Emagine and for the first time in three years I love the fact that I epilate my legs over shaving.  </li>
            <li> If this only works on my underarms, I will be beyond thrilled with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Successful for upper lip, chin, underarm, bikini line, legs...</li>
            <li> But I was familiar with waxing and threading before I started epilating.</li>
            <li> I do make sure that I have a hot shower and exfoilate before I epilate.  </li>
            <li> and then will go around in circles (which is usually what works best).</li>
            <li> So worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought it for about $90, and it was well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun silk epil for many years, and although it worked well, I figured this newer Emjoi epilator with more tweezers would work even better.</li>
            <li> Originally 5/5 stars, now 1/5**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is my original review from June 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this is that it absolutely gets the hair by the roots!</li>
            <li> I was excited to skip shaving for a couple weeks, vs having to shave every day.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, this gets better.</li>
            <li> and I love love love only having to epilate once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I was excited, though nervous, to try the Emjoi Emagine (AP-18</li>
            <li> All worth it!</li>
            <li> It is entirely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had one of the original &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; epilators from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I heard about emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Despite that, I was so excited and used it minutes after it arrived</li>
            <li> The best part about this one is it never pulls your skin like my past ones have.  </li>
            <li> It was OK for the first 6 months</li>
            <li> I would return it except that I do not have the original packaging  &amp; receipt.  </li>
            <li> Wanted this as a backup until my original one dies.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and it is ok.  </li>
            <li> Even the bikini area was pretty okay.</li>
            <li> At first it does hurt but after continuous use it get a lot better.</li>
            <li> The original words well...</li>
            <li> I bought this item a long couple of years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> and I am really excited to have it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I originally started epilating.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and it works great because it has double tweezer heads, but its only good for the legs.</li>
            <li> Worth not having to shave for a week or two!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the Emjoi!  </li>
            <li> I owned one of the first epiladys many years ago.</li>
            <li> Better than my first Emjoi epilator which lasted me 3 years.</li>
            <li> By the end, I was more relieved it was over than the birth of my first child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more notes about first use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this epilator, I was able to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my legs completely in about thirty minutes while sitting in a comfortable, safe chair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not always the one who thinks the more you spend the better is the quality.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My review compares this product to the original Epilady coil epilator (made in Israel) and to the Braun Silk-Epil model</li>
            <li> This device is the best for getting into nooks and crannies and works well in the underarm area, because its head is fairly small and its a bit curved.</li>
            <li> Does pull out fine hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts the first time because you&#x27;re pulling so many hairs at one time, but it&#x27;s bearable.  </li>
            <li> i was excited.</li>
            <li> Glad I waited for the 72 tweezer head, as both legs were done in 20 minutes first time around.  </li>
            <li> I have heard good things about Emjoi and saw this beast of an epilator that had pretty decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super happy with it, so I decided to try another brand, especially after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Now, I must say that I had to wait a little longer than anticipated for the delivery, but in the end it was worth it, so I could experiment the tool on &amp;#34;overdue&amp;#34; hair, and I was extremely happy!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and the cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li> I am a newbie using an epilator and this is my first time and first epilator and let me tell you it hurts like HELL!!!</li>
            <li> After using and loving a Braun Silk-epil epilator for over a year I thought it might be time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect keeping a current customer happy is more important than trying to make new ones to disappoint.     </li>
            <li> so need clean legs</li>
            <li> I have found that corded ones are better because they last longer than the rechargable kind.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Emjoi epilators for the last 15 years, but this one by far is the best one yet!  </li>
            <li> Previously I owned Brown (which was good , too but not as quick and effective as Emjoi).  </li>
            <li> Also, remember to clean out the hair that was pulled or else</li>
            <li> But one it is removed, you skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> or maybe I wasn&#x27;t keeping them clean</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it since it&#x27;s handy to have something at home for touch ups and between waxing sessions</li>
            <li> I had a Gently Gold foe over 10 years that could catch the tiniest hairs til it finally refused to charge where as this couldn&#x27;t even catch ideal hair length according to its manual on my legs.</li>
            <li> But I found the best way to clean the epilator, was to use an old toothbrush to actually scrub out any build up in there.</li>
            <li> The blade housing can be removed from the unit, and I clean it with keyboard air-based cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Well built unit,.. powerful motor easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been using several kinds of epilators and this one is by far the best one!</li>
            <li> i use a q-tip with alcohol or witch hazel to clean the tweezer heads.</li>
            <li> a shower bath or whatever you use to keep your self clean.</li>
            <li> After many years (I am 29 years old &#x3D;)) of shaving</li>
            <li> though there are more tweezers than my old Braun, I feel that I have to pass over the area more times.</li>
            <li> smooth and quick</li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean because of the sealed head.  </li>
            <li> The AP-18 is so fast and does a great job, even on the sensitive bikini line.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Emjoi and the best one so far.</li>
            <li> So what is the point of going over and over for many times and spend much time trying to get a smooth skin even if epilator would still miss A LOT of hairs?</li>
            <li> Then within about 3 months, the rotating blades would periodically seize up and jam, even though there was nothing caught in them and I would clean it after every use.  </li>
            <li> and I really thought I&#x27;d miss the light that&#x27;s found on many others, but these are both non-issues.</li>
            <li> My old one only had 20 tweezers, so this one was a awesome upgrade.</li>
            <li> it cut up my skin, leaving me all red and marked up for days afterwards and wasn&#x27;t even effective!!!</li>
            <li> Legs look smooth but do not feel as smooth as a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> Had to use a tweezer afterward to clean up.</li>
            <li> This Epilator has more power and a more efficient tweezer action than any Epilator I have owned before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Does not impress me with ability to grab more hair, but does work better on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Glad I did, it works pretty good at removing the hair, needs to be used only once or twice a week,</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews before deciding on this epilator, and for once in my life, I made the best choice right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful and works quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold and is fast .  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and whips the hair right off.</li>
            <li> I used the higher speed right away even though my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I get better results from this thing on my bikini line, than on any other part of my body.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic before, and I liked it a lot , but I love that this one can be used while its plugged in  and I love the 72 tweezers it gets my legs done in half the time.</li>
            <li> The light on the Braun is very handy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Emjoi for the first time last night, and let me tell you, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you do have to go over certain areas more than once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that with time and more experience using the Emjoi, I&#x27;ll become a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; at hair removal.</li>
            <li> Certainly, I would expect better for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say that I love it -- on certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Does any on know of a special way to epilate under the arms?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to get it all right away!</li>
            <li> If I could change the purchase of the Emjoi, it would be to get one with a light on it which REALLY makes a difference !!</li>
            <li> I was excited by the speed of this epilator but quickly realized it was breaking a majority of my hairs rather than removinging them from the root.</li>
            <li> just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.    </li>
            <li> MY LEGS ARE NOW AS SMOOTH AS A BABIES BOTTOM HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)</li>
            <li> Sometime after my last update in 2013 the tweezers head on the first Emjoi started catching, i.e. stopped turning, at first it was every once in a while, then more often, until I just couldn&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
            <li> At first, my shins never felt fully smooth after epilating, but now that the hair is thinning out, they&#x27;re finally smooth.</li>
            <li> the first time was great and got all of the hair,  however a week later itI had stubble used it again.</li>
            <li> Is as expected a great product for legs</li>
            <li> I am bright red under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend exfoliating your skin regularly and using a good lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> as soon as I developed a nice rhythm with it, it took no time at all and my legs were immaculate.</li>
            <li> Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting.</li>
            <li> + it is not painful at all, I didn&#x27;t feel anything even at that parts where I never used an epilator before  </li>
            <li> In my case, I got good results only on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun one before, but this one is much quicker and removes much more hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon:)</li>
            <li> If I say I did lower legs, arms (that I rarely do  since hair light) and underarms,(usually shave)</li>
            <li> The Brauns are only good for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> My last one was a braun and that one was good but there was still a bit of pain involved when using it.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely fast, not that noise as many others and does the work.</li>
            <li> I tweezer out some of the leftovers myself if they aren&#x27;t too many or if they are bothering me too much.    </li>
            <li> Because of that, it&#x27;s not painful at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a LOUD, but effective workhorse.</li>
            <li> And thanks to this product, my legs are now scab and itch free for 2 months!  </li>
            <li> It is not extremely painful but for the results that it gives, there should be no pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Final results good but not like the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I am confident I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer with this thing.   </li>
            <li> This is definitely a good investment if you want lasting results that you can do yourself at home.</li>
            <li> most of all FAST.</li>
            <li> I say this OK because it is fast</li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade for my current epilator, but it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li> It felt weighty in my hand and it looked sleek and cool, but I knew I would never use it again</li>
            <li> Sure, that&#x27;s what helps this be painless for me, but it is a much gentler epilator than others.  </li>
            <li> I find it much more comfortable and does a better job on really short hairs.</li>
            <li> Some areas it doesn&#x27;t hurt, others it REALLY hurts, but mostly its tolerable.</li>
            <li> only good thing I found is that using the Emagine is relatively painless, which would be good for beginners.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much faster it is and how much more hair it removes.</li>
            <li> The last Braun was good for 8 months before it started to act up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful but you can feel it.</li>
            <li> I really hope this review helps you. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> works better and twice as fast.</li>
            <li> (although, it&#x27;s much thinner and more sparse</li>
            <li> It was able to keep my legs smooth in a way that the Emjoi had not, feels more solidly built, plus it has a two-year warranty.</li>
            <li> It works good, but it does truly miss a lot of hairs, big hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I told my mom and sister about it.</li>
            <li> This works really quickly, so it&#x27;s not nearly as painful as the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> Was Really hesitant about buying but love it.</li>
            <li> This is a better product with a wider surface area that really grips the hair.</li>
            <li> And it did not even hurt that much :) I would always recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had my last Emjol for over 20 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It still works, but this Emjol is much faster and better.</li>
            <li> The overall performance of this product is good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> So I continued torturing myself and managed to make a full circuit around the bottom part of my leg.  </li>
            <li> It is not painful at all for me, however I do not have an abundance of hair.</li>
            <li> She warned me it hurts, a lot, but told me I should start to shave in the least, and at best to get one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this in May, and LOVED it, until I took it with me to Australia, plugged it in to the proper converter</li>
            <li> I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works).</li>
            <li> I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works).</li>
            <li> my old Braun Epilady lasted over 8 years (and still works, just too slowly to be effective).  </li>
            <li> but I stay on top of my bikini like because I absolutely cannot tolerate stubble there.</li>
            <li> I give it my full endorsement.</li>
            <li> And I have to question the real source of so many glwoing reviews for the product on this site.</li>
            <li> I think for speed, this is an okay epilator, but it doesn&#x27;t work that much faster</li>
            <li> I like the Gently Gold better.</li>
            <li> and I never have to have legs full of hair.  </li>
            <li> I found it works well and is not painful which I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li> I love this item, it makes my hair removal so much easier and faster</li>
            <li> They worked very well and they seemed to remove more hair in one pass than the newer designs.</li>
            <li> And after using it for a month I&#x27;ve already saved what I would have paid to get a full leg and bikini wax.</li>
            <li> This product is really fast, which I love about it.</li>
            <li> This epilator is not as good as my former one.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been through a full 6 weeks growth cycle yet...</li>
            <li> I use it on my underarms, legs, and my bikini area, full Brazilian.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s soooooo much quicker than shaving and it leaves my body feeling as smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> The product itself is not bad</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li> &#x27;s what so amazing, though: the heads on this Emjoi seem to run much faster than my Braun, and because of this, I experienced a LOT less pain!  </li>
            <li> I must say the Emagine is so much faster and more efficient than my loyal Gold Caress...</li>
            <li> Maybe I felt less discomfort with the warm water, but honestly speaking, it takes 20 minutes to epilate my legs</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 is pricier than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very user friendly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As with most epilators, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs on my legs (they are fine and blonde), but definitely enough to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> As a frame of reference, I epilate my legs, arms and am pretty adventurous with the bikini line (I use it for a Brazilian - which is why I own 3 epilators, one is for my nether region only, and I clean it with alcohol after each use.</li>
            <li> This is actually a very effective efficient epilator however it breaks consistently after about a year of regular use.  </li>
            <li> The motor makes the right sound, but the tweezers don&#x27;t spin at all.  </li>
            <li> right before it changes sound.</li>
            <li> My legs would be smooth right after although it took HOURS to get them that way.  </li>
            <li> Just hold it to your skin close but not pushing and its pretty easy to follow the directions and all so just hold it to where the button is closest to your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after much research and review-reading, hoping that it would be the perfect replacement for my older epilator (used regularly for 3 years)</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend reading up on tips and tricks of epilator use before using this for the first time...</li>
            <li> the legs very smooth if you make sure to go back and get those spots you missed at first&lt;br /&gt;*Even</li>
            <li> Also, epilating will not leave you as smooth as shaving, but it is pretty darn great because you will only have to do it once a month (after the first 4 weeks which you should do it once a</li>
            <li> excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, fine hair &amp; have been using epilators for many years.  </li>
            <li> The instructions tell you not to use it on your face - but if you use the side blade and are very gentle it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it works great other than that.</li>
            <li> This works great on legs and other areas.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy with the final results, of course the first time takes some time but it is worth.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very happy with it because it was very fast and powerful comparing to other epilators I had before.</li>
            <li> Sounds to me like it is less than comfortable to use but better than others of its kind.</li>
            <li> so I was lucky.</li>
            <li> works great and much faster than smaller models</li>
            <li> But, even though the epilator took out many hairs by the roots on my legs, it broke off just as many, which left stubble.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> ; (after shaving, more hair will grow at the same stage which will look like more hair).</li>
            <li> &quot; I keep telling myself that six weeks&#x27; worth of smooth legs is worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My epilator arrived quickly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> and I probably would have had to put in time later to go back over any areas that weren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> That would improve it tremendously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator to replace an older Emjoi one that didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers.</li>
            <li> epilator gets the job done quickly and</li>
            <li> yea, don&#x27;t be too intimidated by how quickly the tweezers rotate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many before and after having read the many reviews I finally bought it</li>
            <li> This particular model does an okay job, but it&#x27;s noisier than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Also it was super noisy.  </li>
            <li> My leg hair is pretty fine, I think I will just use it quickly every couple of days,</li>
            <li> Wow it worked great and was the pulling wasn&#x27;t near what I was worried it would be.  </li>
            <li> It does work but seems to take many, many passes before all of the hair is removed and even then I am left with strays.</li>
            <li> I chose this to replace my old Braun because it had lots of good reviews, but I didn&#x27;t really believe the claims of one pass does the trick.</li>
            <li> I do not have hair on my legs, arms or under arms, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do have patches of hair that grow under my chin (over my top lip, around the lower sides of my mouth, and on my chin).</li>
            <li> Worked great on the bikini region, but I could only take so much discomfort on my legs.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quick</li>
            <li> awesome thing is that the Dual Opposed Head pick up the hairs from all directions of growth, instead of having to go over the same spot multiple times causing</li>
            <li> but I just want the job of hair removal done quickly and done well.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more hair I have and the darker and coarser</li>
            <li> I have only had the Emjoi Emagine for about three weeks, and already I love it so much better.  </li>
            <li> Luckily she didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s more comfortable even than my old single-tweezer head device.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t think twice ,just get it , if you want to do it yourself and quickly.</li>
            <li> This brand tends to only last a year before the motor gives out, but they are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It does not cause pain, a bit of a tightness and maybe a quick twinge, nothing earthshaking.  </li>
            <li> You CANNOT go quickly with this</li>
            <li> you get ingrowns try Tend Skin or some medicated cream from Bikini Zone, they will help tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and covers all the areas.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I was super psyched when I received it and waited until after I showered and exfoliated to try it out.  </li>
            <li> the product wasn&#x27;t Good , so Bad Product Good Seller!!!</li>
            <li> I also try and do a quick loofah every time I am in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The epilators get many more of the tiny hairs than waxing does and fewer of them break.)  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li> I used the Emjoi Emagine it plucked the hair off my chin quickly and there was pain.</li>
            <li> but my skin quickly became use to the sensation and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I even follow up with my old epilator to make sure my legs are smooth.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The performance is adequate -</li>
            <li> Love it and would highly recommend over Brawn or Epilady.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel much discomfort, but I have fine hair like said before and exfoliate very often :)</li>
            <li> To keep it fair, I used my dominant hand (left) to hold the Emjoi and my right hand for the Philips.</li>
            <li> It does work pretty well as others have described, goes over your skin smoothly</li>
            <li> I had some different one, but this one really is the best I found so far.</li>
            <li> After using the first time I was amazed at how smooth my legs were.  </li>
            <li> I usually have stubble the day after shaving so being able to go 2 weeks after the first use was great.</li>
            <li> After carefully researching and comparing epilators, I bought this one because it seemed most ideal for my specific need.</li>
            <li> It does a good job with hands and legs, stomach, bikini line, underarms and even chin, leaving your body smooth and worry-free for at least a week or more, depending on your hair growth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product because of the longer intervals between hair removal..</li>
            <li> first two epilators I had were the Emjoi Light Caress 36 tweezer head model.  </li>
            <li> Expected it to be more efficient in retrieving hairs; I&#x27;ve never been able to get all of my hair and do have to use a razor afterwards for any remaining stray hair if I want to achieve that smooth, hairless look.</li>
            <li> and underarms the very first use.  </li>
            <li> Recently bought a much cheaper epilator made by philips and find it to be much more effective.</li>
            <li> I loved the concept although it took a long time</li>
            <li> It worked pertty good, but took way too long to use.</li>
            <li> As a long time user, I did not know it could be so good.  </li>
            <li> I loved the braun too, but it just took too long.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient.</li>
            <li> Speed level 2 almost makes hair removal a super fast and easy task.</li>
            <li> Recommend you use it in the bathroom with good light and a hard floor for easy clean up, because there is no receptacle to catch the tweezed hair.   </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this device - it works great and having the extra tweezing capacity gets the job done in less time.</li>
            <li> My underarm hairs are so light and sparse that I can pretty much get away without saving for a month or more (between living in AZ &amp; my hot flashes, I always were sleeveless blouses).</li>
            <li> i really need it completely smooth for special occasions.</li>
            <li> After that though, it is much more comfortable and the results really do last significantly longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> When this one dies, we&#x27;re sure to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> the new one is even better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the new product</li>
            <li> GET BETTER AS I BUY NEW AND IMPROVED VERSIONS</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> , it got all the fine fair hairs that previous epilators always have missed.</li>
            <li> : fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> But the process of doing both legs could easily take 30 minutes, sometimes much longer.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how easy and fast it is.  </li>
            <li> Best to follow the instructions and do short areas rather than a long swoop.</li>
            <li> Powerful and quick.</li>
            <li> I liked the Emagine in particular because reviewers specified it was fast and powerful.</li>
            <li> I have used Epis for 12 years and this one is fast, easy and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> The dual rotating heads make the process fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Very loyal to this brand as it really does work.</li>
            <li> So fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It exfoliated my skin, but not in a good way ... and even so, it wasn&#x27;t able to remove the ingrown hair or maybe it caused ingrown hair, not sure which of the two</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, it will hurt but the more and more you use it the less it will hurt and the better the results.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product or not for it was not working very well for me.</li>
            <li> iTS GREAT.REMOVES HAIR FAST AND EASILY .THIS</li>
            <li> Really!!</li>
            <li> The gears started to chip away from consistent use!</li>
            <li> I wish I had Emjoi first!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I would guess that I hadn&#x27;t done anything to remove my arm hair in over 3 months, so there was a significant amount of hair.</li>
            <li> and I usually do not need to epilate more than twice a month.</li>
            <li> At first when I used this epilator on my leg it felt like my flesh was being ripped out!</li>
            <li> I just did my underarms for the first time and there is NO HAIR THERE!</li>
            <li> Now that I have been consistent and patient, I have no doubts!</li>
            <li> I usually only need to use the Epilator every week or 2 - much better than when I was shaving every day or 2!</li>
            <li> I considered the fact that fingers are sensitive and that plucking the 1/2 inch hairs from them first really wasn&#x27;t a good way to judge the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li> Favorite purchase from Amazon so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for 4 years now, and it has not failed me yet!</li>
            <li> And, over time, the hair gets more and more fine and less of it.  </li>
            <li> I forgot I ever grew armpit hair in the first place!</li>
            <li> Even for first time ever use!</li>
            <li> The first was the original one</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> - I had both corded and rechargeable coil Epiladies (original and &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I purchased the original epilator that first came out at Hudsons.  </li>
            <li> First time epilator!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how I am so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> In fact so fast on an area with light amount of hair that I thought it wasn&#x27;t working when the sting of the removal stopped so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I only liked that it worked quickly</li>
            <li> Have had 4 or 5 previous models and this is by far  the Best</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out quickly and keeps my legs smooth for much longer.</li>
            <li> My course hair was removed very thoroughly and my legs were super smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, and does a good job with minimal number of passes.</li>
            <li> Love that my legs came out super soft but</li>
            <li> I watch a quick demo video on you tube and start with my right leg.</li>
            <li> I works perfectly fine and it is really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using emjoi epilators for years and have never had any complaints I thought I would try this newer model due to the good reviews, however I think I should have stuck with the tried and true.</li>
            <li> Sure, it might not catch fine hairs, which a razor can catch and &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; things out; however, it will get the thick, noticible hairs and a good amount of fine ones if the skin is properly exfoliated, and the product will continue to get the fine hairs if the head is cleaned as the instructions say.</li>
            <li> very nice product I wish everyone can get for $30 less like myself.</li>
            <li> Also lay a towel or something to catch the hair because it tend to fly around a little when it is plucked out by the machine.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at getting those little hairs.  </li>
            <li> This little machine works great and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> The Emojoi AP-18 is an absolutely amazing spilator and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high end epilator - worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old epilator and thought the dual head was a smart choice, but for me it is too bulky to really be effective on  my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that I would be better able to cover large areas such as my legs and arms for longer hair removal; specifically for summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that no one (consumer companies/websites) has made an effort of comparing epilators by shaving one leg with one top brand &amp; the other with another top brand for easy comparison&#x27;s sake!  </li>
            <li> Also important that you trim hair to a reasonable length to allow the tweezers to grab closer to skin.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to say that this is an amazing product and that it works and that yes, it has cons like the pain, but, it pays for itself in like 1-2 uses compared to paying for waxing, it hurts about the same as waxing</li>
            <li> Legs smooth for so much longer than with shaving,like 2 weeks longer.</li>
            <li> , you know there is nothing gentle or comfortable about ripping your hair out at the root.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it should do, and often times the area stays hair free for longer than it would shaving, but some areas it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my legs are silky smooth just yet but much much improvement.</li>
            <li> If you really want smooth legs, and you could afford it, I would suggest buying botht he emjoi and the braun.  </li>
            <li> I always epilate after I shower so that my skin is free of all lotion and deodorant, so I can&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> All in all, I honestly think it&#x27;s easier and quicker to go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> It is solid and the two tweezers epilation roles effectively.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if this realization transpires on AMAZON and potential customers in the EU be informed when buying it.</li>
            <li> Just accept that it&#x27;s a one-time deal IF you keep up with it, and that the results will be TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I love this product even though it doesn&#x27;t completely pull every hair out from the root.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll agree with some reviewers that say it&#x27;s almost too powerful.  </li>
            <li> IT was worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> is actually worth it.</li>
            <li> , I will spill my guts here, and you can decide for yourself if the pain is worth the end result.  </li>
            <li> and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Although I must warn those who are extremely sensitive to pinch-like pains, I absolutely love this epilator.</li>
            <li> make me hesitate to try more sensitive areas.    </li>
            <li> but I am not convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> All in all, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is truely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> * Is it worth the money? -</li>
            <li> Sooooo worth not having to worry every morning about shaving.  </li>
            <li> but this version seems to have more power because of the direct power supply.  </li>
            <li> I had the pink emjoi epilator for a year and loved it.</li>
            <li> My trouble spots are my shins and armpits, but after 3 months of use, I honestly feel they&#x27;re getting better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter and much more comfortable to hold than my former epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a year, I upgraded to an Emjoi Golden Caress (I think that&#x27;s what it was called) which could be plugged in or charged.</li>
            <li> Epilators also grab hair much closer to the skin level than wax can, so you can actually spend more of your time smooth!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had much success with this.</li>
            <li> and honestly I sometimes don&#x27;t even remember the last time I&#x27;ve used a shaver on my legs at all!</li>
            <li> and I hope that was useful to anyone.</li>
            <li> It sounds powerful and it looks powerful but in reality, it just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> And even so,if it did hurt the sacrifice is so worth it.</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t effective enough to keep me motivated</li>
            <li> That alone makes this worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I rarely used my Braun in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, compared to the Braun, the Emojoi AP-18 wins.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money</li>
            <li> , but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on my under arms and it does hurt but the end result was worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides my skin, my conscious feels better, too.  </li>
            <li> It helps to have a distraction ... put on a good TV show or the news, haha and DON&#x27;T try to cover big sweeping areas of skin....</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful.</li>
            <li> it hurts but it is so worth it</li>
            <li> its to early for me to note if my pubic hair has gotten finer, i would need atleast 5 more months to notice.</li>
            <li> and the motor seems so powerful it ........</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the two speed options, the cute travel bag, the crazy amount of tweezerheads, and the wicked awesome results.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this purchase as it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> the more often I do this and that the bumps were just a result of my sensitive skin not being used to be</li>
            <li> I used this just one time so far but am already in love with it.</li>
            <li> My old epilator used to take an hour or more.</li>
            <li> Does not remove hair as good as I expected it too.  </li>
            <li> It is not painful, although it felt tingly at first to me.  </li>
            <li> I own several Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> I am not afraid to wear skirts or capris anytime of the season now.</li>
            <li> I was using my old epilator, it hurt much more than this one.</li>
            <li> It just wasnt worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The Braun is still running but had lost the necessary speed to effectively pluck and do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> - It doesn&#x27;t result in razor burn at all, and it is nice (especially during the summer) not to worry about hair removal for a week at a time.</li>
            <li> and I love it...but don&#x27;t try it on sensitive areas without using numbing cream.</li>
            <li> Yes, this removes more hair, but it lacks a light which is a necessary element.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using the slower speed as it seems to pull the hair from the root where the faster speed seems to break a lot of the hairs off at the surface, meaning a faster regrowth and more frequent usage.</li>
            <li> I love my old Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it though.</li>
            <li> It was not painful at all around nipples (I was very worried that area would hurt a lot!</li>
            <li> But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> They were correct, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It works like its suposed to and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It cuts close enough to get rid of her stubbles, making her legs nice and feminine, like woman&#x27;s leg is suppose to be.</li>
            <li> but once it was done, the results were worth it.  </li>
            <li> I would like to know how can return or replace it to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the trick is to make sure that it makes the same sound while it is on your skin that it does when it is not on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It does have a powerful motor and with the two speeds there is plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Below is only based on my own experiences after a couple times epilating.</li>
            <li> and I am able to Epilate sensitive area&#x27;s like arm pits, bikini area, face.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it</li>
            <li> I had been using a smaller one for seven years now and really liked it</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this one, including many lying lechers who noted that it was relatively pain free, I decided it met both standards and ordered</li>
            <li> overall I liked it</li>
            <li> Alas I&#x27;m Very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The Braun (liked above)</li>
            <li> The Braun (liked above)</li>
            <li> I read about this one, and how much more power it had, because it was plugged directly in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> I rarely have to deal with my leg hair anymore</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the larger epilator.</li>
            <li> But if you can handle the sting, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> and so far we are quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that the head is too big to use effectively anywhere</li>
            <li> But after years of use, I&#x27;m buying the same kind again.</li>
            <li> But here it was worth it.</li>
            <li> So this if fun.</li>
            <li> but so worth it</li>
            <li> That is a blessing because I am so busy most of the time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product with more tweezers doesn&#x27;t work as good as my older one that had less tweezers..</li>
            <li> This product is POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed this happens more frequently the longer</li>
            <li> Powerful unit,</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This HURTS but it&#x27;s worth using instead of shaving.</li>
            <li> the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the rotating tweezers don&#x27;t stick out far enough not be the most effective.</li>
            <li> If it lasts for two years, it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I found that some spots are way more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li> I liked the Caress, but this one is almost pain-free (assuming you are used to regular epilator pain).  </li>
            <li> So worth it for the self-esteem level increase alone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to miss much more hair than my old one as well, making me go over legs over and over.</li>
            <li> Because of these two things I wouldn&#x27;t say this epilator is worth the price if you don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace my Emjoi Optima (which I loved and ran many years before its motor finally wore out).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt much (just a pinching feeling), didn&#x27;t leave a rash, was Very Fast, and unbelievably Easy</li>
            <li> This works, but I feel like my hairs break off easily when used on high speed</li>
            <li> You could easily catch or tear your skin with high number of rotating tweezers.</li>
            <li> It does hurt when you first began but with more use its just a tickle but make sure to put lotion on after unless you don&#x27;t the issue of dry skin after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very powerful device, and I don&#x27;t know if a cordless device would have as much power as the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of Epilator for years and this one is greatly improved over prior versions and hopefully due to better head design it will not burn up  in 3 or 4 years as the others have.  </li>
            <li> Okay now...when I first saw this I was very surprised to come a crossed something like this and cut on cost of waxing for myself.</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth worker, specially when you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> My hirsutism is pretty mild</li>
            <li> I got used to the pulling sensation pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> But, it seemed to work pretty well...and quickly, I might add.</li>
            <li> I have owned most every generation of epilator that has hit the market in the past 25 - 30 years, and this is by far the best one, so far.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I had never used an epilator before, however, this product is easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my older emjoi of many years (which I was very found of).</li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised when I operated the new Emagine on all those area and the only feeling I had was that of a pleasant massage!</li>
            <li> for touch-ups (ie - wax under-arms or legs first in large swaths, then touch-up with epilator for smooth skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Tylenol</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Emjoi because the process really does take a lot of time</li>
            <li> Does not do as good of a job removing the hair as other models I have purchased</li>
            <li> This unit is good for the legs cause you can do them faster ,but not any other part.</li>
            <li> I had each leg done in about 4 minutes and it did just as good a job as the other</li>
            <li> If it had worked better than it did, I would consider just buying a replacement head instead of a whole new epilator, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with the performance of this one, and I am tired of replacing them every year or two,</li>
            <li> This is corded - makes sense because it does have good power on both low and high settings.  </li>
            <li> This epilator is great because it has so much power and can get the job done quickly, efficiently, and with little to no pain.  </li>
            <li> I give the item a very high rating, but not at the very top, maybe a 9 out of a possible 10.</li>
            <li> right out of the  box</li>
            <li> Just showered right after used a quality exfoliating skin soap which I think minimized the redness.</li>
            <li> BUY IT RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li> I ended up finishing off my right arm with the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Emjoi Emagine misses a lot of hair, and when it doesn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t always get it right, breaking the hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> and I refuse to buy another epilator right now after dishing out a $100 on this one.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I end up shaving right after using it to get the rest of the hairs.</li>
            <li> and it works just right.</li>
            <li> And I was right:</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I choose the right one, but I did not.</li>
            <li> Used it right away</li>
            <li> and it is not fully water proof which the Braun is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Right after my shower, I tried it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why, but i can&#x27;t angle this thing right so that both sides of the tweezers touch my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this and used it right away, but the pain made it to the point where it took about 3 days to get all the hair out of my legs.</li>
            <li> just right and the direction of the epilator</li>
            <li> right still hurts</li>
            <li> I bought it right away.</li>
            <li> as well right?</li>
            <li> It is substantially faster to do my full legs in comparison to my old Philips which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The Braun worked great at first but after a few months the battery would die in about 15-20 minutes - which did not work if it took an hour to do my legs.</li>
            <li> The normal cap worked just fine for my legs and armpits, though I never used the epilator on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it has been stated , it does hurt when you first use it but with frequent use , it gets better after time.  </li>
            <li> In america they are not as popular, but the rest of the world uses these all the time, its unique and does what it needs to over any other product.</li>
            <li> It also gave me a chance to gather my necessary items to accompany my epilating adventure: witch hazel, cocoa butter with aloe, and a nice salt scrub (you can make this pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a good 24-48 hours before my pits felt back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It is loud, and when I first touched it to my skin it felt like getting zapped like static electricity.</li>
            <li> I am sure they could cut down 10 cents on the profits and put in a more durable gear.</li>
            <li> My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who likes silky smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> but most definitely doesn&#x27;t clean up everything the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST epilator for those who have thick, coarse hair that needs to be removed quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live near a waxing salon and could not upkeep as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Gets less painless as you use it more and more.  </li>
            <li> She says it works great, but I didn&#x27;t really push the subject.</li>
            <li> sure all areas were dry and free of lotions, creams, powders, etc</li>
            <li> The on/off/ slider is easy to intuit, and really, its much like shaving from there, except that you&#x27;re supposed to pull your skin taut as you go.</li>
            <li> I drank two mikes hard lemonades first and got a good buzz going and went to town on my legs!</li>
            <li> My hair grows VERY quickly and so if I want to keep things fairly hairless, I need to do it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I have used a cheaper epilator for the past two years and I have only been able to epliate the bottom of my legs, but this new one is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li> I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.    </li>
            <li> I have been epilating for many years (and I&#x27;m only 32 years old), and have gone thru many machines thru the years.</li>
            <li> It has been worth every penny as it gets just about everything on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> and i can shave with a razor or waxing quicker and come out with a lot better results without as much aggravation and unnecessary skin irritation like i experienced with this thing.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how great it works.</li>
            <li> Not really painful, just noticeable and unusual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once so far, and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as closely as traditional shaving does; however, the rewards of no next-day stubble are great!</li>
            <li> After the Emjoi broke, I purchased a slightly more expensive Philips Satin Perfect epilator, and I immediately noticed a marked difference in quality.</li>
            <li> It hurts at first, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> I epilate everything with the emjoi, legs, arms, tummy, mustache, underarms, and a pretty close (but not crazy) bikini line.  </li>
            <li> The thing that seemed to work best was light pressure, slow, short passes.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> This one is advertised as 72 tweezer epilator and therefore, should quickly remove hair from a large area.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had bought a warranty with Square Trade and got a full refund, which I used to buy a new Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Of course there is some discomfort, especially to new areas, but</li>
            <li> But the more important issue is that it&#x27;s head is quite large, and flat.</li>
            <li> But the more important issue is that it&#x27;s head is quite large, and flat.</li>
            <li> I did that 6 hours ago, and I still have little red dots, I&#x27;ll see if there is a cream or something, but.. really great product!  </li>
            <li> I was able to do my legs in little more time than it takes to shave them.</li>
            <li> With this I was able to epliate my armpits and bikini area for the first time and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back for 3-4 weeks which is better than my old epilator</li>
            <li> This device was not very painful, and has not pinched my skin at all.</li>
            <li> it glows when it catches the sunlight; so my hair is fine but dense and grows very, very long (thus seeing a professional for so many years!).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this Emjoi 72-Tweezer Head Epilator because I LOVE the Emjoi EpiSlim so much for my upper lip and underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to epilators, realize that you get what you pay for and don&#x27;t go cheap and then complain.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people familiar with this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to go over each area 3 or 4 times to make sure I got everything, which defeats the purpose of having multiple heads and a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t believe how smooth and hair free it left me.    </li>
            <li> After seeing such great results on my legs, I decided to start epilating my upper lip and underarms.</li>
            <li> The upper lip is not bad pain-wise, definitely better than waxing (and better than the wrinkles that waxing ultimately causes), but the underarms were quite a doosie the first time.</li>
            <li> Hair removal is very quick and it did not hurt because I use the epilator quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> It has super fast rotation.</li>
            <li> The design is also easy to clean and simple to disassemble.</li>
            <li> Clean up also simple and easy.</li>
            <li> I never want permanent hair removal because it reduces skin firmness, but I do have neurological issues that cause muscle spasms and the only scars I get are keloids, so this device works great for me and the with the updated gear design in this device, I know its going to last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, beauty is pain and when it costs only $73, and you can use AT HOME without getting ready to leave.</li>
            <li> However... the reason it hurts less is because this epilator doesn&#x27;t make good contact with your skin</li>
            <li> This is far superior compared to the emjoi portable with only 16 tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Very often, the Emjoi does not even pull hair out from the root, but just shaves it off somewhere near the top.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair so quickly and make this process go so much faster.</li>
            <li> Good so far I only have&#x27;t for couple weeks</li>
            <li> This is quite powerful, most likely because it&#x27;s using a cord not batteries.  </li>
            <li> Not that it really matters to me but posting the accurate color would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> Overall I achieved  smooth underarms and arms, semi smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> I might start trying it on my legs in the future, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with a few passes under my arms after my morning shower and no longer feeling the scratches of razor stubble by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m getting tattoos I do yogic breathing and hum quietly and constantly to myself, like an OM for those of you who have been to yoga LOL.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and the plucking was easy.  </li>
            <li> The first 3 to 4 times of use it did irritate my skin for the first hour but was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is definately up do date, works quickly, and the motor is quieter so the whole house doesn&#x27;t know I am shaving.  </li>
            <li> So overall good product so far...</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more!</li>
            <li> I will keep searching for the right epilator to make my legs soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> for me, the tops of my thighs, the bottom (or underside) of the top of my calves (like right below the back of the knee), etc.</li>
            <li> and it is not fully water proof which the Braun is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.n the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light</li>
            <li> For some reason my right leg stung more than my left, no idea why.  </li>
            <li> , I followed the directions in the manual of how to take the device apart to clean it and that was fine, but in trying to put it back together, I accidentally put the silver ring that surrounds the tweezers on backwards and now it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> Aside from that I am not going to evaluate the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; issue, but one quick tip: every epilator will hurt more if you leave your hairs grow long.</li>
            <li> also love that the cord is super long</li>
            <li> you are shaving - very important especially under the arms &amp; crotch areas.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that the machine its self feels very light</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an epilator I&#x27;ve been using for several years and it has been missing more and more hairs as well as breaking many off at the skin instead of removing the root.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that said if the hair is short would hurt more, and seems thruth because i had longer hair on the top of my legs and hurt more.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shape to hold and point at various angles.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it really does take much longer to grow back than I would have expected which is a great side benefit!</li>
            <li> I DO VERY MUCH LIKE the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachemnt</li>
            <li> this one very much.  </li>
            <li> It removes hair very fast.</li>
            <li> A recommendation though, try your best to scrub your legs well before use.. and watch for new hairs growing shortly after use.. because its expected you may get a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> If you epilate regularly the hairs will be much finer and extract without much ado after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I am delighted with the Emjoi and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it, i don&#x27;t have to shave every other day anymore, my skin feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing fine.</li>
            <li> The Emagine is able to remove hair much faster, more efficiently, and somehow with less pain.</li>
            <li> I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  </li>
            <li> I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  </li>
            <li> It did take a little adjusting to figure out a good angle.</li>
            <li> She likes the color and it works good, but she wishes it was a little wider.</li>
            <li> but after a little solder and tape its all good.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived at my house, I was excited to try out my new epilator.</li>
            <li> I think the pain is less because it so quickly and effectively pulls out the hair.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that claim this product is quicker because of the two head action; this is the main reason I bought this item.</li>
            <li> It was not painful for me, but I have waxed and have a high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I was very much hoping the extra tweezers would make the hair removal process faster and more efficient, not the case.</li>
            <li> I have had great results in most areas of my body and only noticed major discomfort in the center of my chest and armpits.</li>
            <li> It was delivered to a different address on my street and Amazon insinuated some type of fraud which I feel was directed to me.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and and purchased this AP-18 epilator because it was rated number #1.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m willing to attempt to pull off the hairy look.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work great because it didn&#x27;t keep its charge long enough.  </li>
            <li> seeing how much it costs!).</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that i have used so</li>
            <li> was only be a top choice.</li>
            <li> I had about 2 days of hair growth on my legs when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on my ummmm nether region/bikini area and again, it was a teeth clencher the first time around</li>
            <li> of warning: This will hurt the first time you do it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with this model</li>
            <li> First of all, if you follow the directions and move the machine in the direction of hair growth, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> Second, after using Emagine&#x27;s two rows of tweezers on my thighs I can say they are more irritated than they&#x27;ve ever been with epilation.</li>
            <li> I will admit the first time I turned it on</li>
            <li> (This is my first ever epilator.)</li>
            <li> This epilator caught my eye as i first saw it on sale on [...].</li>
            <li> This area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> But then, it wasn&#x27;t removing a whole lot, either!  </li>
            <li> To first time</li>
            <li> Absolutely!  </li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I am pretty used to waxing legs and under arms.</li>
            <li> , follow the instructions about taking a hot bath or shower and exfoliating just before using the epilator.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;m a man</li>
            <li> The Braun silk-epil is so much better and actually grabs the hairs which it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I was actually able to use an epilator on my legs for the first time and I have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This machine does exactly that.</li>
            <li> I took a hot shower before and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> The way this Emjoi is constructed, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, although only time will tell for sure.  </li>
            <li> This epilator does exactly as it states....</li>
            <li> The first one I bought died in about 11 months.</li>
            <li> glad there&#x27;s finally an epilator for us vets.</li>
            <li> I have used epilators since the first one on the market, Epilady, in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and my skin is just absolutely smooth and soft after.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes of hovering this thing over my leg and not being able to place it on my skin, I finally gathered up my courage.</li>
            <li> for the first minute or so.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all; it just scares you the first time.  </li>
            <li> Several reviewers remarked about making sure when bathing to scrub the shaved areas well to exfoliate &amp; I don&#x27;t always remember to do that.  </li>
            <li> Pretty soon it was jamming every 3-4 seconds while epilating</li>
            <li> I had bumps on my thighs after the first time , and after applying the witch hazel, they were gone in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It worked better than my last one.  </li>
            <li> I owned a Braun first, then a Panasonic, and then another Braun.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> It does take some time and at first hurts</li>
            <li> but with the epilator you can expect the consistent pain to take awhile.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator i&#x27;ve ever owned,</li>
            <li> It is far easier to see whether the you&#x27;ve been successful with  removing the hair with an epilator, and with this one, you do need to go over the same spot a few times sometimes, but mostly, it does a great job first time round.</li>
            <li> - Moderately, but quieter than many electric razors.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a seasoned epilator, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> First time epilator...</li>
            <li> you always feel the prickliness and the first epilating process...</li>
            <li> and I know it will only get better.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used</li>
            <li> This epilator worked exactly like their website said it would.</li>
            <li> The first time - it hurt ALOT.  </li>
            <li> the first time i used it, it hurt like a @#$%</li>
            <li> I started with an inexpensive Braun model as my first epilator.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator</li>
            <li> and you will probably find you need more than one pass over areas, and then sometimes have to go over and over the same hair before it goes.  </li>
            <li> The factors I&#x27;m most concerned about are speed and efficiency, and in those respects it&#x27;s a big improvement over the panasonic one that it&#x27;s replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than some of the others, but handles armpits pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Ok about the same as others, but not cordless</li>
            <li> it does hurt first time using it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator though, so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring.</li>
            <li> it really works and well well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews and watched even more on Youtube.</li>
            <li> After the first month of use, I noticed the tweezers didn&#x27;t pick up the hair as well.</li>
            <li> Today was the day of discovery: I used my Emjoi AP-18 Emagine for the first time.</li>
            <li> far as pain goes, this is definitely the most comfortable epilator I have used.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than double what the Emagine cost me!</li>
            <li> word of advice, though: Don&#x27;t use an epilator for the first time if you have somewhere</li>
            <li> really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> The dual heads work well, but the hair on any section of the body only grows mostly one way.  </li>
            <li> You cannot expect it to get them all on the first use.  </li>
            <li> being said, I would gladly pay an extra $5-10 dollars for Emjoi to get their act together and use quality materials for the gearing on the heads/body of this epilator.  </li>
            <li> First time is a killer.</li>
            <li> I did maybe the first week or 2 and haven&#x27;t needed to since.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s just more constant as you&#x27;re going on and on around and around rather than</li>
            <li> I have tried using it after a hot shower like suggested but still cannot handle the pain.  </li>
            <li> It pays for itself on the first 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s my first time</li>
            <li> It is painful,especially the first time.</li>
            <li> My current epiator works better even tho</li>
            <li> The first one burned out after 2 years, but we are hoping that was just a lemon</li>
            <li> Perhaps as far as epilators go it is a good product, but I still found it to be incredibly time consuming and painful</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time epilating, I would recommend \\&quot;tapping\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to be 100% thorough the first time.</li>
            <li> The first epilator I purchased was a Braun Silk-epil 7 for $120.00 vs $80 for the Emojoi brand.</li>
            <li> may be different from others, but my favorite thing about the Emojoi is that it is corded.</li>
            <li> , I waited for over 48 hours before trying it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Is it unbearable, even the first time?  </li>
            <li> I tried many different approaches - with the growth (as the guide says), against the growth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so</li>
            <li> My first thought upon using this was,</li>
            <li> (1-2 months after first use).</li>
            <li> This is the fifth epilator I tried since I first started using electrical epilators.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the epilator.</li>
            <li> First time epilator...</li>
            <li> I bought my first epilator two weeks</li>
            <li> So I figured one with more tweezers and the hair lifting bar would definitely do the trick</li>
            <li> Not only did I save some money but it works better that both of the emojis I bought.</li>
            <li> The Emjo Ap-18 is intimidating at first</li>
            <li> My first time ever in using a depilator</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> the Item i received does not work... pretty dissapointed when i had to have it mailed all the way over from US to Singapore, paying all the postage</li>
            <li> works much better and faster than my smaller cordless emjoi silken</li>
            <li> I tried a different type of hair remover machine (a top name) &amp; it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This item works exactly as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> the area first....</li>
            <li> I love this thing &amp; I will never go back to shaving!  </li>
            <li> My arms &amp; bikini area always come out soft &amp; smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> My legs have thicker hair so it may not always come out silky smooth, but it gets rid of all the visible hair (which is all I&#x27;m worried about), but when I am worried about being smooth to the touch, I can always go over it with a razor and it will still last a whole week.</li>
            <li> I love that they can get the shortest of hairs, so I don&#x27;t have to grow my hair out to have it waxed, and that I can remove hair from my entire body without having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Epilating irritated my skin at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pleased overall</li>
            <li> This epilator removed the fine hair with less discomfort and more thoroughly than waxing; and without the redness, burning and dryness that follows the use of creams.</li>
            <li> My first epilator, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> - it gets the job done so much faster!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is not my first</li>
            <li> However, for about the same price I truly believe you can get a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different methods and products.</li>
            <li> It is painless, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair even after several runs.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic and alarmed the first time I used the Emjoi AP-18 Epilator.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I learned to brace myself for the first 30 seconds on the first leg.  </li>
            <li> I used it several more times</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was slower, but it&#x27;s actually more efficient than my last one.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for my legs.</li>
            <li> are most likely not used to epilating.</li>
            <li> I regret ever picking up my first razor and shaving cream bottle.</li>
            <li> yes it was a bit stinging at first...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too wide for me to try and tidy up that porch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating since they first came out in the &#x27;80s  </li>
            <li> the first time-</li>
            <li> I have owned 5 Emjoi epilators over the last 15 years and this is the most flexible as it rolls over my knobby knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now and they usually last me about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Its my first time using it,</li>
            <li> things first, I like the packaging that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what the directions instructed that I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it seemed to break the hears more often than actually pulling them out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And since I didn&#x27;t have to wait for a charge, I was able to do my entire body all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first two were by Braun and I bought each of them in the $50-60 price range.  </li>
            <li> My first use of the Emjoi produced somewhat satisfactory results, but I still had to tweeze some hairs away.</li>
            <li> first epilator.</li>
            <li> Even in the first trial it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> i m trying epilater  the first time.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilator.</li>
            <li> Using a corded epilator is better because there is no question of the battery charge lasting, and it is faster (as I&#x27;ve heard from friends that use battery powered ones).</li>
            <li> There is no way this would ever get all the hairs on my legs, no matter how many times I went over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> So now, I have to use it more often because parches of hair are growing at different times.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I noticed I had a lot of ingrown hairs at first after using this product</li>
            <li> and I had to use every couple of days at first.</li>
            <li> I had to send back the epilator as it did not perform any better than my 36 tweezer head.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this product and it takes a very short time for me to epilate my legs!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is higher quality, as you would expect with a much higher priced epilator.</li>
            <li> My first was the Braun 5270</li>
            <li> So, I knew to expect a much higher sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first saw this product review on You Tube</li>
            <li> Besides, anyone noticing that one missed hair has bigger issues to deal with :-).</li>
            <li> I just dropped and broke my first one, so I needed this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Any hair that returns after a wax is slower, and there aren&#x27;t so many hairs to pull at the same time.</li>
            <li> I guess the 72 heads help minimize the pain, although on the flip side, I find that the Emoji doesn&#x27;t get as many as the finer, smaller hairs that the Braun used to.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 18 months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared for pain in the first use if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot at first..</li>
            <li> Even the whole bikini area!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First time I used it I felt some sting but not now.</li>
            <li> Well at first anyways, I think my body turned off pain signals to prevent me from going into shock...</li>
            <li> First let me say, I don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li> It was such an improvement to waxing I ended up taking more than I started out to and taking it all off.     </li>
            <li> my first one I bought was in the 90s...</li>
            <li> At first we had to learn how to use an epilator -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and that&#x27;s my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It works a lot better/faster than my old Braun, but I wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost a year consistently, and am overall pleased with it..</li>
            <li> It is my first epilator to use and do not regret it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> The first 3-4 weeks I was beginning to question my decision to not shave cause of the stinging pain and the time epilating took,</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> She uses it on her legs all the time and constantly says how much better using an epilator is than shaving.  </li>
            <li> My first still works after over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I love this for removing facial hair!  </li>
            <li> recommend this product to people who are trying out epilators for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun was my first epilator</li>
            <li> Does it work better enough for the price tag?</li>
            <li> but this is my First Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I had to go over several areas more than once.</li>
            <li> My first epilator was called an Epilady</li>
            <li> product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, rip the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> I read MANY reviews prior to ordering this epilator</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> Better than shaving, results last longer.</li>
            <li> I  have found much better results with exfoliating daily and using exfoliating gloves before</li>
            <li> Does in get every hair on the first pass?</li>
            <li> Again, you get used to it, and truthfully it really only hurts the first time because that is when you have the most hair.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say, this was my FIRST TIME using ANY EPILATOR, and this is my FIRST time Experience; I will Update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT, THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING ANY EPILATOR.</li>
            <li> First areas I used it on, felt \\&quot;Prickly\\</li>
            <li> I still have bumps &amp; some red pin marks where the skin was caught, more then the ForeArms.&lt;br /&gt;Lower Back/</li>
            <li> EXCEPT the closer you get to the more *fragile* Zones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets close enough to the skin to be able to pick up the hair without going over and over and over the area.</li>
            <li> and at first is a sea of red&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it sure beats shaving multiple times a week and worked well for my first epilator ever.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say this is the first epilator i have owned.</li>
            <li> but because i think i would prefer using an Epilator while i take a HOT bath.</li>
            <li> The flip side to this is buying the Braun SE7681 with the battery dying but being able to use while i take a HOT bath, so i plan to purchase the Braun SE7681 Only because i can use this while i take a bath.</li>
            <li> My first on was also an emjoi and</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> Now if ur starting out it&#x27;s going to hurt more</li>
            <li> tooooo funny.  </li>
            <li> AFTER THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> Let it lightly ride along your skin and let the tweezing action do all the work.</li>
            <li> so it comes in soft and light)</li>
            <li> It does not catch many hairs, and what hair it does catch it breaks above the surface of the skin rather than pulling it out at the root.  </li>
            <li> My old epilator had a light</li>
            <li> but you often need to go back and forth more than once</li>
            <li> So for now i will still shave my legs but at least i will have a great bikini line and underarms.</li>
            <li> Five hours later I have way more stubble than if I had shaved.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> well the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> i want one with a double head like this and more tweezers</li>
            <li> and i want one with the most tweezers on it like 40 tweezers or above</li>
            <li> It is even better than the former model.  </li>
            <li> I am a seasoned epilator, and thought I&#x27;d share my experience for those who are debating which epilator to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t stand the sensation on my armpits - IT REALLY HURTS!</li>
            <li> In addition, because of the lighting in the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light we all have so if you are there with your husband</li>
            <li> I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient when you first start using be star</li>
            <li> So I did some research and most of what I found suggested to shave and exfoliate the day before prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> but after the first month or so, there was no discomfort whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this epilator and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I did have quite a bit of irritation but I tryed benadryl spray and it cleared it up.</li>
            <li> and this was my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator (and</li>
            <li> I found worked pretty well:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as close as shaving, but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the last epilator.  </li>
            <li> They all are going to have you experience some pain when you first begin.  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;m deep rooted. :)</li>
            <li> of it, it still didn&#x27;t get the hair the first time around.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it five stars because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since I&#x27;m a first time user.  </li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi products and definitely prefers using tweezer head epilator to shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li> Your legs do get use to using emjoi if you use it consistently</li>
            <li> When I first used it -before</li>
            <li> After 12 months, the adaptor stopped consistently providing power to the unit and it would start and stop depending on the angle</li>
            <li> The jams became more and more frequent until it was perpetually jammed</li>
            <li> Hair grows back thinner and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> and I definitely had to go over spots more than once.</li>
            <li> First of it hurts like hell and it darkens my skin which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> After using this for so many years i actually have places where the hair is not growing anymore without doing laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This is my first Epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a clock for a present and enjoyed it for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> They would spin when I first turned it on, but as soon as it came in contact with my skin/hair, they would freeze up.</li>
            <li> It felt exactly like someone was pulling hair from my legs one at a time.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does hurt the first time</li>
            <li> I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back to the Philips Epilator again.</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well (the first one I broke when it got too close to my towel and threads</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s powerful even when cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating using the emagine is fast and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You still have to go over the area more than once, but it does the job and such a time saver.</li>
            <li> Virtually no discomfort, easy to use and clean, and worth every penny I spent.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used an epilator it did hurt.</li>
            <li> and I tried it more than once and the pain feels the same.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s well worth the investment for those who doesn&#x27;t really like to shave and/or wax.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> After reviewing several makes and models, this came out on top.</li>
            <li> but with this one, it is so fast that I thought it wasn&#x27;t getting the hair, but it was, it just didn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li> Well just came in and at first I thought it had cut me, well read then instructions again.</li>
            <li> I have used many different appliances.  </li>
            <li> My particular device caused mild scratches on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> If I let it go two weeks or more, then epilating becomes much more uncomfortable as you are pulling out so many hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time using an epilator ever</li>
            <li> The epilator is not working as it did when I first received it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 7/2014: Recently, I have found that the epilator teeth lock up and make a loud sound when I have used it for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried using it again about 3 days later, and to my surprise I love it.</li>
            <li> Having used an epilator for many years, this is my 3rd or 4th one.  </li>
            <li> The first time I did my legs was probably the longest, maybe 30 minutes?  </li>
            <li> I love that it takes time to grow back like waxing, but I can just do touch ups once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I used to wax, this saves me so much money and no ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> First of all for some reason it takes forever to do your legs.</li>
            <li> As a woman from the Indian subcontinent, I have lots of coarse hair and hair removal is something I&#x27;ve lived with for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Too much pain!</li>
            <li> But I actually thought they worked better on longer hair than shorter hair.</li>
            <li> : it is fast!</li>
            <li> (mine are pretty boney and angular).  </li>
            <li> : it is fast!</li>
            <li> (mine are pretty boney and angular).  </li>
            <li> It definitely took some getting used to, and I had to make sure to have a razor bump gel handy for immediately afterwards, but that&#x27;s expected with something that is ripping hair out from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because, after reading many reviews on the different products out there, it seemed to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was able to see where the hair was actually tweezed out.</li>
            <li> Do not go for perfection the first time as I did and scrapes and irritations will be avoided.  </li>
            <li> Even with that I was able to wear deodorant next day with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It does look it lot more intimating that is actually is.</li>
            <li> There are so many tweezers and it moves so fast that you can barely feel it pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li> As a first timer, the pain was bearable.</li>
            <li> It does take a minute the first time</li>
            <li> I will use it only because it has more tweezers and it removes the hair faster.</li>
            <li> The epilator is also made of a light weight plastic which really surprised me given the price.</li>
            <li> and I can say that though the difference is ignorable overall, but Braun worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;pros:</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an epliator.  </li>
            <li> The directions say that you can use it on your face (by angling it so that only one disc is touching the area), but I haven&#x27;t tried that and will probably continue to just tweeze there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first use it: break hair and miss hair here and there.</li>
            <li> But it gets better the second time at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to be willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I showered and used this for the first time yesterday for my arms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this must-have gem!!</li>
            <li> any case, I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years (so it&#x27;s not like I just started) and it&#x27;s great, but not nearly as good as waxing (which I can usually get a good 2 weeks out of), but great for in between waxings and is much cheaper than waxing (if you go somewhere) and less of a hassle (if you wax at home, which I do).</li>
            <li> I am new to epilating but wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with the Philips&#x27; performance at grabbing the last 10% of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with my previous Emjoi when I used it while it was plugged in, but the difference between the two models is absolutely night and day!</li>
            <li> The pain on the rest of my leg was definitely less than what I had experienced with my old epilator, though I wouldn&#x27;t say there was none</li>
            <li> Design isn&#x27;t great unless you are super model thin...</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> Holy WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I had my eye on this epilator for weeks, finally made the purchase, and was very excited to get it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> What a pity, since so many other people had a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> In any case, Emjoy by far better than other epilators I had before and much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> the epilator at right angle to the area, hold the skin taut and move it gently in circular motion&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are mostly around uneven spots, like the knees and shinbone, and are usually pretty fine.  </li>
            <li> Even when my underarm skin was still delicate and in process of healing the Emagine did an excellent job, very quick and with much less discomfort than anticipated.</li>
            <li> But I noticed it had a tendency to snap off the hair rather than pulling it, and the epilator never was very good at getting all the little tiny hairs on my legs, leaving them stubbly.</li>
            <li> The box comes filled with everything from a brush to clean the device with to a full blown, down to the nitty-gritty manual.</li>
            <li> The pain is very minimal at first and now I honestly don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice safety feature that prevents you from pressing the heads down to hard upon your skin, which is a great added feature.</li>
            <li> , the extra heads do what you would expect, cover large areas more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I bought the corded type as I am certain it will last for many years.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have a little  guiding light</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be getting to replace my old Braun that is on its way out.</li>
            <li> A tip for nubies to epilating, I first plucked the really stubborn hairs from my legs with regular tweezers around the ankles and the shin will be the most sensitive&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Yes, the first hair ripping was a bit of a challenge, but I&#x27;d just do as much as I could stand and do more the next day.  </li>
            <li> I found that this model was not quite as effective as the other model I had, and it tends to break the hairs off rather than pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest for the first time not to go over the area too much and get it better on the next epilation time.  </li>
            <li> I have not had to do grooming of any kind in a week, so it is well worth the little bit of pain.</li>
            <li> My hair grows in very light and often times, I don&#x27;t realize how long it is until I sit in the sun a certain way because the hair growth is so soft and so light.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have a harder time grabbing fine hairs and doesnt do as good of a job of removing hairs after a single pass.</li>
            <li> , I felt stubble (Winter is hard on a chick!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from getting laser hair removal, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was a die hard fan of the Philips Satin Perfect epilator.</li>
            <li> I will also mention here that because your hair grows at different rates, the first time you clear your legs, whether it be with waxing or epilating, because all of the hairs have grown out, your legs will be much more smooth, and remain smooth for a longer period than subsequent epilations.  </li>
            <li> Even after years of doing it, I get bright red dots on the areas that I epilate and they usually last for 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> Not only is it faster, but it&#x27;s also more effective and causes less pain and redness.  </li>
            <li> The pain I experienced on my upper lip was MINIMAL compared to threading.</li>
            <li> The item was received 2 or 3 days earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but so far, this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> As a waxing aficionado of having a professional set-up at home for 6 years I began to dread the once a month set-up and clean-</li>
            <li> Set realistic expectations, know that it will hurt, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> In addition it was almost completely painless, I think because the hairs were coming out cleanly instead of being tugged and missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also caused a lot of ingrown hairs and dry skin, though I&#x27;m sure I needed to exfoliate and moisturize more regularly.</li>
            <li> It also does a much better job on my armpits, but of course, you have to be sure your armpits are COMPLETELY dry (also necessary with the legs).  </li>
            <li> I also found it more quiet than my previous epilators which is nice</li>
            <li> This is a clean and not messy way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> The emjoi got the hard-to-see hair in a few minutes, where waxing could take 20 minutes or more, and I wouldn&#x27;t be 100% hair free.    </li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for approximately 18 years and this is by far the best ever.  </li>
            <li> So having brought this item as it has more heads than others I found it to be too big to really use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely cost effective and simple to use.</li>
            <li> go over my legs several times to be sure as much hair has been removed, and it takes 10 minutes tops to finish with both legs.</li>
            <li> I find the best technique is to go in slow, tiny circles in the direction</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this awesome gadget.</li>
            <li> The best thing&#x27;s how slowly the hair grew back.</li>
            <li> and you can upgrade to the Emjoi and be done much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A year later - I still love this.  </li>
            <li> This product is only good physically</li>
            <li> Over time, Emjoi is capable of permanently removing most, if not all, of the hair from the larger areas of the body, and that&#x27;s a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using depilatory for ten years and this one is light yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> I spend almost as much time as I did when I used to shave many moons ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;ve never epilated before it will likely hurt.  </li>
            <li> It went good until suddenly these red bumps started appearing.</li>
            <li> I noticed if i used it just after i take a shower when my pores are open works better and don&#x27;t pull too much.</li>
            <li> The price point is good as well because there are more expensive ones out there that can&#x27;t do what this can do.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so for the most part, it did take most of the hair out...</li>
            <li> i am really happy of the product, i like it because it is fast and  doesn hurt comparing to the other one , i barely feels it</li>
            <li> This new model is very fast  and efficient!  </li>
            <li> So worth the price and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Braun&#x27;s SE 3170 silk epilator, and this was infinitely better!  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and this product didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs on my top lip or arm.</li>
            <li> Such a clean alternative to waxing!</li>
            <li> Pain was practically non-existent(1), less than waxing that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> It is super LOUD!</li>
            <li> know a lot of people are more familiar with wax than they are with epilating, so let me compare them a little.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove a large area of unwanted body hair within a relatively short period of time, so the device is fairly fast as well.</li>
            <li> Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  </li>
            <li> Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  </li>
            <li> One positive...</li>
            <li> I decided to make the purchase because of a friend and all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased Emjoi AP-18, based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush that is easy to hold and easy to use on the epilator head.</li>
            <li> I have been using a single wheeled epilator for years and was happy with everything about it, except how long it took me to do my legs.</li>
            <li> The Emgaine also amazed me with the short hairs it was able to grab - it says that it will remove hairs as short as .5mm length, and that is absolutely accurate</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is advertised as being able to rip out 1 mm long hairs.  </li>
            <li> If you soak in a hot bath before you epilate, it&#x27;s much easier on your skin.</li>
            <li> At first I was intimidated by this product because I saw the tweezers rotate so fast</li>
            <li> This head is more enclosed; I can&#x27;t tell if hair is inside the head, and it&#x27;s not clear to me how well rinse water will evaporate, if at all.</li>
            <li> It also had a light which was very helpful for seeing those thin fair hairs.</li>
            <li> With the caveat that I&#x27;ve only had this epilator for a few days, so far I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as described, takes all the hair off where ever I have tried it without much discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and it takes more than twice as long.</li>
            <li> It may appear at a higher price point although consider how much time and $ you&#x27;re saving by doing it at home.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my lower legs every few days for almost a month and my last epilation was by far the best!</li>
            <li> it took me almost 45 minutes to pretty much give my self the hollywood.</li>
            <li> , it works pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The technology sure has come a long way.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi does exactly what it claims to do, which is unusual in this day and age.  </li>
            <li> I have used many Emjoi products for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it goes much easier after the first 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> However, this product is not wireless but seems to be more powerful than other emjoi</li>
            <li> It works extremely well and leaves the skin hair free and smooth, but I swear to God that I felt like punching my daughter in the face if she didn&#x27;t stop.  </li>
            <li> In 1998, I bought my first epilator, which was the Emjoi Gently Gold</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see how this brand performs long term.</li>
            <li> I prepped my skin like the directions say and sat for hours the first time with my headphones in and watched a movie while I went over and over my leg without much to show for it.  </li>
            <li> and if there are many hairs you&#x27;re on for a LONG job</li>
            <li> Like you end up getting a lot of ingrown hair and you have to make sure the hair grows back enough before you can use it again to make your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I removed hair was much slower to minimize the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I can wait a week or two between treatments vs shaving which I&#x27;d have to do pretty much every day</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased a cheap epilator at the drug store (in desperation, I must add, as it was the only one available!)</li>
            <li> I like the plug-in aspect, because it never loses power, and I like how powerful it is.  </li>
            <li> (It is normal to miss one or two that are super fine hairs or too short for epilation).</li>
            <li> Not bad but prefer my old Braur.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t go full bore into a thicker area or sensitive area.</li>
            <li> especially now since im pregnant, with no energy to shave my legs, and being 7 months pregnant its</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the usage tips provided to care for your skin such as bathing in hot water and exfoliating with a lufa before epilating, the Emjoi AP-18 is quite accurate in removing most hairs.</li>
            <li> It sounds simple enough to hold it as instructed my Emjoi, but there is a technique to it, and you naturally get better the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was gritting my teeth the first time I epilated my underarms.</li>
            <li> Other more sensitive areas will not be so pain free, But it&#x27;s the price of beauty.  </li>
            <li> The point tho is if you have any prior experience it is not bad at all!</li>
            <li> Dealing with a cord (which is conveniently very long) is way better than worrying about a dwindling battery life and a two hour charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after the first 5 minutes it was clear that her old epilator with almost died battery was much better than a new Emjoi.</li>
            <li> The next leg was very quick.</li>
            <li> I actually was replacing an older Emjoi - an upgrade - and am I glad I did, there is so much power -</li>
            <li> I just like it dry better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much painless to use everywhere, except the pubic area, which I think is because the hairs are so much thicker than everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the one from the first Emjoi anymore and my Square Trade warranty had expired, but I found another that fit at one of the big box stores.  </li>
            <li> Plus I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt; - after it gets warm, the epilator works even less</li>
            <li> Although I have to say that the pain is minimal, it is more the shock/surprise factor for first time use.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair quickly and completely without my having to go over a spot five or six times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, there are only 2 speed settings and an off switch.</li>
            <li> the daily upkeep is easy.</li>
            <li> if its too long it will hurt a whole lot more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;*Take</li>
            <li> hair from my arms was so easy to take off and hasn&#x27;t come back at all for over a week now!</li>
            <li> It does rotate pretty fast, and I can&#x27;t tell if it would actually pull out the fine hairs or just break them, but</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use baby powder to dry the area before using it and it seems to work better at grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient (I can do pretty much my whole body in 30 min)</li>
            <li> Overall I  am very satisfied I won&#x27;t go back to shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this one is because I wanted to do my job on my own and in less time.</li>
            <li> This epilator is not only reliable, it is easy to use and performs its job well.</li>
            <li> It started to make a loud clicking sound, and would intermittently stop running (it would run, click real loud, stop, click, run, click, etc).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems gripping it, but then I always have dry hands when I use it.</li>
            <li> Left me feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my arms super soft, however, so I keep using it (below the elbow of course).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not like getting a nice massage in a candle lit room, but it does what it advertises at much less pain than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Shaving under the arms is much easier than it seems it would be - again, make sure to keep the skin stretched.</li>
            <li> I love it because it has cut the time in 2/3rds of my old epilator, which was slow and had to make many, many passes over the same area to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> and i want an eplilator thats of good quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Seemed to do a good job.it felt like little pins ,but nothing you can&#x27;t live with .</li>
            <li> I do feel that the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t work the best on its high settings, i feel it skips over or breaks the hair</li>
            <li> the Philips&#x27; single row of tweezers felt more nimble going over bony areas.</li>
            <li> single works more persise.</li>
            <li> but when looking to do large areas the recharging is a pain.</li>
            <li> I bought the Emjoi hoping it would shorten the amount of time it takes to go over large areas like the legs.  </li>
            <li> The large head makes if diffucult to reach some areas.  </li>
            <li> - so be smart about where you use it.</li>
            <li> Large tweezer surface</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who needs to shave large areas of your body.</li>
            <li> but certainly is tolerable in some places.</li>
            <li> The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun.</li>
            <li> The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wait until the hair gets to a certain length like when IT used to wax.</li>
            <li> the head is so large that it does not reach some angles and curves.</li>
            <li> Completely defective from the very first use.</li>
            <li> Of course it hurts a bit at first use, as some reviewers have mentioned, but tweezing hair will most likely hurt,especially in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> it is so nice to not have to mess with wax anymore.</li>
            <li> It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not a man-bear, I&#x27;m a blond white male, not thick hair just fairly noticeable on the legs.</li>
            <li> in all, maybe this works better for people with lighter hair, but after using it for about 6 months, I&#x27;m buying a new braun epilator since they actually make contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> It makes removing hair from new areas nearly pain free.</li>
            <li> It works great and the hair takes much less time to come back than shaving.</li>
            <li> Another slight problem is it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs on my knee cap, but even regular shaving does not do really great job on that area for me...</li>
            <li> This is truly the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever used....and there have a few previous ones.  </li>
            <li> the cord one does not get on my nerves and it stays super powerful, so i will never go back to a rechargeable or battery EVER again.</li>
            <li> I think I have about average hair growth and density, so I cannot promise that everyone will have my same amazing results, but I cannot say enough nice things about this device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can only be used corded-that&#x27;s fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Emjoi can only be used while its connect to the cord my Pananosic works just fine without the cord n in the shower.</li>
            <li> My legs are so so as i have a mixture of fine hair and coarse on my legs.</li>
            <li> It does not last 6 weeks unless your you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with location on the body because I tried them all nor does it have to do with coarse or fine hair, tried that too.</li>
            <li> My leg hair varies between fine and medium coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and perhaps my hairs are too fine to get a hold of</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because the hairs further up my shin and thigh are quite fine, so they tend to break before they can be tweezed out by the spinning discs.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this epilator did NOT work on the fine hair at all and only plucked the darker ones!</li>
            <li> All it did to the fine blonde hair is break it off.</li>
            <li> I researched and found this product to have very high ratings and so purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My own experience with most things with a built-in battery is that they start slowing down as the battery drains and eventually completely die (cell phones, Bluetooth, tablets, tooth brush, electric razor, handheld vacuum, etc.)</li>
            <li> I saw the Emagine in a catalog, (and was seduced by the snazzy, red color more than anything), and figured that my old Emjoi HAD to be less effective.</li>
            <li> It takes me more than hald an hour to finish my right leg half way to the thighs.</li>
            <li> This little machine is amazing.</li>
            <li> I already own a little Energizer battery pack that I can plug it into</li>
            <li> My skin feels warm and a little</li>
            <li> Honestly, it just stung a little bit when I used it.</li>
            <li> The double sided heads are good for one reason, not because they pluck double the hair, because any seasoned epilator knows, you have to come to hair at the right angle, but because you can go back and forth on your arm pits with out having to turn it around.</li>
            <li> It misses a lot of fine hair and the hair seems to grow back quite fast.</li>
            <li> I would say my pain tolerance is pretty high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommed Emjoi AP-18 to anyone interested in purchasing an epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epillator, read the high reviews and opted for this one.  </li>
            <li> maybe a little overwhelming because it is REALLY powerful</li>
            <li> This is just as good as waxing, expect in the hard to reach places</li>
            <li> I have very fair light skin, and very dark, course, thick (body) hair.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s because there are 72 tweezers working hard to make your skin silky smooth, :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One cannot complain about fast regrowth or ingrowns in relation to epilators, because that&#x27;s really individual to each person&#x27;s body, so the factors i believe are important are:    </li>
            <li> The Emjoi is much too bulky to fit close enough on my fingers and hands.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t really come with much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Claim: 72 Tweezer Heads for Fast, Long-Lasting Results</li>
            <li> I believe I would have been better prepared mentally, if I the manufacturer did not use \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; so often.</li>
            <li> , it was very unsightly.</li>
            <li> I was shaving 3-4 times a week to stay completely smooth, especially during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> I am really frugal and strapped for time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a reduction in ingrown hairs vs. shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have to use it about once a week because my hair grows fast</li>
            <li> so I was intimadated by everyone complaining about how much it hurts you BABIES.</li>
            <li> It was hyped up too much on the description.   </li>
            <li> The entire time the website never changed from saying \\&quot;Available for backorder ships within 10 business</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> + it is MUCH faster than another models      </li>
            <li> I was prescribed a 4% hydroquinone cream that didn&#x27;t seem to help me much.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the epilator as hair removal lasts so much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much smoother</li>
            <li> the tweezers move reaaaally fast.</li>
            <li> Too much work.    </li>
            <li> His skin was left hairless and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I regret spending so much money on this epilator.</li>
            <li> The trick is to have a machine that works fast</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel it as much.</li>
            <li> Until that point, it was very unsightly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does work well</li>
            <li> I can remove any unwanted hair so fast</li>
            <li> Most of my hair was removed with one pass, only a few areas needed to have more than one pass.    </li>
            <li> and it was MUCH faster than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It works very well but it does hurt and the machine noise does set off your nerves before and during use.  </li>
            <li> I can still highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> And, again, I can still highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that this model does not have a light and</li>
            <li> Really gals, spend the money on this</li>
            <li> Thanks to this epilator</li>
            <li> The 72 tweezers sounded great,I real time saver.</li>
            <li> I got this today and straight away took it out of the box and used it.  </li>
            <li> This definitely takes out the hair from the root, however it won&#x27;t leave your skin silky smooth like a razor does.</li>
            <li> so this did not bother me too much.</li>
            <li> But... was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li> The biggest downside to waxing is waiting that ~3 weeks for the hair to grow out so that you actually get your money&#x27;s worth when you pay for a salon waxing (and on that note, the cost of professional waxing is a huge downfall, as well)...</li>
            <li> How fast can you get it done? -</li>
            <li> - Very.</li>
            <li> Can i go out looking fab straight away?</li>
            <li> and it stays away much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> It also works fast.</li>
            <li> and it hurt so much</li>
            <li> Thanks,  Lorraine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all speeds--slow or fast</li>
            <li> you want one that&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> (haha -no</li>
            <li> Not only does it sound like I&#x27;m mowing the lawn when I turn this on, but when I tried to use it on my underarms</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.com for your #10 service and prices.  </li>
            <li> As for this review specifically for the Emjoi, it was much quicker to do the job.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who wants to get away from shaving and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are very hairy</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t take too much online research to discover the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine.</li>
            <li> The Emagine is much faster.</li>
            <li> - it seemed to really remove the hair</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s much cleaner than wax.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always ready for shorts.  </li>
            <li> I am very hairy</li>
            <li> It is fast, efficient and versatile.  </li>
            <li> I will say however that it&#x27;s too much for me to use on the thicker coarser pubic hair.</li>
            <li> I feel absolutely no pain in using it, but I&#x27;ve been epilating for more than 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Much easier and cheaper than waxing,and you save money  on disposable razor costs.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of testosterone and your hair grows fast like mine</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very time consuming to me.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if it really would do what it says and would get hairs that are like .05 cm or whatever the ad says.</li>
            <li> It hurt so much</li>
            <li> and so much</li>
            <li> It was very painless but didnt pull the hair out form the roots.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this to shaving.  </li>
            <li> when i bought it i was waiting that it would be fast becouse</li>
            <li> it was too fast</li>
            <li> , it is very painless..</li>
            <li> the Emjoi is well priced, and the product itself has a very robust design that appeals to me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an epilator, and the 72 tweezer heads do the job so much quicker...</li>
            <li> This one does the job much, much faster.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Emojoi claims to be &#x27;gentle&#x27; and if you&#x27;ve ever epilated</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really satisfiede.</li>
            <li> So much so that i didn&#x27;t think another one of their epilators could beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very course, think hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now I can do it in minutes, just a touch up, really.</li>
            <li> It is fast</li>
            <li> But also, I expected more perfection from the epilation</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much the market (and the technology) has changed since 4 years ago when I purchased the (then version) Silk Épil.</li>
            <li> The dual opposing heads doing the job twice as fast as the single-head I&#x27;d owned by another manufacturer</li>
            <li> ago(it was an Emjoi gently Silken)  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> The fact that there&#x27;s no stinging after I put on my &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; (lime juice) is testament to how much</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is reasonably priced for this type of item.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Things just go so fast with this epilator.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.  </li>
            <li> that seems like too much skin to cover.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone in need of an efficient hair removal tool!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> brace yourself ladies and gents, the pain will come but it is very brief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the emjoi in fast circles.  </li>
            <li> i change the direction of my circles in an area as pubic hair grows in different directions untill the area is smooth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see much difference between the 2 speeds</li>
            <li> I have returned this product and ordered Braun silk epil and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> Since I decided I respect myself ( as much as a guy who shaves his legs can)</li>
            <li> Also, in comparison to waxing you save so much time with this epilator.</li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it has the dual opposed tweezers</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> jet fast speed doesn&#x27;t hurt because you&#x27;re not pulling out any/all hair...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as I don&#x27;t have much of a need for that.</li>
            <li> This gadget has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li> cheap Chinese plastic gears....</li>
            <li> It is too much money for this piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> For the price it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for cordless batteries dying even sooner, so that option is ruled out</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need the portability of a battery operated epilator, nor do I need it to be waterproof (</li>
            <li> used in my whole legs, bikini area, under arms and over my lips...</li>
            <li> -fast</li>
            <li> Using this fits into my schedule so much easier than waxing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt much</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.. at all.</li>
            <li> Works quite fast as well -</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work out.  </li>
            <li> I need to spend twice as much time, manually trying to lift my hair so the damn thing grabs it in the end.</li>
            <li> I use this for my whole leg.</li>
            <li> It is faster than my others as well, and does an awesome job on my bikini line, though the size does make it a bit awkward in spots.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Webisites on Epilators and reviews from others.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> but i didnt feel that much pain</li>
            <li> I really like this Epilator.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering why their video ad has the woman going through the same surface area over and over, its because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in one pass regardless of how you do it (lightly over the hair or pressing into the skin as they tell you not to).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs having very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Very inefficient in removing hair.</li>
            <li> After a while your hair on your legs gets thinner and not so much.</li>
            <li> I expected better performance but this is much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the Epilady, but it also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Except that I don&#x27;t have so much hair to remove from my legs and under arms.</li>
            <li> I use it after a shower because the water and scrubbing opens the hair pores which makes it much easier to tweeze.</li>
            <li> Or if it does, there isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> This version doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> Had a braun for over 3 years (which I feel is a reasonable life for an epilator), so I bought this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my legs smooth for over a month and when the hair does grow back</li>
            <li> Underarms takes several times before it&#x27;s comfortable....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not prepared to use this device in the intimate areas of my body as the rotation of these hair pullers</li>
            <li> remind me too much of a mining device used to cut through rock walls.</li>
            <li> So you apply some triple antibiotic cream on the area after you use the epilator and that really heals things up quicker..</li>
            <li> mind you my tattoos were all 3-4s to include to one on my rib cage which is a very tender area).</li>
            <li> But I do get a much closer shave than with a manual razor.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in my life and managing my leg hair is soooo much easier now.</li>
            <li> The emjoi imagine 72 tweezers epilator works fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I even used this on very tender areas.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed product, but considering the amount of pain involved, this is just not for me.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is very sturdy, and although it did hurt, it didn&#x27;t once pinch my skin</li>
            <li> and I feel I&#x27;m saving so much money</li>
            <li> This one is so fast and does not miss a hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after much nagging.</li>
            <li> works fast</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare too.</li>
            <li> and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!o mention, so is my husband!  </li>
            <li> and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!</li>
            <li> but it doesn.t work that much faster.  </li>
            <li> I think the head doesn&#x27;t contour enough to your leg to get that really smooth experience.</li>
            <li> id really like to purchase another epilator by Emjoi.....</li>
            <li> I could never do my bikini line the the Braun because it hurt way too much</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss about the Braun is the light.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi does what it is supposed to do in a very efficent manner.</li>
            <li> Those tweezers move FAST.</li>
            <li> Several days later I finally got brave, got it out and just did it.</li>
            <li> it moves fast.</li>
            <li> I expected more....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> Wish it had a light on it and was easier to use in smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Every women should have one, and they really do work well.  </li>
            <li> After over 10 years of faithful service, I had to replace my Gently Gold</li>
            <li> But the sting is really no worse if you are used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Southern European (those that are KNOW that we have not only MORE hair in MORE areas of the BODY, and</li>
            <li> Much faster.  </li>
            <li> it goes so fast to take off hair that you dont feel the pain</li>
            <li> WITH THE WHOLE TURN OF EVENTS.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me while it worked, but the motor died after about seven months of weekly use.  </li>
            <li> Still take several passes to get a hair free finish.</li>
            <li> This works so fast and is painless.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found out about &amp;#34;Epilating&amp;#34; a hand held device much like an electrical shaver except it plucks your hair with tweezers instead of shaves.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the fiancee, she loves it and thanks the person who invented these epilators.</li>
            <li> It is pain free enough that I don&#x27;t ever have to go get another brazilan wax again.  </li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have the genetic capability to handle this much pain.  </li>
            <li> MUCH EASIER...</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> This was so fast although there was some discomfort</li>
            <li> am used to waxing underarms and bikini and this did not hurt much, but i cannot use it for my legs yet.</li>
            <li> and I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li> It is very tolerable.</li>
            <li> This device has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> For two, this thing is an absolute GODSEND.</li>
            <li> This one is so fast because of the 72 tweezer head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> But it takes so much of time.</li>
            <li> We have spend so much of time on it.</li>
            <li> I really did my homework before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll  never shave again thanks to this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my legs are really hairy.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how fast hair can grow.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how much it helps with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> or so you won&#x27;t feel much.  </li>
            <li> and I am thinking I am going to fast.  </li>
            <li> I will go real slow.&lt;br /&gt;Saying</li>
            <li> I dont see the dual speeds working very well, as in no difference.</li>
            <li> really like this Emjoi</li>
            <li> and I know that from taking vitamin supplements my (head) hair grows fast</li>
            <li> so maybe this had something to do with my leg hair growing fast.  </li>
            <li> but no worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t something I ever really got used to.  </li>
            <li> This 72 tweezers is really fast even on the lowest</li>
            <li> Could have been she overloaded it with TOO much leg hair, but who knows.</li>
            <li> This one takes longer to finish the job and does not pick light, short hair.</li>
            <li> I realized that if i do it like shaving my legs with a electric razor close to the skin won&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes so much longer.  </li>
            <li> For me, this is much easier to do with the faster emjoi.  </li>
            <li> It was SOOOOO much faster than the braun.  </li>
            <li> One thing that has really helped me is to use a loofah both before and after epilating.  </li>
            <li> This works really well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Gave me a much nicer result.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier on the skin.</li>
            <li> And did not think much of it.  </li>
            <li> Twice as fast as the Braun Silk-Epil</li>
            <li> Much quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> You could move it in straight lines or circles.</li>
            <li> That said, this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Even though it has a 72 tweezer head, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair more efficiently, I absolutely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Also, as the hair is removed it is much easier to handle the feeling of tweeting.</li>
            <li> This epilator worked really well.</li>
            <li> the gears that allow the tweezers to rotate are made of cheap plastic and will wear out in short time, leaving you with a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I really like this thing.  </li>
            <li> I imagine if used correctly it might work very well...</li>
            <li> It does make an absolute racket when it&#x27;s used; my dogs wont come in the bathroom when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Being run on an outlet, it funs fast and with 72 Tweezers the job is done in twice the time.  </li>
            <li> for the noise, any hair dryer is much much louder than this</li>
            <li> My underarms have become much lighter in color than before because of razers.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as well as waxing does on the legs and underarms, but for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe is was because it rotating too fast??</li>
            <li> The pain on this one compared to that one is much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and then it doesn&#x27;t happen whole lot.</li>
            <li> The hair goes really fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi 72 tweezer worked very well on my legs, underarms, and binki area.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work on my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I dont feel much pain.</li>
            <li> It has stopped the process of daily shaving but still leaves me with smooth legs all the time.  </li>
            <li> I use this about once a week and find that to be enough to keep my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who desires smooth legs but hates the daily drudgery of shaving.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job removing hair, you do need to go over  the same spot several times, but once hair is removed your skin is left smooth to the touch and hairless.  </li>
            <li> Some people wrote it hurt too much for underarms, I don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> This machine would have done too much damage to the skin trying to pull the hairs out even for a yoga contortionist who could get in there to epilate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get real, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Much louder than my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have waxed my legs a few times and used to do my own brazillian wax with the Bliss kit.</li>
            <li> I should note that I&#x27;m not a hirsute person, and I&#x27;d imagine that a particularly hairy or coarse-haired person would find this product even less effective than I do.</li>
            <li> It felt nice to not have to shave that area everyday when I showered.</li>
            <li> Still, as a daily epilator, the Philips, and the Braun before it, were both far superior, if a tiny bit slower.</li>
            <li> I used to only be able to use epilate my armpits after applying a numbing cream because the area is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you try to use this on the back end near your back door, then good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blaming this on the device or company since it was MY FAULT that I put a piece back incorrectly, but I am saying that it would have been nice to have a bit of room for error since my $80 purchase is now obsolete because of one simple mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford to try Silk&#x27;n or Tria laser systems, but for now, a epilator will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;After more than eight years, I had to toss my old Philips epilator because it finally stop working.</li>
            <li> This later generation works even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Although I have to make a few more passes with the Emoji than I had to with the Braun, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> I can use it and be finished in a matter of minutes and am good to go for at least 6 weeks after.  </li>
            <li> So be prepared to replace this item more frequently than should be necessary for its cost.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything really, except the Top, Inner Thighs (the wobbly, not firm bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a pretty nice past decade with ya.</li>
            <li> I did completely read the user guide prior to use, to make sure I was using it correctly.....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve managed to do my own Brazilian w/out much trouble.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this machine is too big for such a narrow/tight area where the leg meets the trunk of the body.</li>
            <li> I do have very course thick hair, which could be part of the issue, maybe this epilator is good for people with finer hair?</li>
            <li> 72 tweezers should hurt more than the little Satinelle, right?</li>
            <li> This machine left me just as smooth as if I&#x27;d been waxed by my professional!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for a good year and a half to two years, and they all work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rather loud (compared to my old epilator), but it is said to have a very powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say that it hurts like a mother the first several times you use it, but no pain no gain, right?</li>
            <li> (More expensive is better, right??)</li>
            <li> At first, the slower speed was more efficient because the fastest speed would just tear hair in half instead of pluck the whole follicle.</li>
            <li> if one dies I have a back up so far the first one is still going strong .  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> And can I just say WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a light but other than that it does a great job for me.&lt;br /&gt;Those who say it is painful</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little brush to clean it, and a nice white pouch to keep it in, and added bonus!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt, except when I got adventurous, but that also hurts less with time ;)</li>
            <li> The larger head on this model is ideal for legs and can do other smaller areas, but with some difficulty.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to epilation, you have to expect it will hurt the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the tria hair remover at a much greater cost with no positive results.  </li>
            <li> but I just showered right after and put on a soft dove deodorant and all was well.</li>
            <li> My vision is fine, I do not require glasses, but with out the light, I am straining to see the backs of my legs and lower down near the ankle.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I just wanted to point out that my epilator arrived 2 days later than it was suppose to and the seller more than made up for the delay by offering superior customer service and a small refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I would suggest not spending the extra money on the dual head because its not any more useful then the extra pass you have to make anyway to get the hair thats normally missed.</li>
            <li> so I tried it on my upper leg which had a couple weeks of growth and again, even with longer hair, very little was pulled,and  mostly it just broke off at the skin leaving my legs not at all smooth!</li>
            <li> Finally, this epilator is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> overall its worth it!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark, coarse hair that grows fast.  </li>
            <li> A lot smoother than the other epilator I had and gets more hairs.  </li>
            <li> so I have had to turn to MANY other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> I decided to exfoliate starting with the original Epilady.  </li>
            <li> It worked much better than the other model I tried.  </li>
            <li> My armpits on the other hand, seem like the hair is breaking more than I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> while running on the same area, your hair continue to smile in your face &#x3D; get me if you can!</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other model, but still can take a couple of passes to pick up all the hair (hence the 4, not 5 star review).  </li>
            <li> Then again, they may not be able to keep the power level consistent enough while running on battery power, which may be the reason it&#x27;s operable only while plugged in to an outlet.    </li>
            <li> Maybe other nationalities have a better response from this product, but I did not.</li>
            <li> time I noticed I had to epilate more often than waxing due to the root of hair not being pulled out.  </li>
            <li> works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Once a week 15-20 min of epilation with Emjoy is definitely better for me than every other day shaving.</li>
            <li> Originally I used it as a backup for when I couldn&#x27;t get in to get my legs waxed and it worked well enough.</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first, in some areas more then others but after the second or third use the pain decreases.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok; not a problem for me, but I saw similar comment on prior review, so be aware.  </li>
            <li> I really love this Emjoi compared to the other one I had.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little on the first use, but it got much better after that.  </li>
            <li> So the first calve that I did had way more irritation and red bumps because I was having to go over spots several times.</li>
            <li> The other brand seemed to break the hair more often than tweeze it out</li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews that mention that two metal teeth are better than one being plastic.</li>
            <li> (This is an edit to my original review for under arm hair removal- about 1 1/2 months later.  </li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> better than any other i tried</li>
            <li> I do use the circle method someone else mentioned in a review and that does work much better than any other method.</li>
            <li> But for the most part my legs are pretty smooth and pulled out about 75% of the hairs but 25% were broken off.</li>
            <li> In NO time are my legs free of any hair, smooth and all of this with very little pain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to look back and laugh about when I got my FIRST epilator..</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair that is darker and more coarse on the back of my neck, ankles, and underarms.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend paying that much when you can get one that works a whole lot better for less money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been a professional cyclist for years and have shaved my legs for as long as most women.</li>
            <li> does NOT get the fine hairs like stated, and with 72 tweezers takes just as long to remove hair as my worn out one</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to get the job done, enjoy is also very noisy</li>
            <li> (Yes, hairs get all over the place, but because this is a dry epilator, the hair is easy to wipe up and throw away, the hair don&#x27;t stick to anything.)</li>
            <li> There is some minor discomfort on the most sensitive areas</li>
            <li> It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and chin.      </li>
            <li> &quot; the First few Sweeps, then, nothing notable, once in awhile, that Prickly sensation was felt.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected that since it had so many more tweezers than than my Emjoi Emagine that it would be faster and miss less hairs.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to find one that was going to be effective and last a long time.</li>
            <li> the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go over the area softly and kind of floating and don&#x27;t grind the epilator into your skin, it will bog it down anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have very corse hair this works better than any other one I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally hairy legs with very dark course hair and it would take a total of 4 hours to clear my legs of hair with the Braun, if they were super hairy.  </li>
            <li> I did have to go over a few spots more than once, but in all fairness I&#x27;ve not been waxed since right before the New Year (2012)</li>
            <li> really hoped to give this a high rating, but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Caveat - I&#x27;ve been seeing my estitician for 7 years now for regular waxing of my upper thighs, full face, and full brazilian - the real deal one.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;d like my business back they can send me a new head for free.</li>
            <li> Personally, I can live with not being 100% hair free, so I epilate about once a week.  </li>
            <li> With the double sided rotation it relay does the job right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable - was able to risk using on bikini line which hurt WAY too much with previous epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My pores did get irritated but healed quickly and the hairs are much finer and didn&#x27;t come back in immediately</li>
            <li> It is not entirely painless, for your hair is stuck to you, but because it is going so fast, you just feel it rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it really does a quick job of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> The hair that does grow back seems to be soft baby hairs that are easily removied by the emjoi emagine.</li>
            <li> Super fast and grabs teeny, tiny hairs.  </li>
            <li> Yes, when you first start using an epilator it hurts because you have so much hair, but the more you use it the less hair returns so the degree of pain lessens considerably.  </li>
            <li> I felt a mild pinching sensation while using it on the short hair of my legs and armpits; on hair that was longer it pulled and left a very pinching sensation, although not bad.</li>
            <li> Still, I expected it would be superior to the single tweeze auto-plucker</li>
            <li> I have used epilators for as long as they were available.</li>
            <li> After using the braun 5280 for a few years I can say the AP-18 is by far the better epilator!</li>
            <li> Fortunately the cord is quite long</li>
            <li> It is not completely pain free</li>
            <li> For every 2 weeks of smooth legs, I had three weeks of wearing nothing but pants or long skirts.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> First, I have to say how pleasantly surprised I was with the packaging itself.  </li>
            <li> This epilator is a good investment even though the hefty price tag looks pretty expensive at first.</li>
            <li> The key to smooth epilated skin is exfoliation, exfoliation, exfoliation; so make sure you do that everyday after you epilate to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> However I have only so far used it on my legs and arms and not dared anything more sensitive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not painful by any means, or even red.</li>
            <li> I went back to shaving because the abrasiveness of the process really irritated my skin, and when my hair grew back it hurt (for some reason it was more prickly??</li>
            <li> It is fast, easy to clean, and although bigger than other epilators, it is the size of the tweezers that matters.</li>
            <li> Fair warning, the first time you use it, it is pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, this epilator is loud, even for an epilator.</li>
            <li> The product description  says results last for six weeks; that hasn&#x27;t proven to be true.  </li>
            <li> Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  </li>
            <li> first time I have used an Epilator and I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> First off, if you are used to waxing it is pretty much the same comfort level (i.e. hairs ripping from your skin).  </li>
            <li> I expected more discomfort and was pleasantly surprised at how much it did not hurt.  </li>
            <li> You definitely want this machine working at full capacity at all times.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely faster I am done with my full arms, legs, armpits and bikini area in about 30 -35 minutes.</li>
            <li> such a great product, i think i haven&#x27;t bought  any intuition shaving heads for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Have used an epilator since they first came on the market and my old epilady still works</li>
            <li> First the thing is so LOUD.</li>
            <li> pain is not bad, you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Better to do it when your hair is short, once a week or so.</li>
            <li> Not bad enough to return it,but I would not recommend it .</li>
            <li> Last of all go back over clean areas in the perpendicular direction of what you first used to make sure you get any wild hairs growing in a different direction.    </li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get use to it so quickly and it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews perhaps my epilator is defective, but it is very noisy and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as older models I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The comfort level is high - nothing about epilation is nice - would suggest that you do follow the guidelines and bath and dry prior to use.</li>
            <li> The Doctor said I needed more air circulation below the belt to cut down on the dampness.</li>
            <li> Works better than waxing and cuts down time.</li>
            <li> I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase</li>
            <li> I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than shaving every other day!</li>
            <li> I wasted money on a product that cannot be returned at this juncture, and most certainly one that I will never use again.</li>
            <li> I say spend a little extra and get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that this model hurts at all, but I think the fact that I&#x27;ve been waxing and epilating for a while has made me a little more tolerant of discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My esthecitian friend says that epilators aren&#x27;t good for anything but making a wax last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The pain was completely managable for a first time (the pain decreases the more you epilate)and left no red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with my new Emagine.</li>
            <li> plus I am new to this and was practicing how to hold it and how much pressure to use).</li>
            <li> Combined with the lack of an LED light (which I was really used to in my old appliance and depended on), the significant learning curve of the current angle to which you need to direct it to your skin, and the reduced efficacy, I returned this item and purchased a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would take me a very long time to epilate my legs and they never felt smooth.</li>
            <li> simply cause the grow back hair has to have time to get to the right length to epilate, but its so fine and soft that it doesn&#x27;t really bother</li>
            <li> Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using.  </li>
            <li> It is alot faster (since it has so many heads) and does alot better job than my previous ones and with less pain.  </li>
            <li> This works even better than the previous Emjoie that I owned.  </li>
            <li> The tighter the skin, the better contact it has with the hair your trying to remove, and the less it pulls at the skin, which often creates some of the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought it in desperation as I lost my precious previous one.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than my previous one, which I purchased 9 years ago, and had about a 30-40 tweezer head.</li>
            <li> My problem with this one is that instead of tweezing the hairs, it breaks a lot of them in half, so it&#x27;s not accomplishing much more than if I had shaved.  </li>
            <li> It pulls more hairs that previous ones i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> as compared to my previous epilator but seems to pull fewer hairs for sure.</li>
            <li> so i use it mostly for underarms and the lower half of my leg.  </li>
            <li> it was better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> Then I purchased the Gold Emjoi, much better, less pain and still works</li>
            <li> I do not give I love it because I only had to buy a power supply for the European market to me.</li>
            <li> Have owned older versions of the Emjoi Epilator.  </li>
            <li> My idea of a good time is not being found unconscious on my bathroom floor with a buzzing red object in my limp hand.</li>
            <li> Be realistic with any product you buy--</li>
            <li> This particular epilator does not work as stated.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly as when I use a razor.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for my underarms</li>
            <li> Of all the things on my daily personal maintenance list, shaving my legs is at the top.</li>
            <li> I wish the main gear was metal instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> and my skin was smooth and hair free for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair smaller than 2-3 mm but does the job well and quickly.</li>
            <li> To top that off, after using it I can still find hair that it didnt pull out; after going over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li> Be careful in areas with more \\&quot;soft</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding to stay with Emoji, and particularly this model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not,</li>
            <li> the first time epilating the pubic area will take a while, especially if its your first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought the Emjoi because of my curiosity for the dual head design.</li>
            <li> My skin was a bit red after use, but that quickly went away.</li>
            <li> I definitely like it better than my last epilator.</li>
            <li> It gets super short hairs.</li>
            <li> I will be using it on my legs and underarms but my main purpose is my face.</li>
            <li> hairs were very short and they were pulled out like that, different of wax that i would need wait they grow more to depilate.</li>
            <li> It says that you can if you manuever it correctly, but trust me its easier to use one of the smaller units made more specifically for these areas or to simply use another method of hair removal.    </li>
            <li> And if you are someone who has hair growing out of your legs every which way, then you might consider the double sided heads to be more efficient, otherwise, its really only an arm pit benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> keep trying to think of pros, and I think I might just be super irritated that this thing no longer works after 4 years, but c&#x27;mon, can&#x27;t anything last anymore?</li>
            <li> You will have to run it over the same area multiple times to get most of the hair out, even then it doesn&#x27;t get everything like some ppl claims it does.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Emjoi, so I have been used to the pain when using this.  </li>
            <li> chose the emjoi for several reasons, mostly because the tweezers got the highest ratings on several reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I love that, and that it only needs done every several weeks!  </li>
            <li> I had the much older version, and Emjoi Gold.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t come back as quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several epilators before and i was hoping that this would be a SUPER DUPER epilator.</li>
            <li> I have been using the older Emjoi Gold model for about 10 years now, so I thought it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> ) results on this particular area.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare this particular one, too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model, particularly at its cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for chin area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that many lacked power and required several times going over the same spot to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly and I have been using it for several months with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Even with the two heads it takes longer Than my older one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how smooth they actually got.  </li>
            <li> I had to cover the same area, several times for it to pick up most (not all) of the hair in that area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for six years now, and owned four different epilators from three different manufacturers, the Emjoi - Emagine is my favorite.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s too big for brows, I use it for my upper lip and I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> I am Swedish decent</li>
            <li> This epilator definitely works and manages to quickly remove all hair in any chosen spot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older epilator I had.  </li>
            <li> This older model&#x27;s tweezers have two metal teeth vs one plastic and one metal.</li>
            <li> : I have a decent tolerance for pain, plus after a minute or two the area get desensitized.</li>
            <li> Good for flat surface where skin is tight...</li>
            <li> I have very hairy legs and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t get my soft, fine, blond hairs that tend to lie flat against the skin.  </li>
            <li> positive thing about it is that it is faster than my old one.</li>
            <li> I saw this particular epilator on YouTube and it came highly recommended by it&#x27;s reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have a decent pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the hassle and mess of waxing any more</li>
            <li> The Braun epilator was my very first experience with epilation and it definitely took some getting used to dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li> Make sure you pull the skin tight while pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to place it horizontal to the area you are working on, and pull the skin tight.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my pain tolerance to be particularly high, either, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to using wax over the years.    </li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve experienced is hairs growing back just under the skin in a leg area; I can see them, but can&#x27;t reach them until they&#x27;ve finally grown through the upper layer.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest you exfoliate before using.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this to all you ladies, your men will appreciate how your legs feel.</li>
            <li> I have a decently high tolerance to pain and yet sometimes I&#x27;m like gritting my teeth trying to just hurry and get through it.</li>
            <li> I was a swimmer in high school and always felt embarrassed for having razor burn around my bikini line and also never felt like I could show my legs unless I had shaven that day.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t epilated before, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Over all I give it high ratings.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> The sides of the epilator sit up to high</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this after seeing it rated high elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using it on high speed for 20 mins.</li>
            <li> I also would like to note i have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> High quality manufacturing.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> had incredibly high hopes for this epilator, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> recommed it highly.</li>
            <li> For pain, I&#x27;d say maybe a 3 on the high side.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and takes multiple passes; however I used it on pretty short (shaved three days previous) hair that is blonde and fairly thin/fine!</li>
            <li> leaves your skin smooth and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other one i had</li>
            <li> The only sensation I experienced on my lower legs was an occasional slight scraping sensation-</li>
            <li> Yes it has all of these extra hair catching teeth, yet due to</li>
            <li> I also think I read that the fine hairs are harder to get</li>
            <li> The only positive is it really doesnt cause much pain, but I think that is because its not pulling the hairs like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> I found this one on Amazon for less than I paid 10 years ago and this new improved model is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> thorough than other epilators - gets most hairs on first pass, and strip in middle</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little machine -</li>
            <li> Love it once I got desensitized to the little &amp;#</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how this little machine tweezed every bit of that underarm hair and that skin is so smooth now!</li>
            <li> many little ones...</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my bikini line, but, I am using it also now for my legs, the first time hurts a little, but you get used to it quickly; and in my opinion it is much better than shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> great thing is that It takes half the time to do my legs with the 72 Tweezer Head, hence half the pain and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : At one of the spots here in Dallas that I think is clean, well-priced, professional, etc., it would cost me over $160 to get my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li> So cool, I have thick course hair and it pulls them out just fine.</li>
            <li> and most were centered on the upper right leg which is hidden under any type of clothing in the summer anyhow unless I wore a speedo, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this epilator due to the lack of pain and 72 tweezers making for a rapid and easy hair removal experience.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well but takes a little long to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> I cannot say I have tried any other brands of epilators other than Emjoi, but if you are looking for a really good one in their lineup, I highly recommendthe AP-18.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re undecided - trust me, it really does a good job and hurts less - in fact I don&#x27;t feel the pulling like with other epilators, just the pressure.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as I expected.</li>
            <li> So far it is the fastest although not quite as fast as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> The old one&#x27;s head is much easier to clean, i.e., one could see what was there and rinse it off, then set it aside to dry.</li>
            <li> and I still have a light pink discolored area (</li>
            <li> , it got old fast.</li>
            <li> , this really DOESN&#x27;T hurt as much as my old epilator!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator since the week of Christmas and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> epilating in a dim shower really has no benefits, I found).  </li>
            <li> It really does take a LOT of passes to clear an area.</li>
            <li> This works so much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li> My legs were much smoother with this one over my old one.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly quiet; not too heavy and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> but it was absolutely tolerable and in some cases a complete snooze.  </li>
            <li> One pass yields as much hair as 2 or 3 passes on my old epilator.</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi was fading fast</li>
            <li> I did my armpits and was surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I would clear the majority of hairs with the fast emjoi and then go over it again with the braun.  </li>
            <li> I thought that my old epilator was fast...</li>
            <li> i am now trying to get a replacement directly from the manufacturer but do not have much hope.</li>
            <li> , it is much nicer to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> its worth the price not to shave daily!</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I&#x27;ve had a nightmare dealing with shaving, especially inbetween my upper thigh area and back thigh.</li>
            <li> I was bummed because it looked like how my thighs normally do.</li>
            <li> But then I read that this can be a normal reaction because your legs/skin aren&#x27;t used to this type of treatment.</li>
            <li> Overall it works pretty much as promised.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this is worth it.</li>
            <li> I decided to used on my bikini line, I normally waxed it myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I think the product build is a solid one, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price or the ingrown</li>
            <li> Of course it hurts, you are pulling hair out by the root, but for such a shorter amount of time it is definately worth it.  </li>
            <li> A nice option would be also rechargeable, but I definitely would choose electric above battery-only; you need to keep the constant power for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of whether you buy the Emjoi or the Braun, IT IS WORTH IT - especially for you ladies who have the embarrassing chin hairs!!  </li>
            <li> My chin hairs have also pretty much disappeared - I still shave every 3 or 4 days, but instead of hundreds of chin hairs, there are only about 5-10.</li>
            <li> My underarm hair barely grows back anymore &amp; between Brazilian bikini waxes, it keeps me smooth.</li>
            <li> But it was apparent the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t even comparable.</li>
            <li> The extra price is worth the time saved.</li>
            <li> As I normally shave my legs</li>
            <li> The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  </li>
            <li> The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  </li>
            <li> Even if you only plan on using this under your arms, it is completely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> how many times I went over the same small patch of skin trying to make sure that all of the hair was removed only to find that IT WOULD NOT GET ALL OF THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> and I love not having the messy wax everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to waste more money on this failing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy, and it has no light, but it sure gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> but then again, just one trip to a salon will cost you pretty much the same</li>
            <li> On top of that, my legs always felt like I had not shaved in two days; NEVER smooth.    </li>
            <li> I found this definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The speed and performance is worth the price,  however you will need another one that gets the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> I normally pay to get waxed or use a hair removal lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different epilators and this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just barely have any stubble and it&#x27;s been about five days since I first used it.</li>
            <li> wo it&#x27;s worth the extra time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I think I need a few more times to get the technique</li>
            <li> I haven used a normal razor in over a year</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reverted back to shaving after a while since it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Am enjoying not having to shave my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li> Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40)</li>
            <li> Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40)</li>
            <li> It pulled few hairs and broke many hairs leaving stubble.  </li>
            <li> I just found waxing to be too pricey, and I&#x27;m not really skilled enough to do it myself and do a good job.  </li>
            <li> It is ok product but not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one after I broke the first one by accident... goes to show you how much I like using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators x over 20 years, I have used emjoi brands long ago and more recently Braun, Phillips, etc.  </li>
            <li> Was able to see hundreds of long hair follicles on white towel that I had under my legs fall out.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I would have to shave every day, but with this product, I used it once and now,</li>
            <li> My skin looked absolutely normal - just fur</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never be satisfied because you&#x27;re expecting professional quality results (which you would pay a lot to get) from an at-home-use / personal use hand-held machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as effective as waxing, and as long as I use it at least 1x a week, it&#x27;s not painful.  </li>
            <li> Overall it did a good job at catching the hairs, but it&#x27;s just too painful to use</li>
            <li> My arms and upper thighs have very fine hair, as I do not shave them, and the emjoi did not really hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because it has many more tweezers than most other models because I thought it would make the process quicker (albeit possibly more painful) despite being more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It took the Emjoi five minutes to clear as much hair as possible my right arm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other epilator meaning you have to keep going over areas because it doesn&#x27;t remove the ingrown hair, or the fine hair within one stroke like it states.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after using it for the first time, hair started growing back rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a very mild pinching sensation as each hair is removed, but its definitely well within my ability to tolerate it, and even do an entire leg at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and slightly less noisy, but who really cares about the noise anyway?</li>
            <li> I had to go over and over the same short stubbly hairs that my aging Braun could easily pluck out with no problem in one pass.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  </li>
            <li> But be aware that the pain IS more agonizing than waxing, as the process is much slower - at least with waxing a large section of hair can be removed in one second...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this nice looking shiny red little \\&quot;thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but be prepared to clean up a lot of little hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing feeling for someone like me who thought that until I spend a fortune and years on laser hair removal treatments that I was just a hairy girl that always hid my body with clothes and spent too much money and time on grooming and different things that never REALLY did enough to give me the confidence of smooth legs or no stubble or razor burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  </li>
            <li> However, when I had leftover hairs still visible, I went up, from left, from right and</li>
            <li> Only consideration might be need for power cord in right location for light/mirror since no battery option.</li>
            <li> I would use it on my upper lip and on my cheeks right under my \\&quot;side burns\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the tweezers do not open and close at the right time to grab the hair.</li>
            <li> When my Emjoi Optima AP-99 died last week, fear shot through me at the prospect of spending months shopping for the right epilator.</li>
            <li> However, again, my left arm was noticeably smoother than my right and</li>
            <li> The hair grows back right away.  </li>
            <li> This is my third epilator and the construction right out of the box</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aftercare - You will see a lot of red dots; hey, you&#x27;d see them right after getting waxed too.</li>
            <li> it just plugs in as opposed to having a battery to charge, because I have heard that batteries run down pretty quick on epilators and I never have to wait for it to charge.</li>
            <li> Now I epilate about once a week and the sparse hair that comes in at all is soft and fair - very hard to see even when it gets longish.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is that I had to pull out my old Braun epilator (which is slow, and on its last leg</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied, the only thing I can&#x27;t talk about is how long it will last.</li>
            <li> have fine blonde hair, but with the Emjoi you have to cover the same area of skin on your legs 8-10 times to pick up all hairs.</li>
            <li> Also the hair on my legs took forever to grow back and they grow back so fine not like when shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously many people love this epilator, and I love that it&#x27;s corded (doesn&#x27;t lose steam, as it were) and the pulls really are MUCH less painful,</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s truly fabulous on slower-growth areas like the bikini line.</li>
            <li> I was using a Braun before it gave up the ghost unexpectedly, and it was a little more discomforting on my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s a little early for me to be posting this review, as I just ordered this yesterday on my Prime account.</li>
            <li> Small slow circular motions most effective.  </li>
            <li> I tried an epilady back when they first came out, I was in Jr High</li>
            <li> Still working as brand new.</li>
            <li> so I was in the market for a new one and after reading reviews</li>
            <li> I epilate every couple of days to get rid of any new growth, and it takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Anyway with hubbies help, I now have a new \\&quot;look\\&quot; , although I have to say there was some distractions along the way with his help :</li>
            <li> Hence, I purchased a new one.  </li>
            <li> Since it was time to buy a new one, I thought I would try the Emjoi AP-18 Dual head.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t used a razor for my underarms in over 10 years), and decided it was time for a new epilator.</li>
            <li> I might have gotten 3 uses out of my new one before it broke, the tweezers stopped moving</li>
            <li> If you are new to using one of these it is going to hurt.</li>
            <li> I bought it 3-4 years ago and still works as new.</li>
            <li> This is a new and improved model.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair remover.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did - shaving cream, conditioner, brand new razors, etc.</li>
            <li> I called the Emjoi company in New York.</li>
            <li> i used braun epilator for almost nine years i was looking for new one, when i read the review i wanted to give it a shot .......</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to the epilator</li>
            <li> With this new epilator he hasn&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> they replaced it with a new epilator.</li>
            <li> After using for one years it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> AND WHEN I COULDN&#x27;T USE THE PRODUCE AS I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA NOT THE US (WHICH THEY DIDN&#x27;T SAY WOULD BE A PROBLEM)</li>
            <li> If you are a woman looking for a new way to remove leg hair, stick to shaving, or waxing, or Nair.  </li>
            <li> Decided I would upgrade to a fancy new Emjoi model.</li>
            <li> (until you hit a new area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (until you hit a new area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * IF YOUR ARE NEW TO EPILATING -&gt;</li>
            <li> So I ordered a new adaptor for about $20.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Braun epilator for over 5 years now and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> For me, the time savings of the emjoi justifies me having to purchase a new one every year or so.</li>
            <li> This time i decided to get something new.</li>
            <li> A new problem:  </li>
            <li> (I DON&#x27;T LIVE IN THE US)</li>
            <li> From other reviewers Baby Powder, Aloe Vera and a good Exfoliant make the process efficient and hurt less.  </li>
            <li> Now, I want to be totally honest: it does not really pull every single hair at the first shot, but even if I have to go over an area multiple times, who cares?</li>
            <li> In general terms, I like this epilator more than any other I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> It was time to get a new epilator after several years - I have only owned 2 previous ones in 15+ years so to be fair</li>
            <li> It hurts so bad lol not even fun</li>
            <li> Much better to get the Philips satinelle, been using it for the last 2 years, half the price and very efficient.</li>
            <li> Finally, what I&#x27;m left with is a surface of stubble rather than smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it on my legs, but I just feel like epilators are too small in general to effectively use on your legs.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product to use if you&#x27;re tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> A friend with lots of dark hair tested this product on a small area of his leg and had great results.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea of epilating and not having hair grow back for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This epilator doesn&#x27;&#x27;t pinch any where near as much as the old model.  </li>
            <li> And for my legs, it gets hairs that are really short, &amp; my legs feel almost as smooth as when I used a razor blade, but this last a lot longer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it is particularly difficult to get smooth results over boney or prominent areas like shins and knees.</li>
            <li> but it may help some one who likes a complete bare look ;-) ) .</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as painful (can barely feel it, actually)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who&#x27;s experienced with epilating knows what broken hairs feel like: visually, the hairs are gone, but you can feel the tops of them at the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I have no red bumps or anything the next day and completely smooth arms.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better as far as pulling but takes longer and is not comfortable to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Gross fact: I´m very hairy (thanks, dad).</li>
            <li> My mom bought a Braun just a year ago to replace her old one and said she can&#x27;t tell much of a difference from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only problem was that it took soooo many passes to clear an area, but, even with the multiple passes, my skin didn&#x27;t really get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Emoji AP-18 to anyone looking for an efficient, low pain (no epilator will be pain free) Epilator.</li>
            <li> After using the epilator hair grows back much slower then with saving and also much finer.</li>
            <li> to contour curves&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly painless, even with sensitive skin (let&#x27;s be realistic, beauty requires some pain)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I used it primarily on my underarms, bikini area and the inner and back area of my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say that I use it about once every week or 2 just to keep tidy, but it only takes a few minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to sum up...get ready for some discomfort which only lasts while you do it and only for a few times...and then enjoy years of shave free living.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-I let myself dry off completely and took some extra time (about an hour) to get all my things together, set up my area, and made sure I had no dampness left&lt;br</li>
            <li> From many of thedescriptions I expected to feel maybe a day or two&#x27;s worth of stubble, but it only felt like a few hours&#x27; worth.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts much longer than shaving and when it grows back it grows very sparse and the hair seems somehow finer.  </li>
            <li> I used this with the Nisim Hair inhibitor and it left my skin smooth and it took the hair longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I have really nothing good to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so as a college aged male I am stuck in a generation where no one likes hair, even on guys.  </li>
            <li> Poor me.)&lt;br /&gt;(I also tried it on my arms on low speed and came out great without redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> use this mainly for the pubic area and underarms and both are considered sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really use it much because of all the effort w/ just ONE leg (w/ short hair) followed by a razor.</li>
            <li> have coarse dark hair and after many many times running across my legs this pulled little to nothing out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so I decided to purchase it after some major contemplation (considering the price and the fear that it would hurt too much).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li> Even used it on my ears getting the smallest and finest of hairs without any issues or irritation - and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it is very loud but it gets rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> Very loud.</li>
            <li> My solution is to use a loofah in the shower, very frequently.</li>
            <li> I have Italian dark hair, and fair sensitive english skin, so shaving was irriating.  </li>
            <li> Many tweezer heads really does mean faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With our old epilator my husband would always complain about hairs growing back right under the skin.</li>
            <li> I am used to epilators, I have been using them for a long time, now, but I always dread the due date because I have a hard time tolerating the prickly feeling of the hairbeing pulled, especially on my most sensitive areas that are the thighs and the knees..</li>
            <li> If you have never epilated before, I STRONGLY suggest getting just breaking down and paying a one time cost of getting waxed by a professional just once before you start to epilate.  </li>
            <li> the face being VERY fine blond hair, hardly discernible).</li>
            <li> I am a male (cyclist) with course body hair, and this was my first time using an epilator, so</li>
            <li> I am used to waxing and all that so this wasn&#x27;t a very big shock when i first used this.</li>
            <li> but the fact that I don&#x27;t even get smooth skin means this is NOT worth it for me....</li>
            <li> As I said, trim the hairs short, first.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use it in any angle maybe someone more por than me</li>
            <li> When I used to wax the facial hair, it took forever because the hairs were never removed on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Since this was the first time with my underarms there was a tiny bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really only the first time you use it</li>
            <li> The first Emjoi I had finally retired after using it for 21 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are just breaking off instead of being plucked or if it&#x27;s just more hair that it missed, but either way I still feel like I need to shave after using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Invest in one of these for smooth, long lasting hair free legs, underarms, and other areas.</li>
            <li> got my first epilator about 10 years ago and loved the convenience, but it wasn&#x27;t that powerful and ran through batteries like crazy!</li>
            <li> It definitely hurt the first time using it</li>
            <li> If you are using an epilator for the first time, you will likely experience some pain.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the ice glove, but I love the small bag that comes with it for storage.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only epilator.</li>
            <li> Love it for small patches.</li>
            <li> This was the first and will be the last experience I ever have with an Emjoi.</li>
            <li> It worked great for that as well and really does get all the littlest hairs whether separate random hairs or tiny peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> downfall, since hair grows in waves or phases (I think thats the more technical term or what the laser hair removal technicians call it) but you can use this epilator and get all your hair but days later have a tiny bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> As far as pain, yes it hurts!</li>
            <li> I would expect it to last longer considering it is more expensive than most epilators.</li>
            <li> It barely hurt and didn&#x27;t take that much time.</li>
            <li> When the first one missed a hair the second one will pick him up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators since it is the only one I have used, but I&#x27;m glad that I started with this one.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> after the first week, it was a week before i noted i had hair growing back.</li>
            <li> There is always an element of pain with epilators (especially when you first start using one).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to go over the spots several times until the hair is completeley removed but once again after the first time, the maintenance is a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> which is cheaper and pulls the hair out better and with the root. :/</li>
            <li> It works very well only missing the most stubborn hairs which I can then tweeze myself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My only quibble, and it&#x27;s not a big one, is that my old Braun had a light on the business end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first start by saying that I am a male, nineteen years of age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if not more for most of the hair to be picked up.  </li>
            <li> I am a seasoned user of facial wax, so I know that hair removal is not a pain-free process by any means.</li>
            <li> I normally order directly from Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something more efficient in removing short hair and ergonomic, to reach even the more difficult areas.</li>
            <li> I use it only on my arms and it leaves them smooth even when the hair is growing back because it&#x27;s soft hair instead of prickly hair like when you save.</li>
            <li> This is the second one, as the first one was bought a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li> Be aware as of this date (12/31/14) there is a discrepancy in Amazon description - between violet and red.  </li>
            <li> It did pretty well, but the cord fell out constantly until I used a hair rubberband to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> But considering how much less hair I now have on my arms and legs, that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> This product is better than the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> but that is small compared to how much better it is.</li>
            <li> So to all the women and men thinking about buying your first epilator, these are my personal experiences and this may help you in your decision making with a epilator.</li>
            <li> It pulls out the hair with the root and the initial pain goes away after the first swipe.</li>
            <li> So loud!</li>
            <li> The second time I used it on areas that were almost unbearable the first time around, and I was prepard for it to hurt, it did not.</li>
            <li> So overall it does exactly what I hoped it would do, and does not irritate my skin like waxing and shaving does.</li>
            <li> When you are a first time epilator, the rolling beads  give you a different sentation and therefore \\&quot;distract\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you.  </li>
            <li> Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you.  </li>
            <li> This time I took a hot shower to open up my pores and of course exfoliated.</li>
            <li> used it the first time last  night.</li>
            <li> My leg hair is fine, and I like shaving less.</li>
            <li> It does get better after a few uses, I promise!</li>
            <li> take a shower first to open the pores, no lotion beforehand, maybe shave the day before so you&#x27;re pulling shorter hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for my legs, I did experience a lot of severe red bumps around my ankles the first time I used this, but they faded after two days</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator the first one I had stop working and decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, which I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> , it used to come back in 2 weeks (still better than coming back the same day with shaving).  </li>
            <li> like they did when they first came on the market way back.</li>
            <li> : they send a small brush with the package,  make sure you use it.</li>
            <li> Most of my ingrown hair occurs where my legs rub together since I usually sit with my legs</li>
            <li> Obviously they were pretty well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is loud!</li>
            <li> It is loud!</li>
            <li> And I was so surprised to have all the hair gone!</li>
            <li> it totally hurts at first</li>
            <li> i use it every other week to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she has to use it more often than her last one,it has 72 tweezers and is no faster than any other brands she has used.</li>
            <li> * Back of knee - Fast!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li> My armpit hair takes a bit more, likely due to the terrain.  </li>
            <li> First, you really need to us it every day for the first few weeks  in order to get maximum results.</li>
            <li> Good price, maybe one day I&#x27;ll buy the cordless, but I have so few hairs left on my legs and underarms, this one will last for years.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li> of course that hurts, but because the head is strong, you do little rounds and you know the hairs are leaving.</li>
            <li> However, I have gotten certain sensitive parts of skin &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the epilator, which sounds extremely painful but was actually not bad--their safety feature stopping the heads from spinning works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it and the only last thing I&#x27;ll say is to clean it out and sort of like use the little white bristle brush thing after every few good rounds with it to get any hair out of the tweezing area.</li>
            <li> I also find it more difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> The more serious ones were very helpful...</li>
            <li> Now I only shave every couple weeks just as a way of exfoliating and if I want an extra clean shave for shorts or a bathing suit day.</li>
            <li> It worked out fine for this product since the cord it comes with is extra long.  </li>
            <li> Something is different in this model because with the older model I never felt any discomfort just a tingling sensation , but with this one I really feel the hair being pulled.</li>
            <li> I used a nail file to smooth it down</li>
            <li> Good price, faster than average, however it is a little louder (probably because it has two heads)</li>
            <li> Also, by experience with wax and other methods, if you never had depilation pulling the hair, when we do the first time can bleed a tiny bit (specially under arms and sometimes bikini area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;d be targeting a specific hair (more on that later) and, after a pass, be thinking that it hadn&#x27;t worked because I didn&#x27;t feel anything, only to be surprised that it was gone.  </li>
            <li> Other epilators have some flexibility in how they make contact with your skin, but this one is just fixed and open faced, so even if there&#x27;s more tweezers</li>
            <li> but they have plenty of the parts to make and fill orders for complete new units.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know, I have an old Philips, I might just go and buy the new version of Philips again</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi was destroyed and I found myself searching for a new epilator.</li>
            <li> Now in comparison to the old one, this new one saves me time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was brave and tried it on my underarms and it was painful.</li>
            <li> I do find that it hurts less than my Remington Smooth and Silky to use tho...</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to plug in the wall and sit comfortably nearby.  </li>
            <li> ; it is so cheaply made compared to my previous Epilator.  </li>
            <li> I probably spent more money on the batteries on the long run.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I missed having a light like my previous one had.  </li>
            <li> It sits easily in your hand, and while the instructions state which way round you&#x27;re supposed to hold it, the shape of the body makes you want to hold it that way anyway.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use on your legs, but you&#x27;ll have to go over the area a few times for it to catch all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is now not painful at all to use on my legs, nor do I get the red bumpy reaction like I initially got.</li>
            <li> At first, I used the red one to start, and finished with the old one and the auxiliary head.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit harder to use on your armpits, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li> and I can get his entire back done in 20 to 30 minutes (vs a full hour with the Braun).</li>
            <li> I then, due to very limited success, tried again the next day (greater than 72 hours at that point).  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing special that this does that my other epilator don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> ok so before i bought emjoy i already had braun silk epil which broke down after only two years after i bought it</li>
            <li> the appearance &amp; color is the only positive thing I can tell about this because this is the reason I got it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this about a year ago and there are only positive things to say.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and my skin remains smooth and hair free for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from amazon after reading the reviews and deciding that I need to try something new from shaving everyday for keeping my body hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li> It only makes your legs feel smooth if you wait until your hair is very long.  </li>
            <li> If you use one side, it does nothing; if you use both you&#x27;d better be pulling your skin super tight or it will suck in half your face!</li>
            <li> With my previous model, that definitely would have been more like a 30-40 minute job</li>
            <li> I love it because my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for around a week and a half</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work so much better than the one I was previously using that only had one head.  </li>
            <li> I love only having once a week, and sometimes less in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Also, my previous models were able to remove very short hair.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well and removes the growth quickly without to much trouble.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have very light blond very thin hair, so it&#x27;s not noticeable if I don&#x27;t also shave.  </li>
            <li> I have very course hair on my legs and moderate hair on the rest of my body, and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, the sound was a lot more frightening than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I know this may sound crazy, but it works so well that I almost miss getting to use it more often (being new and all ...)</li>
            <li> The first time I used my other epilator, it really hurt.  </li>
            <li> Some areas obviously are going to be more sensitive than others, though you might be suprised on that subject.</li>
            <li> The very first time I did both legs was uncomfortable, and because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react, I did a separate sitting for each leg.</li>
            <li> I went over an area on my legs 10 times and I could still see a number of full hair strands and many smaller broken hair strands on my red, peeling skin (thanks to the repeated tweezers exposure).</li>
            <li> Because of the large head, it is quicker, and it grabs really short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I believe that depends on the way certain hair types grow back.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 tweezers move fast, making the epilation process a lot less uncomfortable, and it grabs the tiniest hairs, so you get a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I do miss the little light on that one,with this one you don&#x27;t need to look.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made in construction</li>
            <li> I used Aloe Vera Gel afterward to smooth over my thighs; the cooling helped as the skin is a little tingly (again, it would be after waxing too).</li>
            <li> It takes me such a long time to get them completely clean</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough that I can use it while standing/sitting in my bath tub (so I don&#x27;t get hair all on the floor and it makes for easier clean up, I just turn the shower on to rinse away all the hair).</li>
            <li> The settings is either too fast or too slow when it comes to removing the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> With my previous epilator I was not able to stand the pain to do my bikini line or arm pits, with this I can easily do both pain free.</li>
            <li> I have never been bothered by discomfort with depilitating since getting used to original Epilady, but do find the Emjoi causes even less of a pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> So if this is your first I would suggest doing a little every day for the first couple weeks till you get used to it.</li>
            <li> They are a little red and tender, but I am sure it will heal overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something that will work and last for awhile.</li>
            <li> But more importantly for me is that other epilators have caused small cuts on the sensitive skin of my inner thighs.  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a little intimidating because I remember the pain when I first started tweezing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> When you epilate for the first time, do little bits at a time because my body had to adjust when I first epilated.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased two of these and can say that no other epilator is as reliable or removes as many hairs as efficiently as the Emjoi AP-18.  </li>
            <li> found it to be very sturdy and does exactly as expected as advertised, a little pain but what did you expect :-)  </li>
            <li> Underarms is okay, but whatever surface you use it on has to be one where the large double head can be down in a long stroke.</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s  cost more probably due to a limited market.</li>
            <li> I use this epilator daily (only because I cannot STAND feeling anything but baby butt smooth under my arms and due to my very quick hair growth and hairs having different growth cycles, it is necessary for my sanity).</li>
            <li> Disappointing but not a problem because Amazon is great about returns.</li>
            <li> Some complained about the cord, the cord is plenty long enough, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> - you could prob clear your chest hair in 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li> It also made epilating more painful because it had so many fewer tweezers and the tweezers spun at a slower rate.</li>
            <li> however its amazing for thick coarse hair!!!  </li>
            <li> it removes hair fast but unlike Braun brand, skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft and the hair grow back after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Huge minus is that it leaves short hair untouched.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s taken me 2 weeks, epilating for an hour every 2 days, to clear my legs, underarms, and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Bottoms of my pecs to my bellybutton gradually got more and more painful</li>
            <li> While it takes longer to clear a area then shaving, the area stays clear for 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi one before but it didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers, so it took longer and was more painful to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much difference between this product and the old, but they are totally different tools.  </li>
            <li> It took me less than 5 minutes to clean my lower leg.</li>
            <li> And I have noticed that the hair is growing back much slower.  </li>
            <li> I had to use my old epilator to remove the hairs that this one just would not remove.</li>
            <li> The only real issue I had was with in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is so loud.</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I hoped considering the discomfort associated, the process would be fast, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Gone is the rash that I would often get from shaving frequently.  </li>
            <li> As the hair grows back, it creates stubble, which nobody really wants.  </li>
            <li> It does not hurt nearly as much now, as during my initial use.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers DO NOT pull as efficiently as I hoped nor does this thing leave my legs soft.</li>
            <li> but it pulls the hairs and leaves my legs and hairs incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was going to be considerably faster, but nah.</li>
            <li> You have no choice but to buy the parts direct from Emjoi, which means you&#x27;re screwed.</li>
            <li> it is really loud device, if it matters for someone)  - maybe I&#x27;m mistaken, but it seems that it takes out longer hairs than, f.e.</li>
            <li> but I am not a fan of the cost of salon waxing which has burned my sensitive skin on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was expecting far worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old panasanoic took forever to charge and even if the charge wasn&#x27;t out all the way, it started losing power.</li>
            <li> Then, when you&#x27;re ready to use the epilator, take a bath to open the pores.</li>
            <li> Also, I find the underarm hairs that grow back are much lighter, finer &amp; fewer.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing that the hair is growing back much faster</li>
            <li> I then took the head apart (completely apart) and cleaned out the gears from debris.</li>
            <li> The postive reviews are either from people who reviwed too early or people trying to sell this to you.</li>
            <li> I have an old Emjoi Gold Caress since 2002.</li>
            <li> I thought: \\&quot;Wow, it will do the job</li>
            <li> When the hair does grow back, it&#x27;s much much thinner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far on every part of my body</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just using the old one.</li>
            <li> I had an old Emjoi gold caress rechargeable that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> It really took out the hairs quite well without having to go over the same spot repeatedly.</li>
            <li> but my old address was stuck in your computer</li>
            <li> I was really keen on the faster epilation aspect and that decided my purchase, and as others commented, overall it is</li>
            <li> , this has never been a problem with the old models.</li>
            <li> I can do everything quicker than my old emjoi.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to rebuy my old model.</li>
            <li> So far I like this epilator.</li>
            <li> What can I say except that I reordered a 2nd one, because everyone in my family wants to use mine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a coworker said that a similar model really works.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work on the peach fuzz on my face, and by using only the front set of tweezers, I think that it pulled them all out.</li>
            <li> I had no redness or irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if it just broke off the fuzz or really pulled it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t, however, use it in *cough, cough* more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> loud sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t, but it DOES work</li>
            <li> far as the pain issue goes....</li>
            <li> But I have 7 children who are trying to SLEEP at night, so I have to hide in a far corner of the house so as not to keep them up.</li>
            <li> The reason I timed this was because my old epilator took me about 48 minutes to an hour to remove hair from both my legs.  </li>
            <li> so you can imagine the pain of tweezing a hair somewhere sensitive but times a million.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I got several cuts from my Braun epilator in the bikini area, but with this epilator I have absolutely nothing of the sort.</li>
            <li> and this one will last longer because she really likes it.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Braun.</li>
            <li> and i cant imagine that it mihgt be such fast</li>
            <li> Would really like to try the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; system next.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the corded operation, I would prefer cordless and don&#x27;t know how I missed that one detail, however, the AC cord provided for power supply is quite lengthy and does not interfere much.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that could leave my skin feeling soft and wouldn&#x27;t leave bumps on my skin afterward.</li>
            <li> It is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> Its very time consuming to use this one since u have to keep going over the same area over and over again...</li>
            <li> I have very curly chest hair and unless I keep it shaved or trimmed very short, its itches unbearably.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about two months and while it still stings a bit, the pain has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> My 10+ years old Emoji epilator, which I hadn&#x27;t treated too well, like</li>
            <li> It was fast and covered a larger area than I was used to.</li>
            <li> This is a plug in unit only, must use a cord.&lt;br /&gt;The return was fast and simple,and credit was within two days.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the one area where I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit loud...</li>
            <li> thinking I had finally found a product that would help me not have to shave so much.  </li>
            <li> That gave me the idea to compare it to my old epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eighteen years old, and hopefully this review will help you decide whether this product is for you.</li>
            <li> This epilator is twice as fast as the last one I owned.</li>
            <li> A couple months after that I completely quit working.</li>
            <li> but just didnt pull the hairs completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard that pulling the hair out would last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> now i only really shave then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally hairy gal...</li>
            <li> By sensitive</li>
            <li> works really well anywhere else, especially underarms.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was the epilator getting too old</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to it, but with each use it&#x27;s much easier than the last.</li>
            <li> since I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I had the smaller one before, but this one is much quicker.</li>
            <li> and now my skin is just softly tingly.</li>
            <li> I personally find waxing these areas to be a nightmare and very hit or miss, and did not want to spend a fortune going to a salon.     </li>
            <li> You have to be in a very well lit room or outside to see the lighter or finer hairs on your legs.</li>
            <li> Hair grows back too fast to invest the time it takes and to put up with the pain.</li>
            <li> it was loud, kept getting louder and stopped working 14 months.</li>
            <li> My old one did.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely unusable now.</li>
            <li> After years of research and hesitation I decided to purchase a replacement for my 14 yr old Braun silk epil.</li>
            <li> It does get much easier if you keep it up because then you&#x27;ll only be covering 1/3-1/2 of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints nor does my old Braun owe me anything</li>
            <li> My regrowth has been reduced, a lot of the hairs don&#x27;t come back, and the ones that do seem thinner and softer, also, the weekly use in the beginning is now around every two weeks, however, there are the one or two hairs that are fast growers and the ones missed because I can&#x27;t see some areas.</li>
            <li> Also, this is a some what loud device.    </li>
            <li> and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast.</li>
            <li> why I switched all those years ago) is that, over time, the hairs grow back much thinner and weaker.</li>
            <li> In my expericence, this one won&#x27;t completely do that.</li>
            <li> I find I only really have to pass over an area twice to pull almost all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the Emoji 18 72 tweezers because my old 48 tweezer just wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use deodorant directly after using this</li>
            <li> Just glide it softly over the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go by my experience as far as pain level</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, like I do, you may not have any issues with the machine.  </li>
            <li> It is so loud and clunky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of the smaller epilators which were really noisy and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Also, it only works if you hold it absolutely perpendicular to your skin, unlike an electric razor which can go off the 90-degree angle and still work</li>
            <li> I even tried at-home Brazilian waxing to try to get a cleaner hair removal at home without the expense of the professional services every month, all to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I rationalized the expense with the fact that professional leg waxing costs anywhere from $65 to $90 a visit depending on location and full/half leg services.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, for those areas I still use my old emjoi gold since the head is thinner.</li>
            <li> it was fast, removed all my hair and it didnt grow back for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> It is considerably faster than just one row of tweezers.</li>
            <li> And the thing is loud, like really loud.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is necessary to shorten the hairs and make them much easier for the tweezer heads to grab.  </li>
            <li> I have an old epilator from Braun that I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> Emjoi discourages re-growth of hair, and the hair that does grow back is much sparser.</li>
            <li> 5-10 minutes) for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The hair grows in soft so there is no stubble.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kinda loud.</li>
            <li> I think that the bikini area is just a sensitive area</li>
            <li> I am by far no expert on this yet.</li>
            <li> it actually worked really well.  </li>
            <li> but it really just broke off the hair because they were stubbly the next day.  </li>
            <li> No problem so far.</li>
            <li> I have exama and using a regular razor really bothers it</li>
            <li> I AM A VERY HAIRY WOMEN ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about how loud it is.</li>
            <li> So I lifted my shirt, and started near the belly button.</li>
            <li> pain in this is getting the whole tattoo done in one instant.</li>
            <li> and wow does it hurt.</li>
            <li> enough, this one is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think this pulls out hairs that my old braun missed.  </li>
            <li> It makes a loud noise when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> So far, I have done my butt cheeks,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really find that I needed it for this, but you might try it if you&#x27;ve got a low pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with skin irritation either.</li>
            <li> By the third time I was removing hair from areas much faster.  </li>
            <li> I dont agree with people who say in ten minutes they are done with both legs, it takes much longer</li>
            <li> Nowhere near childbirth on my pain scale, but it made my eyes water</li>
            <li> I have been exfoliating nearly every day during my shower to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have been exfoliating nearly every day during my shower to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Just completely unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> but again surprised that I can tolerate it and the pain</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as my thirty dollar cheapo version and removes almost no hair at all.</li>
            <li> It has a rather loud motor</li>
            <li> I had waxed for years, using both professional waxers and a home waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> Instead it takes much longer to cover the same area and often never pulls out all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I am considering returning it for rather than having to use two to complete the job.</li>
            <li> Makes a loud noise</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s loud too, but if it would have worked well</li>
            <li> the old Epilady I had to shave my underarms.</li>
            <li> so I know the next treatment will go much easier.</li>
            <li> I can only stand just so much.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from Emjoi.</li>
            <li> No discomfort (I was pleasantly surprised)</li>
            <li> I think I really did a big favor to myself!</li>
            <li> But I like the convenience of taking it out from the drawer and use it for a few minutes after shower to keep myself hair free.</li>
            <li> Not everyday, but once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> We did not mistreat it in any way, yet now it is completely nonfunctional, no matter what we try.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> But get it near my ace</li>
            <li> but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears.</li>
            <li> Like my old one, this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing back much finer and slower.  </li>
            <li> When I travel I am able to take it with me, and it only takes a few minutes when I just need a touch up.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with it so far is that for the sensitive underarm area, sometimes I&#x27;ve had to run it over more than twice to get a few remaining stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Since we are on our second one, we obviously believe it&#x27;s worth it, but I won&#x27;t lie.  </li>
            <li> Only with the Emjoi was I able to stand it long enough to really get the long term effects.  </li>
            <li> The problem was it died after a few months, I got two more emjois and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> It worked...but it took a solid week to build up my tolerance to use it for more than a few seconds in some places.</li>
            <li> The only trouble I had, was reaching the backs of my legs, but with some yoga positions I was able to get everything.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work good at all.</li>
            <li> The good news is it also gets the short, thin hairs.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the rotating tweezers of many other epilators will grab, pinch, or really irritate the skin if you don&#x27;t ensure that its pulled tight.  </li>
            <li> The growth of hair on my legs is interesting - very few from the calf down, around my knees, and thighs, but somewhat more under and above the back of my knees, but still 1/3 of what was there before I started using the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> The first use was quite intense for me, but that was because I&#x27;ve never epilated before, the second time was way less intense.</li>
            <li> In the end my legs and arms are smooth and the redness disappeared in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> I have another model of Emjoi which I was pretty happy with, but the one I have has an odd shape and bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The bristles need to be about twice as long to clean the catch basin, or at least let me remove the tweezer head barrels to actually clean this thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time it did this the abrasion wasn&#x27;t too severe and having had only positive experiences with Emjoi products, I thought perhaps it was my fault and exercised extra care during my next usage attempts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, if you look at the way the head is designed, it obviously can&#x27;t get right next to your skin because of the way the head is built up around the tweezer wheels, and the wheels themselves are almost concave, so if your legs/underarms/</li>
            <li> would NOT use this on my bikini line as the large head on it doesn&#x27;t lend itself to capturing the hair on anything beyond a relatively flat</li>
            <li> Prior to this I had been using an Epilady Legend (I had it for 4 years before I thought it was becoming less efficient), so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  Motor action feels and sounds the most hollow and rickety compared to other epilators I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> What I mean is I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve smoothness on my legs and knees.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to pull the skin as taut as possible, like other reviewers and the instructions recommended, and that definitely helped.</li>
            <li> It really does take much less time to get my legs done then any epilator I&#x27;ve had previously, and I really was a huge fan.</li>
            <li> And it creates a problem that even if you&#x27;re very hairy and working in a more densely hairy area, this product will leave small fine hairs behind.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi pulled much better and did not tug on hairs but grabbed and pulled them out much more quickly, meaning a much less painful experience.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not a fast epilator, but it gets the job done right.</li>
            <li> At first, I would get little bumps on certain follicles and I almost gave up on it</li>
            <li> Even if they hairs are short, long, fine or coarse.</li>
            <li> Epilator has 2 speeds, one is fast and the other is jet fast...</li>
            <li> From there, I use it less and less now because I don&#x27;t have so much hair any more.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit noisy and it doesn&#x27;t get into small areas easily</li>
            <li> Just remember you can&#x27;t use this one in the shower so you there is a little bit of clean up.</li>
            <li> The item also came with a carry bag and a little brush to clean the tweezer head, the cord, and the cover for the tweezer area.</li>
            <li> Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epliator) because the hair on my legs grows fairly quickly, meaning that the results of shaving don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I am ahead in the long run achieving a positive body image.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive underarm skin and due to shaving, it gets very very irritated and has become discolored.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t meant for a women&#x27;s gentle use area but did well on flat part of shins and calves.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no mess like with home waxing kits.</li>
            <li> No mess no fuss and removes hair from root.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall this happening with the first two I owned, but the last two developed the same problem.  </li>
            <li> it takes far less time and gets all my hair out, for the first time ever I can go 2 weeks or more before shaving again, no more in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought a braun after my south american neighbor told me how much better it was than the epilady.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to epilating you will find that you hair really does come back slower and some will not come back again after using awhile.</li>
            <li> I had to use it a few times before getting clean underarms.</li>
            <li> or it is not able to get hold of that fine hair.</li>
            <li> The most recent was purchased on Nov 17, 2014, which equates to approximately less than 3 months of regular use before they have crapped out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper</li>
            <li> i only tried this one because it&#x27;s suppose have more tweezers than my  Panasonic ES2045P Wet Dry Epiglide Epilator.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this probably pissed me off the most.</li>
            <li> Also, Emjoi sells a Black version for \\&quot;Men\\&quot; - don&#x27;t bother, the Red one works perfectly fine, and it was $40 cheaper.    </li>
            <li> Takes just as long and just as difficult around Binet areas.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for underarms and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> I have seriously never seen a bigger wimp!</li>
            <li> Purchased this same one for the second time as the first broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and I was loosing the battle of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss about my old epilator is that it had a light on it... but who needs a light to search for hairs left behind when there aren&#x27;t any?</li>
            <li> However I would not recommend this one to a newbie, the first time is torture enough without 72 tweezers pulling at the same time.    </li>
            <li> I was initially going to complain about how long it took to get my emagine, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This particular model basically has two heads and the tweezers go opposite directions.  </li>
            <li> The only epilator I used before is the classic coil one (my mom got me into it).  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and not exactly slight).</li>
            <li> The product was totally worth it though , it works quickly and you may have to do it several times to get all the hair , but it keeps hair away for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re a guy and your significant other doesn&#x27;t care for hair in various places, this will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> As in it is supposed to be held a certain way to go against the hair follicles a certain way but not really anything different than how you would shave or wax, etc.</li>
            <li> And under the right conditions, it will pull the hairs faster than the other Epilators.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this epilator, but now I&#x27;m back to waxing.</li>
            <li> my estitician gives A+ service, this epilator gives a low A to high A-.</li>
            <li> Taking 30 minutes is actually probably a high estimate.</li>
            <li> Braun comes with a built in smartlight which was actually very helpful in spotting short or very light, thin hairs.</li>
            <li> Consistent use of the Emjoi will keep you smooth longer and longer, and take less and less time to use.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a shaver attachment because my old one had one, as well as a plastic piece to put on the shaver that trimmed your hair to a shorter length that was still long enough for the epilator to easily grab it, but not too long that it pulled more than it needed to, and I think that was helpful.</li>
            <li> The only reason I switched is because I thought more tweezer heads would mean less time, but I can see it would take me many times as long with this product.</li>
            <li> The next time was MUCH better, to get the little ones missed which grew up about 4days later.</li>
            <li> girlfriend has had major problems with ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I had this machine for just over one year before it stopped working - given that this is one of the more expensive epilators, I was expecting something a little more durable.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the smaller Emjoi to get to my bikini, underarms and facial hair a little better.  </li>
            <li> This epilator really saves your time,will not hurt much and less or no ingrown hair problem</li>
            <li> My legs, left razor-blade smooth in record time, I kept turning around, half expecting the cops to pull me over for speeding.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done this personally, as I mentioned, I will tolerate less than smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> easy to do the arms and legs with only some pain after you get used to epilating a few times&lt;</li>
            <li> In comparison with my old Braun, the new epilator is pretty slow and doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair very well.</li>
            <li> The other disadvantage of design of this product is that it is not possible to open the case easily to fix it.</li>
            <li> After reading such positive reviews I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase and haven&#x27;t looked back since!</li>
            <li> After shaving it would take longer and possibly would be more painful as there will be more hair to &amp;#</li>
            <li> I recommend starting on the lower speed, even though it may be more painful, you will get better results.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly, that didn&#x27;t hurt so much as afterward, as would any minor abrasion or razor nick.</li>
            <li> It took 4 hours just to do the legs, but again, I often had let it go so long that my legs were really hairy.  </li>
            <li> * Ankle (those long hairs that I always miss with the razor and would shred myself if I tried to get) - took seconds to do and was so fast there was no pain (0).</li>
            <li> those 7 first tries...</li>
            <li> my first experience with epilating)*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself a day between receiving it and using it...for mental preparation.  </li>
            <li> Worth it for girls with dark hair like me.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it to my leg, I was braced for the pain I expected to follow.</li>
            <li> Then I became ambitious and tried to epilate again as there was not much hair there.  </li>
            <li> I do sometimes epilate my legs because the hair comes back thinner, but I don&#x27;t normally do my legs--maybe once every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Sure takes a lot longer than a regular razor since you have to pass over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li> Hurts the first time, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Feeling accomplished, I reach down to rub what I assume will be a smooth, though very red, leg, only to find that it only removed about 70% of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The machine is not very efficient, it takes a long time to clean the hair.</li>
            <li> I used lotion, and creams to calm it down, but it was no use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly return this within the next two weeks; and will probably go for another Braun, but a corded model this time since their epilators seem to actually work well.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I expected a little more from emjoi.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and I don&#x27;t get all the little red bumps I used to get.  </li>
            <li> Since it has almost twice as many tweezers as other epilators it works a lot faster and hurts a lot less.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she has always used one of the Braun products but they just didn&#x27;t last, between her and my 2 17 yr old daughters, it broke down too quickly.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and after I paid to ship it back to them, they replaced it with a new one.</li>
            <li> Since I thought the same thing might happen to a new one, I waited until we moved back to the US to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I dont expect this to last for years but for the price I&#x27;ll buy new ones as they die.</li>
            <li> so I finally decided to try something new -- this epilator.</li>
            <li> it was 7 days ago and have not noticed ANY new hair growth after the last session (remember your hair grows in cycles, so it takes about a week to get all of it</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I recently lost my optima but also assumed this must be a new and improved version since it&#x27;s been almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> I live that it plugs into the wall because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it losing power in the middle of de-hairing myself.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute little bag too!!!</li>
            <li> Over time I got more comfortable with the pain of tattooing, and I knew this thing couldn&#x27;t hurt that bad.</li>
            <li> The double heads actually do remove the hair more efficiently than my previous epilator that only had the one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She&#x27;s gotten used to the slight bit of &#x27;pain&#x27; from the tweezing action, and said it&#x27;s a lot less work than waxing was.  :)</li>
            <li> and dry off really well.</li>
            <li> As far as pain goes, yeah, it hurts, but less and less each time, and pain is beauty as my grandma likes to say. :)</li>
            <li> Unlike that one, this Emjoi is less painful and I am able to finish shaving my legs with much fewer passes (I suspect because it has more tweezers).  </li>
            <li> No matter which brand you buy, if you do it at least once a week, it will go fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> One leg took me a long time but ONLY because it was my first time.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews (mostly for the Braun 5270) &amp; besides the pain a lot of women complained about, I had gotten the idea that you only had to use the epilator once every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It did take a while to epilate both of my legs the first time (at least an hour), but after the first time it goes by a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old one (15-18 years old) and is a big improvement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention, even after I spend forever trying to get rid of the hairs and it finally gets a few, my legs do not feel smooth AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I will likely buy a smaller epilater for  my face if I feel that it really is removing that fuzz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These would be much better suited to have at least brass gearing to stand up to dude hairs with regular use (</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t chew on my armpits like my (previous) inexpensive tweezer did, and that&#x27;s worth the price upgrade alone.</li>
            <li> I thought I don&#x27;t really need such a big epilator for my face</li>
            <li> , what I heard from others was that it only took a few strokes for this device to get all of your hairs and leave you with smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I like using epilators because they are cheaper than waxing in the long run, and you get to the point, after consistently using it on an area, that you only have to do a touch up here or there</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth after use and the hair takes a few weeks to grow back.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that with regular use the pain is minimal and worth it for the result.</li>
            <li> I use it about every 6 weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than regular shaving, but your skin feels much softer than when using a razor.</li>
            <li> They work about the same, but without such a high price tag!</li>
            <li> ( I initially did it in straight lines and all that happened was red irritated skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Braun Epilator finally died - it was old, probably 15, maybe even 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> Hair grows back 3 to 4 weeks later and much much thinner.</li>
            <li> The hair on my shoulders/arms is quite thick, and this took it out EASILY.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy guy with about 2-3 hairs hairs growing out of many of my hair follicles, I bought this epilator to remove the rather thick, coarse hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;Painful</li>
            <li> It is too thick for the upper lip, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get used to the pain on that area.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the corded models because (a) batteries create waste and (b) batteries lose charge quickly in a device like this.  </li>
            <li> I find it fun to use which might sound weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very exciting to know that my legs are virtually hair free and that I no longer need to be embarrassed due to poor shaving.</li>
            <li> and I thought something good, but I made a huge mistake this is not really a good one.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very slow!</li>
            <li> The reality is that this one is far less precise than the single tweez.</li>
            <li> use it all over upper and middle body as far down as the top of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is a little intense to start with</li>
            <li> Having a hard time waxing myself, I decided to purchase a couple epilators: a small one for the bikini (great product:&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover) and a bigger one for the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said for the price of a single wax or thereabouts this is a reasonable tool for its purpose</li>
            <li> Yes, the girly area hurt like a mo-fo the first time, but just like other reviews claimed</li>
            <li> They were bare and smoother than I ever remember them being!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to razors, so I have no other choice but to do depilation.</li>
            <li> Nothing major, but this emjoi epilator is so painfree</li>
            <li> I had these small patches of hair on my lower-mid back and within minutes the Emjoi devoured the hair and left my skin smooth as a baby!  </li>
            <li> As time went by, the motor got weak and the faster speed was the better choice.</li>
            <li> I saw on some other reviews there were remarks on pain at first...</li>
            <li> Like I said, nothing major.</li>
            <li> The blond hairs on my upper lip are pretty short, so I couldn&#x27;t get them all (plus I have a monroe piercing above one side and didn&#x27;t feellike taking it out)</li>
            <li> I epilated 3 days after first time due to the difference in hair growth and that lasted 6 days.  </li>
            <li> those of you expecting \\&quot;good\\&quot; results froma small, one-time expense as opposed to the regular expense of waxing to get \\&quot;great\\&quot; results - this product is a dream come true!</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new emjoi product since my old one broke after a long time of use.  </li>
            <li> Once again, I have spent many hours reading hundreds of reviews, and based on the reviews, have (once again) narrowed it down to the same Emjoi, or one of the Braun models.  </li>
            <li> My advise would be to get professionally waxed first and then epilate as hairs regrow, it would hurt way less than if you just do it after having shaved for years.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel like some hairs get broken, so there&#x27;s pretty quick re-growth still.</li>
            <li> This is NOWHERE near as painful as repeated waxing (which I did get used to over several sessions); epilating with this machine is more like having someone lightly scratch me with their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be better about pulling out hair, but I still need to do a second round later in the day or the next day, to get the stray hairs that it missed.  </li>
            <li> Think about it - Who in their right mind would subject themselves to something like this?</li>
            <li> The skin is not as smooth as it would be if you were waxing your body, but it is much easier to use and way less messy.</li>
            <li> I have taken the Bruan Epil 7 Epilator into the shower (because it is completely water proof, which this emjoi is NOT), and it really feels the same as dry epilating.  </li>
            <li> found shaving after left me with less ingrown hairs and left my legs incredibly smooth</li>
            <li> And forget the whole bit about lifting up short and flat hairs..</li>
            <li> I only wish is was half as powerful as my old one.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to get this and was so excited that it only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> have used epilators for over 20 years and my older ones lasted a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that large at all.</li>
            <li> I was red raw by the time I&#x27;d managed to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> I rarely need to use it on my under arms any longer, as so little hair grows there now.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it and totally recommend it to any one who is a serious epilater.</li>
            <li> It will hurt less and less the more you use it.</li>
            <li> But, I know it&#x27;ll hurt less and less the more I use</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m not convinced spending the extra money on this particular model for the extra tweezers</li>
            <li> It took me a third of the time doing my entire legs compared with my epilady, granted it was an older one, so the motor did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t all that coarse, it&#x27;s fine; but I couldn&#x27;t understand how that would wear down this little machine so much?</li>
            <li> I love that it pulls the hair from the root, no more stubble!!  </li>
            <li> The charging function was kind of ridiculous because you never knew how long the charge would last</li>
            <li> I had used the Braun for several years and loved it, but like many other users, was frustrated with how long it took to epilate my legs.  </li>
            <li> After reading more about it, I figured I certainly couldn&#x27;t go wrong with almost double the number of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> 3/4 of my leg was hair-free, the other 1/4 had stubble where the hair either broke off, or I just didn&#x27;t have it at the right angle to pull it out efficiently enough.</li>
            <li> I will say though, that the growth that does come in the course of the week is pretty hard to see, unless someone is really looking for it.  </li>
            <li> It is just a little unpleasant at first, not painful, but once you go over your skin a couple of times, you are ok with it.</li>
            <li> I have mostly fine blonde hair on my legs and a very few darker hairs on my shins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction or more obvious on my skin because I&#x27;m downright pale, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive</li>
            <li> I have had a Braun epilator for years that is painful, but does a great job at ripping out the hair roots.</li>
            <li> Some spots are so painful that you need to go to your happy place to get through it.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research before deciding to buy an epilator in general, and then before choosing this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I hunted all over Amazon, hair forums, and general google searches.</li>
            <li> 5318.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some general comments:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> , I wanted my hair removed and it was, just not as smoothly, gentle, and long lasting as the manufacturer&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> So if you go in the opposite direction (as if you were shaving), it clearly breaks off the hairs instead of pulls them by the root.  </li>
            <li> Getting the small hairs takes so much time that it negates the amount of time you thought you saved when working in the very hairy area.   </li>
            <li> That was not good because now the whiskers were coming in more  and were white.  </li>
            <li> Also realize that the first time you use it, it will be torture (unless you&#x27;re used to waxing); but before too long it&#x27;ll be just a minor discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It does not last as long as waxing, but very close</li>
            <li> It takes too many passes to do my legs completely bare, and then I have to do it again soon to get the hairs that were just broken off, not plucked.</li>
            <li> BUT REALLY, IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIMER, IT WILL HURT at least the 1st 5</li>
            <li> But because I&#x27;ve been yanking hair out from its roots for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hates razor stubble or the pain of waxing because it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, unless you&#x27;re really sensitive.  </li>
            <li> but now I barely notice the pain when I do it.</li>
            <li> SO far I have only used it on my legs,</li>
            <li> The head is detachable for easier cleaning if you wish, and comes off as a completely separate unit, with no internal working exposed on either the body or the head when it is removed.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll placed teeth, this barely catches any hairs on curvy surfaces like knees or chin.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the men&#x27;s one is the same and you should save money and just buy this version.</li>
            <li> --I apparently didn&#x27;t have the pain tolerance to use it, and so I returned it.</li>
            <li> It barely grabbed ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li> So far today I only done one leg!</li>
            <li> And its just like mowing a tall grass lawn: don&#x27;t do it while its wet and don&#x27;t move the device fast, or you&#x27;ll miss some hairs and burn out the engine.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful to try this on my underarms because it had always been way too rough for me</li>
            <li> and it disappeared for a while to come back as whiskers in my old age and not just as a mustache but whiskers on my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get far since it was leaving my skin with red bumps ,blotchy patches and bleeding hair</li>
            <li> Now this product is making a squeaking noise and barely turns....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done my arms, so far.</li>
            <li> AP-18 last May after my old epilator (Braun) bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and coarse hair</li>
            <li> The wide head makes fast work  of what I find to be a chore.</li>
            <li> Everything I had tried irritated my eczema further and caused flair-ups - shaving with a razor, shaving with an electric shaver, neet, the sandpaper type leg-hair remover, home waxing...until I began getting professional leg-waxing.  </li>
            <li> My old emjoi epilator broke several years ago.  </li>
            <li> Your hairs grow back soft</li>
            <li> but i never expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> It barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li> I made an attempt at my knees, but the curved bony area didn&#x27;t take well to the Emjoi, it barely removed any hair.  </li>
            <li> The inside was tender, but no where near as tender as the outside calf.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it didn&#x27;t seem to get the hair that was near the bony areas of my legs(shins and knees)too</li>
            <li> I am surprised how well it works and definitely wish I would have gotten one sooner.</li>
            <li> I am a 19 year old male</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a complete elimination of shaving, but I only have to shave once a week.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brand I have tried so far, so</li>
            <li> After my old epilator&#x27;s sudden death I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I replaced it with the same brand I have been using for decades, an Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I have used several kinds of epilators, home wax kits, gotten professionally waxed etc for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Took too much time &amp; didn&#x27;t get the results expected.  </li>
            <li> I shaved them and they&#x27;re soft again , my hair hasn&#x27;t grown back , and no bumps.</li>
            <li> So I was not at all surprised that this epilator didn&#x27;t last a year...</li>
            <li> Naturally hairy female</li>
            <li> I can barely stand using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be the only thing that outweighs my old epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a replacement to my old Emjoi that finally gave out after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use blades or shaving cream for my underarms because they are extra sensitive</li>
            <li> I spent weeks researching different epilators since this would be my first one.</li>
            <li> , you DO need to go over some areas repeatedly, and you need your significant other to do your center of your back and upper back as you can&#x27;t really reach it yourself.    </li>
            <li> Sorry about that, it&#x27;s just an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It takes way too many passes for something with 72 tweezers to grab hairs and even then, it does a poor job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of wearing pants that cover my legs during the summer and not being able to wear tank tops</li>
            <li> It did pull out some of the hairs, but for the most part, it snapped the hairs instead, leaving me worse off then when shaving.  </li>
            <li> I need to use it that often because it leaves so many hairs behind.</li>
            <li> It does not pick up hair on one pass, takes 5-7 passes and even then most of hair are broken off instead of pulled from the root.</li>
            <li> THIS EMJOI IS OKAY FOR THICKER HAIR, BUT WHEN IT IS THIN (LIKE MINE IN MY LEGS), THE EPILATOR DOESN&#x27;T PULL THEM OUT FROM THE ROOT BUT CUTS THEM..</li>
            <li> I love this product , I hate doing waxing looking for something like this product, at the same time  not a razor, this works like a magic, just a note use it after you take a bath.</li>
            <li> drawback with the Emjoi is that is not great around contours like around the knees, the Epilady works better in that area.</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a sweet little carrying bag (for travel) with a plastic divider inside in the center and a little brush to help clean the tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It runs a little more than the Braun one that I had in the past, but when you consider that a leg wax is $50+ it pays for itself by the second use, on the first use if you also normally wax your arms or any other area.  </li>
            <li> I finally went back over the area with my inexpensive old Braun silk epi 3 which is on its last legs after years of use, and it still got the hairs this new one missed repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> By morning, there were NO little red dots on my legs.</li>
            <li> I did not find it any less painful or more effective, and it was just easier for me to epilate outside of the bath.</li>
            <li> This new one is much larger and can cover a larger surface area.</li>
            <li> Hurts much less than my old emjoy and is so much faster to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement, as a matter of fact, it removes even less hair than my old standby.  </li>
            <li> Keeping the lip and chin smooth has been a challenge for me, but no more!</li>
            <li> As women, I think we&#x27;ve all played around with epilators, and the love/hate division is right down the middle.</li>
            <li> On that note, it took me about 2 hours in total to epilate my full legs and entire bikini area the first time; but as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve spent only a few minutes each week maintaining since then.   </li>
            <li> I have owned an epilator for a few years and have had good success with it until more recently when I started to get nasty red bumps on my legs every time I epilate.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it it worked as good, maybe slightly better than the bruan, but even after only a few uses I could tell the piece of crap was breaking down.</li>
            <li> It hurt much less than I thought it would when I first used it.</li>
            <li> And after the first month it works even less,  even after being cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I called in and the lady told me to use a little rubbing alcohol, and that worked a little better.</li>
            <li> as I said, I&#x27;ve used 3 other models consistently over the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s my first one, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any louder or quieter than other brands, but there is definitely a</li>
            <li> Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li> Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li> takes many passes in the same area to get all the hairs and after a year it became so weak that it stops working when you push it against the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I tried following the directions and all advice I could get from other reviews.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to get some of that loose skin stretched nice and tight or you may tweeze off a bit of flesh.</li>
            <li> Not knowing how long the hairs had to be (ok, .4mm, but seriously, who can measure that?)</li>
            <li> It works well if you are mainly using it for legs and arm, but a little too wide for small areas &amp; doesn&#x27;t perform as effectively as on the larger areas.</li>
            <li> 4/5 because it is harder to do it in certain places and you have to go through the same spot over and over.</li>
            <li> Also, up until the last month or so, when the hair on my legs grew back, it was always soft and I could barely feel it,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the other epilator brands, but this one works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It is so much faster than the Braun or Epilady and grabs the hairs that the other epilators missed.  </li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, the thing hurt so much, I was hopping from one foot to the other while trying to remove my underarm hair.</li>
            <li> The sensation is a little like a light electric zap, not really like a pinch.  </li>
            <li> The whole process now turned into a disaster, with me spending 40 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> All other areas of my body have responded much faster.</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I din&#x27;t believe it takes so much of time when I read other reviews.</li>
            <li> and possibly a whole lot of other folks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just so much faster and easier than any other methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this and other epliators, I was a bit worried that it would hurt too much.  </li>
            <li> (I thought this as someone who had waxed in the past) but this actually hurt more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Few tips - make sure to stretch the skin to help reduce pain and try to do it after a shower so that the hair is a little easier to pull out.</li>
            <li> But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Product lasts a long time without damaging your skin (as razors do) or becoming dull</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, so I can only compare it to conventional women&#x27;s shaving, but I have to say I am SOLD.  </li>
            <li> Waxing of course is a little messy and a little more time consuming, but the real downfall was that you have to let your hair growout before you can do it again!</li>
            <li> My legs responded the same way that they do to a professional leg waxing as far as my skin is concerned and my eczema seems to be remaining unaffected!  </li>
            <li> Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though a lot of people will try to persuade you that a wet epilator would 1) hurt less 2) be easier to clean, i think both claims are misleading.</li>
            <li> Recently, however, I noiced that it is not picking up short fine hairs and is now missing the long, coarser hairs as well.  </li>
            <li> It does leave the area red and sensitive for a short time.  </li>
            <li> It is also simply too big to get anywhere near the bikini line.</li>
            <li> Direction seemed hair dependent - sometimes I&#x27;d have no success for several passes going in the growth direction, then I&#x27;d go against the growth and get it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, last but not least, the cord is really long, which is</li>
            <li> Since my old epilator was so, well, old, I expected technology would have improved this devices.</li>
            <li> I found that no matter how much time I spent on each leg there were always patches of hair left over.</li>
            <li> Not having the finances or local resources (only one place near me does it</li>
            <li> After several failed reattempts at starting and screaming like my 3-year old child mid-tantrum, my husband came to make sure I was still alive.  </li>
            <li> It is not going to hurt as much to pull out 1/4 inch of hair line as it would doing the entire 1 1/2 (or so) inch wide head.</li>
            <li> Minor discomfort the first time, but considering I did almost every area, it wasn&#x27;t at all as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am now concerned that it will take my legs a LONG time to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; if they do at all.  </li>
            <li> I am now concerned that it will take my legs a LONG time to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; if they do at all.  </li>
            <li> that extra service that you&#x27;re actually paying for when you see a professional.</li>
            <li> This is the first Epilator I have purchased, so I felt it was unfair to give it a full 5 stars, since I had nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work decently on my bikini line, but I could just use my EpiSlim there, so that&#x27;s not much of a saving</li>
            <li> This works great on my mix of thin and thick hairs.  </li>
            <li> Pulls out the hair fast, I use the highest speed and because it pulls so many hairs out at once, so quickly, it seems less painful..</li>
            <li> so I only used it once, but I knew that with the pain of childbirth behind me and being used to leg waxing, I should now be able to handle epilation without a problem.  </li>
            <li> For me, I can use the emjoi in about 1/4 the time, and the time savings is definitely worth the few tiny hairs that remain.  </li>
            <li> I found them very forgiving in terms of how they had to be held against the skin, and how fast or slow you had to move them around on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had little hairs grow back right away</li>
            <li> I loved it for my bikini line and other sensitive areas because it was easy and no mess like waxing, but it would leave it with the worst ingrown hairs ever despite exfoliating, ingrown hair pads etc etc.</li>
            <li> Where is the progress in technology?&lt;br /&gt;It has a hard time grabing onto the hair, requiring more passes over the skin &amp; consequently I end up spending as much time, if not more, than with my last Braun Silk Epil</li>
            <li> This little device works really well!</li>
            <li> While using this does mean a bit if pain the results are well worth the discomfort!  </li>
            <li> IMMENSE amounts of pain while barely leaving evidence of said torture!  </li>
            <li> I did not have to shave the next day and that was a major improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did hurt a little the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> its still a little stuby the first use.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little bit the first time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does sting a little the first time</li>
            <li> First time removal of facial hair will be painful but effective, it gets easier after the second time.</li>
            <li> It might be because I have a high pain tolerance as people state, but I never really thought I did.</li>
            <li> While researching my next model, I found most epilator reviews ridiculous and unhelpful!</li>
            <li> but since i am asian with wheatish complexion and black hair its pretty visible.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not really sure but is better than shaving and having the hair showing after less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> When I finally decided I was sick of how long it took with my old Philips (which, compared to the Braun it replaced, I&#x27;ve never been terribly happy with) and came to amazon to pick up the optima, I found this improved model and pounced on it.</li>
            <li> Mine grows fast enough in a day to shave everyday, but may have been a little short for a true trial.  </li>
            <li> Also, on the more painful spots I would go over quickly a couple of times, so the pain was in short bursts rather than constant.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to buying the product so I would have a general idea of what to expect.</li>
            <li> hahaha like its not worth it at all</li>
            <li> I only have to use mine every 3-5 days to have bare underarms all the time.</li>
            <li> Barely noticed the occasional sting.</li>
            <li> This product takes twice as long to depilate as the old one.</li>
            <li> And I figured the dual head action would speed up the epilation, considering my biggest gripe is how long epilation</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the only epilator I have used on my face that does not hurt a lot, especially in the sensitive area above the lip.</li>
            <li> It took me just as long to epilate as with my old one (Braun SE 5 series.)  </li>
            <li> : I have been a long time epilator and have a 2.5yr old Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle.</li>
            <li> It’s just that they both had a very short life apparently.</li>
            <li> And when your leg hair grows back, you can barely see it.  </li>
            <li> it sounds loud and scary.my hair wasnt even long.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying some numbing spray and using that the first few times.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same spot on my legs slowly and several times to get them really smooth</li>
            <li> it hurt the first few times, but you got used to it &amp; it stopped hurting.</li>
            <li> Now I know some people complained about they wish it was cordless but truely corded will keep its power.</li>
            <li> I believe the results are worth the small amount of pain endured.</li>
            <li> The phrase &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; came to mind a few times during my first use.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> you buy it, take care not to press firmly and brace yourself for that first 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure now if it was worth</li>
            <li> I did shave first then use the epilator everyday to get used to it</li>
            <li> But with either epilating or waxing, the hair is obviously pulled out completely, so when they do grow back, the end is a fine tip that isn&#x27;t nearly as irritating.  </li>
            <li> I can get a smooth leg just by shaving in less time with less hassle.  </li>
            <li> Hair grows much faster on legs from the knee down.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better,less painful, and very easy.</li>
            <li> It is becoming more bearable with each use, and I really less painful than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Sure, it hurts less, but that&#x27;s because it only pulls out a few hairs at a time!  </li>
            <li> The head is big enough for some major coverage too.</li>
            <li> me preface to say that I&#x27;m not a very hairy girl, and I&#x27;m actually lucky in the leg hair arena that it&#x27;s only dark below my knees.  </li>
            <li> and it is well worth a little bit of discomfort (in the beginning) for long term results.</li>
            <li> , the pain is less the second time, significantly less the third time and pretty much non-existent thereafter.  </li>
            <li> My Silk epilator has a small light near the head that clearly illuminates the fine hairs that are otherwise very difficult to see, even in a well lit room.</li>
            <li> But if you are working in an area where there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair, it has a hard time picking up the fine single hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to keep your skin taut and don&#x27;t push it down hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> This new one is so great and MUCH less painful.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned before the first use is the most painful.</li>
            <li> I typically exfoliate once every three days, just to prevent ingrown hairs (I am very prone to them).</li>
            <li> It is sooooo much faster, you will finish in half the time.</li>
            <li> It works so much faster than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Keeping up on the hair removal makes it so much faster and easier and there is noticeably less regrowth over time.</li>
            <li> MUCH FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY OWNED EMJOI.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to take off hair and it doesn&#x27;t take off as much hair as it used to so overall, not worth my time anymore</li>
            <li> Over all, it seems to be well built and will hopefully last as long as my old Emjoi and Braun.</li>
            <li> It is loud enough that I do have to turn up the volume if I&#x27;m watching TV while I epilate, but not nearly as loud as say, a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I figured that even though it might hurt, with 72 pairs of tweezers, at least it will be over quickly.</li>
            <li> After the first few months my hair is growing back finer.</li>
            <li> There was very slight and bearable pain when I used it the first time.</li>
            <li> Even doing it once a week is thrilling for me compared to daily shaving and still not smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the epilator I only took off a few hairs then put it away while trying to get up my nerve.</li>
            <li> If you do that, then just a few hairs will grow back at first, and you can epilate them out without the torture of tearing ALL of them out at once.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt at first, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> My legs had a few days worth of razor stubble on them, so the hair wasn&#x27;t really long.  </li>
            <li> I loved it but within 60 days the one small plastic cog that joined the head to the body(motor)had broken and the epilator was unusable.</li>
            <li> Quick passes, slow passes.  </li>
            <li> The thick hairs hurt the most coming out hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However i have read hundreds of reviews and if my old eppi is anything to go by with a single tweezer head</li>
            <li> It hurts, that&#x27;s for sure - but no more than waxing and it hurts my wallet considerably less than waxing!</li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as shaving but my leg hair is noticeably thinned (at least 70 percent!).  </li>
            <li> when I first held it against my skin it stung a little but that last for only a second.  </li>
            <li> My back would actually hurt from doing it to long with my old one.</li>
            <li> However, after the first couple of shaves, I only have to shave my legs &amp; underarms about once a week to get the few hairs that grew in since the last shave.  </li>
            <li> and it was still painful but not bad since I was too buzzed to really care haha).</li>
            <li> Normally, I would have to shave every other day so this has been a time saver for me.</li>
            <li> but the second time I used it (which was 2 glorious, itch free WEEKS) I could hardly feel it!  </li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and arms and it took less then ten minutes, and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> now I notice not only less hair growth, but it is much thinner..</li>
            <li> It took me a solid half hour on each leg, but I really wanted to be thorough.  </li>
            <li> its easy to use, especially over time as your leg hair starts to thin out.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thick or coarse or anything; its medium hair.</li>
            <li> If you have deep, coarse, hard rooted guy hair, you are going to tire of the pain and repetition quickly.</li>
            <li> Even after I got used to it, the areas around my ankles and knees were always the most sensitive, but not so bad with this new model.</li>
            <li> having spent so much for this I expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Especially for the armpits, it just makes all the hair grow at least 3x slower and when it does grow back it isn&#x27;t an issue waiting for it to get long enough to epilate again since it&#x27;s so light now.</li>
            <li> Not long ago I went to a local laser hair removal tech to get an estimate on getting my back and shoulders done.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that if your hair is not long enough it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Which is fine but a pain in the behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to Epilators so for me there was absolutely no pain as I&#x27;ve read in reviews for other epilators, but those people may be using them for the first time.  </li>
            <li> overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy this emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months if you use it as heavily as I do.</li>
            <li> overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy this emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months if you use it as heavily as I do.</li>
            <li> The gear in the handheld part driving the head is the weak point, Don&#x27;t expect more than 3-4 years from this machine as the gear starts slipping and eats itself up.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on I jumped a little!  </li>
            <li> first time I used it, the noise was a little intimidating, but no longer!</li>
            <li> Even when it was working I found it broke off more hairs than it pulled, the large head made it difficult to get into tight areas such as my pits and bikinis line.</li>
            <li> Even though the Emagine looks large and heavy, it&#x27;s not at all.</li>
            <li> You will have to wait for hair to grow long enough and you will have to use this often, consistently and after several weeks of using this for 45 minutes or longer sessions, you will find that the hair is sparser and less course.</li>
            <li> After only a few months and only a few uses it no longer pulls out my hairs easily.</li>
            <li> well, I was gritting my teeth and ready to scream, but as I saw this little contraption spinning around and ripping my leg hairs out, I sucked up the pain and pushed forth.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get it all done, but my skin is so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> In its defense ... I do have very fine hair, but again it is performing worse than other epilator</li>
            <li> But it is true that it hurts less and less with each use.  </li>
            <li> I would put this upwards of a 4 on the pain level for as little as I got done; the machine really was too big to get any closer than the outer edges of the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short</li>
            <li> It leaves little bumps for a few hours but the next day your skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always started at my ankles and worked my way up because it hurts the least there and a little more the further you get up your legs, and when I started at my ankle there was almost no pain.</li>
            <li> Up near the \\&quot;bum\\&quot; on the backs of my thighs (where the \\&quot;seat\\&quot; and thigh meet) was a little sensitive; that&#x27;s probably a solid 3 for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very loud it drowns out every other noise you may have going in the room.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Emojoi only came with the cord and a cleaning brush, but considering I never once used the other attachments provided from Braun, Emojoi wins this catagory as well - less is sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but to me that would be throwing good money after the bad.</li>
            <li> Love it,not painful at all,and it is very fast.only prob is that the package says it has a shaving attachment</li>
            <li> (before I started epilating 10 yrs ago, it was very heavy &amp; dark), I usually only use the Emjoi once every 4 – 6 wks, but it takes me a good hour at least.</li>
            <li> It also  does the job much faster than previous models, bonus!  </li>
            <li> Before it would take me 1-1.5 hrs to do my whole legs, but now it&#x27;s half that!  </li>
            <li> Was very excited to get my epilator, unfortunately will have to send back.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use an electric shaver but that only keeps me smooth for half a day before I have stubble.  </li>
            <li> I have been told that as you keep doing it, the roots get less deep, but that first time is rough.</li>
            <li> When you have a moderate amount of hair it obviously hurts more but the more you remove, the less and less painful it is.</li>
            <li> My first time ever epilating was after purchasing this Emagine, although I have EXTENSIVE experience with all other types of hair removal; I&#x27;ve been getting professional waxings for the past 10 years, and I also am in the process of both laser and electrolysis treatments on my legs.</li>
            <li> I first started sugar-waxing at home in the 1970&#x27;s - very messy process.</li>
            <li> it is normal, but you will get used to it and will hurt less the next times.</li>
            <li> Used another brand in the past that took FOREVER, but the Emjoi is so quick with minimal discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Shaving and the removal creams always left me with bumps and burns due to my sensitive skin, plus, the very next day my skin felt like sandpaper!!</li>
            <li> It is also very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Please GO SLOWLY and don&#x27;t use it right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a newbie like me and have sensitive baby white skin with thick dark hairs and this is your first time using an epilator Expect lots and lots of pain!</li>
            <li> very pale legs were dotted in red for the rest of the evening, but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> take a long time to get a clean look (up to 30 min per leg)&lt;br /&gt;-Hair has to be at least 1/2&#x27;&#x27; long to be pulled out successfully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery operated ones seem to die quite early on due to problems with the batteries and such.  </li>
            <li> Do this somewhere you can either vacuum or sweep or on a towel because the hairs all fall and shoot out</li>
            <li> It moves like a vacuum.</li>
            <li> first few times I used emjoi were uncomfortable and time consuming, but the more I used it and the slower the hair started growing back reduced the amount of time I spent shaving.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;m making a good choice, but this is not really a good one!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so slow!</li>
            <li> and I was a little nervous about buying one for such a high price .</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, and still leaves little red pin prick type marks, but those go away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this brand epilator in the past with great results, but this one is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> it was a lot louder and moved a lot faster than other epilators I have used and/or seen in action</li>
            <li> pain - some small pinching sensations only, no big deal really.</li>
            <li> This is a complete contradiction to the other reviews that I read on the product, so I assumed that I was using it incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> The price was far lower than any other site.  </li>
            <li> The pubic area was nowhere near what I anticipated it being due to some of the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> It seems the cord must have had a short, and the device would not stay running long enough to make using it possible.  </li>
            <li> at first it stung a little - not much</li>
            <li> I did get little bumps at first, but I get minimal now.</li>
            <li> I became kind of self conscious after awhile because the ingrown hairs left brown spots after :(</li>
            <li> After that, the pain decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I had read great reviews about the Emjoi epilator, and since it was a little less expensive than replacing my Braun, I ordered one.  </li>
            <li> You can see dark spots where it&#x27;s jammed in and even lines across my leg where the hair is high enough to see but deep enough that I&#x27;d bleed if I tried to pick it out.</li>
            <li> My mother offered to help me get a new one that would take me less time.  </li>
            <li> Bought this epilator to help smooth out my naughty guy parts down there, from the shaft down to the poop chute.</li>
            <li> I used a cold towel to calm my skin after my first use.</li>
            <li> After I was finished, I was amazed to see that the dark roots were completely gone, my underarms were the same color as the rest of my arm!</li>
            <li> As a person who doesn&#x27;t buy much off the internet, I was skeptical at first but after buying and receiving the product I must say that I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The hair on the portions I used it grew back much slower, so eventually I made it up past my knee.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything besides sound like a small lawnmower and break off a few hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> Underarms are the only thing I have to shave every day; once I placed my order a week ago I quit shaving so the hair would be long enough.</li>
            <li> BUT to my surprise the initial shock and pain didn&#x27;t last long, and you can see the roots of the hairs that got pulled.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions because you don&#x27;t use it like a regular shaver with long strokes, but short strokes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 Emjoi epilator models over the last 10 years -- this was the 4th Emjoi purchase for me and since I&#x27;ve previously only had the best experiences with Emjoi epilators, I was shocked at the poor performance of this model.</li>
            <li> And takes several several tries to get coarse hair only gets about 60% of the hairs.</li>
            <li> you are like me and despise shaving everyday, I would highly suggest investing in this product.</li>
            <li> It took me less than 15 minutes to get both arms completely hair-free!</li>
            <li> Waxing is history, and after the first go around the pain in hardly there.</li>
            <li> I just think that now i would like to experience epilating under hot water to dull some of the pain</li>
            <li> It picks up almost all of my leg hair on the first pass (don&#x27;t press too hard).</li>
            <li> i have quite white skin, and it was decidedly marked with little red dots for a while afterwards.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily believe that it would be quicker or less iritating, so I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This epilator was quick at removing hairs and completely painless, but unfortunately it did not remove the hair roots.</li>
            <li> This was the second or third epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so I&#x27;m not new to these.</li>
            <li> My experience with epilators is somewhat limited since this would be only the second one that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is gone in three or four strokes as compared to the several minutes a single headed epilator could take.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of dark underarms or people who are getting any type of irritation from shaving or other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is much you can do about that.</li>
            <li> It did sting, but again waxing is more painful and the creams are more irritating.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it really got any hairs.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t grasp small hairs.</li>
            <li> cause I really cant use my small epilator for my legs.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi Gently Gold at some point in the past.  </li>
            <li> My \\&quot;Long Lasting Results\\&quot; is one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just long enough to rip out.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to stay out of the way on this one.  </li>
            <li> u can use only if u hair is long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting my bath water mixed with hair, and it takes too long to shower if i use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t offer a battery operation, but the cord is plenty long enough, even for a bathroom with illogically placed electrical outlets.</li>
            <li> either maybe both problems of the flat head</li>
            <li> Early on, I was exfoliating too harshly and it left my skin looking red and bumpy.</li>
            <li> the cleaning instructions said, lasted a long time, but eventually the epilator gears were too stressed to properly come together (I can still use the shaving attachment on that ancient thing, so its still of benefit).</li>
            <li> Long passes, short passes.  </li>
            <li> I was epilating so long each time,the battery would run out and I would have to plug it back in.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry - you probably won&#x27;t even see the hair once it&#x27;s long enough.</li>
            <li> In short, it takes way too long to do anything</li>
            <li> Having no stubble was terrific enough to get over my initial dislike and it&#x27;s not intense anymore</li>
            <li> but the hair didn&#x27;t stay away as long as my last epilator.</li>
            <li> Cord is long enough.</li>
            <li> Is it a long term practical solution for a guy in deep rooted areas like the chest or stomach?</li>
            <li> low back, stomach and the center of my chest, my sideburns, chin, and upper lip (</li>
            <li> This is such a long process to go through if you want to get to not shaving anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought at first that you would go against the hair slowly</li>
            <li> If used every five to six weeks there is little new hair to remove from body.  </li>
            <li> Second, no matter  how often you epilate, it&#x27;s very tough to get smooth enough to pass the touch test.</li>
            <li> Pros: it really gets rid of the hair &amp; less &amp; less grows back &amp; what does grow back is lighter &amp; finer.</li>
            <li> , so I wanted something that cut down (out, completely is what I wish for) the Waxing/Threading time.</li>
            <li> Cheeks - Again, this machine is a little big for getting up in to these sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic and have very dark brown hair, I live in Miami, FL</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that people with course hair have 3 or 4 rounds of waxing (and no shaving) before starting with an epilator, as waxing is much less painful and the hair will start to grow back thinner making the initial epilation treatments much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> So it is quite fast, and hurts a bit less than some of the other epilators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It lasted about 7 months before the gears started skipping and chirping, the unit never removed hair as well as other epilators - much slower and less efficient.  </li>
            <li> I was going to use it on my legs to cut down how often I have to shave, but when it pulled the hairs it almost felt like little electrical shocks--tolerable at first, but gradually intensifying until I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> The two chunky plastic pieces on both sides of the tweezer face make the product difficult to manipulate for proper hair removal from knees and other more curvy areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I would go get waxed and the hair was back a day later due to different growth cycle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as quick as shaving, but you spend less time overall in that you have to wait a few weeks to remove your hair, as opposed to a razor where you have to shave every day or every other day.  </li>
            <li> I am also hoping that after a few years of this, I will do permanent damage to the hair follicles and they will cease to grow new hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I got all of my upper thigh leg hair in less than 30 minutes - without a silly little light to eluminate things for me, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> but after a bit it stopped and i was excited to see the bare skin it left behind, it did pinch and gave me goosebumps and a little irritaion and reddish skin.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, the only bad thing about it, is that is kind of too noisy.</li>
            <li> and you could feel it tugging and losing the hairs, particularly painful in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> So far the most painful area...</li>
            <li> So far the most painful area...</li>
            <li> This one is dry only, but i don&#x27;t see that as a problem.    </li>
            <li> I will note that the chances of my using this thing anywhere near my \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot; are less than none.</li>
            <li> Delivered early and paid $40.00 less than advertised elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Takes alot less time than my old one.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a hair removal alternative &amp; have tried many different methods in my life</li>
            <li> Yes, it is somewhat painful but far better than shaving or waxing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> With each epilation, hair roots seem to get less sensitive so it gets easier to use.</li>
            <li> Use them when you exfoliate, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it three times, in less that 2 weeks, and it has not delivered the smoothness it purports.  </li>
            <li> This multi-head epilator does the job of my old one in half the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After cutting myself shaving my chest and back too many times</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt on my legs, but more sensitive parts like arms/under arms are too painful for me.</li>
            <li> When receiving this item the first thing that immediately disappointed me was the lack of a built in light.</li>
            <li> Shaving rarely works for me, as soon as I step out into the cold bathroom air, I&#x27;m ready for another shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a LIFE TIME Shaver/Waxer/Threader of ALMOST EVERY AREA OF MY BODY (moderate Skin sensitivity, mostly to Artificial things, &amp; I&#x27;m used to the \\&quot; sensations \\&quot; of threading, waxing, etc); it started before 13,i started shaving before most girls.</li>
            <li> I would totally sit through the pain once a week if it meant that my legs would be smooth but as it was I was dealing with the pain and the maintenance of shaving angry epliated skin anyway.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON THE BLACK \\&quot;MEN&#x27;S\\&quot; VERSION...</li>
            <li> Not like the old ones that were more painful.  </li>
            <li> I even have noticed less ingrown hairs than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a super hairy dude, I&#x27;m just trying to take preventive action.  </li>
            <li> It completely stopped working in a less than 1 year.</li>
            <li> --I think that would be scary, but given how easily it glided on my arm, I would think that it probably works just about everywhere</li>
            <li> but with the Emagine you can epilate, and then continue to run the thing over your legs weekly/every few days to grab those few hairs that either weren&#x27;t yet long enough when you first epilated or that possibly broke off during the process.</li>
            <li> Braun epilator came with a wide variety of different caps / attachments including one with a razors to shave any left over hair.</li>
            <li> Careful on the face, use the slower speed and angled but upper lip area definitely ouchie.</li>
            <li> As far as breaking hairs... there were a few pieces of stubble left.</li>
            <li> And the first few times you use, you might get the little red bumps/pimples/irritation.</li>
            <li> I had a earlier battery operated single head version that still works</li>
            <li> This is replacing a single head model from the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Back when I shaved my legs, I would have to shave them every, single day (twice a day</li>
            <li> I used it for an hour and resorted back to my single head.</li>
            <li> And what I mean by this is that it doesn&#x27;t break the hair at the folicle, it actually takes the whole thing out.  </li>
            <li> If body hair bothers you enough that you will inflict considerable, repetitive (though short lived) pain upon yourself, then yes, this product does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not hurt like other epilators, but it barely removes any hair.  </li>
            <li> No one wants batteries to die in the middle of tweezing, so having a plugged in device aids in avoiding ingrown hairs that were half pulled when the little tweezers died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the noise always sounds a little scary and intimidating, but it got the job done fairly quick and fast.</li>
            <li> also its bulky and makes it hard to use in certain areas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful at first but after a minute of using it, it&#x27;s super breezy.</li>
            <li> Emjoi AP-18 preferred the Braun SE7681 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator or just the &amp;#34;braun&amp;#34; brand in general.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that using an epilator WILL HURT the first few times, but after a while, you become so accustomed that you no longer feel pain, but rather a slight discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The head is somewhat narrow compared to the other one, but the power behind it is nice.. it rarely bogs down unless you are pressing entirely to hard against the skin.</li>
            <li> In the very sensitive areas, the first time might be difficult.</li>
            <li> While I find that expensive, I figured that once I bought several packs of replacement razors or a few trips to the salon for waxing, this thing pretty much paid for itself and would inevitably save me money.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself to have a decent threshold of pain, and it took some serious teeth-gritting and deep breathing exercises to get through it, especially under the arms.</li>
            <li> Several epilators later, inclusive of Braun and other Emjoi products, I decided to spring for this.  </li>
            <li> I only did one leg that night though,i&#x27;ll work up the courage for the other leg, later.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s no different from a regular 36 tweezer epilator, other than the fact that i can&#x27;t see what i&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up on using it under my armsand went back to shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> Once I heal, I may go back to epilating occasionally, then still shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> But over the past year it was my main go to for leg hair removal.</li>
            <li> The large thick handle is cumbersome and tiring to hold for the time it takes.</li>
            <li> The epilator is a little bit loud when it&#x27;s on, but it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to and it can be a little loud, but once you get the hang of it, just keep going</li>
            <li> As far as armpit discoloration goes, I feel it has helped lighten the area although not significantly.</li>
            <li> Battery run ones are too weak and slow, it requires many passes to get anything done, and the batteries constantly run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being of Indian decent, I&#x27;m a female who unfortunately has battled with every form of hair removal with little success - until I found epilation.</li>
            <li> Hurts a lot less than my previous Emjoi Gently Gold Caress epilator</li>
            <li> it is fast and I can remove hair in about half the time of my previous Epi-lady.  </li>
            <li> My only main complaint is the product description.</li>
            <li> : lack of efficiency, breaks half of the hair instead of pulling it out, no light to help you see what you are doing, harder to clean than other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Sometimes the first few times I got little bumps.</li>
            <li> The trick to using it and making it less painful, is making sure you take a hot bath or shower prior, and pulling the skin as tight as you can in the area your using the epilator.</li>
            <li> got it as a gift for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very noisy, but not really THAT bad, and removes the hair well, giving her a smooth skin feel, easier than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about the pain because in general, many people said it was quite painful.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that the people giving this item a negative review don&#x27;t really understand how epilating works.</li>
            <li> It is painful at first, but once your legs get used to it, it is sooooo worth the reward of not having to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous after reading some of the reviews about how painful this product could be.  </li>
            <li> ( i use to get waxes a while ago but stopped as it was expensive to maintain)&lt;br /&gt;*have a flash light and mirror on hand too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was more afraid reading all the reviews and thinking on use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister tried it thinking she might have better luck and buy it, but it was so painful for her that she could not do more than a square inch; needless to say, she regretted letting her hair grow out all week.    </li>
            <li> Yes it is painful, but lets be honest here.. beauty ALWAYS hurts.</li>
            <li> It lasts at least a couple of weeks before the stubble is really noticible.  </li>
            <li> Bought the Emjoi AP-18 after reading many reviews, chose this one after reading that the battery operated epilators blow thru batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> At least this is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Truth be told, my old unit of another brand did no better in that regard, and didn&#x27;t do as thorough job overall.  </li>
            <li> From Wash/scrubbing, set up for lightening, floor protection, mirrors, etc to running back and forth to the Microwave  to heat/warm the Wax, to Waxing, then Threading, then Calming the Skin and putting the Mirrors and such away and cleaning the Area(s), it (NO JOKE) can take upwards of 10 Hours, average begin about 7/8.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to take a long time to epilate and I wanted every hair gone.  </li>
            <li> , I read the reviews and as such expected some pain/discomfort, from having my hair pulled from the roots.</li>
            <li> I will post an update on how long the results last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I switched to the epilator, I do a some minor spot-checking once a week.  </li>
            <li> (the cord is fairly long.)    </li>
            <li> This beats shaving by a long shot.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Here, I should mention that the hair being pulled should be about a quarter inch long, tops.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my legs because it just takes soooo long</li>
            <li> A couple of times the epilator caught a hunk of skin because it wasn&#x27;t stretched.</li>
            <li> They used to refer to me as \\&quot;Monkey Arms.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to have my hair grow out long in order to wax.</li>
            <li> that really never needs to go over the same area twice.    </li>
            <li> Gets close and removes hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> The third time -- not much at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Epilator user.</li>
            <li> and I expect it will save me tons of money in the long run.</li>
            <li> epilating often, it does not take too long (for me it took about 0.5 hour for both legs plus some &amp;#34;cleanup&amp;#34; with the tweezers).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too long and to start with lower legs.</li>
            <li> After epilating for a long time, hair becomes finer.  </li>
            <li> I had some long hairs that I had neglected with the Philips but the Emjoi</li>
            <li> To prevent ingrown hairs, I exfoliate daily in the shower using some rough gloves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve popped ingrowns that released 3 inch long hairs.</li>
            <li> so that means your hair has do be long before it will grab it.</li>
            <li> The epilator does not have a wide enough surface and doesn&#x27;t work well on underarms.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t exfoliate often enough, your skin is going to be harder to epilate.</li>
            <li> I had one before long time a go.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and she can go a long time in between needing to touch up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, this is a corded epilator, but the cord is long (about 7-8 feet).</li>
            <li> It got harder to remove my armpit hair and does not get short hairs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it a  long time ( for me that means years)  </li>
            <li> Another note, tie up long head hair and clothing when tweezing your under arms because you can pull your long hair into this tweezer and...</li>
            <li> Not much at all and definatly not enough to complain about.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require your stubble to be long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it has been working out so far.  </li>
            <li> But the power cord is so long, it allows me the flexibility to use Emjoi anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> This one takes me between 1/2  to an hour,  depending on how long it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for a long time.</li>
            <li> I did it on my arms with long hair</li>
            <li> JUST IMAGINE HOW 72 TWEEZERS GOING 100 MILES PER HOUR PULLING LONG PEICES OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Will see how long this lasts before growth returns.</li>
            <li> Was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t charge and have to remain plugged in, but the cord is quite long and it has not been a problem.  </li>
            <li> But, because the cord they provide is long, it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, even growing my leg hairs long didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> and i have got to say that this is the least painful and most powerful epilator on the market.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how long the braun would take to do all of that.  </li>
            <li> How long it will be before I have to use it again,</li>
            <li> And does not do the job underarms unless the hair is really long.</li>
            <li> Move slowly in long swoops and hold the device at a 90 degree angle against your skin.</li>
            <li> three weeks later, I finally have a few hairs poking through enough for me to touch up my legs again.</li>
            <li> But I needn&#x27;t have worried, because the inflammation subsided within a few hours, leaving me with baby soft legs.</li>
            <li> Why I waited so long to try an epilator, i do not know.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have to be long at all to use it.</li>
            <li> and why did I wait so long to try this??  </li>
            <li> I was surprised - pleasantly at first, then skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am very sorry that we purchased this unit - it was a 90% waste of money (to be fair) - - -</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t do anything stupid with your skin or think you can run right out in that sexy little skirt.</li>
            <li> how to hold it, etc., but once we got all that down, we found it worked really well for the small areas like upper and lower lip.</li>
            <li> Removed only the very fine facial hair, not any of the annoying longer or thicker individual hairs that pop up.</li>
            <li> Like on my legs I&#x27;ll usually go over them first from down to up in strips as if I was shaving</li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and ordered it, after comparing several products and their corresponding reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this unit enough - if you&#x27;re trying to decide, having a cord really isn&#x27;t such a big deal when you can do your arms, underarms and legs in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> but after doing research online, I found that is common especially on people with thick hair, which I definitely had (I use it on my legs and underarms), one solution I found was using this product right out of the shower so pores are open, and cleaning the areas with witch hazel afterwards and using non-comodogenic lotions after that..</li>
            <li> So a year down the road, it barely held a charge</li>
            <li> You certainly do not have to keep going over the same spots over and over to get it smoothe.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I compared the left and right side of my body, I personally felt the Braun side was smoother.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, and it could remove hair completely, and don&#x27;t feel too painful.</li>
            <li> it is so much more convenient and less expensive than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> That is likely because it is pulling out less hairs now (as hair grows back in in stages).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The same thing happened only in less than six weeks!I want to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator and the battery was starting to die, so I decided to try a Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Definitely prefer my Braun wet and dry that I broke.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco of a similar product for the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Marketing alone must have been in charge of the claims of less pain, because the pain is either the same or close enough to others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last epilator always removed all hairs with less tweezer heads, and although it lasted me over 7 years it finally died.  </li>
            <li> She loves it because she only has to use it only every 2-3 weeks and probably less as she continues to use it.  </li>
            <li> Sure ther are a few broken hairs, but I don&#x27;t have to repeat usage as often as with other epilators.</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi had only 21 tweezers, making it a little bit more of a painful experience every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has two settings, lower is less ouchy in general-</li>
            <li> The other epilators either cut the hair and I had to repeat the process after a couple of days or left my skin feeling bumpy and not soft and just shaved.</li>
            <li> And it almost takes the same time as waxing yourself, but with much lesser mess and clean-up</li>
            <li> Not only did it take half the time of a professional leg waxing, but the discomfort was SO MUCH LESS</li>
            <li> The other irritating thing is once you think you&#x27;re done removing your hair, you go back and find some stragglies that you know you ran the epilator over but can&#x27;t figure out how you manage to miss that certain area thus causing you to have to go over the same spot again.  </li>
            <li> We used the other one until it finally gave out from exhaustion.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use a razor on my legs due to numerous nicks and cuts and I am allergic to wax and liquid hair removers.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand will stay with the Braun and only time will tell which one will reign.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand will stay with the Braun and only time will tell which one will reign.  </li>
            <li> I had only minor skin irritation in the area that was tweezed, and it lasted only briefly, so do it a few hours before your planning on exposing the area.</li>
            <li> I felt this was due to the sheer mass that is on the legs rather than the underarms.</li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Like the headline says, this epilator works well up until the cheapo plastic drive gears on either the epilator head, or the epilator itself wear out due to regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One pass accomplishes what it took several to do with every other epilator I have tried.</li>
            <li> I left loads of little red dots all over my leg from all the hairs being ripped out.</li>
            <li> Other epilators could take me an hour to do my legs, since I would have to go over the same area repeatedly to get all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> This company only has a 30 day money back guarantee which is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to shaving because it has made my hair thicker than that of a mans due to shaving.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Braun Braun epilators - unfortunately the Braun epilators with more tweezers are for use wet/dry and these only can be used without the cord.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this removes hair extremely well, even when going over the area several times.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with any other brand, but I would definitely recommend this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my other one.  </li>
            <li> My only guess for the difference is that this machine has no buffering on the sides where the other Emjoi Divine is curved and provides buffers for pain release (meanwhile still satisfactorily pulling out the hair).  </li>
            <li> but I  only do my legs every other week, if that.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for a while now and needed a 2nd epilator due to travel, etc.</li>
            <li> Other then that, the epilator works, but definitely doesnt work as well as the braun.</li>
            <li> The long cord is helpful for just this reason!</li>
            <li> I have used other epilators with fewer tweezers and have had to go over the same area two or three times in order to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my other brand.</li>
            <li> By the third attempt of trying the epilator, I no longer felt the sharp pain on the areas I have gone over before.</li>
            <li> It functions with the same inefficiency as other brands (I have tried the epilady, the remington and the braun) but</li>
            <li> if you plan to do your bikini area and other body parts with the same epilator).  </li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars due to the initial pain.</li>
            <li> It only works on the US voltage and the device does not have resilience to take in any other voltage.</li>
            <li> So long Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I cam finally tolerate using this all over my body in one setting without wimping out due to pain or time.</li>
            <li> But they lasted a long time - about 15 years!</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is, your hair does need to have a little length, if too short, it will not grab.  </li>
            <li> I stood in my bathroom (the cord is long!) and leaned on the counter, sat on the edge of the counter, or proped a leg up on the counter to get to all the spots.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and this thing doesn&#x27;t quit!</li>
            <li> The other trick is to have your skin as dry as possible, so I apply baby powder as it also lifts the hair and makes it easier.  </li>
            <li> Also, as other posters have mentioned, it takes about half the time than with my previous epilator--and really doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to remove the hair and it misses a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s corded (a very very long cord), and has a plastic cover that I can never seem to keep track</li>
            <li> Electric (as opposed to battery) with a very long cord.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs in the tweezers unless they are very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not battery operated, it only works on dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> Not a single \\&quot;black dot\\&quot; can be seen.</li>
            <li> The most painful spots were the very center of my stomach up to my chest bone and my low back.</li>
            <li> Underarms, upper legs and bikini will be more painful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-After applying witch hazel to both legs and allowing it to dry, I applied my cocoa</li>
            <li> Dry brushing your skin with a mitt also helps.</li>
            <li> I have spent over $1000 on electrolysis &amp; that only partially worked.</li>
            <li> Also, several reviewers complained about the battery completely dying within 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> It only cut them so they were back within a few days.</li>
            <li> over the next few days i epilated the region again as hair grows at different rates.</li>
            <li> I am doing small sections at a time, knowing that the first round is the one to get through.</li>
            <li> I do need to go over the same area a few times to remove all my leg hairs - some just seem to grow out in different directions.</li>
            <li> dont, dont, dont, use this on sensitive areas such as the face or armpit or even the bikini line.....at least for me.</li>
            <li> After several years of epilating, I could miss even a whole week (camping) and the stubble was sparse and thin and softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I am left with shaving which I need to do everyday and sometimes if I shave in the morning I need to redo it if I&#x27;m going out at night, It is such a hassle.</li>
            <li> my advise would be to exfoliate very well and watch how the machine is slicing your hair every use if ...if you notice it starting to cut poorly just stop and return if you&#x27;re still within the 30 days ...</li>
            <li> A few days later when the hair follicles grow back, skin is bumpy with in growth.</li>
            <li> A few days later I got up my nerve, after looking on youtube to find out how to use it properly, and decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> However, within the last few days the hair on my legs has started to come back with a vengeance.  </li>
            <li> However, within the last few days the hair on my legs has started to come back with a vengeance.  </li>
            <li> It is loud, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I am very hairy with thick black hair especially on my legs.   </li>
            <li> The hair is soft and grows back extremely slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to epilation.</li>
            <li> but I only gave it a three star rating because I&#x27;m now on my third one it seems as if after one year the previous two just stop working!</li>
            <li> At first it was tough getting used to the stings pulling out the hair.  </li>
            <li> I know it can be a tough time around at first.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a pretty tough guy.  </li>
            <li> Because the devise is curved, I had to press very hard on the parts of my legs with athletic curves, particularly the back part of my thighs.</li>
            <li> But I wished that it pulled every single hair from the root so that i wouldnt have to \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Epilating is like shaving, you&#x27;re not going to get every single hair with just one sweep of the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over an area 20 times just to get a single hair.</li>
            <li> I do not feel it would survive being dropped a single time.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference in the results between this and the single row of tweezers models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using epilators for awhile now, I know epilators do not remove every single hair.</li>
            <li> I have found it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair but about 90% and takes about 0 mins a leg.</li>
            <li> I have neither the time nor inclination to ensure every single hair has been plucked.  </li>
            <li> Besides, I have never had an epilator that gets every single hair.    </li>
            <li> I had a single row of tweezers and took forever...</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, the braun clears every single hair, whereas the emjoi, clears ALMOST every hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful not the pinch your sleeve in the tweezer as it will ruin the mechanism of this little machine and will never work the same- personal experience.</li>
            <li> Much less discomfort and long lasting results.</li>
            <li> Left with a few red pinpricks/Irritation bumps, probably less the waxing though!!!&lt;br /&gt;Face , Cheeks/ Upper Lip/ Beside the Ears/ Chin/</li>
            <li> Even then, I could still see some dark stubble on my inner thighs and under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I have rather coarse dark leg hair which is why I started epilating instead of shaving.</li>
            <li> As a newbie with sensitive skin and coarse hair, I find epilating painful, but the results worth it.</li>
            <li> But I was surprised that this was no more than a 2 on a scale of 1-10 pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> This barely hurts at all now that Ive used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I spent way too long.  </li>
            <li> but hey i was able to reach till the bikini line which otherwise was very difficult...</li>
            <li> And I know it&#x27;s pulling skin, because its on the hair in the little catch bin (which is difficult to clean, because it doesn&#x27;t pull apart for cleaning), and because i&#x27;m bleeding from the spots where the hair follicles were!</li>
            <li> I have to make several passes and by that time by skin is red raw.</li>
            <li> like the idea of an electrical cord as opposed to batteries because as you know batteries loose their strength over time.  </li>
            <li> When the tweezer heads in the Braun epilator that I&#x27;ve had for three years got too dull, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to buy a new one because I think the tweezer blades are dull and so</li>
            <li> so so bad, seriously i was screaming as i started the machine lol)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic wet dry one before this, and decided to go for a dry one this time that did the job quicker.</li>
            <li> The hair returns less frequently and less noticeably.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this Emagine.</li>
            <li> I like to be hairless from the neck down, and I have some very coarse hair in places, but this thing plucks even the thickest hairs almost painlessly.</li>
            <li> Quick and efficient, cuts down the time spent epilating by at least half.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessarily faster, but I&#x27;d say it has cut down on ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> the function that presses down on the area does help ease the pain as the alternate side pulls out the hair...</li>
            <li> but here is a brief run down of my experience.</li>
            <li> I can only assume they mean the tweezer heads are electrically doped with silver, for the same reason they (sarcasm) use silver in medical facilities.</li>
            <li> I have not worn pants or long skirts since!!  </li>
            <li> prior to the procedure if you&#x27;re unable to tolerate any amount of pain&lt;br /&gt;-Easiest to do after a hot shower on dry skin (do not use on oily/lotion-covered</li>
            <li> It still required me to use the higher setting and go slowly with little circular motions.  </li>
            <li> There are some pretty tiny puny fine/thin hairs on your leg that this cannot grasp, so those small ones will be left behind.</li>
            <li> I have had three of these over the last three years and my current one, about 8 months old, is starting to fail - gears stripped again.</li>
            <li> I would have been happier with the red version, but only slightly because the edges on the head slope up on the men&#x27;s version and down on the ladies.</li>
            <li> To ensure they firmly hold the hair to extract it, they have to slam together pretty hard.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have to Wax (EVERYWHERE from the Chin down, except a small portion of my upper back, and i don&#x27;t do upper arms, also I THREAD my Face), then THREAD my Face (Cheeks, eyebrows, chin, &amp;  </li>
            <li> It is pretty quick and much less painful than I am used to, having had other epilators before this one...</li>
            <li> i have just received my new epilator and used it for the first time, and i can definitely say that it is really not that bad at all.</li>
            <li> I washed the area before with hot water and exfoliating scrub just to minimize as much pain as possible.....and it still hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> Waxing was out of the question, it was not the first time I got burn but this time healing was much longer and painful than before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would NEVER recommend this to someone as a long term solution, but given deeper rooted and coarser hair, the removal is more painful for me.</li>
            <li> The second time was less.</li>
            <li> Anyway -- my advice is if you&#x27;re looking for an epilator for the bottom half of the body and perhaps underarms too - i use it there all the time, it hurts yes, but it is tolerable and you can just push through it if you&#x27;re determined enough to not have hair for a month after</li>
            <li> I previously had a smaller braun that was rechargeable and will rebuy that one anyday.</li>
            <li> Can i use it wet and dry?</li>
            <li> I actually looked forward to epilating, I usually epilate once a week to get the entire cycle.</li>
            <li> I purchased my wife the Emjoi Emagine because her previous Emjoi finally gave up the ghost after 10 years.</li>
            <li> The first time is the worst and it does get better.</li>
            <li> It definitely made my legs less stubby, but still didn&#x27;t get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> hair, the less it grows back</li>
            <li> It also drew some red blood dots and actually drew small specks of blood.</li>
            <li> On top of that I am disappointed it left some hair stubble and broke some of the hairs off instead of pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am alone on this, but the attachments seemed pretty pointless</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if there is less hair after several weeks.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d still have to shave at the same interval, there&#x27;d just be less hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d still have to shave at the same interval, there&#x27;d just be less hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> plus I had the extra expense of the other attachment with the other one.</li>
            <li> (BTW, the Braun system is currently double the price that I paid for it back in 2007 - not sure why that is).</li>
            <li> , it does pull your hair out, but not particularly well IMO.</li>
            <li> I got equal results from a Remington Electric Shaver which was 3/4ths less</li>
            <li> And if you have in-grown problem, like I do, this definitely doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I watched a video on you tube advertising this product and was also warned that it might be uncomfortable after the first several uses.  </li>
            <li> I wish i hadn&#x27;t thrown out my previous one and gotten the same model instead.</li>
            <li> Now I stick to low, think there&#x27;s less hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I have 4 tattoos, and actually the pain in those were less than this</li>
            <li> Typically I had to shave my legs daily...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it works well for the lower half of my shin and calf area, above this it does not perform as it should.</li>
            <li> I  GAVE AWAY MY PREVIOUS EPILATOR (BASIC PHILLIPS)</li>
            <li> and if you use it regularly, the regrowth is thinner and less.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally need to touch up around my knees mid-week but usually the one a week treatment is enough.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid (less than $70 with taxes and shipping), this machine in one use has almost paid for itself compared to my regular waxing appointments.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these (3 red 1 black).</li>
            <li> but just tried it for the first time and as other users stated, it is SLOW and INEFFICIENT!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is serious about epilating.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my legs weren&#x27;t that bad, it didn&#x27;t take long, but I still didn&#x27;t feel it was working miraculously fast, and when I had removed as much hair</li>
            <li> I read about a lot of other elipilators and how long it took to use them and the varying results.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on waxing, this has paid for inself in 1 use, it is painful when you use it at first</li>
            <li> Same with wax but without the mess.</li>
            <li> Have not had it very long and the hair has come back as soon as a few days.  </li>
            <li> As a mechanical engineer, I believe the gears used in this product are not strong enough to transmit the power for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> which is much less messy than soft wax, so</li>
            <li> It is faster, overall less painful, and more efficient with a corded operation.</li>
            <li> As far as being painful it was the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> But I could not bare my legs because of the dark rough stubble.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of positive reviews for this device, which really surprises me since this was absolutely the worst epilator model I ever used.</li>
            <li> It was almost as simple as shaving, just a little longer.</li>
            <li> Ecstatic because the little machine achieved similar results as waxing in a short amount of time with little set-up/ cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I only felt this a little bit</li>
            <li> I also have been having major ingrown hairs that were never a problem for me in the past.</li>
            <li> My legs have never been this smoothe, I use the emjoi once a week to catch any little hairs it may have missed the last go around.</li>
            <li> It does not pick up the little short hairs as it is described.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice and personal preference on how you progress around your body.</li>
            <li> A little Neosporin to avoid any inflamation (translated: infection) and it was no big thing.  </li>
            <li> Just a little &amp;#34;bulky&amp;#34; to use because a little larger than my last one.  </li>
            <li> When starts growing back my legs are a little prickly like when i shave</li>
            <li> It works until the crease where your underpants would sit and then you&#x27;ll need to tweeze manually the last little bit.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t regret this purchase, because even though I have to do a little extra tweezing, I am no longer getting the itchy stubble</li>
            <li> Only criticism is that it still leaves me with my legs feeling a little stubble...</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier and bigger than I had thought it would be so slipping it in a carry on takes up quite a bit of room.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want those tiny little hairs slipping out, now do you?</li>
            <li> The hair that does return is so soft you hardly know it there.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever got an ingrown hair when shaving, so this really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse black body hairs with really pale ghost white skin which is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> I figured there had to be another way to loose unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because it is hard to reach some areas, but that is obvious given the size.</li>
            <li> I couldnt find the same model I have, so decided to try this one, thinking that the dual heads would make it easier to epilate hard to reach areas where the hair follicles grow in different directions.</li>
            <li> It gets more hair than the Braun ever did and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad when most of the hair has been removed from the area.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t pull out so many hairs at once, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.  </li>
            <li> then this bad boy is going to be a beast :-)</li>
            <li> decided against getting a rechargeable one as the ones I looked at would not let you use them while plugged in and there were many reviews saying the battery started going bad and not holding a charge after a year or so.</li>
            <li> This thing took them in one painful yet satisfying fell swoop.</li>
            <li> so the closer it was to my ankles the more painful it was.   </li>
            <li> As a side note, I did use it on my underarms and that was more painful</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out that was why epilating became more painful over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even with the pain i was glad of getting rid of all that ugly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did try an epilator many years ago before I had ever waxed, and it was too painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful, but not terribly so.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a bit painful, but tolerable, in the beginning</li>
            <li> IT IS MORE PAINFUL THAN WAXING.</li>
            <li> Virgin hair is always harder and more painful to remove</li>
            <li> make a crazy sound</li>
            <li> At least with epilators, the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; problem disappeared and regrowth was soft.  </li>
            <li> and it keep hair away for a long time, longer than waxing usually does for me because it gets the tiny hairs too.   </li>
            <li> The first few times it is a bit painful, but keeping the skin stretched really helps.</li>
            <li> This is a small drawback i guess, to epilators in general, not just this one.</li>
            <li> Admittedly i should probably answer this question after at least a couple of months usage, but so far, i&#x27;d say yes, and based on the majority of the reviews i&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> I have an old Emjoi (white)I purchased at Sharper Image at least 10 yrs ago for about 50 bucks.</li>
            <li> As usual, some people complain -in general-</li>
            <li> the crazy amount of 72 tweezerheads makes the grueling pain of exorcising the hair demons from all my public and private parts go by much faster.</li>
            <li> It gives some pain and moreover she had to go at least 3-4 times to each place to completely get rid of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers had said that the corded ones make it difficult to use the epilator while watching TV, but this cord is pretty long.</li>
            <li> this is by far the most efficient, least painful...</li>
            <li> However, I only need to shave every few days.</li>
            <li> I am a hair removal maniac and I have spent a lot of time and money waxing, shaving, and tweezing.</li>
            <li> was minimal</li>
            <li> It did not sting on every pass-or on every hair-so it was a  minus one on a scale of one to ten-ten being intolerable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really bothered by shaving.</li>
            <li> I found that this took longer then expected</li>
            <li> Money well spent on this product.</li>
            <li> The gears were slipping.</li>
            <li> No broken hairs or any left behind after moving over area a few times.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Noiseier than expected and not cordless.  </li>
            <li> This hurts A LOT, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> does not come with a shaver/trimmer head, for the cost I would have expected that too.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Expected with an epilator.</li>
            <li> Yes, this removes hairs sporadically, but leaves wide gaps to go over again.  </li>
            <li> I spent two days researching the Emagine and at the time of my purchase (August 2010)</li>
            <li> It works just as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Allegedly you get used to the pain</li>
            <li> this product is so inefficent at that, while the Braun could pull out partial ingrowns in just one pass.</li>
            <li> Hair grows at different speeds so wait a few days and go over the hair again.  </li>
            <li> That should tell you your hair will grow back within a few days.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really rough hair.  </li>
            <li> made my decision to go with the Emjoi based on a few simple reasons</li>
            <li> Waxing is not perfect but it wins for now...</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give you an option to use it as a cordless device and its a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I think there are a few reasons why I didn&#x27;t instantly get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave because the hair starts growing back in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> The head keeps getting jammed and it cuts the hair instead of pulling it off the roots.</li>
            <li> but it covered a wide</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done efficiently, and hair take a few weeks before it begins to grow back.  </li>
            <li> so I guess this it to be expected.</li>
            <li> I am using it for my legs, underarms and bikini area with minimal discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I could only get one arm or leg on one charge, so I&#x27;d have to either wait between areas for a charge, or spread out my epilating over a few days to get it all done.  </li>
            <li> This was such a waste of money I can&#x27;t believe after reading reviews for hours I got stuck with it because I threw away the packaging!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a Braun Silk-epil for a few years and recently decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works well with minimal discomfort.  </li>
            <li> No thanks around my privates.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly useful for underarms and it would take too long to do the legs.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, a machine that rips your hair out of the follicle is going to hurt, but you get used to it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This only lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> It died a few weeks back</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t notice rough nubs.</li>
            <li> So be careful what you wish for.</li>
            <li> With time, I had gotten used to it anyway and the pain, to me, was minimal and now, with the AP-18, it is practically non existent.  </li>
            <li> when I am rough with it</li>
            <li> get all but the last few pieces of hair on my underarms which still leave some hair noticable.</li>
            <li> am now going to try a different brand because these should not be burning out after a few months.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I immediately went to the bathroom, took a shower to open my pores as recommended, and thoroughly dried.  </li>
            <li> Carefully I jabbed it at my leg, the pain was noticeable, but bearable.</li>
            <li> if you are still curious to try this</li>
            <li> I also use it carefully on my chin and lower face, even though they say not to.</li>
            <li> but I found it harder on the skin than the one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never really looked into it until I started getting some tattoos.</li>
            <li> I am careful to exfoliate and I took the advice about also buying a Mr Tweezerman to remove the hairs that get stuck.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions: exfoliated, dried, made my chin and upper lip taut.</li>
            <li> only downside is that I&#x27;ve noticed that the epilator misses a few hairs on my legs sometimes.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area a few times just to get the hair</li>
            <li> I have spent the majority of my hair removal days shaving, but have waxed on occasion too.  </li>
            <li> It did not hurt quite as much as I expected it to hurt.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading comments and researching epilators, before buying the Emjoi - a brand I hadn&#x27;t used before.</li>
            <li> No bleeding, but bruising and trouble wearing deo-dorant for hte next couple of days.</li>
            <li> I think it feels rough and don&#x27;t like it for bikini area.</li>
            <li> It works, but it takes quite a few swipes over the same spot to make it catch</li>
            <li> After careful consideration I opted to purchase the Emjoi AP-18.  </li>
            <li> Works just as I expected.</li>
            <li> As with any epilator, you need to be careful about ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t it does get jammed, but that is user error, not a manufacturing problem.</li>
            <li> So it is harder to use in the underarm and behind-the-knee areas.</li>
            <li> So it is harder to use in the underarm and behind-the-knee areas.</li>
            <li> If you are use to waxing, there is minimal pain involved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed, exfoliated, and dried my legs thoroughly prior to using the Emjoi Emagine.</li>
            <li> Even with that a few stubborn ones still remain- no big deal.</li>
            <li> I found myself going over the same spots a few times.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You just ripped hair out of your body for pity sake; don&#x27;t kid yourself here</li>
            <li> was minimal.  </li>
            <li> It does not do the work promised in the propaganda.</li>
            <li> Another annoying issue related to time is that because you&#x27;re spending so much time going over the same places/taking so long in general, the epilator starts to heat up and burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used similar models of epilators, and this by far was the worse.</li>
            <li> but it was a good feeling to me knowing that I was getting rid those awful whiskers and the result would last longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> No it does not always completely remove hair in one swipe but that just depends on type of hair and how course or thick it is.  </li>
            <li> This product got all the thick hairs near my bikini line and arm pits.</li>
            <li> I can use it in sensitive areas as long as the skin is tight with no more irritation than any other epilator.     </li>
            <li> I am worried about how long it will take to epilate, since I will be going down in number of tweezers, but I just can&#x27;t risk another chance on the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I can do both legs, lower and upper, in less than 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> This is directly due to the tiny gear beginning to strip which transfers motion from the motor body of the little machine to the tweezer head rollers.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I did it, and it really was nothing as bad as the old epilady, but that could have been due to the fact that I had been waxing all those years.  </li>
            <li> While epilating the bikini area can be particularly painful in general, this epilator reduces the pain because of how quickly it removes the hairs.</li>
            <li> It is not a pleasant experience the first few times</li>
            <li> The angle is difficult to get right.</li>
            <li> Either way, the shape of the head on this epilator is really bad for getting at any part of your body other than your legs (and its really challenging to get your knees with it).</li>
            <li> Come back to that area later and work very small areas overlapping as you progress into the unremoved hair.</li>
            <li> I use the Emjoi PX EJ Epilation cream immediately after which does help with irritation caused by epilating and use it every other day for a few times, then just use a regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> They say if you keep using the epilator the hairs grow back softer, lighter, and slower and it hurts less and less</li>
            <li> so only about once every three weeks, as over the years there is less and less hair.</li>
            <li> Because the hairs grow in at different rates, it hurts less and less.  </li>
            <li> The one possible negative I do want to point out is that I have dark, coarse hair with the exception of my outer thighs, where the hair is lighter &amp; finer.</li>
            <li> noise was a surprise-but not much noisier than any other electric razor I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works as well as I expected from other reviews I have seen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, I&#x27;m pondering what to do with my hairy legs, I&#x27;m on Amazon shopping for the same epilator thinking that I could not press firmly this time, or I could try another epilator, or resume waxing (dread), or just shave again (lazy short term solution)</li>
            <li> In the past I had my daughter use electric clippers on my back and the hair would grow back in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> As someone else said, they make a men&#x27;s model but there really is no difference other</li>
            <li> It took so long to do only one leg because it&#x27;s so hard to deal with the all the pain.</li>
            <li> The points of the little plastic gears wear down, so they no longer make the needed connection in the related area.  </li>
            <li> after 40 minutes of torture and still no progress, i bit down hard on a towel and used the old one.</li>
            <li> I have a theory that the next time will not hurt near as bad since the new hair growing in will be finer</li>
            <li> Well that was rather a waste as it really didn&#x27;t do anything that burn the surface hair and not a good job at that.</li>
            <li> product just works but not effectively, it pulls the hairs &#x27;half way&#x27; not fully,making hairs to grow again in a few days, its like a shaver really.</li>
            <li> This epilator gets the job done in such little time!  </li>
            <li> and you should go several times over the little ones to catch them!</li>
            <li> Minus is my previous unit had a larger gear system which made me suspect the small, single gear on this Emjoi unit maynot hold up.</li>
            <li> I can see little black dots where the hair is trying to grow back.  </li>
            <li> I can see little black dots where the hair is trying to grow back.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to do as it is hard to stretch the skin but can easily be achieved.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on the lower half of my leg which had 4 days of hair growth and even after going over the same little strip multiple times very little hair was pulled.</li>
            <li> So, the epilator I&#x27;ve been using finally just got to be useless and I decided to treat myself to a new one.</li>
            <li> This new opposite rotating design is flawed.  </li>
            <li> i have a very low pain tolerance, so i was quite sceptical, but willing to give it a go given that i&#x27;d read in a number of places that epilators are now nowhere near as painful as they used to be, and i had read many reviews stating that this one was around the least painful there was.    </li>
            <li> Being sick of waiting forever for full hair growth to was, and not a big fan of shaving, I was considering laser hair removal and then a friend suggested I try epilators.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for decades and have very little growth left.</li>
            <li> It hurt like the dickens, left scabs everywhere and pulled very little out.  </li>
            <li> Please note that this product is NOT as thorough as waxing; it cannot get all of those frustrating little hairs that your professional will go back and touch up or tweeze - you know...</li>
            <li> And, it is much less painful than the Braun, huge plus!    </li>
            <li> I think waxing is less painful and more efficient, but it comes with a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Despite having more tweezers, the way this epilator keeps the skin taught, means it&#x27;s less painful than the others I have used.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably, there is SLIGHT pain, but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Whereas with my other one, I can get away with 1.5x a wk or even 2 weeks wo epilating.  </li>
            <li> i cant compare it to other models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the noise or pain (although it&#x27;s not exactly a plus)</li>
            <li> Until the parts issue is worked out, any other assessment is moot, because lacking the part, this device becomes a disposable item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of epilators, shaved and used hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> , so that&#x27;s a no go and the other Epilators I tried, if you got close to tender skin they would take a bite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Emjoi Gold Caress for the past 5 years and finally had the courage to upgrade to Emagine.</li>
            <li> I have tried other epilators.</li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to epilate anywhere other than your bathroom, or room, or</li>
            <li> So, this leaves me with two options: 1) buy another Emjoi AP-18, or 2) some other epilator brand.</li>
            <li> AP-18 because I don&#x27;t want to be stuck with hair on my legs, face, under arms, or bikini area due to a dead/empty battery.</li>
            <li> unless I don&#x27;t have any other means to take off hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have a lot of under arm hair, and using this Emjoi did leave some small red spots when the hair was pulled out.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissapointed with this epilator.</li>
            <li> Ithink that the speed of the model also seems to reduce the pulling sensation that you get with some other epilators.</li>
            <li> I have never tried waxing before or any other epilators</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair removal methods (80&#x27;s epilator, electrolysis gel pads,</li>
            <li> Amazon tells me they will take it back, thank goodness, since it is NOT cheap!</li>
            <li> I feel like I got ALL except for the extremely smallest of hairs this time.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Be careful about this!</li>
            <li> I have vericose veins and don&#x27;t want to risk shaving due to the danger of nicking myself.</li>
            <li> At first you may feel an uncomfortable sensation, but after that it is painless.</li>
            <li> but I ended up using twice a week instead of twice a month like I&#x27;m used to with other epilators.</li>
            <li> As a reference, I shave every other day and don&#x27;t wear anything that will expose my legs on the off day because my hair is already noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I actually got any hair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that part of my problem is due to impatience with the time it takes to do the legs.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed I went searching some more.</li>
            <li> and/or doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the hairs as well as other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It does somewhat but not as well as other models</li>
            <li> Hirsutism: medical condition involving excessive hair growth on women.</li>
            <li> I have to use my epilator every week instead of every other week now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen what other reviews have said, and yeah it hurts.</li>
            <li> but I read other reviews that recommended it</li>
            <li> The extra tweezing heads, and their small size, seems to make the difference.</li>
            <li> It tok almost 3 months to get the replacement part due to availability.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well on picking up the shorter hairs either as my other ones...</li>
            <li> and then get the other when you have another moment.</li>
            <li> This is my FOURTH epilator in the past month.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get close enough to do the fronts of my legs because there is a small bar that goes between the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> and they were not willing to help.</li>
            <li> One set is in the head piece and the other in the body of the epilator.  </li>
            <li> Broke hair off in other spots....</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I like stepping out of my comfort zone every once in a while, which is why I gave this a try</li>
            <li> I hope to never have to use any other hair removal again.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;m not a first time epilator, but I felt no plnching at all.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely hairy man who uses this item over every part of my body excluding my head and face.</li>
            <li> of the other epilators are cuter</li>
            <li> I have had Braun, Philips and Some Other Brands</li>
            <li> I usually have stubble the NEXT day after shaving.</li>
            <li> Is it any noisier then other models?</li>
            <li> It was pretty useless.</li>
            <li> faster than any other brand i bought before.</li>
            <li> I only receive a small amount of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> and I was going to see it through to the bitter end!  </li>
            <li> I looked on amazon and due to the reviews decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li> &quot; something or other, which is just bull.</li>
            <li> So in other words, \\&quot;No, it&#x27;s not something that is mounted to a wall!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get tiny stuff, so small hair will stay till it grows out, then you can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let that settle on one leg while I epilated the other</li>
            <li> in other words a have two 36 tweezer machine and NOT a 72 one.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> That being said, I can&#x27;t compare this to any of it&#x27;s competitors or even to other Emjoi models.</li>
            <li> Additional tweezers make this work faster than other epilators with fewer heads.</li>
            <li> but as all the other products it causes ingrown hair</li>
            <li> The dual heads are extremely efficient and my skin isn&#x27;t piched or pulled.</li>
            <li> Its a mediocre product for a pretty penny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have pain when removing hair and found the same with the emagine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not consistent in terms of grabbing hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;PAINFUL looking leg hair plucker&amp;#34; for my wife because the other ones motor just overheated and stopped working.</li>
            <li> The other one lasted 3 years.</li>
            <li> I had to go to my dermatolgist due to ingrown hairs that got severely infected.</li>
            <li> The heads rotate away from each other and get every hair regardless of direction of growth.</li>
            <li> My hairs are so course that they are almost sharp when shaved.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several in the past.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve read other reviews that have said it doesn&#x27;t hurt - well....</li>
            <li> It got to where I could not shave every day due to razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> But maybe it has worked for other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gears lose contact and the tweezer head could not rotate properly so although the small gear connected to the motor, rotates but it can not drive the teweezer heads.</li>
            <li> Wasted money unless your a blonde hair,blue eyes gal that doesn&#x27;t have to deal with thick, Italian, black/brown hair.</li>
            <li> (Every other day I use a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs but have not had any.)</li>
            <li> I had used other brands for years, this one is faster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years as razors leave my legs a &amp;#34;bloody mess&amp;#34; due to skin issues.</li>
            <li> but nothing compared to the other epilators.  </li>
            <li> As all other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I have used other hair removal systems, including epilators....</li>
            <li> A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no louder than any other electric shaver on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ve got to be careful!</li>
            <li> For my face, I just used my usual facial moisturizer after epilating.</li>
            <li> My underarms were the most painful, but I held that skin tight and powered through it.</li>
            <li> It does not clean up every single hair like waxing though.</li>
            <li> Not fun, but certainly not agonizing.</li>
            <li> A little more painful on the underarms and bikini line, but</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product, I expected it to be way better than the previous epilators that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> but since it takes half the time, at least it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> after a few times it really does not hurt that bad but be prepared the first few times yikes  </li>
            <li> The pain gets very minimal.  </li>
            <li> does the job i guess, but very rough on the skin..</li>
            <li> I use a long handled stiff brush to exfoliate before...</li>
            <li> But even after you&#x27;ve got the worst, you can go right over it again and get more, and it wont hurt as bad even in the first 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> But even after you&#x27;ve got the worst, you can go right over it again and get more, and it wont hurt as bad even in the first 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pas the return date (my bad) and really wished I hadn&#x27;t thrown away my old Emjoi Gold with enthusiasm when I opened this beast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment and waste of money.</li>
            <li> Using this device is easy and hardly painful.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how it really was painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product, I could not see any hair left, but I could feel the stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> (even my 8yr old asks me what&#x27;s wrong with my legs and why they are all red etc).</li>
            <li> Went over and over the same spot and still left hair behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even considered going back to waxing while using it since it does such a poor job at picking up hairs.  </li>
            <li> Only went back to using this because I have grown tired of the delayed IPL (Silknsense</li>
            <li> It was such a disappointment, The lowest speed is still to fast, and seem to miss ALOT of hair.</li>
            <li> She said it was painful at first, but now since her hair is thinner she barely feels a tug.</li>
            <li> so shaving only makes things worse, have stubble &amp; grow back faster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic wet/dry E5 WD51, I wanted to try it in the shower, which I did a few times, then I just found it easier to shave them dry again.</li>
            <li> After reading different postings, I decided to switch to this Emjoi -- it seemed to be faster, and less &amp;#34;sophisticated.&amp;#34; My previous epilators all had special attachments, but I could never use them, the process was too painful on other parts of my body than my legs, so I preferred waxing.</li>
            <li> so maybe it was breaking a few of those long hairs before it could get down to tweeze them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on average every other day since my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap, broke after about 3 months (gears dont turn right).</li>
            <li> I use the Emjoi on my arms and legs about once a week (even less during cooler months) and am disappointed that this epilator--which cost more when I purchased it--has lost its functionality after about 100-200 uses.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this was very disappointing for me considering I have purchased many things on Amazon</li>
            <li> For my both legs and arms, it takes more than an hour which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful but nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> I use it on underarms and it works very well on upper lip and around faint &#x27;sideburns&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> It also seems to be less irritating than my previous devices.&lt;br /&gt;Great device, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I placed an order on 6/12/11 for a new head to replace the broken one that lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of pain, but not much</li>
            <li> I have to work a little harder to get those, which increases my usage time.</li>
            <li> but ive seen how others have commented and complained for so long about how the epilator&#x27;s gears mess up for after so long or</li>
            <li> Used this on legs that had very thick unshaved 2 month old hair and was done in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an old Braun silk epil for years, and I mean years!  </li>
            <li> So, less ingrown hairs and no stubble in other words.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little but not more than waxing, the pain goes of instantly.</li>
            <li> I use my Braun epilator to get the smaller, hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> If the hairs are very short, it has a hard time grabbing them, so you will have to let the hair grow out a bit before it will grab.</li>
            <li> hardly any hair grows back after a week.  </li>
            <li> The only area it does not work well on is my face, but I use hard wax there anyway</li>
            <li> I have tried it on thighs too but too hard to do the back of my thighs or bikini.</li>
            <li> they hardly come out and not as coarse.</li>
            <li> I have spent my way through at least four other epilators over the years - all with single heads.  </li>
            <li> I do like the braun features of the light and that it is cordless; however, the power that the cord adds to the emjoi makes being tethered to the wall not so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s not 100% pain free, but it&#x27;s not as bad as people are making it out to be.</li>
            <li> When I did research prior to purchasing this, I did see a handful of reviewers who noted a similar [bad] experience like mine, but I figured I wouldn&#x27;t end up being one of those, but naturally I did.  </li>
            <li> When I did research prior to purchasing this, I did see a handful of reviewers who noted a similar [bad] experience like mine, but I figured I wouldn&#x27;t end up being one of those, but naturally I did.  </li>
            <li> It sucks that you can&#x27;t get your money back also.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I finally decided I HAD to at least try it..</li>
            <li> I have an average pain tolerance and even underarm hair removal</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t figure that out until I had used the thing for a whole week.</li>
            <li> Not worth $81.00.</li>
            <li> I really think that it just feels like a weird, prickly sensation.</li>
            <li> It said the small red dots will go away in a few hours</li>
            <li> I reviewed at least 20 different kinds of epilators before making this purchase.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to epilating, any epilator will be painful for the first several uses.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had dark under arms.</li>
            <li> and it has helped with the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have dark corse hair</li>
            <li> i would give this a 3.5, just because i thought it was not worth paying $80.</li>
            <li> My back hurt worse than ever because it took so long to get those ingrown hairs out.      </li>
            <li> The results are NOT worth the pain.</li>
            <li> All in all -- not worth it.</li>
            <li> Dont&#x27; get me wrong, even with the Emjoi, the first few days were like torture, but tolerable      </li>
            <li> It is useless on my blond leg hair which is much finer.</li>
            <li> I was really obsessed when I got it so much</li>
            <li> (at least for men, with coarse hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (at least for men, with coarse hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I would often get ingrown hairs and dark marks on my legs .</li>
            <li> I only turned it on for a few seconds but it was a few seconds of torture!</li>
            <li> Not fun or sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did and does not hurt at all, it merely feels like someone gently tugging at my skin.</li>
            <li> Usually, if I don&#x27;t have money to go get a wax I have to jeans or long skirts until I can go, but now I have this machine at my house whenever I need to tend to my body hair.</li>
            <li> Someone needs to invent a way to get rid of body hair permanently--this is no fun...</li>
            <li> really thought I was doing something wrong after all these glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not worth for the price I paid for this item.</li>
            <li> For the hairs that it did &amp;#34;get&amp;#34;, after looking closer with a small flashlight, it could see that the hair I thought was gone was just dangerously low and had to put my Tweezerman to heavy duty work.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see the Optima was phased out and didn&#x27;t do much research before purchasing this Emagine.  </li>
            <li> I was expected the one pass as promised, that did not happened, in fact I needed a few passes in some areas to achieve the desired results.</li>
            <li> and there was minimal hair (I could see where I missed a few spots or</li>
            <li> The hair does not come out as thick the next day like with the razors.</li>
            <li> Cons: It takes longer to shave than a regular razor, so you have to go fairly slowly.</li>
            <li> I had the big, thick hairs on my legs, too.</li>
            <li> Worked way worse than my overused year old epilator.</li>
            <li> I am a male with dark, thick hair and I purchased this to use on my chest and abs.</li>
            <li> would never ever buy this or let my family go near this after an extremely frustrating use of this machine.</li>
            <li> I still feel a few prickly hairs, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as much or as thick as it does when you shave.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is BY FAR the quickest, easiest, way out of all hair removal I&#x27;ve had for my secret garden.</li>
            <li> You have to go slowly, I had to keep telling myself this constantly.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money I spent on laser hair removal and waxing.</li>
            <li> What people hate more than hair is stubble.</li>
            <li> Hair grows back slowly so</li>
            <li> item does not work as expected; it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The blades slow down and it isn&#x27;t pulling all the hair even with multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> I hope that in due time, I have to use it less and less.</li>
            <li> A little background on me, I have very pale strawberry blonde fuzz ALL OVER my body.</li>
            <li> While I do like the epilation it offers, I unfortunately was dumb enough to believe that the battery would actually benefit me.</li>
            <li> Pain free (or less painful) without efficacy</li>
            <li> I do recommend this epilator for a less painful experience and being hair free for longer than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I have had some ingrown hairs but do not find that much worse than before (previously had an old Phillips Satinelle)</li>
            <li> So basically, it really worked about as well as a 3 year-old less expensive</li>
            <li> The hair grows back so slowly and much less of it-</li>
            <li> down leg with witch hazel</li>
            <li> I look down and that&#x27;s all I can see...</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> I mix up going up and down where the hair is</li>
            <li> Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have probably known that and just went up and down.</li>
            <li> It seemed to bog down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;****first shave the area you will epilate or trim the hair down with some clippers some.</li>
            <li> My ingrown hairs are gone down like 98% .  </li>
            <li> This epilator has you moving it down in sweeping strokes.</li>
            <li> then the effectiveness went down and it was taking longer to do my legs.</li>
            <li> With this epilator - you can start one leg when the baby is down for a nap</li>
            <li> With the Braun, periodic cleaning of the gears was required since hair would fall down the gaps.</li>
            <li> Belly button down hurt a lot</li>
            <li> Lie down and relax your arm while doing underarms</li>
            <li> The down side to this is you cannot use the Emjoi AP-18 in water, at the time when i was purchasing i figured</li>
            <li> It cut down my shave time by 2/3</li>
            <li> I then sat down on the floor, plugged in my Emjoi, and began mass-tweezing my leg</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and proceeded to glide it down my chest.</li>
            <li> I bought this item six months ago and today it has suddendly begin making a noise like a car breaking down</li>
            <li> and you wouldn&#x27;t have to ruin your skin shaving every other day!</li>
            <li> it due to the minimized pain levels!</li>
            <li> Start at the edge of an area and work your way into the hair little by little by using small back and forth strokes until you have cleaned the area.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a blister pack, with little information in comparison to other models.</li>
            <li> But please be careful if you have thick hair, it may be little more painful.</li>
            <li> But this little guy makes it go by faster, and it seems to hurt less than other epilators I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> (Plus it made the entire thing vibrate a little too hard)</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair that is hard to pull out.</li>
            <li> I thought long and hard before tossing my old Epilady -- which, while a little slow, was still working after a decade! -- and buying this model.</li>
            <li> I’m disappointed that I had a bad experience with this since I heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> Also in my experience, the first session was the most painful, the ones that followed were not as bad at all.</li>
            <li> (because, for a female, I have dark, coarse body hair and shaving leaves stubble and ingrown hairs, waxing is alright but expensive and obnoxious to have to go get it done all the time</li>
            <li> I have some trouble with it breaking off hairs instead of pulling them, but this could be due to me not having used one before.</li>
            <li> After hearing the review from her, as well as a few other bloggers and youtubers, I thought that I would give it a chance.</li>
            <li> The two rolls of tweezers work to remove hair faster and it misses less hairs than other devices, though it still misses quite a few.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say overall that this was a bad product (since I did not have much time to use it before it became unusable), but for being on the closer end of $100, I could have just stuck to using electric clippers and saved my money.</li>
            <li> I am hoping/expecting that in time, less and less of it will be making an appearance.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for about a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> , maybe softer/thinner hair will break less..</li>
            <li> hair was much less course when it regrew (compared to shaving)and epilating this time resulted in significantly less discomfort.</li>
            <li> It says you get less ingrown hairs using this product.  </li>
            <li> The epilator paid for itself in less than 2 uses and is a durable, reliable, and portable method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> After a year and half stopped working</li>
            <li> my previous phillips model.     </li>
            <li> I also feel like it hurts less and leaves my skin less irritated.</li>
            <li> But believe it or not, as time goes on and you continue to use it, the pain is less and less.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> And less dense.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was skeptical about buying another one, even more, to pay this hefty price.</li>
            <li> For my skin/hair type it is quicker and my skin is much less irritated aferwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced the pain factor is less because of the 72 tweezer head.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s rechargable and my previous ones were not.      </li>
            <li> My previous Emjoi lasted for almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It hurts less, but it takes longer.</li>
            <li> and I hoped that this could cut that time in half - as stated.</li>
            <li> She also comments on how her hair grows out less and thinner.  </li>
            <li> For instance, I figured that the crack, taint and hole would have been the most painful, but it was the least.</li>
            <li> That did require some slight acrobatics to accomplish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase it for my legs but after several facial attempts, I tried it just to see if I was holding it wrong.</li>
            <li> So rather than picking them out, I let them grow themselves out, and I&#x27;m having less of an issue with them.</li>
            <li> but it seems this one hurts less than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> To the point it&#x27;s almost a slight burn.  </li>
            <li> but I also did it while slightly intoxicated once too</li>
            <li> It did hurt a wee bit less when I kept using it.</li>
            <li> As a previous waxer (done it since I was 14 and ever since)</li>
            <li> So, it makes the epilation less time consuming, but a user shouldn&#x27;t expect it to remove all of their hair in any body area.</li>
            <li> but sadly I think at this point I will just go back to the basic razor until I find something else.</li>
            <li> device is only for people who have serious issues with body hair.</li>
            <li> And with less pain.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not getting even half of everything.\\</li>
            <li> but if you pull the skin taut, it hurts significantly less.  </li>
            <li> So removing hair I can do now in half of the time I was used to!!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I also swear I have way less ingrown hairs than I used to have.</li>
            <li> the less hair</li>
            <li> the  less it hurts.</li>
            <li> the last critic is that the bulky head makes it difficult to take care of curved areas such as knees or armpits.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It only lasts a few months until it slowly starts to stop working</li>
            <li> My previous epilator was a Braun SE 7681.</li>
            <li> As summer was approaching I need to seriously look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I recommend washing the area with soap and water, drying it thoroughly and patting on some baby powder to help the epilator grab the hair with less irritation to your skin.</li>
            <li> and it took significantly less time to do them.</li>
            <li> I have had the replace the head after less than a year and this happened with another of there models.</li>
            <li> -Entry below asterisks is my previous review-  </li>
            <li> As I suspected a bit over a year ago, the sad undersized gearing ... smaller and narrower than those in our Phillips Satinelle or our Emjoi Erase which both still work, stripped awhile back rendering the unit unusable.</li>
            <li> Like i said, i had much less pain</li>
            <li> never the less    price-</li>
            <li> and I experience considerably less discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that I could shave less often.</li>
            <li> Even though it lasted a bit less than a year, it was a year I never had to worry about smoothness of my legs.</li>
            <li> I had previously used</li>
            <li> I need to double check the refund/return policy because this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The price is less than waxing, lazering and razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use my Emjoi, but with a 72 tweezer head I expected to not have any hair left behind, less stubble feel at the end of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I previously had a battery operated one</li>
            <li> I finish doing my half legs within 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Well, now I think it hurts less because it´s not getting all the hairs by the root.</li>
            <li> (Thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, precede epilation with the consumption of half a bottle of wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I owned a previous generation of the Emjoi epilator and used it until it wore out.  </li>
            <li> This tweezer cuts time in half.</li>
            <li> But, I thought that I could upgrade and order an item that would do the work in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Its a lot less work then shaving that is for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my previous tweezer.</li>
            <li> so I have less stubble after a shave, but W.T.H.   </li>
            <li> Alot less pain  as well.</li>
            <li> It would still take LESS time AND EFFORT/TROUBLE to do this then the Waxing/Threading Routine.</li>
            <li> It keeps sticking and freezing and picks up significantly less than hair before.</li>
            <li> This one is quicker and needs less passes.</li>
            <li> (I had shaved the previous day like I was advised)</li>
            <li> , I decided to take some pain medicine and wait a half hour to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> less than one \\&quot;large\\&quot; area wax</li>
            <li> I find that this hurts less than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i wont take less than 36.</li>
            <li> My legs are smoother longer and I seem to have less irritation than I had with the braun.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully in time, it will be even less of a bother.</li>
            <li> For several years, I have been unable to shave my legs properly because of arthritis.  </li>
            <li> However, I prefer the previous model that this once replaced.</li>
            <li> so I literally received it in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> , the pain would subside as there was less and less hair to go over.</li>
            <li> All have had the tweezer head design, though my previous ones were gold plated (no idea why).  </li>
            <li> Without all the nooks and crannies found on others, less hair and peach fuzz gets into the head, making cleanup a breeze.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel them in just half a day</li>
            <li> Now, after less than 2 years, the gears have stripped and it no longer works.  </li>
            <li> I have laser half of them (have almost no hair from my knee to the bottom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And each time you shave, you will see less hair that needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> So if I can stand the pain or slight discomfort, so can you.</li>
            <li> I dont think you can expect any less pain if you are planning to pull out your hairs by its roots.</li>
            <li> I also have, plus twice as efficient in hair removal and half as noisy.  </li>
            <li> Anyone looking to get one that will take less time to use, this one fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It just seemed like I would end up taking half a day just epliating my legs.</li>
            <li> The only negative experience I have, is that it does not remove hair well in uneven areas like the knees.</li>
            <li> Go in the direction of hair growth for less pain.</li>
            <li> Takes less than 1 hour to do legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I typically use this for the pubic area and the underarms.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there is slight discomfort</li>
            <li> I am giving one star less just because I get some ingrown hair after usage but exfoliating the skin couple of times a week helps</li>
            <li> the pain is less and it spins fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so much better than messy wax which I hate.</li>
            <li> but I figured it&#x27;d be one less body part to worry about.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done in less time, leaving smoother skin than any razor ever could.</li>
            <li> I bought this model five years ago to replace an older generation that failed after two years.</li>
            <li> I retired this little extension of hell to the dark corner under the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I should also say that I have very coarse, thick black hair which I can shave with a razor at 5am and have a shadow by 9am!</li>
            <li> skin is soft, pale, and thin</li>
            <li> I already owned the emjoi epi silk when I ordered this, it just took so long to remove the hair from my legs that I hardly ever used it.  </li>
            <li> I usually wax my under arms and legs and this cuts the time spent on waxing by half.</li>
            <li> : shaving would not only leave black dots, but a shadow and ingrown hair, waxing was expensive and messy, and laser hair removal was costly and only semi-permanent.</li>
            <li> Also, the unit leaves a mess of hair (both on your working surface and in the tweezers), and it is noisier than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> So this is pretty disappointing for me, given the price.</li>
            <li> Not a good product to use on big patches of hair.</li>
            <li> I cleaned up my mess and forgot I was timing my hair removal and remembered to look at the clock at 8:56.  </li>
            <li> Not good when you rely on this for your regular hair removal method!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman and needed something to get rid of hair since shaving my curly hair constantly ended up with ingrowns and painful bumps.</li>
            <li> There is no true quality anymore.</li>
            <li> Starting about 3 years ago, due to problems with persistent, itchy bumps on my legs, I started epilating my entire leg, and yes, the first time was the worst!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I don&#x27;t get a close smooth shave feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and less painful</li>
            <li> The two spinning heads also kept the skin tight which seemed to lessen the pain.  </li>
            <li> The trick is holding your skin tight when using it.  </li>
            <li> you have tight skin.  </li>
            <li> It was painful on the first run, but I now just use it weekly, although I really see very little hair growth in one week, but it is far less painful.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s kind of annoying, because all the other times after are much less painful (barely noticeable) due to the thinness of the hair.  </li>
            <li> if you have coarse hair that is hard to pull out, this is the epilator you want!</li>
            <li> It had a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; attachment with only about 12 tweezers that wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad along with the normal head attachment.</li>
            <li> It was my first experience with an epilator, so I expected it to be painful.</li>
            <li> After years of waxing, I was looking for a faster, less messy method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for a few years now and it takes off less than 30% of my leg hair and maybe around 50% of my armpit hair.  </li>
            <li> If I missed a day or two the stubble was thick and dark, and noticeable rough to touch.  </li>
            <li> My main problem with this epilator is that after a year or so of use (I use it once a month during cold weather, and probably once a week or every other week during the summer time)</li>
            <li> if you use it on your bikini line it will hurt badly ,but after the first few times the pain is minimal .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and even though I&#x27;ve had some painful experiences, it&#x27;s been bareable and the results are by far unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and even though I&#x27;ve had some painful experiences, it&#x27;s been bareable and the results are by far unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The hair grows from so many directions, that I&#x27;d always have to go over them up to four times (soooo painful) and there&#x27;d STILL be leftover hairs!</li>
            <li> I would compare it to almost, little shocks.</li>
            <li> In addition, it seems like hairs have to be a little bit longer for this one to work than for the Braun to work.  </li>
            <li> For the newbies...it takes a little practise and it does hurt..</li>
            <li> Firstly, im not one to usually write reviews.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I feel little to no pain--barely prickly.</li>
            <li> just stings a little (and</li>
            <li> The tweaser head little plastic gear broke in 2 places from extended use.  </li>
            <li> You have to let the hair grow out a little longer</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is a little bulkier than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little bit nervous about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the stubble as it rubs against my pants, and my husband gets a little queasy if the hair on my legs is longer than his buzz-cut head.</li>
            <li> I think it might be a little louder</li>
            <li> so the hair does need to grow a little.  </li>
            <li> and I have little hair spikes throughout my legs already.  </li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;ve also used it on my face because I have little whiskers on my chin</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to go over and over or push a little or whatever</li>
            <li> This Emjoi doesn&#x27;t pull my skin, leave little blood blisters, or hurt.  </li>
            <li> I have nicknamed this little beauty \\&quot;Tasmanian</li>
            <li> Just do a little bit each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. A.)</li>
            <li> The little bar does nothing to help that.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little faster.  </li>
            <li> So a little pain during, but none afterwards?  </li>
            <li> it does hurt a little butyou can get use to it.  </li>
            <li> just do little areas at a time....</li>
            <li> it came with and shake it a little bit after detaching the head.  </li>
            <li> Every 3 weeks of 15 minutes is great!&lt;br /&gt;After nine months of use, the little torture machine has begun to disfunction.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind the little leg fuzzes</li>
            <li> Works and gets every little hair.</li>
            <li> Since I used a small Emjoi epilator on my face, I decided to check on the reviews of other Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of redness which subsided within minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year</li>
            <li> and I even noticed some little drops of blood where hair had been pulled out on the spot that I tried.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy female, and it sucks!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my little Phillips satinelle epilator;</li>
            <li> I ended up with tons of little cuts all over my legs from having to dig the ingrown hairs out.  </li>
            <li> And I have to say it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> None of that mattered to the little motor that couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my arms which are a little hairier than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> i was little worried it will hurt.</li>
            <li> This Emjoi Epiator seems to be alot faster than other Emjoi Epiators Ive used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if its because the hair on my legs is a little finer, but</li>
            <li> that other epilators I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> After about a year of using the Braun with little decrease or resistance build up to the pain I started searching for another alternative and found the Emoji</li>
            <li> I would spend an average of 30 minutes for both legs combined!</li>
            <li> Just sticks a little.  </li>
            <li> If you can stand a little pain, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> So I did a little research on hair removal and decided to try the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is that the little gear wheel which drives the tweezer head is made out of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Since it is pulling the hair out at the root, it does hurt a little, but like anything - you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Felt a little prickly, sometimes.</li>
            <li> it literally felt like thousands of little electricity bolts hitting you at one time...</li>
            <li> one of the little teeth break off then all the rest do</li>
            <li> It was virtually painless, just a little stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done my arms or legs yet because I shave both, and have to let the hair grow out a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisier than some,  </li>
            <li> a little one&lt;br /&gt;and used it every day but now with this one I can go days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little problem with a little stubble after Epilation.  </li>
            <li> I did a touch-ups every couple of days and had little to no regrowth for about a week.  </li>
            <li> Even though using this product may cause a little discomfort</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this and optimistic about the reviews, so am disappointed in its performance.  </li>
            <li> This was due to a small burr on the rotating disc.  </li>
            <li> Also when using it don&#x27;t try to do it a little and tke it away from your legs because it hurts.</li>
            <li> all the little missed hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a little pinching pain because it does tweeze out the hair</li>
            <li> this may be because I have used other epilators in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the nature of the hair there or the shape/countours of the area itself.  </li>
            <li> I like the little travel/storage pouch.  </li>
            <li> Feeling a little pinching.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> little to no pain as it removed almost all hairs.</li>
            <li> Alarmed due to my first reaction of the tweezers on taut lower front calf skin as if I was being electrically shocked a billion times and I almost instinctually threw the little machine at a wall.  </li>
            <li> before showering&lt;br /&gt;Shave after with razor no more than 4 blades(to get the dead layer of skin off and any other missed hair)&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
            <li> will say it was somewhat less painful than my old epilator, but that is a sort of a moot point considering everything it left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is INCREDIBLY painful the first time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a little bumps but its gone in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Maybe pushing the moving head too firmly to catch all those little leg hairs not removed like they would be waxing...</li>
            <li> I have dark, thick hair on my legs and armpits, but this worked so well, and it got all the little blonde hairs my old epilator used to leave behind!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tough to do anything else while you use it,so that&#x27;s time that has to be dedicated to that specific purpose.</li>
            <li> For the ones who are tough enough to epilate instead of shaving, this machine is it.</li>
            <li> You do have to get the technique down, but that is the case with anything like this!  </li>
            <li> I only decided to replace it because lately it had been taking longer and longer to epilate as I think the tweezers were getting a little dull</li>
            <li> Then you are left to work very hard at getting it to pick up the hairs which were left behind.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, &amp; would have to shave my legs every day in summer, now I just \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; once a week.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark hairy legs</li>
            <li> a drag!!!</li>
            <li> Two weeks later a few hairs started to grow, I could not wait to use it again!!!...</li>
            <li> As far as epilators go, the eMagine is a tough machine and should provide the user with 6 weeks of shave-free strutting.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair on my legs that literally would grow back everyday.</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t get smooth legs for a week at a time, at least I won&#x27;t have unsightly and painful legs for days on end.ays and had little to no regrowth for about a week.  </li>
            <li> Not as painful as I expected it to be, considering my pain tolerance isn&#x27;t very high.</li>
            <li> : corded, fast, somewhat less painful than other epilators</li>
            <li> This is the second Emjoi product which has failed me after less than 2 years due to breakage of the wheel&#x27;s plastic spokes.   </li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t get smooth legs for a week at a time, at least I won&#x27;t have unsightly and painful legs for days on end.</li>
            <li> Clearly the person who engineered this device failed.</li>
            <li> My last one, a Legend, recently started cutting off the hairs instead of pulling them out ...</li>
            <li> Too awkward to use on anything but your legs, and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> However, for some reason, the surface of the machine is very abrasive where it feels like it&#x27;s cutting into your skin.  </li>
            <li> However, you need to liberaly cream everyday.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days of doing bit by bit, because it is quite</li>
            <li> It has trouble pulling shorter hairs...  </li>
            <li> In fact I dont even feel it anymore now that I have been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Why waste money on something that doesn&#x27;t work well?</li>
            <li> I had tried this before with the braun a few times and the pain had been so unbearable I had to stop.     </li>
            <li> My legs are not smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaving is an everyday thing</li>
            <li> It left a lot of hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You do have do go over a few times - in a circular motion</li>
            <li> But alas, even as I followed the directions, exfoliated prior to use, everything to make it go as planned, it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> And it looked heavy.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to get all the hair off</li>
            <li> #Wasted #MY #MONEY</li>
            <li> At home waxing, yuck messy and doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Not brave enough to use it on the bikini area</li>
            <li> With this product its usually a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The shipping took few weeks</li>
            <li> (I think the machine may have broken off some of the lighter hairs, even when used on the Low setting).</li>
            <li> pun intended)) to do my bikini and knee area along with pulling out the stragglers all over the rest of the legs that the Emjoi left behind.    </li>
            <li> and then after I dried them, immediately used the epilator.  </li>

            <li> Silk Epil 5 Epilator with Ice Glove, Green]] .</li>
            <li> No light.  </li>
            <li> Just in a matter of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Started making incredibly choppy sounds as if something was stuck inside of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE GOT A FEW</li>
            <li> It does take a few passes to get all the hair</li>
            <li> I will do that in a few days.  </li>
            <li> But it does have a few draw-backs.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I used another cheaper brand for a few years, but it seemed to take longer and longer to remove the hair</li>
            <li> Had one for a few years and wanted another to replace it , but I guess they don&#x27;t make them like they use to...</li>
            <li> few tips from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I get out, I use the towel to rub away any dead skin.</li>
            <li> so I considered them a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It might seem silly, but you&#x27;d be surprised how helpful it</li>
            <li> What took me ages before, took me a few minutes today.</li>
            <li> If I try this on my bikini area I will get waxed a few times before attempting it.      </li>
            <li> If it hurts a bit (and it will) just take it and keep epilating, I promise it will stop hurting after a few times</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator b/c I was going to the beach and did not want to have to shave everyday there.  </li>
            <li> Every few days or once a week per area is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I used to get hollywood waxes a few years ago</li>
            <li> Just keep exfoliating every few days .</li>
            <li> After 11 months it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> It truly was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did not Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no light on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not smooth, they are bumpy.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks the gears are stripped.....  STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about missing places.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for a few years now.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use....</li>
            <li> But I have to say that it didn&#x27;t work for me and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> BIGGGGG waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This was a wasted $80 in my case.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and destroy any thought of trying this emjoi unless your goal is to remain hairy.</li>
            <li> After a few months it stops hurting at all</li>
            <li> I was debating on buying one, I didn&#x27;t want to just buy a cheaper $30 one and not like it and just have the investment wasted.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t remove the majority so I end up having to waste a lot of time still tweezing.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The Braun kept missing hairs and took me quite awhile to finish.  </li>
            <li> After you use it a few times, there is NO pain.  </li>
            <li> A few things: 1.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If it lasts a year, and I use it every few weeks</li>
            <li> Talk about a waste of $90.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She bought one of these a few months ago and was using it to get rid of unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> In the idea that it will thin out the hair that grows back, like waxing.</li>

            <li> So you can go over an area a few times in one night, with</li>
            <li> The gear within the machine broke off a few of the teeth on the epilating head and now it does not function.  </li>
            <li> Finito, dead.</li>
            <li> I have thick,dark hair and shaved everyday.</li>
            <li> I rather use this than have tweezers everyday.</li>
            <li> I learned this after a bit when I started seeing a few ingrown hairs on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> One broke after 8 years, one broke immediately, and my third one was broken by the TSA after they searched my bag.</li>
            <li> It would be a waste of money, time, effort and patience.</li>
            <li> One round with the Emjoi</li>
            <li> Using it is uncomfortable, but I would not go so far as to say it hurt.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s dead</li>
            <li> The Panasonic left a lot of hair behind esp.</li>
            <li> (I think it might be because the emojoi breaks a few hairs off instead of pulling them.)  </li>
            <li> I do have a few additional suggestions for those of you who haven&#x27;t used an epilator before.  </li>
            <li> This happens frequently and makes it really difficult to epilate any body part.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few epilators over the years</li>
            <li> For the areas that are regularly groomed it does a poor job of grabbing the shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Short hair, thin hair</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review after I had used this product a few times.  </li>
            <li> Be patient though, these things take a few passes to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Under my arms I use every day for a few days.  </li>
            <li> We plugged it in, tried it out on a few spots, and then had to go run some errands.</li>
            <li> Its not cordless, and there is no light on it to help see the hairs on the body.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The night of, I showered and thoroughly dried before epilating; I did not use any talc or drying powders.</li>
            <li> Did both legs (including behind the knees and upper thighs!)</li>
            <li> (and a few dollars too)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving because I have sensitive skin and either get ingrown hairs or rasor bumps in sensitive areas, therefore I waxed.</li>
            <li> I waited the 6-8 weeks for the next round of growth, and to my dismay, was not happy with the results (not to mention the almost unbearable pain of the pinching and grabbing of my skin by the machine).</li>
            <li> I have used other brands which all said 6 weeks in between usages,  that was not true, for me it was  every 3 days and the hair on my face is not course or thick.</li>
            <li> The product is a little hard to get in  the creases (not including underarms), but other than that I will not be returning this one.</li>
            <li> and when I took off the head of it thinking that something was stuck to find out that the roller that is suppose to move the tweezers were all worn down and was not able to move the tweezers</li>
            <li> I find it really strange to say this, but this tweezer is far less painful than the Emjoi Optima.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally if you have a couple of drinks first it becomes much less painful...</li>
            <li> My armpits still hurt the worst, but again, pull the skin super taught--grin and bare it.  </li>
            <li> : expensive, a bit loud, but honestly no louder than other epilators.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on several different websites before buying this product and it is definitely less painful than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> It pulled out the hair in a single pass (I could see the root base so it was not breaking the hair), and it did a stellar job.</li>
            <li> I spend less time going over areas than I have with past epilators.  </li>
            <li> In less than 12 minutes I was done with my legs and underarms!</li>
            <li> I got both legs done in less than the time it took to do just one leg with the Braun!  </li>
            <li> , even if I have to to this once (I hope it will be less, but lets say maybe even 2 - 3 Times a week) and EyeBrow Threading ( Can&#x27;t/Shouldn&#x27;t Epilate There! )  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it cut my time in half, but it did seem shorter than usual.  </li>
            <li> Small hairs are still noticeable on the legs, but not seen, and with each day and pass it keeps getting less and less.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight</li>
            <li> I can be finished in half the time it has taken me in the past.  </li>
            <li> Hello, less pain!</li>
            <li> Also, i could actually feel a sharp, pricking sensation in a number of the pores for a while afterwards, but nothing disturbing.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used this epilator, it was a little painful.</li>
            <li> Or at least I have to touch up every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> Works well, removes a lot of hair per pass, a little annoying to have cord always, but my main problem with it is it is too big to get into small spaces like around the side of your ankles.</li>
            <li> deos not get very small hais, obviuosly i would want every single hair to grow otherwise its pointless</li>
            <li> The first few times I did it, I thought it was extremely painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS painful the first few attempts, but your body gets use to it after awhile.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed, but I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old one exclusively.</li>
            <li> The first time was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> The epilators I had in the past were frustrating - it took me amost an hour to do both legs and still left some hairs.</li>
            <li> It was not easy by any means, I had to use a screwdriver.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy mustache &amp; beard caused by some heavy medication in the past.</li>
            <li> it would if I were to wax my legs, it doesnt make a mess, and I can use it on just about any part of my body!</li>
            <li> it worked well when it worked (5 stars) and -2 stars because it has proven not to be a well engineered little machine past nine months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took about 30 min or so to shave both legs a little past my knees.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the first time you use this product it can be a bit painful, but honestly, it&#x27;s not that bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it as I can hardly raise my arms.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this epilator for about 2 months now and have found that if I use it about once a week I have very little irritation and that clears in a few hours.</li>
            <li> something about the number of tweezers or the shape of the head really helps make it less painful and</li>
            <li> I could purchase a less expensive model and get the same results.</li>
            <li> Removing hair from my legs is so much faster and even less painful.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the fastest one of the bunch, cutting the time in half.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and for some reason, less painful.  </li>
            <li> If you press too hard, it slows down, so press it just up to the point</li>
            <li> If the motor slows down, you are pushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is a bad product when compared to others, but compared to expectations, this falls way short.veral passes going in the growth direction, then I&#x27;d go against the growth and get it the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my lower legs, it hurt so bad it brought tears to my eyes</li>
            <li> Legs are pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I even did my armpits and while that did hurt pretty bad</li>
            <li> HOWEVER,  the pain was pretty bad....</li>
            <li> Like I said it&#x27;s painful at first</li>
            <li> first time was painful, but I use each week, and that is nothing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was painful at the first time using it</li>
            <li> First use will be painful.</li>
            <li> Of course, it was painful since it was the first time</li>
            <li> My first time using this, I must admit, it was tickling painful, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> The first 5 times were painful, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> It was kinda painful the first time I used it, but now I don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> He was scared that it would be painful at first</li>
            <li> The first time is painful...</li>
            <li> That said, underarms are quite painful the first time you do them.</li>
            <li> It is pretty painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too painful to use under the arms and for the bikini area, I could only do the top, the rest was too painful.</li>
            <li> my review will be base on the manufacture claims, against its performance, and targeting other first time</li>
            <li> No more mess and no more</li>
            <li> No more messy wax , shave cream and razor bumps for me.</li>
            <li> I still get a few, but it seems not nearly as many.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my once extremely thick and dark leg hair is now a lot thinner and lighter and takes a lot longer to grow.</li>
            <li> Before I used emjoi I had thick dark hair on my legs and it look as though I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little hard to use on uneven surfaces like the knees and underarms.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun that is beginning to age and slow down</li>
            <li> I found that once the battery on the rechargeable unit wore out, it seemed to slow down even when it was plugged in.</li>
            <li> Anyways, for me I was a little disappointed at first thinking I&#x27;d still have to shave along with doing the epilator.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, coarse hair but not luckily not very abundant on my legs.</li>
            <li> Also not very effective on underarms.</li>
            <li> but that requires paying attention because, until I got the hand of it, I was creating raw places on my body.</li>
            <li> my skin goes freaking RAW man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> general, I am very disappointed that I waste so much money on this product</li>
            <li> The stubble is not as bad as from razor shaving though, since (I am guessing) the hairs are growing back at different rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you use this, if you continue to do maintenance on the tweezed area before all the hair grows back out, it won&#x27;t hurt as bad as the initial use.</li>
            <li> I can see a few hairs I missed, not many- and not sure of the re-growth that I will see in the days to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they did a HORRIBLE job the one time I went there) to get professional leg waxing done, I really had no choice.  </li>
            <li> It would take me at least an hour to do both my legs with the Braun, that time is cut in half by the Emojoi.</li>
            <li> A LOT of it is Thick too, and it&#x27;s ALWAYS Jet Black)</li>
            <li> My hairs did soften up and became less thick.  </li>
            <li> I could go at least a week and a half before seeing any regrowth.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and absolutely hate shaving for numerous reasons.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for a few years now and have become tired of the time and money spent.  </li>
            <li> I mean I would have bitten down on a belt strap if it had been nearby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried epialting before and was a little nervous!  </li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve been epilating), it takes a little while longer for me to do the job (and I&#x27;ve got to do my thighs, chest, torso, and arms, ugh!).  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind a little pain, but this was a little ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Considering all the positive reviews, there&#x27;s a chance I got a bad unit</li>
            <li> the positive side, the product was not as painful to me as others reported.  </li>
            <li> The snapped hairs led to very painful ingrown hairs, VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the other reviews for this epilator &amp; it stinks!  </li>
            <li> I wore out the other less expensive brand of Enjoli in less than a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little louder, but works twice as hard to get even the tiniest hair.</li>
            <li> This Emjoi AP-18 Emagine frequently caught my skin, missed a lot of the hairs (sometimes short ones, sometimes fairly long ones!), and worst of all it caused abrasions on my skin.</li>
            <li> The warranty process is a complete hassle and SLOW!!!</li>
            <li> hands down!!    </li>
            <li> I use on my underarms and bikini line, as I have very little hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> I developed serious  uncomfortable skin irritations which lasted 7 days.  </li>
            <li> So only bad thing - that hair should be a little bit longer than I expected to be removed.    </li>
            <li> I read reviews that said that Emjoi was less painful comparing to other similar epilators and i agree with it.</li>
            <li> It really dosent hurt that bad, but thats just me</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how folks have given it bad reviews.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast in sending too Bad</li>
            <li> Yes, of course you can feel the hairs being pulled out, but it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad ones that take too long or simply doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so disappointed, and for what I paid this was worse than the cheap Braun model I have.</li>
            <li> It was intensely painful and tickled so much</li>
            <li> It is fast so it is not as painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you&#x27;ve done an area once, it&#x27;s not as bad the second time around, as long as you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> It is to painful to use, don&#x27;t remove hair very well and</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t painful at all</li>
            <li> Terrible, I used a Braun silk epil 7 before this and was 100x better.</li>
            <li> For me it was not fast, it took an episode of \\&quot;Game of Thrones\\&quot; to completed both legs, this included discomfort breaks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will continue to use this device.  </li>
            <li> I usually shaved my underarms, I never waxed it or epilated it, so they were not used to this torture device.</li>
            <li> I move the epilator quite a few times but it doesnt catch them!</li>
            <li> Even set on slow speed it tends to break a few of the hairs off instead of pulling them out.</li>
            <li> If you need a heavy duty \\&quot;machine\\&quot; this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I am not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Even then, I usually had to grab one or two with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> Bikini area is too difficult for me, so I only tried a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> I can still feel small stubs of hair.</li>
            <li> - This is not better, in fact - it&#x27;s inferior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what advantage the dual head is either.  </li>
            <li> negative is that there is no light on the epilator (which Braun has)</li>
            <li> The pain is beyond this world and it left behind stubble!</li>
            <li> Two heads are NOT better than one.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel that it took an excessive number of passes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have gotten used to the hair being pulled out by the root...</li>
            <li> I was told that you can get use to it, but I was not able to with my legs.</li>
            <li> Not better then Braun Silk epil, gives ingrown hair, skin coming off giving rashes.</li>
            <li> I have a weird hairline on the back of my neck).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is time-consuming to use as it takes several passes to remove all hair, and forget trying to use it on soft/cushy areas of skin--it will pull your skin into the unit.  </li>
            <li> it got the small hair.</li>
            <li> Do small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> However if you are not once you get past the majority of the hair removal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these in the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to spend hours on a saturday or sunday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where this product falls, so it may or may not wind up on the &amp;</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> im african american female who WAS prone to nasty ingrown hairs from shaving.  </li>
            <li> work in small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> am disappointed by this product because despite of the number of tweezers and the two heads rotating in opposite directions, it is only as efficient as the machine I had 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> and it does a terrible job on top of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review to let people who tried epilation in the past and gave up that they may want to try it again.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does a lousy job...</li>
            <li> This epilator can pull out hair as small as 2mm in length without any trouble!</li>
            <li> Does not require a lot of repetitive motions.</li>
            <li> This epilator broke inside while I was using it and because it happen after a warranty I was not able to return it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not magic like you want to believe it.</li>
            <li> The efficiency of the 72 tweezer head was no more than my 36 tweezer head.</li>
            <li> This works well but not outstanding</li>
            <li> I had no issues even in small spaces.</li>
            <li> It is a small battery-operated unit.  </li>
            <li> (We have a small place.)</li>
            <li> A job that usually takes anywhere from 2 1/2 - 3 hours took about 1/2 hour.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, having Greek blood, I was not so blessed with the hairy gene.</li>
            <li> No sure if it removed any hair.</li>
            <li> No more stinging after shaving!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> It will pick up small hairs  ---</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Starting again, the pain was about 98% as horrible as it was the first time, but I was COMMITTED now.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heating element or something, there&#x27;s no magic ion generator to stop bacterial growth on it, or while using it.</li>
            <li> the cleaning brush, is too small to do anything.</li>
            <li> no more paying a fortune for waxing or showing you bikini area to strangers.</li>
            <li> No sure why</li>
            <li> There is no magic, pain-free solution.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will be returning this item and going back to shaving with my razor.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will be returning this item and going back to shaving with my razor.  </li>
            <li> I have had three in the past</li>
            <li> i usually end up having just one side touch</li>
            <li> is no more then maybe a 3.</li>
            <li> A beginner can get used to it by using the slower speed and depilating small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and first time i used it hurts like crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid after a month of use and some considerable damage to my armpits</li>
            <li> Move in small swipes.</li>
            <li> Move in small swipes.</li>
            <li> hence, you are left with a useless device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if cream slows hair growth as after all Mother Nature is in control.  </li>
            <li> During each use it has made my skin softer with no more ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> What can I say - no more shaving,</li>
            <li> Small clockwise or anti clockwise circular motions and u</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied, regretful of paying 90 dollars for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The major negative complaint on the Braun though was I ended up with 3 bloody pores, still trying to figure out why, maybe due to long hairs being pulled???  </li>
            <li> ANYTHING, that cuts down this time and arduous task, is needed ,that&#x27;s why I looked at this,</li>
            <li> Seems to be less painful compared with my old Braun one and quicker too.</li>
            <li> I used to have thick stiff stuble on parts of my legs when I shaved, and had to shave a couple times a week.  </li>
            <li> Much less painful than my previous Emjoi only drawback is it&#x27;s not designed to get bikini area.</li>
            <li> This product not very good, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Having very heavy hair growth, shaving was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it removed ALL the hair and not leave the very few it does leave....</li>
            <li> Also alot less painful!&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li> Then it got a lot worse because the itchy stubble would make me itch harder until I literally itched my skin till it was bleeding!  </li>
            <li> It does not catch all the little hairs especially if they are thin but in my experience it is less painful than other epilators I tried (e.g. Braun).</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks it started to slow down, and within on year it was impossible to properly epilate.</li>
            <li> They fail for various reasons, but commonly it seems to be the the cord (where it goes into the machine).  </li>
            <li> This only gets worse and worse.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the things I had read about this product did not match its actual performance, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Hurts like bloody hell, but definitely rips the hairs out by the root, and they take some time to grow back!</li>
            <li> (afterwards...the lower speed could not pick up the broken hairs left behind)</li>
            <li> and it left the annoying red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I am a black female who was sick of having those little spots on my legs everytime I shaved.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that bad unless I just have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Basing a product review on \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot; is quite silly, as the whole point of the product is to rip hair out of your body - which frankly is not a marvelous experience no matter how hard core you are.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work :(</li>
            <li> I used this 3 times within two weeks because I hate to admit I&#x27;m a pretty hairy person.  </li>
            <li> I think its because my legs are at least used to past torturous methods like waxing and hair creams,</li>
            <li> This item is a sad excuse for an epilator made by Emjoi.....</li>
            <li> A few minutes on Google will save you a few days of painful, red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> But it did work; I just went really, really slowly over my skin and worked small areas at a time checking the work as I</li>
            <li> My legs usually get itchy after I shave with a razor, so I tried this and no more itch!</li>
            <li> decided to take the plunge after reading the reviews here and got the 72 tweezer head Emjoi Emagine with the thought that I could always return it if it was too painful, took too long, or gave me a rough  finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t get to the hairs as easily, has chafed my skin, and sometimes caused ingrown hairs and blocked follicles (very nasty).</li>
            <li> Between the redness, bumps, and black, my legs look even worse than they did when I was shaving.  </li>
            <li> Between the redness, bumps, and black, my legs look even worse than they did when I was shaving.  </li>
            <li> but I tired it first its painful ....</li>
            <li> The stubble, and having to wait for hair to get long enough to pull out, are annoying factors.  </li>
            <li> only upside I found was that the Emjoi seemed less painful than the Philips.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth epilator, it&#x27;s less painful and faster.</li>
            <li> I definitely was less painful than the silk-epil and it removed the hair a lot faster.  </li>
            <li> Personally i think it is less painful in the bikini area and in the area of the Brazil wax.</li>
            <li> Baby powder makes the process ten times less painful and at least two to three times quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hard facts    </li>
            <li> It has a hard time around bony areas - like around the knees and in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It hardly worked.</li>
            <li> There is also a safety feature of automatic shutoff if you push too hard on your skin to prevent injury.</li>
            <li> it hardly hurt, just a prick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain.  </li>
            <li> This epilator hardly pulls any hair from my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with the hair underneath my arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get all of the hair in one area.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to do your bikini or your underarms.</li>
            <li> The 1st one wore out because I pressed too hard.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever shave unless I have to go to an event.  </li>
            <li> Now I hardly feel it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried pressing hard and pressing lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also hard to use around the knees</li>
            <li> Also hard to use around the knees</li>
            <li> The switch could be improved but I assume it is purposefully hard to switch on, to reduce the risk of accidental tweezing.</li>
            <li> like when u scratch your skin too hard with your nails.</li>
            <li> It did irritate and scratch some areas as I think I pressed too hard, however, the areas had no discomfort at all.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while you feel a pluck, but besides that, it doesn&#x27;t hurt hardly at all.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH THE RISK!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all!!!</li>
            <li> I have this little gadget!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I developed really bad ingrown hairs under my arms so although it worked I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do that again.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi is a bit painful, more than waxing, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Also it could never effectively remove hair from my knees or shins.</li>
            <li> The product was loud and painful, but I already knew that going in, based on my research.  </li>
            <li> Plus, there were a lot of finer hairs left behind, and it was difficult to do my underarms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often that this happens, but when it does, it really sucks.</li>
            <li> just home - at least, i wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi Epliators since the late 90s</li>
            <li> Like with all hair removal, you will need to do it regularly at least to start, because your hair grows in cycles, and when you do it today, you&#x27;re not catching the hairs that are still growing in the pores and haven&#x27;t peeped out as yet.    </li>
            <li> the Emjoi AP-18 turned out to be a massive disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have to use it at least couple of times a week to keep my arms and legs hairless.</li>
            <li> and/or it hurts and sucks to do it yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used an Epilady since the late 80s.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even realize it until it was too late</li>
            <li> The only inconvenient, it&#x27;s not cordless.</li>
            <li> This means using it at least once a week and dealing with a lot of ingrowns.</li>
            <li> The I have been waxing and/or epilating for at least five years now.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful to the level that I could only get a few inches done</li>
            <li> I find myself going over an area at least three times,</li>
            <li> So that may be common among epilators.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review since I almost did not buy this product based on the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before buying and was concerned about the negative ones.  </li>
            <li> My next disappointment was the fact that the unit does not come with any form of trimmer head.</li>
            <li> It sucks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not catching the invisible hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been insecure about it, but usually it&#x27;s not really an issue unless I&#x27;m laying out in my bikini.</li>
            <li> My mom swore by the old school epilators, but according to her they were incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to me though, as I prefer this over shaving, cutting myself, and worrying about scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , Gives the impression of razors cutting you, my skin is red</li>
            <li> At least with this i&#x27;ll do it once a week.</li>
            <li> Overall, disappointing</li>
            <li> The bone contact was unpleasant, it was too small of an area for that big of a machine, and I was concerned about getting my skin caught.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s far too painful to use anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : not cordless - construction is not good if you have small hands or mobility issues&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I started at the bottom of ankle by my foot and worked my way up and around...very slowly.  </li>
            <li> but after a few uses you get used to it and the hair grows thin and slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - it takes ages to epilate, and the results are not exactly amazing (see below)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this because I was tired of shaving everything downstairs virtually everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to use the slow speed to pick up the finer hair</li>
            <li> Compared to the Emojoi the Braun might as well have been slow and slower.</li>
            <li> GO SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like waxing really slowly.</li>
            <li> so the hair will grow thick and it can pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs and under my arms is so thin now I can comfortably not epilate for weeks without worrying about the hair.  </li>
            <li> Since the dual tweezer head its soo thick</li>
            <li> It would take 20-30 minutes PER leg because my hair was so thick.</li>
            <li> I even try it in slow motion and didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Go at it from the edge and work in slowly.</li>
            <li> (I am a licensed aesthetician) and I was getting tired of how messy the waxing process is.</li>
            <li> After epilating, I used Gigi Slow</li>
            <li> Even if you go in circles make them slow circles</li>
            <li> I do plan on running it on my legs again (slowly, of course) just to keep up with the growth</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair even if you sweep it in a slow one directional way.</li>
            <li> so I do not have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> if you are like me and have thick, kinda wavy hair that grows with like 2-4 hairs for every follicle i would NOT use this.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick however (I&#x27;m talking terminal hair)</li>
            <li> me, a sharp razor is the smoothest, least expensive way to go.</li>
            <li> I do like epilators in general because I hate the results of shaving and the mess of waxing.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have bought over the past 10 years and it is the fastest and least painful out of the three.  </li>
            <li> No amount of lotion would curb the itching, and the doctor&#x27;s version wasn&#x27;t enough and was too expensive!</li>
            <li> I mean I shave my underarms</li>
            <li> I mean, why not just shave?</li>
            <li> i mean it works but ouchhhhh</li>
            <li> So overall I was disappointed with this product, especially considering how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> Hammacher Schlemmer used to mean quality to me.</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me!</li>
            <li> No more waxing!</li>
            <li> no more shaving!</li>
            <li> The head on the Emjoi feels very rough and uncomfortable,</li>
            <li> this hurts so bad, I can only do a small area at a time and then quit...</li>
            <li> Yes, it did work but got ingrown hairs and some scarring not to mention some slight scarring and hated those red bumps that lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that there is not a light nor internal battery</li>
            <li> I always HATED waiting for my hair to be long enough that I could wax again!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly for those with allergies and hate the cuts from shaving.  </li>
            <li> Oh and knees is a little difficult to do because i could feel the tweezers on the bony parts and was afraid that i might hurt myself in the process, same with elbows&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the hair so much quicker, and it is less painful!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get into the very small areas.  </li>
            <li> But waxing your legs in the summer is not ideal because of the few weeks you have to let your hair grow out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the one I had fell down and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> After a few passes your skin starts to go a little numb.</li>
            <li> -less painful than other epilator varieties....</li>
            <li> It is faster and much less painful than the other models by this company and others.  </li>
            <li> saves me a ton of money versus waxing and even less painful than the other Epilady I was using</li>
            <li> This makes hair regrowth less uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I seriously dont know how you would get it out, but to turn off the device and pull out the hair/ thread itself.     </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re serious - can be time-consuming</li>
            <li> Seriously, this works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to control where it will remove hair and if you have a tricky area, it will constantly fight you to keep moving.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It grabs at the skin and fails to get to half of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Guys&#x27; hair is seriously rooted.</li>
            <li> Seriously saves me TONS of money.</li>
            <li> All together the product is better to me because I would get horrible blood blister from waxing and the worst thing you get from this is that it may cause slight bleeding on spots with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Compared to other epilators used in the past - this was a very big disappointment !!!  </li>
            <li> Yes lady&#x27;s, I&#x27;m sorry to say, but even after removing hair for six years there&#x27;s still a little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> However, it becomes less and less painful with each go, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt now at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week and find it&#x27;s less and less painful as the weeks go on.    </li>
            <li> Use this thing after you shower and it will be less painful and you will get less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Plus, it seems rather tough on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I just got tired of having to work so hard to reach  an those areas.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, it is much less painful too!</li>
            <li> but since then the hair takes FOREVER to grow back (standing ovation) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad either when I do have to go over it.</li>
            <li> takes FOREVER to grow back (standing ovation) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad either when I do have to go over it.</li>
            <li> but after the second time it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is a bad product when compared to others, but compared to expectations, this falls way short.</li>
            <li> but I thought that same thing about the bad reviews I saw myself.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back, and shaving can be a pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered a bad back and back surgery, a bad knee and knee surgery, and had my ankle fused.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad one from a third party here at amazon who knows but I&#x27;m done with epilators but</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be painful like waxing but not extremely painful to where I couldn&#x27;t handle it since I know that if it were that painful then no sane person would use it.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> * Is it painful? - Not enough to worry about.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse so the ingrown hair can be painful at times.  </li>
            <li> (Probably not good to do this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this on my underarms (not too painful if I epilate weekly) and my upper lip (ouch), but it works so well.  </li>
            <li> although not so painful if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly painful and would leave red marks/tiny scratches on my skin.</li>
            <li> My lower legs took me two sessions to get it done as it was quiet painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my upper lip, and it&#x27;s always painful and makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to throw up, so I continue to wax.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not  good</li>
            <li> like i thought&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a good choice</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT PULLED EVERY LAST PEICE OF MY LEG HAIR, WAS IT PAINFUL?</li>
            <li> I knocked off a star because I hate how loud it is</li>
            <li> YES VERY, BUT WAS VERY SHOCKED AT THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> But it is much less painful and messy than waxing.</li>
            <li> In the past I had used other epilators but they were painful and took forever to remove all the hairs</li>
            <li> After a painful first try, I am mad at myself for not doing this sooner.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less painful than my previous epilator!</li>
            <li> I think part of it is due to determination which causes you to numb some of the pain.</li>
            <li> Also, the epilator will never cut you or get dull!</li>
            <li> Works well but is so hard to use!</li>
            <li> I had pulled hair from which, though not a lot, was still not a pleasant sight.  </li>
            <li> I had pulled hair from which, though not a lot, was still not a pleasant sight.  </li>
            <li> (Laser is too expensive &amp; ruins Tattoos, &amp; some other products have rather bad reviews).</li>
            <li> and I have a high tolerance for pain, but it still hurt very badly</li>
            <li> For the past year I was getting my legs waxed every 3 weeks, which was getting quite expensive.</li>
            <li> While they told me the time, I&#x27;m pretty disgusted by this.</li>
            <li> I used this epilator once, following instructions to the letter, and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> But not for the weak.</li>
            <li> ) The first swipe is the worst.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m no epilating newbie: I expect it to be at least a little painful.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I am doing something wrong?  </li>
            <li> Be wary of this product, a small &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; to a gear broke off inside</li>
            <li> Forget the negative reviews; those people do not know what they are talking about!   </li>
            <li> the first time is the worst...</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m  past the uncomfortable stage,</li>
            <li> The first time is the worst.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave in the shower was especially difficult due to back pain when bending over.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Holy Toledo, my first run at my underarms was AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> only con: it is not cordless :(</li>
            <li> Purchased it during a desperate attempt to rid of my dark, course arm pit hair.</li>
            <li> One down side of this product is it is awkward to hold</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate and broke down to purchase the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual</li>
            <li> Also, some of hairs never regrow and some regrow very slowly.  </li>
            <li> with a little help from numb master</li>
            <li> so I either get razor bumps or a really bad skin reaction which is not very desirable.</li>
            <li> It is not as painful as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> A friend who also has tried a few depilatory like devices sold me on this one as the least painful of whats out on the market.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noisy to operate, and if you&#x27;re used to epilating, the hair removal isn&#x27;t painful.  </li>
            <li> After a few months or so of shaving, I got horrible red bumps all over my legs</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll get red bumps that look nasty for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I believe this was the result of the hair that was broken by the device as opposed to being pulled from the roots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice broken hair etc.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating both for about 3 weeks now, and the pain has decreased dramatically as well as hair thickness and growth time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not happy with this product, and I&#x27;ll list a number of reasons:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The hair does thin out and its appearance becomes lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was worse.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> I guess there is no happy medium with this type of product</li>
            <li> Plus everyone&#x27;s pain threshold is completely different, so please don&#x27;t ever base your purchase on that sort of feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say maybe 5% of the hair is broken or missed when epilating and I&#x27;ve come to accept this.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, it would take two hours to charge.</li>
            <li> this ISN&#x27;T irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> Poor customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing will blare at you which is a tad annoying, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use this on secret garden.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my back because I hate shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> This was way worse than both.</li>
            <li> and i was tired of shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> Leave some stubs behind.</li>
            <li> To make things worse</li>
            <li> So the thing stops rotating when it hits the broken tooth.</li>
            <li> You could see them but he would have to remove that thin skin covering it to get it out.</li>
            <li> But since we had got quite addicted to being hairless (and didn&#x27;t have to run out to be threaded every 3 weeks), we decided to buy another so that my daughter and I would each have one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really great for places like the knees</li>
            <li> hair removal time has decreased under my arms, but on my legs, I still spend about 10 or so minutes on each leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken bones and sometimes driven myself to the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Emjoi I purchased in 1989 and decided it was time to give those fingers a rest as they must be tired.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving and have tried several epilators.</li>
            <li> The draw string bag is a poor afterthought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN AN REVIEW BEFORE, BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS SO UNUSUAL ND SHOCKING TO ME</li>
            <li> IVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I had mine for approximately three years and the power cord just stopped working.</li>
            <li> got broken after 4-5 months of use...</li>
            <li> I get a lot of annoying facial hairs - I&#x27;m a hairy person, no way aroun it.  </li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t work on thin hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also completely worthless about my chin and upper lip</li>
            <li> My poor leg looks like it has a 5o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> REALLY FRUSTRATING..  </li>
            <li> but I got tired,</li>
            <li> it then decided to buy this one for the speed, now is broken</li>
            <li> actually I use it for my underarms, bikini line, and the annoying peach fuzz mustache too.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t pick up thin and and finer hair.</li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY SOLD THIS PRODUCT UNDER FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 rating only because it does remove the surface hair, though painfully slowly and sometimes very painfully.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to any women who are sick of shaving all the time and hate the rough stubble feeling when hair starts to grow back after shaving.</li>
            <li> And I started shaving every once in a while for the past few months, and I had a few millimeters of growth on my legs at worst 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;happy place&amp;#34; looked like the skin of a raw chicken.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit faster and and is slightly less painful than the optima.</li>
            <li> /&gt;72 tweezer head makes the job go quicker and less painful.  </li>
            <li> Those will be less painful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve waxed before, I think that epilating is definitely less painful because it doesn&#x27;t grab the skin.</li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;ve noticed it gets less painful each time.</li>
            <li> However, I did find the Emojoi considerably less painful than the Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was noticeably less painful.</li>
            <li> the less painful it is.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s actually less painful than waxing and a lot easier to use</li>
            <li> It was much less painful</li>
            <li> The Emjoy Epilator is less painful and faster</li>
            <li> This is a brutal way to remove hair from the back.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but not so bad that it would make me stop using this.</li>
            <li> little painful, but you get use to it.</li>
            <li> A little painful</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve probably had your share of struggles with painful razors, messy creams, and sticky waxes.</li>
            <li> I hated epilating, it became such a chore</li>
            <li> But because of a terrible experience with the old &amp;#34;epilady&amp;#34; of the 1990&#x27;s I was literally terrified to try to epilate.  </li>
            <li> If that starts to become uncomfortable, move to the other side of the area and come at it from that side, a 1/4 inch at a time...sort of like cutting grass!  </li>
            <li> I tried this epilator (I have not used other models or brands) because shaving can be annoying.  </li>
            <li> When i do this, it sometimes scrapes my skin raw, which is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> and I must say I was a little disappointed in this one.  </li>
            <li> From the neckline to the bottom of my pecs was painful, But very tolerable (I&#x27;d give it a 1-2 from 1-10, 10 being very painful).</li>
            <li> and I used to itch really bad after shaving, but ever since I&#x27;ve been using this epilator, I&#x27;ve had no more itching on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have thought about buying one of these devices in the past, but it just seemed like it might be too painful for me.</li>
            <li> My friends all tried it as well and after making one of them bleed pretty bad, we decided it was my worst purchase.</li>
            <li> Cons: no light, no hair receptacle, no shaver head included, can&#x27;t get to small areas very easily, especially difficult on knees.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in its short life span.</li>
            <li> and I hate the mess and inconvenience of using a shower</li>
            <li> The cord is a little annoying, but you do get a lot of power</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you are waiting for the hairs to grow out a bit before the Emjoi can grab them.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to shave because I get such terrible razor burn and break outs</li>
            <li> tried doing my upperlip but failed, either i am not using it well</li>
            <li> There was one expensive epilator that burned out after one use.</li>
            <li> This became tiresome as you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Anddd you don&#x27;t have to worry about the expensive razor refills either.</li>
            <li> having shaved all my life, it being the easiest and least painful option for hair removal.</li>
            <li> I looked at instruction manuals, on-line recommendations for use, and perused the reviews here on Amazon hoping to find out what I was doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It made the scratching worse when I shaved!</li>
            <li> It seems totally random or luck that I get any at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is the worst depilating product I have ever owned or tried, so I&#x27;ll definitely have to return this item.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it is difficult to see</li>
            <li> a week later I had horrible prickly stubble.   </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,having used the epilady some twenty  years ago.</li>
            <li> That combined with how expensive this thing is is the reason for the 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst ever, I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Arms are the least painful.</li>
            <li> I was wrong as I have used this epilator</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I ever purchased this Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Even if it did, the way that it is set up makes it terrible for bony areas such as the knee, ankle, and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you make the investment.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt it was weird.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This product is awful - tried to get my money back - to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive they had become.  </li>
            <li> Slow painful and didnt even get all the hair.</li>
            <li> , I know this product is expensive and lots of people depend on these reviews when deciding whether to purchase things or not.</li>
            <li> As often as my wife used it that is not impressive.</li>
            <li> but it was expensive at $60-$75 a pop.</li>
            <li> Also, despite the two rotating heads, I have to try epilating in all directions to get the finnest or the random isolated hairs</li>
            <li> and this is the easiest and least painful one of three I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and I have to admit that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still,  I am under-whelmed &amp; would not recommend this fairly expensive product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t pick everything up in one pass...but that still doesn&#x27;t matter to me because of the time savings and ease of use.</li>
            <li> WRONG.    </li>
            <li> I bought this one instead of my Braun on which the battery failed after about a year.</li>
            <li> Maybe there was something wrong with the one I received.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work so well.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, this failed in both accounts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all.</li>
            <li> , I steeled myself for what I knew would be mind-blowing pain and proceeded to epilate, and it was... uncomfortable?</li>
            <li> i was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I returned the item.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say this claim is a blaitent lie.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it can be so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> (it annoyed everyone!).</li>
            <li> so I may have had unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Certainly uncomfortable; Thusly I have yet to proceed to all the Bikini Area yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary if you have never used an epilator before, but it works so well,</li>
            <li> Much hysterical laughing on his part later</li>
            <li> I did some \\&quot;tender\\&quot; areas that I thought would be uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> is that for the price (all these devices are too expensive)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m wrong here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to get your under arms done.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use it on my face, but I don&#x27;t think it should be too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I sadly got it caught in a piece of clothing and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned numerous epilator products and this worked the worst.  </li>
            <li> To my amazement, my bikini line was the least painful area I epilated.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I did anything wrong, it just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I did anything wrong, it just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> WTF</li>
            <li> I consider it an expensive electric razor for legs.  </li>
            <li> so I stop using it, not Good!!</li>
            <li> Seems unfair to charge shipping to customers to return something when we are sent a defective product.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with the Emjoi, so I can recommend it.the south</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with the Emjoi, so I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every epilator is going to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> BUT it is broken now!</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG...</li>
            <li> It is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, both my legs broke out in red bumps all over; it looked like some horrible disease.</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 4 months, and then it started to fail.</li>
            <li> no more waxing -  Emjoi away  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I broke 1 after 2 years and accidentally used one with the wrong power in Greece.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> -I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I changed from 5 stars to 3 stars due to poor customer service :( :(</li>
            <li> I used to shave and i am in my late 20&#x27;s, i was sick of shaving.</li>
            <li> I am very thin</li>
            <li> and I seriously feel like they are way smoother then waxing or shaving!!  </li>
            <li> The Emoji is so much less painful that the Braun!</li>
            <li> It is very expensive for the poor performance.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely shocked at how poorly this product performed.</li>
            <li> absolutely disappointing for something that expensive.</li>
            <li> but for those of us who are sick and tired of shaving, it does the trick.</li>
            <li> but I had it worst with other brands</li>
            <li> It would have avoided the use of that dreaded nair and other horrible products.</li>
            <li> This is annoying because you can&#x27;t use it wherever you want in the house with out something ridiculous like an extension cord.</li>
            <li> It was truly a horrible mess.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is the least painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever used though!</li>
            <li> That is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> The cord can be somewhat awkward...  </li>
            <li> I would suggest used 5% Lidocaine numbing cream to numb the area before using it.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for 2hrs (because i feel asleep), but 1hr is sufficient to numb the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that would cause me to scream.  </li>
            <li> I have even started using it under my arms which I was always afraid to do.</li>
            <li> ,maybe I am just chicken</li>
            <li> The epilator itself sometimes ends up cutting hair instead of pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> that epilators are sort of painful or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> i received the box i was thinking returning it before trying because i was afraid of the pain, but i couldn&#x27;t, so</li>
            <li> I started epilating because shaving was a dangerous act for me since I couldn&#x27;t wear my glasses in the shower.  </li>
            <li> You would be crazy not to use these.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to be in pain.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is crazy painful!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid to.</li>
            <li> After that it started cutting and snagging hairs from all directions ...</li>
            <li> my blow dryer (just in case I got cold, and to reopen my pores without making the hair</li>
            <li> I was really afraid to try the chest hairs</li>
            <li> Then I had a crazy idea to try it again.  </li>
            <li> i would get cold, as i started to use it</li>
            <li> I am hairy unfortunately and its painful no matter what i use honey wax, brazilian wax or epilator....</li>
            <li> Having coarse/thick leg hair is really annoying and no matter how close the blade would be to my skin, i could still see the roots of the hairs under than thin layer.</li>
            <li> but waxing was just getting too expensive!</li>
            <li> and I secretly call this the \\&quot;Bush Hog!! )  </li>
            <li> thats scary!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, if you have never waxed or epilated before, it will hurt like a mad man.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed that it does work any faster.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I have gotten some laser hair removal but its so expensive!</li>
            <li> so i was so skeptical of what to buy !   </li>
            <li> and I usually feel horrible after waxing and even after using creams.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it (weird!).</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get the hair and just ended up damaging the skin</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about trying anything else.</li>
            <li> or it can prove to be very difficult.</li>
            <li> Take you time and take a break if it gets very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I hated it, I hated the stubble and the shadow that always showed up everyday.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> so I just whip out this bad boy and GONE.</li>
            <li> so I just whip out this bad boy and GONE.</li>
            <li> When I read reviews for this model and others and saw people who gave any of them a bad rating for the pain they caused, I scoffed and wondered what they thought ripping hair out of the skin would feel like</li>
            <li> Too bad the product quits at that</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pathetically bad in the bikini area where you have curves to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have had a bad experience with a epilator, try this one.</li>
            <li> With time the pain will not seem that bad.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad to do.</li>
            <li> Too bad it turned out to be a marketing gimmic.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that after applying baby powder (which I recommend to anyone epilating) and waiting over night, the bumps were not as bad.</li>
            <li> I always get in grown hairs bad every time I wax, or shave.</li>
            <li> With this I don&#x27;t get them nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> But you get used to it, and it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> Well it is not that bad</li>
            <li> Arms are not that bad to do either (maybe a 1-2 from 1-10)</li>
            <li> And if I didn&#x27;t shave every day I had stubble, it was that bad.  </li>
            <li> I also tried it on my legs which wasn&#x27;t as bad as my bikini area</li>
            <li> Worked so badly I returned it.</li>
            <li> I think the discomfort level isn&#x27;t as bad with Emjoi, for some reason.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad, that it pulled skin from the roots of the hair on my stomach, which is why it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> the bad pain once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bad pain once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad thing about it is that it leaves shave bumps on your legs.</li>
            <li> I have a medium pain tolerance but to read some reviews that state, &amp;#34;not bad, feels like a pinch</li>
            <li> and I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as people</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad, and the ache/sting didn&#x27;t go away when I was done.  </li>
            <li> it has a pinching touch on legs but its not that bad.</li>
            <li> i feel bad throwing this emjoi in the trash</li>
            <li> the bad -</li>
            <li> the bad -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding when I said it was painful though.</li>

            <li> Not as painful as I thought it would be.  </li>

            <li> and it doesnt work... :[</li>

            <li> The in-growns are annoying but not the fault of the product.  </li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate this thing.</li>
            <li> I think it helps to use exfoliating gloves in the shower since I&#x27;ve seen alot of people recommend exholiating before using the epilator to avoid nasty and painful bumps and ingrownn hairs.</li>
            <li> cause it was that bad!</li>

            <li> Sorry Guys that&#x27;s The truth !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I tried to use it on my sideburns and I broke out HORRIBLY.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;ve threaded before, I also broke out terribly.</li>
            <li> It looks gawd awful when wearing shorts.</li>
            <li> That was the worst pain in the universe</li>

            <li> customer service is horrible.</li>
            <li> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: horrible unflexible head that wont make contact with your skin, heating up and burning you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> With the Emjoi, I don&#x27;t need to use the cream and it is not even painful!!</li>
            <li> As a person with terrible eczema on my legs, I have struggled for YEARS to find a solution to my leg hair removal problem.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> I ended up with terrible scrapes on my skin that co-</li>
            <li> So, I tried this because I kept getting awful ingrown hairs (YUCK) from waxing.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE MY HAIR GREW OUTRAGEOUS.</li>
            <li> , this is the worst problem from this, but is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dual opposed heads is a terrible idea.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t seem to feel the yanking of your hairs quite as terribly.</li>
            <li> I used to get terrible &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; after shaving but not with the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible for it!</li>
            <li> It is terrible, grabs no hair and takes forever.</li>
            <li> My legs LOOK and FEEL terrible.  </li>
            <li> My legs LOOK and FEEL terrible.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Even for me, after all those years of waxing, epilating ALL the hairs at once is really terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this emjoi!  I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi for years now and this is hands down the best one!!  I use it on my entire leg, my bikini area and under my arms.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, which I love.  It also  does the job much faster than previous models, bonus!  I can&#x27;t recommend this Emjoi enough.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> it works great and effectively as advertized.</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell! Tried once and never used it again!</li>
            <li> Ok.  I have been using this epilator now for over 4 months and can tell you that it is wonderful.  I use it under my arms, my entire legs and the girlie areas.  Yes, the girly area hurt like a mo-fo the first time, but just like other reviews claimed, the pain is less the second time, significantly less the third time and pretty much non-existent thereafter.  My legs remain good for 2 weeks before they need another run with the epilator. And I have noticed that the hair is growing back much slower.  I am hoping/expecting that in time, less and less of it will be making an appearance.</li>
            <li> I finally received my Epilator after I was supposedly to have received it. It was delivered to a different address on my street and Amazon insinuated some type of fraud which I feel was directed to me.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and and purchased this AP-18 epilator because it was rated number #1. I really like it and I have been using epilators for many years. I have no pain but it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as I expected. I had to use my old epilator to remove the hairs that this one just would not remove. They weren&#x27;t just short hairs either. on a scale of 1 to 10 I rate it a 9. I think its great. I would recommend this to my friends but you definately need to make sure someone has to sign for their orders because it was not delivered to my house and it was a week or so after Amazon informed me it was delivered before I received it. Had the people not brought it to me I would have been out quite a bit of money!!!! I didn&#x27;t even know the people so I was lucky.</li>
            <li> The Emojoi AP-18 is an absolutely amazing spilator and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high end epilator - worth the money. Secondly, I just wanted to point out that my epilator arrived 2 days later than it was suppose to and the seller more than made up for the delay by offering superior customer service and a small refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for the quality of the machine and customer service.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to epilate as often as I shaved. I do still get ingrown hairs but overall its worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this device! I use it on my armpits and legs. The one I like it most on is my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I tried to use it on my sideburns and I broke out HORRIBLY. I looked that I had a disease. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the Emjoi&#x27;s fault at all, though. Whenever I&#x27;ve threaded before, I also broke out terribly. So, if you&#x27;re like me and removing hairs from your face results in breakouts, probably just don&#x27;t use there.</li>
            <li> Bought this epilator in february and used it weekly until a gear in it broke about 2 weeks ago. Very disappointed in its short life span. Even when it was working I found it broke off more hairs than it pulled, the large head made it difficult to get into tight areas such as my pits and bikinis line. Also it could never effectively remove hair from my knees or shins. Always felt stubbly afterward. Recently bought a much cheaper epilator made by philips and find it to be much more effective. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible, I used a Braun silk epil 7 before this and was 100x better. This one th charger didn&#x27;t work, nor did it remove any hair. Waist of money.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research before deciding to buy an epilator in general, and then before choosing this epilator.  I chose it because of the amount of tweezers - I didn&#x27;t want to take a long time to epilate and I wanted every hair gone.  The product was loud and painful, but I already knew that going in, based on my research.  It did well removing the hair and the pain did get better over time.  Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.  The only real issue I had was with in-grown hairs.  This may be caused by inefficient exfoliation on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, last week, it stopped working.  The gears are somehow not connecting.  The motor makes the right sound, but the tweezers don&#x27;t spin at all.  I checked my warranty.  It is good for a year.  I checked my purchase date - a year and 2 weeks.  I gave this product 3 stars because it did what I needed it to do, but only for one year.  I will be purchasing another epilator - I will never go back to shaving - but I think I&#x27;ll try the Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa.  We&#x27;ll see if this helps with ingrown hairs.  I am worried about how long it will take to epilate, since I will be going down in number of tweezers, but I just can&#x27;t risk another chance on the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t have the time for a wax. It is so loud. It makes me worry that my neighbors can hear it and wonder what is going on in my apartment. I can&#x27;t handle the pain it causes on my arms and legs, but I use it mostly on my underarms and bikini line. I hope to one day become tolerant of the pain! When I can use it on my legs, it makes shaving wonderful. Some of the hairs break, so I have to shave with it. However, I only need to shave every few days. It works perfectly on my underarms and bikini line. Ingrown hairs are about the same as waxing. Not too bad. Overall, I like the product, but I wish it was quieter.</li>
            <li> Doc told me not to shave for a while, so I thought I would upgrade to a newer and better epilator than the one I had because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m willing to attempt to pull off the hairy look.  I had a cheap Emjoi one that I&#x27;ve had for a while but it didn&#x27;t work great because it didn&#x27;t keep its charge long enough.  I checked the reviews online and this seems to be one of the best out there right now.  I really like it and am happy with it.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!TORTURE!!! literally pulls the hair out. Some model said you get used to it but noooooo way. Shaving is fine with me. Do yourself a favor and do not try this thing!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone else and they have had no problem with this. Still working as brand new. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator.  I have heard so many great reviews on this product and how it has the MOST tweezers of any epilator out there, so i decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  I have to say, I&#x27;m not super impressed with this epilator (esp seeing how much it costs!). Yes it does cover more surface area since it&#x27;s \\&quot;bigger\\&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job in removing my underarm hairs.  I do find that it hurts less than my Remington Smooth and Silky to use tho...but that could be becuz i don&#x27;t think it removes ALL the hair by the roots.  I also find I need to epilate my underarms EVERY week when i use this.  Whereas with my other one, I can get away with 1.5x a wk or even 2 weeks wo epilating.  Also it doesn&#x27;t really come with much.  Just the epilator itself and a cheap bag and it costs $100+ (regular price).  Give me a break!  Won&#x27;t be repurchasing this when it breaks but i&#x27;m open to trying another cheaper model by this same brand.</li>
            <li> Does not take up all the hair, even after going over it again and again. Even if they hairs are short, long, fine or coarse. This product did not work for me. It sucks that you can&#x27;t get your money back also. I&#x27;d rather wax.</li>
            <li> I received this item today and just tried it. Now, I must say that I had to wait a little longer than anticipated for the delivery, but in the end it was worth it, so I could experiment the tool on &amp;#34;overdue&amp;#34; hair, and I was extremely happy! This thing does not hurt at all! I could not believe it! I am used to epilators, I have been using them for a long time, now, but I always dread the due date because I have a hard time tolerating the prickly feeling of the hairbeing pulled, especially on my most sensitive areas that are the thighs and the knees.. Well, I was pleasantly surprised when I operated the new Emagine on all those area and the only feeling I had was that of a pleasant massage! Now, I want to be totally honest: it does not really pull every single hair at the first shot, but even if I have to go over an area multiple times, who cares? It is just sooo pleasant! In the end my legs and arms are smooth and the redness disappeared in less than 20 minutes! I look forward the next time I have to use it again, and I don&#x27;t fear it anymore! Incredible, really! And I thought that two heads would have doubled the pain.. what a wonderful surprise instead!</li>
            <li> Ive had this for about a year and a half now. Still works great. This is the first epilator that i have used so i cant compare it to other models. It feels like a prickling sensation all over. I have waxed my legs a few times and used to do my own brazillian wax with the Bliss kit. I would say my pain tolerance is pretty high. its easy to use, especially over time as your leg hair starts to thin out. I loved it for my bikini line and other sensitive areas because it was easy and no mess like waxing, but it would leave it with the worst ingrown hairs ever despite exfoliating, ingrown hair pads etc etc. I became kind of self conscious after awhile because the ingrown hairs left brown spots after :( They faded on thier own after a while though. I just use this for my legs now which im pretty happy with. especially now since im pregnant, with no energy to shave my legs, and being 7 months pregnant its not the easiest task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best usage for me to prevent ingrowns:&lt;br /&gt;Legs, armipts.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate the night before&lt;br /&gt;Use before showering&lt;br /&gt;Shave after with razor no more than 4 blades(to get the dead layer of skin off and any other missed hair)&lt;br /&gt;Wipe down leg with witch hazel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found shaving after left me with less ingrown hairs and left my legs incredibly smooth</li>
            <li> It performed as advertised.  It does leave the area red and sensitive for a short time.  My advice is to use the epilator prior to bedtime and liberally cream the area.  Make sure you pull the skin tight while pulling the hair.  My area is smooth and has been completly hairless for 4 weeks.  However, you need to liberaly cream everyday.  its worth the price not to shave daily!</li>
            <li> I am a male (cyclist) with course body hair, and this was my first time using an epilator, so my review will be base on the manufacture claims, against its performance, and targeting other first time Epilator users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: 72 Tweezer Heads for Fast, Long-Lasting Results&lt;br /&gt;Result: I was expected the one pass as promised, that did not happened, in fact I needed a few passes in some areas to achieve the desired results. This would be a mojor issue if a user cannot tolerate the discomfort assosiciated with the process.&lt;br /&gt;Claim: Antimicrobial Protection&lt;br /&gt;Result: Is getting bacterial injections from using epilators an issue? I had no sign of infection prior, and none now..&lt;br /&gt;Claim: User-Friendly Operation&lt;br /&gt;Result: It could not get easier, extremely easy to use.... Not so easy to keep engaging however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; is used quite often in the product description, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; is relative, based on your ability to cope with discomfort, I read the reviews and as such expected some pain/discomfort, from having my hair pulled from the roots. I believe I would have been better prepared mentally, if I the manufacturer did not use \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; so often. As a first time user, I hoped considering the discomfort associated, the process would be fast, and long lasting. For me it was not fast, it took an episode of \\&quot;Game of Thrones\\&quot; to completed both legs, this included discomfort breaks. It will get the job done, but not quite as claimed. I will post an update on how long the results last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product, I could not see any hair left, but I could feel the stubble left behind. I believe this was the result of the hair that was broken by the device as opposed to being pulled from the roots. If your desired result is for smooth finish this will be a significant flaw. I wanted to hair removed and it was,, I did however, because of manufacture&#x27;s claim expect a more smoothend result (again take my hair type into consideration, maybe softer/thinner hair will break less..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair growth was noticeable after five days. I had to epilate again after seven days. My \\&quot;Long Lasting Results\\&quot; is one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was much less course when it regrew (compared to shaving)and epilating this time resulted in significantly less discomfort. There still is the stubble, and there was more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the product, I wanted my hair removed and it was, just not as smoothly, gentle, and long lasting as the manufacturer&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi seems to just break off most of the hair.  It does pull out some,  I did let the hair grow out before I used it.  Have not had it very long and the hair has come back as soon as a few days.  Will continue to use and hope it does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not super impressed with this.  I like the plug-in aspect, because it never loses power, and I like how powerful it is.  But I don&#x27;t feel like it does a good job of getting every hair, even the thicker ones! I felt like I had to go over each area 3 or 4 times to make sure I got everything, which defeats the purpose of having multiple heads and a powerful motor.  It&#x27;s supposed to get it all right away! Plus, there were a lot of finer hairs left behind, and it was difficult to do my underarms.  All in all, I honestly think it&#x27;s easier and quicker to go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Use the YouTube recommendation of my friend who lives in the U.S., Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator  was only be a top choice. It is solid and the two tweezers epilation roles effectively. I admit that my girlfriend gave me a good tip. And the AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator I enter I like it. I do not give I love it because I only had to buy a power supply for the European market to me. Would be nice if this realization transpires on AMAZON and potential customers in the EU be informed when buying it. My girlfriend is not at fault here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to write this review! Ok, first off I&#x27;ve had a nightmare dealing with shaving, especially inbetween my upper thigh area and back thigh. I get ingrown hairs, red bumps...you name it, it was very unsightly. It looks gawd awful when wearing shorts. I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how it makes me feel. I look down and that&#x27;s all I can see...and I think that&#x27;s all anyone else can see when they look at me (even my 8yr old asks me what&#x27;s wrong with my legs and why they are all red etc). I&#x27;ve tried creams (which just burn like heck and eat my skin), I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of razors. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of diff shaving creams, plucking, etc. I even looked into laser hair removal...but for $2600 and the uncertainty that the hair could possibly grow back, yeah I wasn&#x27;t going for it. Then I came across this and I read the reviews so I instantly purchased it. Took 3 days for it to ship and OMG I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it. I had about 2 days of hair growth on my legs when I first tried it. My first reaction was... well, I was gritting my teeth and ready to scream, but as I saw this little contraption spinning around and ripping my leg hairs out, I sucked up the pain and pushed forth. I&#x27;m not kidding when I said it was painful though. I&#x27;d rather go through another child birth than that! Afterwards my legs were red and where the hair was pulled out swollen. I was bummed because it looked like how my thighs normally do. But then I read that this can be a normal reaction because your legs/skin aren&#x27;t used to this type of treatment. So a couple days went by and lo and behold the redness went away and there was minimal hair (I could see where I missed a few spots or where shorter hair was starting to grow to the length where I could epilate it). It is now not painful at all to use on my legs, nor do I get the red bumpy reaction like I initially got. I&#x27;ve tried this on my ummmm nether region/bikini area and again, it was a teeth clencher the first time around but since then the hair takes FOREVER to grow back (standing ovation) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad either when I do have to go over it. I tried my under arms and that lasted a whole 15 seconds, LOL. So far the most painful area...I&#x27;ve since tried my under arms again and was much more successful. And can I just tell you that I&#x27;ve yet to shave my under arms and it&#x27;s been a month!! I&#x27;ll get like 5-10 hairs that I either missed or couldn&#x27;t get inititally so I just whip out this bad boy and GONE. I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and even though I&#x27;ve had some painful experiences, it&#x27;s been bareable and the results are by far unbelievable. I also want to add that I prefer the plug-in opposed to the rechargeable only because it does take a bit of time...I think I&#x27;d be recharging non-stop just to finish one leg.the hair takes FOREVER to grow back (standing ovation) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad either when I do have to go over it.

            <li> Once in a while, you come upon a product that is a total game-changer.  This epilator is one of them.  I have fair skin and dark, coarse hair that grows fast.  I was shaving 3-4 times a week to stay completely smooth, especially during the summer months.  Even then, I could still see some dark stubble on my inner thighs and under my arms.  Since I switched to the epilator, I do a some minor spot-checking once a week.  I could probably go two weeks.  The hair grows in lighter and finer.  Gone is the rash that I would often get from shaving frequently.  I am also hoping that after a few years of this, I will do permanent damage to the hair follicles and they will cease to grow new hairs at all. I am really frugal and strapped for time.  I could not justify going to a salon or spa and spending a ton of money and time getting waxed, especially when I have fast-growing hair.  This is cheap in comparison and it takes me 45 minutes max to do my arms, legs, and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: This will hurt the first time you do it.  I consider myself to have a decent threshold of pain, and it took some serious teeth-gritting and deep breathing exercises to get through it, especially under the arms. However, it becomes less and less painful with each go, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt now at all.  Just accept that it&#x27;s a one-time deal IF you keep up with it, and that the results will be TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The product does rip hair out, as it advertises.  I used it on my chest.  It took me a few days of doing bit by bit, because it is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised as being able to rip out 1 mm long hairs.  That was not my experience.  It has trouble pulling shorter hairs...  which is a bit of an issue.  As the hair grows back, it creates stubble, which nobody really wants.  Unfortunately you are waiting for the hairs to grow out a bit before the Emjoi can grab them.  The stubble is not as bad as from razor shaving though, since (I am guessing) the hairs are growing back at different rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingrown hairs are also an issue.  It says you get less ingrown hairs using this product.  I don&#x27;t really notice a reduction in ingrown hairs vs. shaving.  I think your skin and hair-type are the greatest factors for predicting ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair takes longer to grow back than shaving.  It does not hurt nearly as much now, as during my initial use.  That is likely because it is pulling out less hairs now (as hair grows back in in stages).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will continue to use this device.  The stubble, and having to wait for hair to get long enough to pull out, are annoying factors.  Overall this devices does what it claims to do - rips out hair.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my Emjoi AP-18 Dual Opposed 72 hair remover.  It gets almost all of the hairs and you can use it anywhere on your body.  It leaves little bumps for a few hours but the next day your skin is smooth.  A lot smoother than the other epilator I had and gets more hairs.  I have to use it about once a week because my hair grows fast and I don&#x27;t wait until all the hair is the same length before tweezing it.  Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with this model and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hates razor stubble or the pain of waxing because it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, unless you&#x27;re really sensitive.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal since the original Epilady came out.  I figured, with 72 tweezers, this was bound to be more effective and faster than models I&#x27;ve used since.  First of all, if you follow the directions and move the machine in the direction of hair growth, nothing happens.  So if you go in the opposite direction (as if you were shaving), it clearly breaks off the hairs instead of pulls them by the root.  Second, after using Emagine&#x27;s two rows of tweezers on my thighs I can say they are more irritated than they&#x27;ve ever been with epilation. It is also simply too big to get anywhere near the bikini line. Finally, what I&#x27;m left with is a surface of stubble rather than smooth skin.  I do NOT recommend this product and wish I had kept the packaging so I could return it.</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator in the last 20 years. So far it is the fastest although not quite as fast as I&#x27;d hoped. It is a little heavier and bigger than I had thought it would be so slipping it in a carry on takes up quite a bit of room. Over all, it seems to be well built and will hopefully last as long as my old Emjoi and Braun.</li>
            <li> I am unable to shave because I get such terrible razor burn and break outs so I have had to turn to MANY other hair removal methods. For the past year I was getting my legs waxed every 3 weeks, which was getting quite expensive. In the past I had used other epilators but they were painful and took forever to remove all the hairs so I was hesitant to try another one but waxing was just getting too expensive! I did a lot of research before I purchased my Emagine and I am so glad that I ended up choosing this one! Since it has almost twice as many tweezers as other epilators it works a lot faster and hurts a lot less. In fact I dont even feel it anymore now that I have been using it for a few months. I will admit the first time I turned it on it was a lot louder and moved a lot faster than other epilators I have used and/or seen in action so I was a bit scared but once I used it I feel in love! It takes a third of the time it would if I were to wax my legs, it doesnt make a mess, and I can use it on just about any part of my body! When I travel I am able to take it with me, and it only takes a few minutes when I just need a touch up.  The epilator paid for itself in less than 2 uses and is a durable, reliable, and portable method of hair removal. I would recommend exfoliating your skin regularly and using a good lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I owned the Emjoi Optima first, for 6 years, and loved it. It finally died on me recently, so I purchased this newer model. Overall it works pretty much as promised. It seems a bit faster and and is slightly less painful than the optima. It somehow feels smoother over the skin. Ergonomically much better than the Optima too, so you can get a better grip on it.     My only issue with it so far is that for the sensitive underarm area, sometimes I&#x27;ve had to run it over more than twice to get a few remaining stubborn hairs. When i do this, it sometimes scrapes my skin raw, which is extremely painful. It&#x27;s not often that this happens, but when it does, it really sucks. I&#x27;ve taken to trying to tweeze the remaining stubborn hairs instead of running the epilator over it too many times. Which is fine but a pain in the behind. That said, most of the time and on legs it&#x27;s totally fine.    As an aside, before buying this one, I tried a Braun Silk Epil - the only model I could find in Germany, where I&#x27;m living now. That one pulled my skin into the tweezers, basically pinching it and stopping it from working. So utterly painful. I will stick with Emjois from now on!</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday (from my wish list). I&#x27;d been waxing so I was no stranger to pain. And of course this hurts. I actually resent the instruction manual and product information describing the feeling as \\&quot;prickling, tingling\\&quot;. It&#x27;s PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;So when I opened it and looked at it and plugged it in and turned it on, I was terrified. (This is my first ever epilator.) It took me 20 minutes to work up the nerve to apply it to my skin. I started on my legs. One leg took me a long time but ONLY because it was my first time. The next leg was very quick. It does miss hairs but my way of remedying that was to go over those from different directions. It advises that you use this in the direction of hair growth and that&#x27;s what I did for the most part. However, when I had leftover hairs still visible, I went up, from left, from right and as soon as I developed a nice rhythm with it, it took no time at all and my legs were immaculate. Hair free. I did my armpits on the second setting. That was the worst pain in the universe but after I did them both, I was SO PLEASED. They were bare and smoother than I ever remember them being! When it comes to armpits, shaving leaves stubble and itchiness. (I&#x27;ve always hated shaving them.) Creams gave me chemical burns and the hair would still come back just as soon as shaving. Waxing was hopeless. The hair grows from so many directions, that I&#x27;d always have to go over them up to four times (soooo painful) and there&#x27;d STILL be leftover hairs! This thing took them in one painful yet satisfying fell swoop. I was making everyone feel their smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I have MRSA and bought this based on the silver technology.  The tweezers DO NOT pull as efficiently as I hoped nor does this thing leave my legs soft. My legs are all stubly (if that&#x27;s a word) and I would rather let my hair grow out rather than feel my prickly legs!  Bummer... I was hoping this epilator would be my \\&quot;cure\\&quot; to shaving since I can&#x27;t any longer... I will keep searching for the right epilator to make my legs soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This epilator caught my eye as i first saw it on sale on [...]. I did not purchase it there as i found a way better price here on Amazon than anywhere else. I bought mine for $78.90 plus i got free super saver shipping! What a deal. I am used to waxing and all that so this wasn&#x27;t a very big shock when i first used this. I would compare it to almost, little shocks. When you have a moderate amount of hair it obviously hurts more but the more you remove, the less and less painful it is. I actually like it! I want to use it everywhere! My legs feel very nice but not 100% smooth, as i shaved before and i heard hair grows in cycles so there&#x27;s more hair coming in. But I&#x27;m sure as i use this more and more the hair will grow back a lot slower. I definitely think this is worth it. Why waste money on something that doesn&#x27;t work well? I say spend a little extra and get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient. Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using.  Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.  I found that the braun broke the hair off, the emjoi  pulls hair out at the root which leaves my legs feeling smoother longer.    Specific areas and pain...the hard facts    Legs:  The first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt. I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.    underarms:  does a fabulous job- just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.    fine hair on arms and stomach:  Worked great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the braun and only required 2 passes.    Bikini area:  Emjoi produced the smoothest result.  This area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...eye watering pain, not screaming in pain. Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting. I had tried this before with the braun a few times and the pain had been so unbearable I had to stop.     I do like the braun features of the light and that it is cordless; however, the power that the cord adds to the emjoi makes being tethered to the wall not so bad. (the cord is fairly long.)    I would buy this one over the braun any day....the time I am saving is astounding!    FYI, any epilator you get will be easier on your skin than shaving - shaving causes your skin to lose its elasticity. Also, the epilator will never cut you or get dull!</li>
            <li> My left leg was left with irritated red bumps for WEEKS that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Maybe I&#x27;m just too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work :( I don&#x27;t mind the noise or pain (although it&#x27;s not exactly a plus) but the fact that I don&#x27;t even get smooth skin means this is NOT worth it for me....</li>
            <li> Tell ya what, I was hoping this was better than what I was led to believe. There was not a lot of pain with the item. I did not like the fact that when the hairs start to pretrube out there were bumps on my legs, something I do not get with regular shaving with the razor.    Bottom line, save your money and stick to using a razor!</li>
            <li> I was very enthusiastic about this product, at first I thought it worked very well. I used this product on my legs, underarm and bikini area. But then I needed to use it ever 2-3 days because of stubles.    there is no way that my hair grew within 2-3 days if they were \\&quot;plucked\\&quot; as claimed in the terminology of an epilator. But instead it cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull from the root as I have examined after each use.    I love this product even though it doesn&#x27;t completely pull every hair out from the root. But I wished that it pulled every single hair from the root so that i wouldnt have to \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; every 2-3 days. It does take a while to go over an area. It can get time consuming and eventually the skin feels raw-like.</li>
            <li> I got this after using the Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle (the highest rated epilator here on Amazon) for about 1.5 years.  And although I do love the Braun, this epilator is easily 2X faster!  For me this is the biggest advantage.  Before it would take me 1-1.5 hrs to do my whole legs, but now it&#x27;s half that!  I&#x27;m so happy with it.      I&#x27;ll agree with some reviewers that say it&#x27;s almost too powerful.  I do appear to have better luck using the lower setting, it seems to get more hairs.  Also, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you do have to go over certain areas more than once.  In addition, it seems like hairs have to be a little bit longer for this one to work than for the Braun to work.  And, it is much less painful than the Braun, huge plus!    Cons: no light, no hair receptacle, no shaver head included, can&#x27;t get to small areas very easily, especially difficult on knees.  The Braun has the shaver head, and it&#x27;s easier to manage.  But, if I were to pick one, it would be the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine, hands down.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, She is still using it. Sounds to me like it is less than comfortable to use but better than others of its kind.</li>
            <li> After a year and half stopped working</li>
            <li> I spent weeks researching different epilators since this would be my first one. I am a black female who was sick of having those little spots on my legs everytime I shaved. So I decided to get this one then I saw that they had a rechargeable version of the same epilator. I wanted it but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the twenty or so dollars more. But when this one came in the mail what I recieved was not the corded epilator that you have to stay in one place stuck close to a plug because I got the RECHARGEABLE epilator for the SAME PRICE! I was so happy! IT was worth the money. This is my first epilator so I was intimadated by everyone complaining about how much it hurts you BABIES. It really dosent hurt that bad, but thats just me I guess. I think everyone was just letting that mindset of ohh its going to hurt, get to them before they used it. It is very loud it drowns out every other noise you may have going in the room. I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it and i&#x27;m still not but it pulls the hairs and leaves my legs and hairs incredibly soft. It just takes some getting used too. I think it helps to use exfoliating gloves in the shower since I&#x27;ve seen alot of people recommend exholiating before using the epilator to avoid nasty and painful bumps and ingrownn hairs.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna be the bomb because it had 72 tweezers but it&#x27;s just ok.  I have an emjoi with 32 tweezers that works just as good.  Eh, it&#x27;s alright.  It was hyped up too much on the description.   I thought that it was going to be considerably faster, but nah.</li>
            <li> The has to be the best invention in the last 500 years! It was painful on the first run, but I now just use it weekly, although I really see very little hair growth in one week, but it is far less painful. This beats shaving by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work like a combain and thorough. Best on the market.</li>
            <li> As of June, 2011, you cannot by a replacement tweezer head, and you WILL need to buy a replacement head, sooner or later. Until the parts issue is worked out, any other assessment is moot, because lacking the part, this device becomes a disposable item.</li>
            <li> I am a hair removal maniac and I have spent a lot of time and money waxing, shaving, and tweezing. I bought the Emjoi epilator after trying my sister&#x27;s Braun 5270, since the Emjoi has more tweezer heads I thought it would be quicker for removing leg hair but I was really disappointed! I tried it on the lower half of my leg which had 4 days of hair growth and even after going over the same little strip multiple times very little hair was pulled. I wanted to give it a fair shot so I tried it on my upper leg which had a couple weeks of growth and again, even with longer hair, very little was pulled,and  mostly it just broke off at the skin leaving my legs not at all smooth! I think that maybe the guard around the tweezer heads has something to do with it because it felt like I couldn&#x27;t get it to rotate close to my skin like I could with the Braun 5270. Disappointing but not a problem because Amazon is great about returns.</li>
            <li> I placed an order on 6/12/11 for a new head to replace the broken one that lasted less than a year. The site stating it was on a 10 business day backorder. On 7/5/11 I get an email telling me they \\&quot;expect\\&quot; to be able to ship it within 30 days and if I&#x27;d like to cancel my order. I decide to wait. It is now 8/1/11, nothing. The entire time the website never changed from saying \\&quot;Available for backorder ships within 10 business days\\&quot;    So almost 2 months, in the SUMMER, and no replacement parts but they have plenty of the parts to make and fill orders for complete new units. While they told me the time, I&#x27;m pretty disgusted by this. I&#x27;d expect keeping a current customer happy is more important than trying to make new ones to disappoint.     You have no choice but to buy the parts direct from Emjoi, which means you&#x27;re screwed. At this point I&#x27;m going to cancel my order and get something else [[ASIN:B00006592X Braun SE3170 Silk-épil SoftPerfection Epilator]]. If they&#x27;d like my business back they can send me a new head for free.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  I bought this to replace one I had had for over 10 years and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> + it is not painful at all, I didn&#x27;t feel anything even at that parts where I never used an epilator before  + it is MUCH faster than another models      - it is really loud device, if it matters for someone)  - maybe I&#x27;m mistaken, but it seems that it takes out longer hairs than, f.e. my previous phillips model.     I didn&#x27;t notice broken hair etc. So only bad thing - that hair should be a little bit longer than I expected to be removed.    But still a great model and way more better thn all I had before</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was brave and tried it on my underarms and it was painful. I usually shaved my underarms, I never waxed it or epilated it, so they were not used to this torture device. I had to use it a few times before getting clean underarms. I have to say that they look good, much better than shaved. I decided to used on my bikini line, I normally waxed it myself. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all compared to waxing. The reason I wanted to try this product was because I started developing razor burns, so I was hoping that epilating would reduce this problem. I read all the reviews before buying this product and a friend had great results with it. I followed all the advice given by reviewers, I used a loofah and scrub, I cleaned the epilator with alcohol after using it, etc. I was happy with the results until I used it again. I started developing more razor burns than I did with waxing. I was prescribed a 4% hydroquinone cream that didn&#x27;t seem to help me much. I decided to stop using the epilator and have decided to try laser hair removal instead. Let&#x27;s see how it goes. I also used the epilator for my legs but didn&#x27;t like it because my legs didn&#x27;t feel smooth. I went back to using my razor. In my case, I got good results only on my underarms. The results vary with skin type it seems.</li>
            <li> Its just excellent in every way. Its so good. worth the money. It solved all my problems. I dont need to wax anymore.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the first epilator I&#x27;ve purchased or used.  When I read reviews for this model and others and saw people who gave any of them a bad rating for the pain they caused, I scoffed and wondered what they thought ripping hair out of the skin would feel like (I thought this as someone who had waxed in the past) but this actually hurt more than I expected.  I bought this model because it has many more tweezers than most other models because I thought it would make the process quicker (albeit possibly more painful) despite being more expensive.  I like the idea of the epilator as hair removal lasts so much longer than shaving.  BUT I&#x27;m not convinced spending the extra money on this particular model for the extra tweezers is actually worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Did the job.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to get my epilator, unfortunately will have to send back. My hair is fine and with a bit of discomfort pain wise, it wasn&#x27;t getting much of the hair as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that has been removing my chest hair for many years (before it became commonplace), About 20 yrs ago, I wa informed that I needed to wear support hose for my leg problems,I found out that it was best to remove leg hair to have the hose stay up better.  I&#x27;ve used other brands of epilators, shaved and used hair removal creams. the Emjoi AP-18 72 Tweezer Head Epilator seems to do the best job of removing the hairs, and the hair re-growth seems to be much finer and they are removed fairly well. Sure ther are a few broken hairs, but I don&#x27;t have to repeat usage as often as with other epilators.</li>
            <li> After years of waxing, I was looking for a faster, less messy method of hair removal. I had my eye on this epilator for weeks, finally made the purchase, and was very excited to get it in the mail.  I used this epilator once, following instructions to the letter, and was disappointed. It was reputed to remove hair as short as 0.4 mm. long. My hair was noticeably longer than that, and only about 50% came away. Also, the unit leaves a mess of hair (both on your working surface and in the tweezers), and it is noisier than I had anticipated. The only good thing about it that I can think of is, it is not as painful as I thought. But then, it wasn&#x27;t removing a whole lot, either!  I had high expectations for this epilator, but now I&#x27;m back to waxing. For almost $90.00, I would expect a much better performance.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to pull out the hairs, but cuts them off maybe.  My legs are not smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator. I had a Braun one before, but this one is much quicker and removes much more hair. I also feel like it hurts less and leaves my skin less irritated. I primarily use this for my underarms and I love the results. I&#x27;ve tried using it on my legs, but I just feel like epilators are too small in general to effectively use on your legs. It takes me such a long time to get them completely clean and I feel like it&#x27;s not worth it.  To first time epilators-- yes, epilating does hurt! But it gets better with time. I&#x27;ve been using epilators for about 4 years now. The first few times I did it, I thought it was extremely painful but now I barely notice the pain when I do it. Your hair becomes a lot finer and sparser as you continue to use it. I only have to use mine every 3-5 days to have bare underarms all the time. Overall, this is a great product to use if you&#x27;re tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is our second Emjoi epilator.  We used the other one until it finally gave out from exhaustion.  So we ordered this one because it is more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you wondering just how painful an epilator is, I will spill my guts here, and you can decide for yourself if the pain is worth the end result.  Since we are on our second one, we obviously believe it&#x27;s worth it, but I won&#x27;t lie.  It smarts.  The epilator rapidly pulls out hairs by the root, leaving your legs, arms, or wherever you choose to use it, smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.  Arms and lower legs give a bit of a stinging sensation, and you can tell you are getting close to finishing an area when the stinging stops.&lt;br /&gt;  Here, I should mention that the hair being pulled should be about a quarter inch long, tops.  Just long enough to rip out.  If it&#x27;s longer, it will hurt more, so trim what you need to.&lt;br /&gt;  Will it give you ladies the \\&quot;Telly Savalas look\\&quot; in the \\&quot;nether reigons\\&quot;? Absolutely!(Hubby and I secretly call this the \\&quot;Bush Hog!! )  As I said, trim the hairs short, first.  Will it hurt?  Absolutely!  But believe it or not, as time goes on and you continue to use it, the pain is less and less.&lt;br /&gt;  One of the reasons for this is that the hair grows back softer, thinner, and smaller.  And less dense.  Consistent use of the Emjoi will keep you smooth longer and longer, and take less and less time to use.  Hubby is a body builder/power lifter, and they too, go for the smooth groomed look, so our epilator gets a GOOD workout!&lt;br /&gt;  We love it.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to nightly shaving of legs and arms.  I loove the feel of smooth skin!  Two thumbs up on a great product!!</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it in any angle maybe someone more por than me can! I am just so happy I was able to return it for free. Thanks Amazon:)</li>
            <li> WOW!!! I have never ever used any epilator before-but I am not a fan of the cost of salon waxing which has burned my sensitive skin on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take the plunge after reading the reviews here and got the 72 tweezer head Emjoi Emagine with the thought that I could always return it if it was too painful, took too long, or gave me a rough  finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;It can only be used corded-that&#x27;s fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain was minimal I am happy to report! I am fairly pain tolerant though, so if you are more sensitive-use with caution. Start with the lower setting.&lt;br /&gt;the sting was akin to the feeling you might get when using an electric razor and a longer hair gets caught and pulled momentarily. It did not sting on every pass-or on every hair-so it was a  minus one on a scale of one to ten-ten being intolerable. Barely noticed the occasional sting. I was expecting far worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed and ease of use were terrific. took me maybe all of 15-20 minutes to do both lower legs to a satisfactory finish. I did use an exfoliating sponge with warm soapy water on my skin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings, lower is less ouchy in general- but you remove more hairs per pass on the higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness factor-was about an 8 out of ten. I can see a few hairs I missed, not many- and not sure of the re-growth that I will see in the days to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise was a surprise-but not much noisier than any other electric razor I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this tool as a great way to stay hair-free and smooth this summer.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it! I&#x27;ll be the first to say that it hurts like a mother the first several times you use it, but no pain no gain, right? I use it on my underarms and bikini area. I absolutely love it for my underarms! They&#x27;re so much smoother and I don&#x27;t get that annoying razor burn. However, I feel like some hairs get broken, so there&#x27;s pretty quick re-growth still. As for my bikini area? It is INCREDIBLY painful the first time! I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed that area before, so I&#x27;m not used to that kind of pain. I ended up buying some numbing spray and using that the first few times. I can now epilate without the spray, but it still hurts. What I love most is that I don&#x27;t get razor burn! That&#x27;s worth the money and pain!! I don&#x27;t do my legs because it just takes soooo long and I&#x27;m not really bothered by shaving. But this is great! And some numbing spray is a great idea until you get used to it!</li>
            <li> I have always felt like a gorilla, because of my hairy arms and legs. The first time I used this epilator, it was a little painful. The second time was less. So I do like this product, but most of all I love being a bit smooth.</li>
            <li> OK, so this is my first epilator ever, that I have never used one or even held one in my hand before this one, so I cant compare. I have been waxing my legs once in 2-3 months since last 4 or 5 years. I am pretty used to waxing legs and under arms. I have waxed my arms probaby once a year on occassions. So, my reactions when I sat to use my epilator. I plug it in and switch it to speed 1 - Whao!! thats scary! the tweezers move reaaaally fast. I watch a quick demo video on you tube and start with my right leg. It hurts a little but not more than waxing, the pain goes of instantly. It takes me more than hald an hour to finish my right leg half way to the thighs. I start with the left leg and its done in 15 mins. I have got a hang of how it works.&lt;br /&gt;There are a little bumps but its gone in a few hours. Oh and knees is a little difficult to do because i could feel the tweezers on the bony parts and was afraid that i might hurt myself in the process, same with elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I start with the lower hands. OUCHHHH!!! Hands hurt a lot, maybe they hurt the same when waxing but since i dont wax them that often I dont remember. When I move to my arms, it doesn&#x27;t catch all my hair! I have very fine hair on the arms but since i am asian with wheatish complexion and black hair its pretty visible. I move the epilator quite a few times but it doesnt catch them! That is a bit disappointing. Because I can still see hairs on my arms :( Am yet to try underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried doing my upperlip but failed, either i am not using it well or it is not able to get hold of that fine hair. I ended up using facial wax strip for upperlips! Over all I am rating it 4 giving it the benefit of my inexperience. Will update the review if I learn more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am happy with this product because I dont have time to visit salons that often and I like to wear dresses skirts to work so need clean legs but I do not wish to shave. Its such a money and time saver.&lt;br /&gt;Also, follow the instructions about taking a hot bath or shower and exfoliating just before using the epilator. Also apply a nice body lotion, cold cream to the epilated areas.</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first,  but does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;m a man and I had a problem with summertime heat rash. The Doctor said I needed more air circulation below the belt to cut down on the dampness. So guess what, it was trim time or go nude time(not). I tried shaving, hair remover and the Epilators. Shaving is an everyday thing and I don&#x27;t like the stickers. Hair remover burns(more rash), so that&#x27;s a no go and the other Epilators I tried, if you got close to tender skin they would take a bite. So as one last try, because the Epilator removes hair for a longer period of time and when it grows back there are no stickers, I tried the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator. Glad I did, it works pretty good at removing the hair, needs to be used only once or twice a week, no stickers and the very best thing is it won&#x27;t take a bite if you get close to tender skin. The only thing that could be improved is it needs a slower speed. Even set on slow speed it tends to break a few of the hairs off instead of pulling them out. But I would guess it&#x27;s getting better than an eighty percent pull rate. Get the rest of the hair the next time.</li>
            <li> Emjoi did a wonderful job improving this product.  Easy to use, clean and store.  Amazon has most certainly the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I had to return this item. There were two issues which did not work well for me.     1. With 72 tweezer heads, I thought the product would deliver faster and/or more efficient epilating. This was not the case. I feel it does not have enough power to drive the heads.    2. The concave design works in an anti-efficient manner for my legs. A convex design would have been more appropriate. Because the devise is curved, I had to press very hard on the parts of my legs with athletic curves, particularly the back part of my thighs. Too much work.    I ended up purchasing the Braun Xpressive, which I am completely happy with. The Emagine may be a great device for a lot of people, it just depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> A friend with lots of dark hair tested this product on a small area of his leg and had great results.  His skin was left hairless and smooth.  I have thinner, lighter leg hair and the product wasn&#x27;t as effective.  It left a lot of hairs behind.  I regret spending so much money on this epilator.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the other reviews for this epilator &amp; it stinks!  I had to go over various areas of my leg about 100 times for it catch the hairs and even then it missed A LOT!  The Braun silk-epil is so much better and actually grabs the hairs which it is supposed to do.  I will never purchase another Emjoi product!  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Emjoi Gold Caress for the past 5 years and finally had the courage to upgrade to Emagine. I must say the Emagine is so much faster and more efficient than my loyal Gold Caress...I was actually able to use an epilator on my legs for the first time and I have coarse hair. If you are a regular epilator user, this is a must upgrade! For the newbies...it takes a little practise and it does hurt..but over time..it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other epilators. Bad ones that take too long or simply doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair out. There was one expensive epilator that burned out after one use. Needless to say, I was skeptical about buying another one, even more, to pay this hefty price. But, I did it anyway; I am happy I did. It will always be painful to pull hair from the root; if you expect it to be painless, you must be a cyborg. Reality is, you ARE pulling hair off your skin. The trick is to have a machine that works fast so you don&#x27;t feel it as much. The other trick is to have your skin as dry as possible, so I apply baby powder as it also lifts the hair and makes it easier.  This machine does exactly that. I am allergic to razors, so I have no other choice but to do depilation. If you have the need for a reliable machine, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried epialting before and was a little nervous!  First, I have to say how pleasantly surprised I was with the packaging itself.  It comes with a cute bag and cover for the top.  It does have a cord but I really think that&#x27;s good because it has sooo much power!  When I first turned it on I jumped a little!  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I sat there for a minute watching all the things move and I finally decided I HAD to at least try it..and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  I started with my under arms - when I first held it against my skin it stung a little but that last for only a second.  Then I started going over the entire area in circle motions.  I did both arms in about 15 minutes and I seriously feel like they are way smoother then waxing or shaving!!  Next I tried my legs.  I found that this took longer then expected but the results are worth it!  It was easier for me to do \\&quot;squares\\&quot; at a time.  I started at the bottom of ankle by my foot and worked my way up and around...very slowly.  You do have do go over a few times - in a circular motion but once I got the hang of it I got in a groove!  Oh yeah I took a hot shower before and exfoliated. When I was done, I used an after shave lotion.  I have no bumps and no irritation and I&#x27;m blown away by the results!!  I can&#x27;t wait to look back and laugh about when I got my FIRST epilator.. the Emagine!!  &lt;3</li>
            <li> Money well spent on this product. I never use razor but this. The hair does not come out as thick the next day like with the razors. I have been using the tweezers for years and I see that I&#x27;m not as hairy anymore.   Be careful not the pinch your sleeve in the tweezer as it will ruin the mechanism of this little machine and will never work the same- personal experience.</li>
            <li> This epilator is awesome!!  I have tried many other epilators before this one and I have to say this one is the best.  I have found that corded ones are better because they last longer than the rechargable kind.  The battery operated ones seem to die quite early on due to problems with the batteries and such.  The cord is long enough to stay out of the way on this one.  It has a very nice shape for handling and it really does a great job getting ALL the hair.  And what I mean by this is that it doesn&#x27;t break the hair at the folicle, it actually takes the whole thing out.  So, less ingrown hairs and no stubble in other words.  The head is big enough for some major coverage too.</li>
            <li> works great and much faster than smaller models</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for many years (and I&#x27;m only 32 years old), and have gone thru many machines thru the years. They fail for various reasons, but commonly it seems to be the the cord (where it goes into the machine).  The way this Emjoi is constructed, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, although only time will tell for sure.  It is by far the best epilator I have ever had, works the best and the fastest.  I LOVE it and totally recommend it to any one who is a serious epilater.</li>
            <li> Did not remove my leg hairs well. Did a great job on my arm pits though. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Hi, customers. I use this product for tow months and i like the results. But the proces is very strong feel. If u need remove hair u can use only if u hair is long</li>
            <li> This epilator does exactly as it states....it pulls the hair out from the roots (most of the time)! Is it painless? No. Could one get used to it? Sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every hair removal way/product known to man. I was hoping that this was the answer for me. But alas, even as I followed the directions, exfoliated prior to use, everything to make it go as planned, it didn&#x27;t work out. And thank God, I only did one leg as a test. Here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After epilation, 3/4 of my leg was hair-free, the other 1/4 had stubble where the hair either broke off, or I just didn&#x27;t have it at the right angle to pull it out efficiently enough. Everything was great for the first week or so. But by the second week, ALL of the hairs became ingrown and red bumps everywhere! It took another two weeks for the hairs to get to the point where they could be shaven smooth agai . Until that point, it was very unsightly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think the product build is a solid one, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price or the ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a sharp razor is the smoothest, least expensive way to go.</li>
            <li> REVISED REVIEW IN 8/2011&lt;br /&gt;I no longer recommend this epilator. The first one I bought died in about 11 months. The gears were slipping. I contacted the company and after I paid to ship it back to them, they replaced it with a new one. The 2nd one DIED at once again 11.5 months. The gears get stripped because they&#x27;re plastic. I have only used this on underarms and lower legs. Nothing too challenging. It worked best when new but progressively declined in performance. Therefore I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. And in case you&#x27;re wondering, Emjoi will not warranty a replacement.... you get one replacement within warranty (1 year). Too bad the product quits at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this epilator for those of you who are familiar with epilating. I was hesitant to order it since it looks HUGE on the ad/listing. It&#x27;s really not that large at all. And it looked heavy. It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: fast and easy to use. Hurts a lot less than my previous Emjoi Gently Gold Caress epilator&lt;br /&gt;Corded, so it doesn&#x27;t run out of power. Many tweezer heads really does mean faster.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable - was able to risk using on bikini line which hurt WAY too much with previous epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use on legs, underarms, bikini area&lt;br /&gt;More thorough than other epilators - gets most hairs on first pass, and strip in middle does help lift hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive, a bit loud, but honestly no louder than other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORDER it today. You can also get it at [...]. I bought mine here at amazon.com - it was cheaper with free shipping vs paying sales tax for [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re undecided - trust me, it really does a good job and hurts less - in fact I don&#x27;t feel the pulling like with other epilators, just the pressure.</li>
            <li> Firstly, im not one to usually write reviews.  But after buying this last week, i had to write how impressed I was.    The hair on my shoulders/arms is quite thick, and this took it out EASILY.  I should also mention that i&#x27;m male, and wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work well on a guy.    Didn&#x27;t hurt much (just a pinching feeling), didn&#x27;t leave a rash, was Very Fast, and unbelievably Easy - you could prob clear your chest hair in 5 minutes.    Still can&#x27;t believe how smooth and hair free it left me.    Also, Emjoi sells a Black version for \\&quot;Men\\&quot; - don&#x27;t bother, the Red one works perfectly fine, and it was $40 cheaper.    If you&#x27;re a Hairy Dude, BUY THIS!!</li>
            <li> I can tell that the people giving this item a negative review don&#x27;t really understand how epilating works. It takes a few weeks to get all the hair off but after that it&#x27;s smoothness all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s finally an epilator for us vets. I&#x27;ve been tweezing for many years now and I just want an epilator that grabs it all. It doesn&#x27;t hurt in the slightest any more. I&#x27;ve owned just about every brand of epilator out there and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I have used epilators since the first one on the market, Epilady, in the 80&#x27;s. Having very heavy hair growth, shaving was a nightmare.  I&#x27;d have a prickly \\&quot;beard\\&quot; within hours of shaving.  At least with epilators, the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; problem disappeared and regrowth was soft.  But the process of doing both legs could easily take 30 minutes, sometimes much longer.  I have used several generations of Epilady, then a Phillips and then a Braun, on which the light was a very good feature, but decided to try the Emjoi when the Braun died. This is like having a Jaguar rather than a Chevrolet. I can do both legs, lower and upper, in less than 15 minutes!  I have never been bothered by discomfort with depilitating since getting used to original Epilady, but do find the Emjoi causes even less of a pulling sensation. If you need a heavy duty \\&quot;machine\\&quot; this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi caress gold for many years, it did a fairly good job, if slow,and I used it primarily on legs.  The switch broke so I was in the market for a new one and after reading reviews bought this.  It arrived yesterday and I love it.  Very impressed by function and speed.  If I say I did lower legs, arms (that I rarely do  since hair light) and underarms,(usually shave) right out of the  box I think it is an indication of speed and ease.  Paid for itself already vs waxing, and a good price on amazon.  Of course it hurts, you are pulling hair out by the root, but for such a shorter amount of time it is definately worth it.  In fact so fast on an area with light amount of hair that I thought it wasn&#x27;t working when the sting of the removal stopped so quickly.  Only consideration might be need for power cord in right location for light/mirror since no battery option. No broken hairs or any left behind after moving over area a few times.  Overall excellent.</li>
            <li> It hurts, that&#x27;s for sure - but no more than waxing and it hurts my wallet considerably less than waxing! If you soak in a hot bath before you epilate, it&#x27;s much easier on your skin. This really does work well and it keep hair away for a long time, longer than waxing usually does for me because it gets the tiny hairs too.   I am very glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Today is 1/17/2011. I purchased product 12/16/2010. It seems to be working as described; however, more time for evaluation is needed. I can say that I feel little to no pain--barely prickly.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Have owned older versions of the Emjoi Epilator.  All have been good, but they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> The Emojoi tweezer is everything I thought it would be.  I am very happy with it and have already recommended it to many of my friends and family! I made a great choice!</li>
            <li> I actually was replacing an older Emjoi - an upgrade - and am I glad I did, there is so much power - I absolutely love this little machine - I can remove any unwanted hair so fast and my skin is just absolutely smooth and soft after.  I&#x27;m use to Epilators so for me there was absolutely no pain as I&#x27;ve read in reviews for other epilators, but those people may be using them for the first time.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although I must warn those who are extremely sensitive to pinch-like pains, I absolutely love this epilator. I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic wet dry one before this, and decided to go for a dry one this time that did the job quicker. Even though a lot of people will try to persuade you that a wet epilator would 1) hurt less 2) be easier to clean, i think both claims are misleading. I don&#x27;t like getting my bath water mixed with hair, and it takes too long to shower if i use it in the shower. I also find it more difficult to clean. I just like it dry better. Anyway -- my advice is if you&#x27;re looking for an epilator for the bottom half of the body and perhaps underarms too - i use it there all the time, it hurts yes, but it is tolerable and you can just push through it if you&#x27;re determined enough to not have hair for a month after - this is your best option. Being corded is a HUGE plus too. My old panasanoic took forever to charge and even if the charge wasn&#x27;t out all the way, it started losing power. Besides, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to epilate anywhere other than your bathroom, or room, or just home - at least, i wouldn&#x27;t. Lots of power, efficient, quicker than most, tolerable pain. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, fine hair &amp; have been using epilators for many years.  With my last one wearing out, I decided to try this two head model.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily believe that it would be quicker or less iritating, so I am pleasantly surprised.  SO far I have only used it on my legs, it&#x27;s size and power make me hesitate to try more sensitive areas.    Pros:  For my skin/hair type it is quicker and my skin is much less irritated aferwards. It does a good job of removing the hairs with one or two swipes.    Cons:  Noiseier than expected and not cordless.  Neither of which is a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator but I am not convinced it&#x27;s worth the money. I have to go over the same spot on my legs slowly and several times to get them really smooth and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have to, not with the dual opposed 72 tweezer heads. It still beats shaving every day and for that, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Seeing the great and not-so-great reviews, I was having second thoughts after I placed my order for the Emagine epilator.  When it came, I decided to try it out and I can&#x27;t believe how easy and fast it is.  I have an average pain tolerance and even underarm hair removal just stings a little (and I expect I&#x27;ll get used to it).  I&#x27;m allergic to depilatories, waxing is a pain and shaving leaves me with cuts...I&#x27;ll be using the Emjoi from now on.  I was trying to decide between this one and one of the cheaper cordless Emjoi models, but I&#x27;m glad I went for this one.  It feels sturdy and I&#x27;m convinced the pain factor is less because of the 72 tweezer head.  Most of my hair was removed with one pass, only a few areas needed to have more than one pass.    I can&#x27;t recommend this unit enough - if you&#x27;re trying to decide, having a cord really isn&#x27;t such a big deal when you can do your arms, underarms and legs in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> I just received my Emjoi Emagine last night.  I have thought about buying one of these devices in the past, but it just seemed like it might be too painful for me. I&#x27;ve tried depilatories (sometimes they burn me), wax (for my face), the Epicare coil (ow!), and tweezing before I bought the Emjoi.  I figured that even though it might hurt, with 72 pairs of tweezers, at least it will be over quickly. I don&#x27;t consider my pain tolerance to be particularly high, either, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to using wax over the years.    After about 20 minutes of hovering this thing over my leg and not being able to place it on my skin, I finally gathered up my courage. It stung like a mofo....for the first minute or so.  After that, the pain decreased significantly. My legs had a few days worth of razor stubble on them, so the hair wasn&#x27;t really long.  I think that might have helped me. As soon as I stopped, there was no lingering pain, and my legs were smooth!    Today, I was even able to use it on stray hairs under my chin (thanks, birth control pills!) and it was MUCH faster than waxing.  When I used to wax the facial hair, it took forever because the hairs were never removed on the first pass. The emjoi got the hard-to-see hair in a few minutes, where waxing could take 20 minutes or more, and I wouldn&#x27;t be 100% hair free.    I&#x27;m really pleased with this product so far.  I thought it would take me a week or more to get used to the feeling of an epilator, so I&#x27;m incredibly happy that I&#x27;m adjusting to it so well in just two days! I&#x27;m so happy that I won&#x27;t have to buy wax and razors anymore.     So, if you&#x27;re worried that you won&#x27;t be able to handle the pain, you might just surprise yourself!</li>
            <li> this is a good epilator..</li>
            <li> It works very well but it does hurt and the machine noise does set off your nerves before and during use.  But it works well so I use it.</li>
            <li> Pros: it really gets rid of the hair &amp; less &amp; less grows back &amp; what does grow back is lighter &amp; finer. It&#x27;s especially fantastic for getting all those tiny chin hairs! Cons: It takes longer to shave than a regular razor, so you have to go fairly slowly. My electric shaver was faster, but then, I had to use it every day.  I read a ton of reviews (mostly for the Braun 5270) &amp; besides the pain a lot of women complained about, I had gotten the idea that you only had to use the epilator once every 4 to 6 weeks. This is not possible; as our hair does not all grow back at the same time. However, after the first couple of shaves, I only have to shave my legs &amp; underarms about once a week to get the few hairs that grew in since the last shave.  I especially love using this on my chin hairs! I have spent over $1000 on electrolysis &amp; that only partially worked. I was still plucking 20 -30+ chin hairs every morning! Now, I use the Emjoi every couple of days on 2-4 hairs! It even gets the peach fuzz.  One of the Braun reviewers (Mark Twain) has good advice for the first time users: shave (with a razor) 5-7 days before you&#x27;re going to use the epilator. Then, when you&#x27;re ready to use the epilator, take a bath to open the pores. Shave in the direction the hair grows and stretch the skin for the area you are shaving - very important especially under the arms &amp; crotch areas.  The first few times it is a bit painful, but keeping the skin stretched really helps. It&#x27;s like plucking your eyebrows - it hurt the first few times, but you got used to it &amp; it stopped hurting. A couple of times the epilator caught a hunk of skin because it wasn&#x27;t stretched. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all; it just scares you the first time.  Shaving under the arms is much easier than it seems it would be - again, make sure to keep the skin stretched. Also, I find the underarm hairs that grow back are much lighter, finer &amp; fewer.  The only problem I&#x27;ve experienced is hairs growing back just under the skin in a leg area; I can see them, but can&#x27;t reach them until they&#x27;ve finally grown through the upper layer. These areas are just on the outside of my calves, by my by knees &amp; I think it might be because I always wear pants &amp; sit all day &amp; that area is tighter against my legs. Several reviewers remarked about making sure when bathing to scrub the shaved areas well to exfoliate &amp; I don&#x27;t always remember to do that.  I bought the Emjoi about a year ago &amp; have been very happy with it. It has an electric cord that plugs into the bottom of the shaver &amp; reaches over 8 feet.  A nice option would be also rechargeable, but I definitely would choose electric above battery-only; you need to keep the constant power for shaving.  I&#x27;m surprised that no one (consumer companies/websites) has made an effort of comparing epilators by shaving one leg with one top brand &amp; the other with another top brand for easy comparison&#x27;s sake!  Regardless of whether you buy the Emjoi or the Braun, IT IS WORTH IT - especially for you ladies who have the embarrassing chin hairs!!  Jan 2013 update: I&#x27;m still using this great epilator &amp; loving it. My underarm hairs are so light and sparse that I can pretty much get away without saving for a month or more (between living in AZ &amp; my hot flashes, I always were sleeveless blouses). My chin hairs have also pretty much disappeared - I still shave every 3 or 4 days, but instead of hundreds of chin hairs, there are only about 5-10. The growth of hair on my legs is interesting - very few from the calf down, around my knees, and thighs, but somewhat more under and above the back of my knees, but still 1/3 of what was there before I started using the Emjoi. One thing: I shave my legs about once every two months, so if I had done it more often &amp; regularly, I&#x27;m sure the hair would be much sparser. It&#x27;s pretty much painless to use everywhere, except the pubic area, which I think is because the hairs are so much thicker than everywhere else. I can still highly recommend this!  April2017 Update Sometime after my last update in 2013 the tweezers head on the first Emjoi started catching, i.e. stopped turning, at first it was every once in a while, then more often, until I just couldn&#x27;t use it any more. Luckily, I had bought a warranty with Square Trade and got a full refund, which I used to buy a new Emjoi.  After three or so years, the electric cord/adapter for the 2nd Emjoi stopped working. I didn&#x27;t have the one from the first Emjoi anymore and my Square Trade warranty had expired, but I found another that fit at one of the big box stores.  The issue I’ve been experiencing the last month or so is that epilator seems to be shaving instead of epilating. I started noticing that the hair is growing back much faster and there’s a lot more of it on my chin. Also, up until the last month or so, when the hair on my legs grew back, it was always soft and I could barely feel it, but now I feel the stubbles, like I used to get from shaving. So, this leaves me with two options: 1) buy another Emjoi AP-18, or 2) some other epilator brand. Once again, I have spent many hours reading hundreds of reviews, and based on the reviews, have (once again) narrowed it down to the same Emjoi, or one of the Braun models.  End result: I&#x27;ll buy another Emjoi AP-18 because I don&#x27;t want to be stuck with hair on my legs, face, under arms, or bikini area due to a dead/empty battery. Since the hair on my legs and underarms has become so sparse (before I started epilating 10 yrs ago, it was very heavy &amp; dark), I usually only use the Emjoi once every 4 – 6 wks, but it takes me a good hour at least. The Brauns are only good for about 40 minutes. Also, several reviewers complained about the battery completely dying within 6 months to a year. My own experience with most things with a built-in battery is that they start slowing down as the battery drains and eventually completely die (cell phones, Bluetooth, tablets, tooth brush, electric razor, handheld vacuum, etc.) which is why I buy cameras that use lithium batteries and buy spare batteries. Even though I’ve had to replace two units after 2.5 and 4 years, I still feel that the Emjoi works great and is worth the $80 (which has not gone up in price since the first one I bought 10 yrs ago)!   And, again, I can still highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the second Emjoi epilator I have purchased (kids lost my first one) and I am very happy with it.  The double heads actually do remove the hair more efficiently than my previous epilator that only had the one.  My only complaints are that this model does not have a light and it isn&#x27;t rechargeable.  The cord can be somewhat awkward...  All in all, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have my Emjoi AP-18 Emagine for about a year. I am very pleased with it. I have strong hair and wax didn&#x27;t always work well, especially under my armpits, but I have never had problems with this epilator. No more mess and no more pain - some small pinching sensations only, no big deal really. I don&#x27;t know the other epilator brands, but this one works very well for me.</li>
            <li> This hurts A LOT, but that was expected. However, I had to go over areas 5-6 times to fully get the hair off resulting in irritated, red skin. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This thing HURTS! It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I tried to use it twice, that was enough for me. #Wasted #MY #MONEY</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and at first it worked wonderfully. Then 2-3 months later it started to jam once in a while. Pretty soon it was jamming every 3-4 seconds while epilating and I&#x27;d have to push the wheels to get it spinning again. This became tiresome as you can imagine. I then took the head apart (completely apart) and cleaned out the gears from debris. I assumed this would fix it. It didn&#x27;t. The jamming continued until I couldn&#x27;t take it.     I caved and bought a replacement head ($30) hoping maybe the initial head was just defective. Surprise - the Same thing happened. Clearly the person who engineered this device failed. The postive reviews are either from people who reviwed too early or people trying to sell this to you. Do Not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I loved the idea of epilating and not having hair grow back for at least two weeks.  However, the product did not do what is claimed.  There was a little bit of pain, but not much and you get used to it quickly, especially on Speed 2.  But, even though the epilator took out many hairs by the roots on my legs, it broke off just as many, which left stubble.  I can get a smooth leg just by shaving in less time with less hassle.  I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to using this product for a long time.  One positive...it did a great job for armpits.  It took no time at all and was baby smooth in minutes!  It just didn&#x27;t do a good job on legs, which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried different methods of removing hair. At home waxing, yuck messy and doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Then 2 1/2 years ago I bought a Panasonic epilator. Yes, it did work but got ingrown hairs and some scarring not to mention some slight scarring and hated those red bumps that lasted a few days. In January a purchased a No No. Well that was rather a waste as it really didn&#x27;t do anything that burn the surface hair and not a good job at that. I finally broke down and bought this Emagine. This is wonderful. It is a close to shaving as one could ask for and not painfull to my legs and upper thighs and bikini area. I was brave enough to do my underarms. Since this was the first time with my underarms there was a tiny bit of discomfort. I know that this will go away the more that I use it in this area. If you are new to epilating you will find that you hair really does come back slower and some will not come back again after using awhile. I had no red bumps at all with this. I am so happy that I splurged for this it was worth every penny. Now I know some people complained about they wish it was cordless but truely corded will keep its power. I already own a little Energizer battery pack that I can plug it into so I can take with me in any chair, room, etc so I can get plenty light and I don&#x27;t worry about having an outlet. Really gals, spend the money on this it is truely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emjoi epilators for the last 15 years, but this one by far is the best one yet!  It is alot faster (since it has so many heads) and does alot better job than my previous ones and with less pain.  Yes, when you first start using an epilator it hurts because you have so much hair, but the more you use it the less hair returns so the degree of pain lessens considerably.  After 15 years, I only have to use it every three weeks or so.  The hair that does return is so soft you hardly know it there.  I am definitely recommending it to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this epilator I am enjoying a razor-free summer. It did take a while to epilate both of my legs the first time (at least an hour), but after the first time it goes by a lot quicker. I epilate every couple of days to get rid of any new growth, and it takes about 10 minutes. I have noticed that my once extremely thick and dark leg hair is now a lot thinner and lighter and takes a lot longer to grow. In addition, I am getting a lot fewer ingrown hairs than when I was shaving. After seeing such great results on my legs, I decided to start epilating my upper lip and underarms. The upper lip is not bad pain-wise, definitely better than waxing (and better than the wrinkles that waxing ultimately causes), but the underarms were quite a doosie the first time. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was gritting my teeth the first time I epilated my underarms. After I was finished, I was amazed to see that the dark roots were completely gone, my underarms were the same color as the rest of my arm! I felt like I could be a deoderant model! I have been epilating both for about 3 weeks now, and the pain has decreased dramatically as well as hair thickness and growth time. It is just one of those things that you have to get used to, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friendly advice for anyone having problems with pain and/or red bumps. I have found that exfoliating with a loofah and salt or sugar scrub in a warm shower helps a lot before epilating. I typically exfoliate once every three days, just to prevent ingrown hairs (I am very prone to them). I also recommend rubbing witch hazel on any areas that get red bumps after you epilate. I had bumps on my thighs after the first time , and after applying the witch hazel, they were gone in about 5 minutes. One last thing to do is take care of any ingrown hairs with a pair of pointed tweezers dipped in rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and despise shaving everyday, I would highly suggest investing in this product. This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.product. This is my favorite beauty buy of the year.</li>
            <li> It works well if you are mainly using it for legs and arm, but a little too wide for small areas &amp; doesn&#x27;t perform as effectively as on the larger areas.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using epilators for approximately 18 years and this is by far the best ever.  Hair removal is very quick and it did not hurt because I use the epilator quite frequently.  I like the corded unit because it saves on batteries and seems to have more power.  Extremely satisfied.  Would definitely buy again...highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item twice.The 72 tweezers sounded great,I real time saver.I loved it but within 60 days the one small plastic cog that joined the head to the body(motor)had broken and the epilator was unusable.I liked it so much that I purchased it AGAIN,thinking maybe I had just received a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.The same thing happened only in less than six weeks!I want to give it 5 stars and I also want to give it zero.If it is redesigned,I will try it again.</li>
            <li> So having brought this item as it has more heads than others I found it to be too big to really use. It has to be plugged in for use with no rechargeable battery. I previously had a smaller braun that was rechargeable and will rebuy that one anyday.</li>
            <li> Impressive. Online tips are great, hot shower, intermittent shaving. Much better then tweezing. Saves money by not waxing.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi Epliators since the late 90s and I can&#x27;t imagine hair removal without it</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator to replace  a similar Emjoi that I&#x27;d been using for several years.  This new model is very fast  and efficient!  The dual head makes all the difference!  A great product and value!</li>
            <li> So painful and never ending. Go with a home laser like Silk n flash instead for permanent, non-painful results.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best epilator I have bought to date.  This is the third one I have bought over the past 10 years and it is the fastest and least painful out of the three.  My last one was a braun and that one was good but there was still a bit of pain involved when using it.  Nothing major, but this emjoi epilator is so painfree, I thought it must be just breaking the hair off instead of pulling it out.  After 2 months of trying it out, I know it&#x27;s actually pulling the hair out.    It runs a little more than the Braun one that I had in the past, but when you consider that a leg wax is $50+ it pays for itself by the second use, on the first use if you also normally wax your arms or any other area.  Also, it&#x27;s rechargable and my previous ones were not.      Not brave enough to use it on the bikini area so I can&#x27;t review on that, but this is a great epilator.</li>
            <li> this product makes me save tons of money on European wax. it is not that painful to use this product .i just don&#x27;t recommend  for the face.</li>
            <li> I was the recipient of this gift. It is becoming more bearable with each use, and I really less painful than I thought it would be. It is great not to need to shave daily. I like that it is corded and that I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge. The cord is very lengthy and it is great for arms, underarms, and legs:)</li>
            <li> This works even better than the previous Emjoie that I owned.  Works super fast, does a great job.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> easy to use, and it could remove hair completely, and don&#x27;t feel too painful. Like it.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years to remove hair and I have a lot of hair to remove.  They used to refer to me as \\&quot;Monkey Arms.\\&quot;  Well no more, I started using this product at the first of the year.  I used it on my arms (a smaller version on my face)and I am virtually hair free.</li>
            <li> The tweaser head little plastic gear broke in 2 places from extended use.  I use it once a month and after 7 months I need to buy a replacement head for it already which will cost me $30 plus shipping.  The Braun epi&#x27;s are much better at one time pass and fine hair removal but when looking to do large areas the recharging is a pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Emjoi. I upgraded to 72 tweezers thinking it would be faster for leg hair removal. Nope. Takes just as long and just as difficult around Binet areas.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for underarms and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> The best hair removal I have ever used on my whole body. I will NEVER use a razor again after using this. Plus I have super sensitive skin and this has helped me not to break out in rashes or have an allergic reactions. Using a razor on my legs made the hair grow back the next day. With this product its usually a few weeks. Again the best!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I got this today and straight away took it out of the box and used it.  It worked better than my last one.  I owned a Braun first, then a Panasonic, and then another Braun.  Each only lasted between a year or two.  I am hoping this one stays longer.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product. The shipping took few weeks but I finally got it tonight and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  It is extremely fast, not that noise as many others and does the work. The best one ever. Previously I owned Brown (which was good , too but not as quick and effective as Emjoi).  Highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li> This definitely takes out the hair from the root, however it won&#x27;t leave your skin silky smooth like a razor does. There are some pretty tiny puny fine/thin hairs on your leg that this cannot grasp, so those small ones will be left behind. For the most part though your legs will be hair free. I tweezer out some of the leftovers myself if they aren&#x27;t too many or if they are bothering me too much.    At first I was intimidated by this product because I saw the tweezers rotate so fast, I thought it would hurt. It does hurt to an extent. I&#x27;m used to the pain of waxing so this did not bother me too much. Also, remember to clean out the hair that was pulled or else it&#x27;ll get too crowded with hair in the epilator.     Overall I really do love this product. Saves me from cuts from razors and saves the trip and cost of waxing. Plus I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to have my hair grow out long in order to wax. Anddd you don&#x27;t have to worry about the expensive razor refills either. This epilator is a good investment even though the hefty price tag looks pretty expensive at first. It pays for itself after a while and saves you money in the end. Get it!</li>
            <li> I love it so far. I use it on my legs about every week since the hair is not all on the same growth cycle. Because of that, it&#x27;s not painful at all. I just wish that it did a better job of getting just one hair. For that, I still have to bust out the tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works great! It does take some time and at first hurts but after a few uses you get used to it and the hair grows thin and slow. C:</li>
            <li> I have an old Emjoi Gold Caress since 2002. It works perfect. It just takes a while to remove the hair. But one it is removed, you skin feels super smooth. I saw this Emagine Dual Head and was so happy. I thought: \\&quot;Wow, it will do the job faster\\&quot; So, I ordered it. I have tried it immediately. But... was very disapointed. It has super fast rotation. When you place it against your leg, the machine moves itself on the leg. I think because of this it is not grasping the hair, instead it breakes it. I looked closer to my leg and it looks like the hair is there, it was just cut very short.     Not a good product. I am very disapointed. It is going back</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I wish I would have known about this years ago.  I have very sensitive underarm skin and due to shaving, it gets very very irritated and has become discolored.  This product has helped to lighten the skin on my underarms and I no longer have any irritation.  I use this about every two weeks.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed the more I use it, the longer it takes for my hair to grow back, which is great!  When the hair does grow back, it&#x27;s much much thinner.  It&#x27;s true, the first time you use this product it can be a bit painful, but honestly, it&#x27;s not that bad at all.  And it&#x27;s really only the first time you use it that it&#x27;s kind of annoying, because all the other times after are much less painful (barely noticeable) due to the thinness of the hair.  It&#x27;s not as quick as shaving, but you spend less time overall in that you have to wait a few weeks to remove your hair, as opposed to a razor where you have to shave every day or every other day.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to everyone I know.  It&#x27;s much better than waxing.</li>
            <li> My first time ever epilating was after purchasing this Emagine, although I have EXTENSIVE experience with all other types of hair removal; I&#x27;ve been getting professional waxings for the past 10 years, and I also am in the process of both laser and electrolysis treatments on my legs. Let me say that I CANNOT BELIEVE that I didn&#x27;t try epilating sooner - what was I thinking not buying this thing years ago!?! This is now my very favorite method of hair removal!! The biggest downside to waxing is waiting that ~3 weeks for the hair to grow out so that you actually get your money&#x27;s worth when you pay for a salon waxing (and on that note, the cost of professional waxing is a huge downfall, as well)... but with the Emagine you can epilate, and then continue to run the thing over your legs weekly/every few days to grab those few hairs that either weren&#x27;t yet long enough when you first epilated or that possibly broke off during the process. It is SO great to feel like I&#x27;m \\&quot;in control\\&quot; of the process any time instead of waiting for my next salon waxing.   The Emgaine also amazed me with the short hairs it was able to grab - it says that it will remove hairs as short as .5mm length, and that is absolutely accurate (another big advantage over waxing!).   In regard to the pain factor: yes, epilating is very painful. However, after a ton of waxing, laser, and electrolysis treatments, it honestly doesn&#x27;t phase me much. But be aware that the pain IS more agonizing than waxing, as the process is much slower - at least with waxing a large section of hair can be removed in one second... but with the epilator you can expect the consistent pain to take awhile. On that note, it took me about 2 hours in total to epilate my full legs and entire bikini area the first time; but as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve spent only a few minutes each week maintaining since then.   The one possible negative I do want to point out is that I have dark, coarse hair with the exception of my outer thighs, where the hair is lighter &amp; finer. While the Emagine worked INCREDIBLY on the dark hair, I didn&#x27;t get quite as astonishing results on the light hair (I think the machine may have broken off some of the lighter hairs, even when used on the Low setting). So if you have very fine hair, I&#x27;d say that the Emagine (or epilating altogether?) may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator i&#x27;ve ever owned, having shaved all my life, it being the easiest and least painful option for hair removal. i did a lot of research online before deciding on an epilator, and even more before deciding to try this one. i have a very low pain tolerance, so i was quite sceptical, but willing to give it a go given that i&#x27;d read in a number of places that epilators are now nowhere near as painful as they used to be, and i had read many reviews stating that this one was around the least painful there was.    i have just received my new epilator and used it for the first time, and i can definitely say that it is really not that bad at all. Yes, there is a very mild pinching sensation as each hair is removed, but its definitely well within my ability to tolerate it, and even do an entire leg at a time. It is far easier to see whether the you&#x27;ve been successful with  removing the hair with an epilator, and with this one, you do need to go over the same spot a few times sometimes, but mostly, it does a great job first time round. i doubt there&#x27;s a hair removal technique yet invented that really never needs to go over the same area twice.    Like with all hair removal, you will need to do it regularly at least to start, because your hair grows in cycles, and when you do it today, you&#x27;re not catching the hairs that are still growing in the pores and haven&#x27;t peeped out as yet.    One cannot complain about fast regrowth or ingrowns in relation to epilators, because that&#x27;s really individual to each person&#x27;s body, so the factors i believe are important are:    * Is it painful? - Not enough to worry about. Also, i could actually feel a sharp, pricking sensation in a number of the pores for a while afterwards, but nothing disturbing.    * How fast can you get it done? - For me, this epilator was perhaps a couple of minutes faster than shaving, but nothing to write home about.    * How smooth are you afterwards? - Very smooth, very smooth.    * Is it easy? -As easy as shaving with this one.    * Can i attack multiple parts of my body with the same tool? - Yes - the same head can do the upper lip, underarms, legs and bikini area. However, the instructions say that when using on the upper lip, one should only target individual hairs at a time, and use only one of the heads.    * Can i use it wet and dry? This one is dry only, but i don&#x27;t see that as a problem.    * Is it easy to use? - Very. It sits easily in your hand, and while the instructions state which way round you&#x27;re supposed to hold it, the shape of the body makes you want to hold it that way anyway. The on/off/ slider is easy to intuit, and really, its much like shaving from there, except that you&#x27;re supposed to pull your skin taut as you go. Easy peasy.    * Is it easy to clean? - Yes. It comes with a little brush that is easy to hold and easy to use on the epilator head. The head is detachable for easier cleaning if you wish, and comes off as a completely separate unit, with no internal working exposed on either the body or the head when it is removed. All you need to do is brush off the hairs and you&#x27;re done.    * How noisy is it? - Moderately, but quieter than many electric razors. Its not quiet, per se, but it didn&#x27;t scare my cats when i turned it on next to them.    * Can i go out looking fab straight away? - i would say no. This is a small drawback i guess, to epilators in general, not just this one. i have quite white skin, and it was decidedly marked with little red dots for a while afterwards.    * Is it worth the money? - Admittedly i should probably answer this question after at least a couple of months usage, but so far, i&#x27;d say yes, and based on the majority of the reviews i&#x27;ve read (many of which are after a significant period of use), i would say yes.</li>
            <li> I owned a Braun Silk-Epi for a while which I loved.  I let my sister borrow it and never got it back (she loved it too!).  I had read great reviews about the Emjoi epilator, and since it was a little less expensive than replacing my Braun, I ordered one.  Well, I have had it several months now and have tried it three or four times.  It just doesn&#x27;t work as well!  I have to go over the same areas over and over, and it really only seems to get the finer hairs.  This is a complete contradiction to the other reviews that I read on the product, so I assumed that I was using it incorrectly.  I looked at instruction manuals, on-line recommendations for use, and perused the reviews here on Amazon hoping to find out what I was doing wrong.  No luck.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I am not sure why.  I am not overly hairy and my hair is not overly course.  Guess I will have to go back to the Braun...</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell but love it!!!!!!!!  Get use to the pain but gets all the hair and it stays away much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> The first Emjoi I had finally retired after using it for 21 years. I replaced with this one. What a wonderful product, easy to use, no pain. I am a Emjoi user for ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator did a fair job for me.  I would have to make multiple passes, in all directions, to get all the hair under my arms.  Even then, I usually had to grab one or two with a tweezer.  I never used it on my legs.  I would use it on my upper lip and on my cheeks right under my \\&quot;side burns\\&quot;.  I would have given it a better star rating, but unfortunately it stopped working at just over a year.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was out of warranty.  My previous Emjoi lasted for almost 10 years.  So this is pretty disappointing for me, given the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after 10 years of owning a Braun Silkepil Eversoft model. If you&#x27;re a seasoned epilator, this is the one for you. This packs some serious power and does quick work of the legs, arms, underarms and bikini area. I actually looked forward to epilating, I usually epilate once a week to get the entire cycle. The key to smooth epilated skin is exfoliation, exfoliation, exfoliation; so make sure you do that everyday after you epilate to prevent ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far on every part of my body and I am sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************CONS************************************&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with a shaver/trimmer head, for the cost I would have expected that too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an Epilator before so may just be a wuss about the pain. Legs were stingy but worked in mostly one pass. Best to follow the instructions and do short areas rather than a long swoop. Underarms - YOWZA!!! basically instant birth but was completely impressed after I was done hopping around flapping my arms. Best looking underarms in Seattle!! I will note that the chances of my using this thing anywhere near my \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot; are less than none. My idea of a good time is not being found unconscious on my bathroom floor with a buzzing red object in my limp hand. Knowing my kids - it would probably end up on you-tube.  Used it about six weeks ago and it&#x27;s time to go again. Not looking forward to it but I fear I&#x27;m hooked.... the things we do for beauty....</li>
            <li> Really!! Good quality love it</li>
            <li> Great machine! First time epilator...you always feel the prickliness and the first epilating process...it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought and I loved the results. My pores did get irritated but healed quickly and the hairs are much finer and didn&#x27;t come back in immediately and I know it will only get better. I had the big, thick hairs on my legs, too.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product over a year now, and love love love it.  It is painful at first, but once your legs get used to it, it is sooooo worth the reward of not having to shave every day.  The key to minimizing pain is to pull your skin taught while epilating over your skin.  Also, keep your skin hydrated and use a pumice stone on any areas you epilate EVERY TIME YOU SHOWER.  This prevents ingrown hairs which then have to be tweezed to the surface before you epilate (I have to do this some).  My armpits still hurt the worst, but again, pull the skin super taught--grin and bare it.  Sooooo worth not having to worry every morning about shaving.  If you can, epilate outside so as not to worry about sweeping up all the hairs that are left laying around after their death (mwahahaha).  Bikini area is too difficult for me, so I only tried a couple of times.  Epilating is like shaving, you&#x27;re not going to get every single hair with just one sweep of the epilator.  Be realistic with any product you buy--the more you go over the area, the more hairs it picks up.  Go over the area softly and kind of floating and don&#x27;t grind the epilator into your skin, it will bog it down anyway.  Happy Epilating :):)</li>
            <li> I have an old Emjoi (white)I purchased at Sharper Image at least 10 yrs ago for about 50 bucks. It came in a white box with a \\&quot;loofah\\&quot; pad, and an auxiliary electric razor head. It&#x27;s a LOUD, but effective workhorse. I saw the Emagine in a catalog, (and was seduced by the snazzy, red color more than anything), and figured that my old Emjoi HAD to be less effective. I was wrong.  This product takes twice as long to depilate as the old one. It&#x27;s light and slightly less noisy, but who really cares about the noise anyway? It hurts less, but it takes longer. The old one&#x27;s head is much easier to clean, i.e., one could see what was there and rinse it off, then set it aside to dry. This head is more enclosed; I can&#x27;t tell if hair is inside the head, and it&#x27;s not clear to me how well rinse water will evaporate, if at all. There is no auxiliary head included to do the final smoothing which was, for me, the key to achieving the smoothness of a razor without having to use one.   At first, I used the red one to start, and finished with the old one and the auxiliary head. Now I&#x27;m just using the old one. I should note that I&#x27;m not a hirsute person, and I&#x27;d imagine that a particularly hairy or coarse-haired person would find this product even less effective than I do. And as for \\&quot;using one side of the head for facial hair\\&quot;--do so only at your peril. If you use one side, it does nothing; if you use both you&#x27;d better be pulling your skin super tight or it will suck in half your face! I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed, but I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old one exclusively.</li>
            <li> Best epilady I have ever used. Gets close and removes hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> The epilator works as advertised. The design is also easy to clean and simple to disassemble. It also works fast.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with epilating but I&#x27;m a fan of waxing and threading now.  This particular product stopped being awesome after about 6 months to a year of use.  It takes a lot longer to take off hair and it doesn&#x27;t take off as much hair as it used to so overall, not worth my time anymore unless I don&#x27;t have any other means to take off hair. I&#x27;ve owned this product for a few years now and it takes off less than 30% of my leg hair and maybe around 50% of my armpit hair.  It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used and I love it!  I would highly suggest you exfoliate before using.  As far as being painful it was the very first time I used it but now it&#x27;s nothing!  I use it once a week and find it&#x27;s less and less painful as the weeks go on.    So if this is your first I would suggest doing a little every day for the first couple weeks till you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a razor on my legs due to numerous nicks and cuts and I am allergic to wax and liquid hair removers.  I decided to exfoliate starting with the original Epilady.  At first it was tough getting used to the stings pulling out the hair.  Several epilators later, inclusive of Braun and other Emjoi products, I decided to spring for this.  It has been worth every penny as it gets just about everything on the first pass.  I have had several ingrown hairs on my legs and this one gets them.  My hair is coarse so the ingrown hair can be painful at times.  I recommend this product highly for those with allergies and hate the cuts from shaving.  Additionally shaving makes the hair grow back faster and the hair feels like spikes.  Exfoliated hair doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old one (15-18 years old) and is a big improvement.  I like not shaving my legs and regrowth is not prickly.  However, if you must have marble-smooth legs, epilators are not for you.</li>
            <li> It would be great if you could remove the guard as the guard prevents you from pulling the real short hair.  You have to let the hair grow out a little longer but it works great other than that.</li>
            <li> I had an old Emjoi gold caress rechargeable that was 15 years old.  The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, so figured it was time to replace it.  So I decided to upgrade, &amp; I am very glad I did!  I stuck with this brand because I was satisfied the first time.  This epilator doesn&#x27;&#x27;t pinch any where near as much as the old model.  I can do my bikini line effortlessly now.  And for my legs, it gets hairs that are really short, &amp; my legs feel almost as smooth as when I used a razor blade, but this last a lot longer!  I have very dark hair, &amp; would have to shave my legs every day in summer, now I just \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; once a week.  I will not go back to using a razor again!</li>
            <li> I tried epilating years ago with another cheaper brand and it hurt so much I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I did some research and tried again, purchasing the Emjoi 72 Tweezer head model.  It worked much better than the other model I tried.  (I use it on my legs.)  It really took out the hairs quite well without having to go over the same spot repeatedly. This epilator worked exactly like their website said it would. If you are new to epilation, you have to expect it will hurt the first time.  But it is true that it hurts less and less with each use.  The first time - it hurt ALOT.  The second time -- it&#x27;s bearable.  The third time -- not much at all.  Now it doesn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with Eczema for over 10 years now on my legs. No amount of lotion would curb the itching, and the doctor&#x27;s version wasn&#x27;t enough and was too expensive! It made the scratching worse when I shaved! My legs felt good for about a day, until stubble would start to grow.  Then it got a lot worse because the itchy stubble would make me itch harder until I literally itched my skin till it was bleeding!  I saw this particular epilator on YouTube and it came highly recommended by it&#x27;s reviewer.  As a last ditch resort, I decided to spend the money and get it.  I won&#x27;t lie, the first time i used it, it hurt like a @#$%*!!! but the second time I used it (which was 2 glorious, itch free WEEKS) I could hardly feel it!  And thanks to this product, my legs are now scab and itch free for 2 months!  Thank you Emoji!</li>
            <li> I never got this product and I was never reimbursed by amazon.com.  I put in my address but my old address was stuck in your computer so it got returned to you and i am still waiting to get my money back.  It would be great if you could look into it or send me the product at 56560 East End Rd., Homer, Alaska 99603. I was really disappointed because I had an emjoi before that broke when I was in Peru and I loved it.  Thanks,  Lorraine</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for a little over a year. I started with an inexpensive Braun model as my first epilator. It had a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; attachment with only about 12 tweezers that wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad along with the normal head attachment. It also had a light which was very helpful for seeing those thin fair hairs. I only decided to replace it because lately it had been taking longer and longer to epilate as I think the tweezers were getting a little dull or maybe I wasn&#x27;t keeping them clean enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wanted to get what I thought would be a more high-end epilator. I have heard good things about Emjoi and saw this beast of an epilator that had pretty decent reviews. And I figured the dual head action would speed up the epilation, considering my biggest gripe is how long epilation takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Emjoi AP-18 turned out to be a massive disappointment. It doesn&#x27;t even get the hairs AT ALL. I have rather coarse dark leg hair which is why I started epilating instead of shaving. Maybe that has something to do with it, but it just seems that this epilator cannot get the hairs. I have to go over an area 20 times just to get a single hair. I have tried every direction too-- with the growth, against, SIDEWAYS, and nothing works. I&#x27;ve tried all speeds--slow or fast it matters not. I can even leave the epilator in place spinning over a hair for 20 seconds and it won&#x27;t come out. It takes FOREVER to make any progress. It seems totally random or luck that I get any at all. It&#x27;s also pathetically bad in the bikini area where you have curves to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, even after I spend forever trying to get rid of the hairs and it finally gets a few, my legs do not feel smooth AT ALL. I can still feel small stubs of hair. I&#x27;m not sure if they are just breaking off instead of being plucked or if it&#x27;s just more hair that it missed, but either way I still feel like I need to shave after using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed, and for what I paid this was worse than the cheap Braun model I have. Such a waste of money. I would recommend a different brand entirely.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this over waxing. It&#x27;s completely cost effective and simple to use. It&#x27;s a bit painful at first but after a minute of using it, it&#x27;s super breezy. Clean up also simple and easy. The tweezers take all the smallest of hairs even the ones you don&#x27;t see. I used it on my arms, legs, armpits, and upper lip. Like I said it&#x27;s painful at first but the pain subsides after a while. Overall great quality and magnificent product.</li>
            <li> It was time to get a new epilator after several years - I have only owned 2 previous ones in 15+ years so to be fair I can&#x27;t compare this to a huge range when I say it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had!  I was really keen on the faster epilation aspect and that decided my purchase, and as others commented, overall it is about 1/3 faster overall.  I was hoping for quicker and it is not quite the revolution I&#x27;d hoped for.  It does work pretty well as others have described, goes over your skin smoothly and you will probably find you need more than one pass over areas, and then sometimes have to go over and over the same hair before it goes.  I have had this only about a month so I am hoping this will improve.  I have had some ingrown hairs but do not find that much worse than before (previously had an old Phillips Satinelle) and it is not too painful.  However I have only so far used it on my legs and arms and not dared anything more sensitive.</li>
            <li> With the caveat that I&#x27;ve only had this epilator for a few days, so far I&#x27;m impressed with it. The factors I&#x27;m most concerned about are speed and efficiency, and in those respects it&#x27;s a big improvement over the panasonic one that it&#x27;s replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an epilator that will remove unwanted hair post-haste, then it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  It you want one that&#x27;s gentle or if you&#x27;re new to epilating, it might not be the best one to start with.  This thing isn&#x27;t suble, it looks and sounds like the misbegotten offspring of a cuisinart and an electric shaver.  It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than some of the others, but handles armpits pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t offer a battery operation, but the cord is plenty long enough, even for a bathroom with illogically placed electrical outlets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not happy with this product, and I&#x27;ll list a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt; - despite the 72 tweezers, it doesn&#x27;t epilate the hairs properly-- I have to go over a number of times to get the result&lt;br /&gt; - it takes ages to epilate, and the results are not exactly amazing (see below)&lt;br /&gt; - it breaks the hair just above the root, which means in a couple of days its growing a &#x27;stubble&#x27;&lt;br /&gt; - after it gets warm, the epilator works even less (once again, it takes ages to epilate, so try that if you are in a hurry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the worst depilating product I have ever owned or tried, so I&#x27;ll definitely have to return this item. Sorry about that, it&#x27;s just an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Epilator user. I&#x27;ve been using these products since 1990 - so I feel that after 20 years, I&#x27;m a pretty good judge off them.   This particular epilator does not work as stated. Yes, it pulls the hairs. And under the right conditions, it will pull the hairs faster than the other Epilators. But the conditions must be that you&#x27;re working in an area which has a lot of hair. Where there&#x27;s a lot of hair, it pulls them out like crazy! But if you are working in an area where there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair, it has a hard time picking up the fine single hairs. And it creates a problem that even if you&#x27;re very hairy and working in a more densely hairy area, this product will leave small fine hairs behind. Then you are left to work very hard at getting it to pick up the hairs which were left behind. Getting the small hairs takes so much time that it negates the amount of time you thought you saved when working in the very hairy area.   Also, the shape of the head is different than the others. It has a hard time around bony areas - like around the knees and in the bikini area. The most important thing is that I had to pull out my old Braun epilator (which is slow, and on its last leg (haha -no pun intended)) to do my bikini and knee area along with pulling out the stragglers all over the rest of the legs that the Emjoi left behind.    This was the most expensive of all the epilators. But the performance does not justify the cost. I don&#x27;t like it and now I must find a way to get a different one.     As stated above, I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for 20 years now. I was excited to try the Emjoi because the process really does take a lot of time and I hoped that this could cut that time in half - as stated. It didn&#x27;t.    Bottom line - This is not better, in fact - it&#x27;s inferior.</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews perhaps my epilator is defective, but it is very noisy and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as older models I&#x27;ve purchased.Not only does it sound like I&#x27;m mowing the lawn when I turn this on, but when I tried to use it on my underarms I found it very difficult to get the hair and just ended up damaging the skin, this has never been a problem with the old models. Given the shape of the head I&#x27;m really not sure what advantage the dual head is either.  I&#x27;ve been using emjoi epilators for years and have never had any complaints I thought I would try this newer model due to the good reviews, however I think I should have stuck with the tried and true.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous after reading some of the reviews about how painful this product could be.  Well, it kind of stings, but that is about all I experienced.  I have very fine hair, so that may be the reason.  I hoped it would be better about pulling out hair, but I still need to do a second round later in the day or the next day, to get the stray hairs that it missed.  I have found some of the suggestions helpful, and have followed them with good results.  I took a shower and made sure to use a buffpuff on my legs and then after I dried them, immediately used the epilator.  It still required me to use the higher setting and go slowly with little circular motions.  There were still some hairs that it did not pull, and I had to go over those spots again the next day.  I guess nothing is perfect, but it is nice not to have to shave every two days.</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited to recieve this product and it&#x27;s definitely better than shaving but it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and i sometimes have to use my tweezers to get the stray hair sometimes but i definitely love this product and would recommend!! also if you are complaining about ingrown hairs after using this product maybe you should have read the instructions - you alwayS always always HAVE to exfoliate before using to prevent ingrown hairs. that what i always do!</li>
            <li> This got such great reviews I was so excited to be getting to replace my old Braun that is on its way out. I was very disappointed. It takes a very long time to remove the hair and it misses a LOT of it. It seems that the tweezers do not open and close at the right time to grab the hair. The motor also sounds horrible. I cannot imagine this lasting even a year with the way it sounds when you plug it in. Kudos to Amazon for making the return so easy.</li>
            <li> Ok about the same as others, but not cordless</li>
            <li> Yep. Just what I wanted. Takes a little getting used to, but not so bad that it would make me stop using this. Yay to noore shaving!!  Thank you Emjoi!!</li>
            <li> I have been using a epilator for over 15 years, this is my favorite one.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt like some of them can.  If you have had a bad experience with a epilator, try this one.</li>
            <li> I have Italian dark hair, and fair sensitive english skin, so shaving was irriating.  I love this.  it does hurt first time using it.  I use on legs and under arms.  first time was painful, but I use each week, and that is nothing.  will never shave again.  My hair is even coming in finer, not as coarse.</li>
            <li> This is OK. You do have to go over some areas over and over to get the hair out. I find it works better on coarser hair vs finer hair. I&#x27;ve been waxing for decades and have very little growth left. This is great for touch ups and I expect it will save me tons of money in the long run. It worked better on my legs than the bikini area. As for the pain, if you&#x27;re used to waxing, this is nothing. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it since it&#x27;s handy to have something at home for touch ups and between waxing sessions and there&#x27;s no mess like with home waxing kits. I wish it worked better on the first try though.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Emjoi 72 Tweezer Head Epilator.  Performs exactly as described, takes all the hair off where ever I have tried it without much discomfort.  The price was far lower than any other site.  Thanks Amazon.com for your #10 service and prices.  Jane Bowles</li>
            <li> I bought this model five years ago to replace an older generation that failed after two years. This one has not missed a beat, or should I say, hair! The 72 tweezers heads makes this quicker than my former model, and there is virtually no pain. If you use this a couple times and experience pain, don&#x27;t fret, it does subside and disappear with prolonged use. My legs now have sporadic hair growth instead of the forest that was sprouting before. I use it weekly for touch ups instead of shaving every day like before. Invest in one of these for smooth, long lasting hair free legs, underarms, and other areas.</li>
            <li> This thing does not do what it is supposed to. If there are 1,000 hairs on your leg then you can expect this epilator to remove about 100 of them in a ten minute span. It is not extremely painful but for the results that it gives, there should be no pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to waxing. Don&#x27;t waste your money here</li>
            <li> I purchased my wife the Emjoi Emagine because her previous Emjoi finally gave up the ghost after 10 years. She swears by it and upon receiving it, I actually read the manual. Since it is not recommended to share epilators between people, I decided to purchase one for myself (I always shave my arms, legs, chest etc with a razor). I wanted to purchase a different brand and based on the reviews here, I went with the Braun 5180 [[ASIN:B004QI271W Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil 5 Epilator with Ice Glove, Green]] . The shipping was on time as always (great amazon service)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me in my infinite wisdom decided to play guinea pig and experiment using the left(Braun) and right(Emjoi) side of my body for comparison, so here&#x27;s my findings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;72 tweezer head makes the job go quicker and less painful.  Motor feels more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a little bulkier than the Braun.  No light.  Final results good but not like the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my verdict??? I believe they both did the job well and both have their pros and cons. As for this review specifically for the Emjoi, it was much quicker to do the job.  The two spinning heads also kept the skin tight which seemed to lessen the pain.  Unfortunately, when I compared the left and right side of my body, I personally felt the Braun side was smoother.  The major negative complaint on the Braun though was I ended up with 3 bloody pores, still trying to figure out why, maybe due to long hairs being pulled???  This didn&#x27;t happen with the Emjoi though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has always bragged on how she waits 5 to 6 weeks before using the Emjoi again.  She also comments on how her hair grows out less and thinner.  If I could change the purchase of the Emjoi, it would be to get one with a light on it which REALLY makes a difference !![[ASIN:B000NDTO5G Emjoi AP-10L Light Caress, Corded]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have both machines, time will only tell as to the durability of the Braun.  Emjoi had already proven itself in my household after ten years of service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite and she is sticking with it.  I on the other hand will stay with the Braun and only time will tell which one will reign.  Either way, it&#x27;s a win-win situation because of AMAZON.com&#x27;s great prices and service! Thanks for reading !already proven itself in my household after ten years of service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is the Emjoi is my wife&#x27;s favorite and she is sticking with it.  I on the other hand will stay with the Braun and only time will tell which one will reign.  Either way, it&#x27;s a win-win situation because of AMAZON.com&#x27;s great prices and service! Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li> This epilator really saves your time,will not hurt much and less or no ingrown hair problem&lt;br /&gt;but caution don&#x27;t use it on your face though it says it is safe ..until and unless you are pro at using this</li>
            <li> This is easy to use on your legs, but you&#x27;ll have to go over the area a few times for it to catch all the hairs.  The head is a bit big so it&#x27;s a bit harder to use on your armpits, but not impossible.  Overall, it does a good job.  This is my first epilator though, so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  If you get skin irritation from shaving I definitely would recommend trying an epilator.</li>
            <li> My underarm hair barely grows back anymore &amp; between Brazilian bikini waxes, it keeps me smooth. I love this epilator!!!</li>
            <li> Love this!! I had a earlier battery operated single head version that still works but this version seems to have more power because of the direct power supply.  The cord is long enough to plug in the wall and sit comfortably nearby.  It does a very good job removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> After seeing many of the beauty gurus of Youtube give reviews about the epilator, I had to have one. As a person who doesn&#x27;t buy much off the internet, I was skeptical at first but after buying and receiving the product I must say that I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who wonder if it hurts -- yes. The first time is the worst and it does get better. The hair does thin out and its appearance becomes lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my epilator once a week fresh out of the shower for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, is easy to clean, and has a cute little storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not chargeable, it does not have batteries. You plug it in and go, which is great! No one wants batteries to die in the middle of tweezing, so having a plugged in device aids in avoiding ingrown hairs that were half pulled when the little tweezers died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get away from shaving and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this device has gotten rid of underarm shadow and gives me the smoothiest underarms ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Hurts on your face but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this item, and I think it will work for me. The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly as when I use a razor. For those of you who have tender skin - it&#x27;s going to sting, especially so behind the knees. Also, I don&#x27;t have a lot of under arm hair, and using this Emjoi did leave some small red spots when the hair was pulled out.I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your face.    Overall, I am satisfied with this product. Any red spots went away in a very short time. There were no residual discomforts after using this device. My suggestion is to take your time when using this tweezer device, and treat yourself with your favorite body lotion when done.</li>
            <li> Very quick and painless removal! Just in a matter of a few minutes. With the double sided rotation it relay does the job right!</li>
            <li> I am a man, and this was the best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a while. The price at Amazon was amazing. I bought the men&#x27;s version of the ap-18 and I am very happy with it. I would have been happier with the red version, but only slightly because the edges on the head slope up on the men&#x27;s version and down on the ladies. This causes some problems getting into some areas of my skin. I like to be hairless from the neck down, and I have some very coarse hair in places, but this thing plucks even the thickest hairs almost painlessly. There are some tricks to this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, if you have never waxed or epilated before, it will hurt like a mad man. What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting. One thing I have learned is that you should use baby powder. It makes the hairs stand up and the epilator glide over your skin. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t figure that out until I had used the thing for a whole week. Baby powder makes the process ten times less painful and at least two to three times quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most. For instance, I figured that the crack, taint and hole would have been the most painful, but it was the least. That did require some slight acrobatics to accomplish. My wife could not stop laughing at me. I also found that my ribcage was almost unbearable. It was intensely painful and tickled so much I could not hold still. My wife had to do my back, and that also hurt. I found that if someone else did it I could not anticipate the pain so it was worse. If you are very hairy I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring. Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used. The head spins sofast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product. It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use. My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble. And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use. Especially as I had help from my husband. Never had a bikini or leg wax, in fact never have removed the hair on the bikini line. For legs and under arms had always been a razor girl. However, I decided that it was time to spice up my life ( just turned 50). Anyway with hubbies help, I now have a new \\&quot;look\\&quot; , although I have to say there was some distractions along the way with his help :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a hint, make sure you keep the skin taunt, as this allows a good grip but also reduces pain. Although I have to say that the pain is minimal, it is more the shock/surprise factor for first time use. Also important that you trim hair to a reasonable length to allow the tweezers to grab closer to skin.  Great result, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As far as epilators go, this is a great product. It&#x27;s stronger then the battery operated ones I&#x27;ve used, and with the extra tweezing capability it gets the job done faster. Of course it hurts a bit at first use, as some reviewers have mentioned, but tweezing hair will most likely hurt,especially in sensitive areas. The trick to using it and making it less painful, is making sure you take a hot bath or shower prior, and pulling the skin as tight as you can in the area your using the epilator. The tighter the skin, the better contact it has with the hair your trying to remove, and the less it pulls at the skin, which often creates some of the pain. You can also tilt it so only one of the heads is contacting the skin until you get used to using it. In areas where the hair is thicker, you may have to make several passes to get all the hair. Once you use this, if you continue to do maintenance on the tweezed area before all the hair grows back out, it won&#x27;t hurt as bad as the initial use. It also has a nice safety feature that prevents you from pressing the heads down to hard upon your skin, which is a great added feature. I had only minor skin irritation in the area that was tweezed, and it lasted only briefly, so do it a few hours before your planning on exposing the area. I also find moisturizing after tweezing helps diminish this problem. I think it is especially nice in the bikini line areas, where razor bumps are often a problem, there was no redness except for the initial one mentioned before, which is gone very quickly. I went on a camping trip for a week and could stay in shorts with no razor stubble growth, that&#x27;s a bonus!</li>
            <li> An excellent product but ouch. Expected with an epilator. Effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to epilators so I was a little bit nervous about this purchase. After a painful first try, I am mad at myself for not doing this sooner. Waxing is history, and after the first go around the pain in hardly there. I wish I did this sooner. Just remember you can&#x27;t use this one in the shower so you there is a little bit of clean up.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it&lt;br /&gt;Best thing ever  -  at first it stung a little - not much but I got use to it and have told all my friends about it.  Ladies it really works and well well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yes it has all of these extra hair catching teeth, yet due to either maybe both problems of the flat head or I&#x27;ll placed teeth, this barely catches any hairs on curvy surfaces like knees or chin. I had a Gently Gold foe over 10 years that could catch the tiniest hairs til it finally refused to charge where as this couldn&#x27;t even catch ideal hair length according to its manual on my legs. I didn&#x27;t purchase it for my legs but after several facial attempts, I tried it just to see if I was holding it wrong. This wasn&#x27;t meant for a women&#x27;s gentle use area but did well on flat part of shins and calves.</li>
            <li> I had never used an empilator before, but after reading so many good reviews on this particular epilator I decided to buy it and let me tell you it was I was very pleased with the results. Yes, it was painful at the first time using it but after the second time it wasn&#x27;t so bad. I use this mainly for my underarms and I will not go back to shaving! This product is amazing! Price is great!</li>
            <li> Two words:  Pain, inefficient.  Yes, this removes hairs sporadically, but leaves wide gaps to go over again.  There are areas of the body that the pain is negligible, but others, IT HURTS!!!</li>
            <li> Have used emoji products for years. Never disappointed. Epilators take some getting used to. This one works great.</li>
            <li> I have epilating for over 20 years.  This is the best epilator I have used in terms of speed. I can do everything quicker than my old emjoi.  Be sure to place it horizontal to the area you are working on, and pull the skin tight.  I can use it in sensitive areas as long as the skin is tight with no more irritation than any other epilator.     The only downsides for me were having it corded, and it is too big to do smaller areas where you need some precision.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I thought something good, but I made a huge mistake this is not really a good one.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very slow! you have to go on and on for like 4 times per each area, sometimes does not take the hair just cut the hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I will return... I am not happy.</li>
            <li> It works great but my kid can hear it from upstairs and thought it was a blender! It is super LOUD!</li>
            <li> Bought this epilator to help smooth out my naughty guy parts down there, from the shaft down to the poop chute. It worked, for a couple of months. My hair isn&#x27;t all that coarse, it&#x27;s fine; but I couldn&#x27;t understand how that would wear down this little machine so much? After about 3 months, the tweezer head started to become dysfunctional. Started making incredibly choppy sounds as if something was stuck inside of it. (Plus it made the entire thing vibrate a little too hard) I checked it compulsively before buying another tweezer head replacement (30 bucks!). The gears started to chip away from consistent use! I don&#x27;t understand why they won&#x27;t replace their cheap plastic gears with metal if they&#x27;re charging 90$ for this machine? I will no longer buy Emjoi tweezer head replacements, or endorse this specific Emjoi product at all.</li>
            <li> I had the pink emjoi epilator for a year and loved it. I thought that this would be an upgrade for 20 dollars more with two spinning heads. But it was apparent the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t even comparable. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and it takes more than twice as long. I&#x27;m going to rebuy my old model.</li>
            <li> This is the first Epilator I have purchased, so I felt it was unfair to give it a full 5 stars, since I had nothing to compare it to. I read several reviews and watched even more on Youtube. I am very happy I bought this particular model as my first epilator. Surprisingly, I get better results from this thing on my bikini line, than on any other part of my body. My trouble spots are my shins and armpits, but after 3 months of use, I honestly feel they&#x27;re getting better. At first, my shins never felt fully smooth after epilating, but now that the hair is thinning out, they&#x27;re finally smooth. My armpits on the other hand, seem like the hair is breaking more than I was hoping it would. Yes, I am getting better results over time, but I still wish the hair didn&#x27;t break off as often. After the first month of use, I noticed the tweezers didn&#x27;t pick up the hair as well. I called in and the lady told me to use a little rubbing alcohol, and that worked a little better. But I found the best way to clean the epilator, was to use an old toothbrush to actually scrub out any build up in there. I keep it clean and it works perfectly. I&#x27;m especially glad I started using this in the off season when my legs weren&#x27;t \\&quot;on display.\\&quot; I am confident I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer with this thing.   Oh, one more thing. I had issues with ingrown hairs only on my shins. Those suck. They&#x27;re not painful by any means, or even red. They&#x27;re just growing under the skin. So rather than picking them out, I let them grow themselves out, and I&#x27;m having less of an issue with them.</li>
            <li> So far I like this epilator. It does not catch all the little hairs especially if they are thin but in my experience it is less painful than other epilators I tried (e.g. Braun). It has a cord so there is no issue with it dying in the middle of epilation (and having to wait for it to recharge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative is that there is no light on the epilator (which Braun has) so sometimes it is difficult to see the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If epilating often, it does not take too long (for me it took about 0.5 hour for both legs plus some &amp;#34;cleanup&amp;#34; with the tweezers). After shaving it would take longer and possibly would be more painful as there will be more hair to &amp;#34;take care off&amp;#34; (after shaving, more hair will grow at the same stage which will look like more hair). If you never epilated before, I suggest not to start with hair that&#x27;s too long and to start with lower legs. Those will be less painful. Underarms, upper legs and bikini will be more painful. With time the pain will not seem that bad. And of course there is an issue of ingrown hair, which happens with all epilations as as well as waxing. Exfoliation may help. I sometimes like to alternate shaving with epilation which may help with ingrown hair but then the process takes a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Great for legs, underarms, and the bikini area. I would suggest used 5% Lidocaine numbing cream to numb the area before using it. I tried using it w/o the numbing cream, but couldn&#x27;t bear the pain. However, cream ELIMINATED the pain in the bikini area and underarms. I let it sit for 2hrs (because i feel asleep), but 1hr is sufficient to numb the area.</li>
            <li> Of all the things on my daily personal maintenance list, shaving my legs is at the top. I can&#x27;t stand the stubble as it rubs against my pants, and my husband gets a little queasy if the hair on my legs is longer than his buzz-cut head. As women, I think we&#x27;ve all played around with epilators, and the love/hate division is right down the middle. Of all the epilators out there, the eMagine by Emjoi has the most aggressive design, including 72 tweezing elements that Emjoi boasts is the most on the market. While I never look forward to \\&quot;epilator night,\\&quot; I keep telling myself that six weeks&#x27; worth of smooth legs is worth the discomfort. The eMagine is efficient and feels like an epilator feels--there&#x27;s no getting around that. The eMagine is comfortable in the hand, glides easily across the skin, and has two power settings for fine or coarser hair. The eMagine is not rechargeable and must be plugged in to operate. The blade housing can be removed from the unit, and I clean it with keyboard air-based cleaner.  As far as epilators go, the eMagine is a tough machine and should provide the user with 6 weeks of shave-free strutting.</li>
            <li> I had the Braun SE7681 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator and the battery was starting to die, so I decided to try a Emjoi. I wish I had Emjoi first! It is MUCH much better. It works like a dream!!! I think it might be a little louder and you can&#x27;t use it in the shower, but those are the only cons. It gets more hair than the Braun ever did and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> When my Emjoi Optima AP-99 died last week, fear shot through me at the prospect of spending months shopping for the right epilator. Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t take too much online research to discover the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine. I read quite a few reviews before deciding on this epilator, and for once in my life, I made the best choice right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My epilator arrived quickly after I placed my order. Another plus. Today was the day of discovery: I used my Emjoi AP-18 Emagine for the first time. How thrilled I was at the way this epilator felt in my hand compared to the AP-99, which was bulky and awkward. The Emagine glided over my skin without dragging or pulling. It removed the hair quickly and completely without my having to go over a spot five or six times. Even though the Emagine looks large and heavy, it&#x27;s not at all. It&#x27;s lighter and much more comfortable to hold than my former epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell? I&#x27;m so excited, I could spit! :D</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL WITH SHORT HAIR. IF YOU WANT A SMOOTH SHAVE YOU STILL HAVE TO USE RAZOR. I&#x27;VE GOT A FEW INGROWN HAIRS TOO FROM USING IT. I HOPE THE MORE I USE IT THE BETTER IT GETS. BUT LIKE I SAID WON&#x27;T GIVE A SMOOTH SHAVE LIKE RAZOR.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate this thing. The pain is beyond this world and it left behind stubble! I would not recommend this for people who have coarse hair. I think these work better on fine. It works fine everywhere else, but my legs are another story....Not worth $81.00. I will be returning this tomorrow.</li>
            <li> My Braun Silk epil died after giving me 3 awesome years of smooth, hair-free legs, arms, and underarms.  I bought the Emjoi hoping it would shorten the amount of time it takes to go over large areas like the legs.  Two heads are NOT better than one.  This epilator broke most hairs instead of pulling them out.  And it does not get to short hairs at all.  It was hardly better than shaving, a week later I had horrible prickly stubble.   I am going back to Braun, and all you need is just the basic 5180.  It is definitely not a fast epilator, but it gets the job done right.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissapointed with this epilator. After using and loving a Braun Silk-epil epilator for over a year I thought it might be time to get a new one. Read some reviews and decided to try this one. Big mistake! Worked way worse than my overused year old epilator. Returned the epilator and am going back to Braun!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing epilator I have ever used! I swear to you, it is like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first epilator about 10 years ago and loved the convenience, but it wasn&#x27;t that powerful and ran through batteries like crazy! After about a year, I upgraded to an Emjoi Golden Caress (I think that&#x27;s what it was called) which could be plugged in or charged. The charging function was kind of ridiculous because you never knew how long the charge would last and it operated at a reduced speed when it wasn&#x27;t plugged in. I just used it plugged in all the time. Then, when we moved overseas 4 years ago, despite using adapters and what not, my epilator died (same thing happened with my blow dryer and 3 of my husband&#x27;s electric razors). Since I thought the same thing might happen to a new one, I waited until we moved back to the US to buy a new one. In the meantime, I went back to shaving my legs and waxing my arms, underarms, upper lip, and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with my previous Emjoi when I used it while it was plugged in, but the difference between the two models is absolutely night and day! The Emagine is much faster. The first time I used it I would guess that I hadn&#x27;t done anything to remove my arm hair in over 3 months, so there was a significant amount of hair. It took me less than 15 minutes to get both arms completely hair-free! With my previous model, that definitely would have been more like a 30-40 minute job and I probably would have had to put in time later to go back over any areas that weren&#x27;t perfect. Not only was the Emagine quicker, but I didn&#x27;t require any touch ups - it seemed to really remove the hair uniformly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain goes, this is definitely the most comfortable epilator I have used. I really think that it just feels like a weird, prickly sensation. There&#x27;s also something comforting about being in control of the epilator; if you&#x27;re trying to remove hair and it hurts and you want to take a break, you can! Ithink that the speed of the model also seems to reduce the pulling sensation that you get with some other epilators. I really don&#x27;t think that this model hurts at all, but I think the fact that I&#x27;ve been waxing and epilating for a while has made me a little more tolerant of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people are more familiar with wax than they are with epilating, so let me compare them a little. If you&#x27;ve waxed before, I think that epilating is definitely less painful because it doesn&#x27;t grab the skin. I also think it&#x27;s much cleaner than wax. For example, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wax being antimicrobial or the aesthetician dipping the spatula in it more than once or if the wax is going to make you break out. Epilators also grab hair much closer to the skin level than wax can, so you can actually spend more of your time smooth! I always HATED waiting for my hair to be long enough that I could wax again! Also, between waxing and epilating, the cost difference is a no-brainer: At one of the spots here in Dallas that I think is clean, well-priced, professional, etc., it would cost me over $160 to get my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and upper lip waxed. That&#x27;s more than double what the Emagine cost me! And I never need an appointment to epilate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice, though: Don&#x27;t use an epilator for the first time if you have somewhere you need to be! Even after years of doing it, I get bright red dots on the areas that I epilate and they usually last for 2-3 hours. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction or more obvious on my skin because I&#x27;m downright pale, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have found that I NEVER have to shave anymore.  I use this thing every 5-10 days, (even longer if I&#x27;m not being picky) and I&#x27;m always ready for shorts.  I haven&#x27;t had the ingrown hair problem that some have spoken of, but I exfoliate with Neutrogena&#x27;s grapefruit scrub about once every 1-2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is a BARGAIN in my view, since I don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;did I shave?\\&quot; before going anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have used this type of Epilator for years and this one is greatly improved over prior versions and hopefully due to better head design it will not burn up  in 3 or 4 years as the others have.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I felt this worked perfect on the pits. It definitely made my legs less stubby, but still didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I felt this was due to the sheer mass that is on the legs rather than the underarms. Ya dig?</li>
            <li> I am a male with dark, thick hair and I purchased this to use on my chest and abs. It works great and the hair takes much less time to come back than shaving. It is quite painful sometimes, but it is something you can get used to. As far as I can tell, the men&#x27;s one is the same and you should save money and just buy this version. The only problem with epilation is ingrown hairs. I purchased some tend skin to help with that and it has worked great as well. This is definitely a good investment if you want lasting results that you can do yourself at home.</li>
            <li> It works well. As for those who say its painful, I would say that depends on how hairy you are. I am very hairy and it wasn&#x27;t too bad. My only concern is that the machine its self feels very light so I would never use it over tile. I do not feel it would survive being dropped a single time. I have never tried waxing before or any other epilators so I have nothing to compare it to, but it works well and my skin is smooth as silk now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,having used the epilady some twenty  years ago. This is so much better,less painful, and very easy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in 24 years and this is the best \\&quot;plucker\\&quot; I have ever used.  This is the latest and greatest.  It is fast, efficient and versatile.  I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 Emjoi epilator models over the last 10 years -- this was the 4th Emjoi purchase for me and since I&#x27;ve previously only had the best experiences with Emjoi epilators, I was shocked at the poor performance of this model. I see a lot of positive reviews for this device, which really surprises me since this was absolutely the worst epilator model I ever used. I&#x27;m experience with epilation and so I know this was not user error -- as I said, I&#x27;ve used 3 other models consistently over the last 10 years. This Emjoi AP-18 Emagine frequently caught my skin, missed a lot of the hairs (sometimes short ones, sometimes fairly long ones!), and worst of all it caused abrasions on my skin. The first time it did this the abrasion wasn&#x27;t too severe and having had only positive experiences with Emjoi products, I thought perhaps it was my fault and exercised extra care during my next usage attempts. Then it caused an abrasion severe enough on my underarm that it took 3 weeks to heal and I still have a light pink discolored area (not from catching the skin, just from the tweezers rotating over my skin without me applying much pressure at all and I held the skin taught). Considering all the positive reviews, there&#x27;s a chance I got a bad unit but why risk it?</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because I have no idea how well it works--I apparently didn&#x27;t have the pain tolerance to use it, and so I returned it. I was going to use it on my legs to cut down how often I have to shave, but when it pulled the hairs it almost felt like little electrical shocks--tolerable at first, but gradually intensifying until I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 Emagine is the best epilator I have ever used and I have been using them for about 10 years.  It exceeds expectations.  Very light weight and easy to use.  The additional tweezers on the head reduce hair removal time and discrease discomfort. I spent two days researching the Emagine and at the time of my purchase (August 2010) Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Went from shaving every three days to using this once every two weeks. The extra price is worth the time saved.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, works very well!</li>
            <li> Before I begin let me say that I am a guy. Got this because I was tired of shaving everything downstairs virtually everyday. It definitely hurt the first time using it but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I will say however that it&#x27;s too much for me to use on the thicker coarser pubic hair. Hair type will definitely determine the level of pain/discomfort. This works great on legs and other areas. It does take a few passes to get all the hair but I didn&#x27;t feel that it took an excessive number of passes. But to really get this thing to work you do need to hold the skin taut and perform a few yoga maneuvers. That combined with how expensive this thing is is the reason for the 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> What can I say except that I reordered a 2nd one, because everyone in my family wants to use mine.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had much success with this. Missed a ton of hair and I ended up shaving. Haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> When my Gold Caress Epilator died, I bought the Emagine.  Don&#x27;t wait for yours to die.  Just go ahead and get this one NOW.  It is sooooo much faster, you will finish in half the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator to see if I could remove my leg hair faster than the Braun unit I have.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed that it does work any faster.  The dual heads work well, but the hair on any section of the body only grows mostly one way.  The large head makes if diffucult to reach some areas.  I use my Braun epilator to get the smaller, hard to reach areas.  The motor is powerful on this epilator and is great for getting course hair quickly.  After epilating for a long time, hair becomes finer.  I have to use the slow speed to pick up the finer hair so the fast speed is too powerful and useless after a while.  I wish this epilator had a LED light like my Braun unit has.  That would improve it tremendously.</li>
            <li> This is a great Epilator. Not sure if I have gotten used to the hair being pulled out by the root...but it seems this one hurts less than others I have tried. It works just as I expected it would. I would like to find one that gets all the hair out with just one going over, but I have not found that yet. It is a keeper though, and I would recommend it. Love the color too.</li>
            <li> This is the best epilator I have found. Quick and efficient, cuts down the time spent epilating by at least half.  A very powerful and sturdy machine that I can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst ever, I have ever bought. Total waste of money. I bought it in desperation as I lost my precious previous one. It hardly worked. while running on the same area, your hair continue to smile in your face &#x3D; get me if you can! and this machine gives up.&lt;br /&gt;I would never ever buy this or let my family go near this after an extremely frustrating use of this machine.</li>
            <li> I had another model of this product for years, but it finally died on me.  This one is easy to use and I love that I can &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; without the blood-letting I experience with a razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Delivered early and paid $40.00 less than advertised elsewhere. Fa</li>
            <li> Love it once I got desensitized to the little &amp;#34;bee stings&amp;#34;.  Does the job I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have been using Emjoi for many years.  I think it is excellent and possibly the best hair removal product on the market.  Unfortunately the one I had fell down and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Hence, I purchased a new one.  If taken care of, the product lasts for many years. I even find the hair grows back sparser and finer.</li>
            <li> This is the third epilator that I have owned.  I have used Epilady, Braun and now the Emjoi Emagine and for the first time in three years I love the fact that I epilate my legs over shaving.  It is so much faster than the Braun or Epilady and grabs the hairs that the other epilators missed.  Love it and would highly recommend over Brawn or Epilady.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a coworker said that a similar model really works. I received it yesterday and tried it on my forearms, then legs, then the peach fuzz on my face, and lastly my hairline on my neck. Today I did my legs and under arms. I have fine blonde hair that is darker and more coarse on the back of my neck, ankles, and underarms.My underarms were the most painful, but I held that skin tight and powered through it. Underarms are the only thing I have to shave every day; once I placed my order a week ago I quit shaving so the hair would be long enough. I can&#x27;t believe how this little machine tweezed every bit of that underarm hair and that skin is so smooth now! I really wanted it to work on the peach fuzz on my face, and by using only the front set of tweezers, I think that it pulled them all out. I used witch hazel when finished and followed up with argon oil because it is an anti inflammatory. I had no redness or irritation on my sensitive skin. Only time will tell if it just broke off the fuzz or really pulled it. I&#x27;ve tried other hair removal methods (80&#x27;s epilator, electrolysis gel pads, no no) that didn&#x27;t work. If this only works on my underarms, I will be beyond thrilled with this purchase! I will likely buy a smaller epilater for  my face if I feel that it really is removing that fuzz.</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator.  It works a lot better than my previous one, which I purchased 9 years ago, and had about a 30-40 tweezer head. This one leaves my skin smoother, softer.  I feel absolutely no pain in using it, but I&#x27;ve been epilating for more than 12 years.  If you are using an epilator for the first time, you will likely experience some pain.  Also, no pain in using on armpits.  I don&#x27;t, however, use it in *cough, cough* more delicate areas.  I&#x27;m afraid that would cause me to scream.  I don&#x27;t use the ice glove, but I love the small bag that comes with it for storage.</li>
            <li> This device works great in the areas I used it that cooperated. It hurts of course, but what do you expect. I bought another type of epilator a while back, which was wireless, and this one blows that one out of the water. The head is somewhat narrow compared to the other one, but the power behind it is nice.. it rarely bogs down unless you are pressing entirely to hard against the skin. There were a couple times I got my finger nipped by the middle part and it stung a bit but wasn&#x27;t really painful. Overall a great quality product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product two days in a row, following the instructions, but was left with stubble. I went to try again the third day only to find that it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. There was no power. I&#x27;m returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> awful service. awful price</li>
            <li> First use will be painful. You&#x27;re pulling hair from the root...what do you expect? After repeat use your hair will return finer.   I always use the Emjoi immediately after shower as pores are open. As with shaving you should exfoliate. Successful for upper lip, chin, underarm, bikini line, legs...NOT eyebrows. Eyebrows require precision.  It may appear at a higher price point although consider how much time and $ you&#x27;re saving by doing it at home. Additional bonus is you can do a touch up at any time rather than making an emergency appointment at your waxing salon.  enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my first and only epilator. When I first turned it on, the sound was a lot more frightening than I expected it to be. Since it&#x27;s my first one, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any louder or quieter than other brands, but there is definitely a loud sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, there are only 2 speed settings and an off switch. Cleaning it out is easy; I just use the brush provided and sweep through it after each use. It&#x27;s corded (a very very long cord), and has a plastic cover that I can never seem to keep track of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go over my legs several times to be sure as much hair has been removed, and it takes 10 minutes tops to finish with both legs.</li>
            <li> do not buy this product. customer service is horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing some youtube reviews on epilators. This particular one received the best reviews and so I decided to purchase it after some major contemplation (considering the price and the fear that it would hurt too much). I tried this the day I got it and I will say...it hurt. I wont say though that it hurts more than waxing. It&#x27;s a pinching pain that you get used to eventually. I have used this all over my body. As for underarms...it&#x27;s quite easy...if you stretch the area you only have to swipe twice to be done one side. Arms are the least painful. As for my legs, because I&#x27;m skinny, I think it hurts more on my lower legs than thighs.   I&#x27;m not too hairy but this has definiely lessened the darkness on my underarms and I usually do not need to epilate more than twice a month. Great product, I would recommend to all my friends. In fact, my sister bought one after using mine!</li>
            <li> Not a good product to use on big patches of hair. Love it for small patches. I was told that you can get use to it, but I was not able to with my legs. It was way to painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she has always used one of the Braun products but they just didn&#x27;t last, between her and my 2 17 yr old daughters, it broke down too quickly. She loves this epilator, it used to take her an hour to do her legs, now she&#x27;s done in 20 minutes and a lot smoother to the touch.I highly reccommend this to all you ladies, your men will appreciate how your legs feel.</li>
            <li> review is from a guy :    Yes it works, it does what it says, but be advised it DOES hurt, especially when you are doing the side area or obliques area of your torso/chest ... as well if you try to go lower than your belly button any you&#x27;ll be wishing you didn&#x27;t ... just shave there as it friggin hurts...    Allegedly you get used to the pain but so far I haven&#x27;t, but it DOES work, you DO need to go over some areas repeatedly, and you need your significant other to do your center of your back and upper back as you can&#x27;t really reach it yourself.    Do it in the shower or you&#x27;ll be cleaning up your hairs all over the place</li>
            <li> I already owned the emjoi epi silk when I ordered this, it just took so long to remove the hair from my legs that I hardly ever used it.  So I bought this one, which is supposed to be faster.  My problem with this one is that instead of tweezing the hairs, it breaks a lot of them in half, so it&#x27;s not accomplishing much more than if I had shaved.  I also find that this misses some of the shorter hairs, which the epi silk caught.</li>
            <li> When the tweezer heads in the Braun epilator that I&#x27;ve had for three years got too dull, I decided to try something new. I was looking for an epilator that could do the job faster and thought this would be it. Wrong! I was absolutely shocked at how poorly this product performed. I had to go over and over the same short stubbly hairs that my aging Braun could easily pluck out with no problem in one pass. The only reason I switched is because I thought more tweezer heads would mean less time, but I can see it would take me many times as long with this product. And forget the whole bit about lifting up short and flat hairs..this product is so inefficent at that, while the Braun could pull out partial ingrowns in just one pass. What on earth was I thinking. Amazon tells me they will take it back, thank goodness, since it is NOT cheap! This was the first and will be the last experience I ever have with an Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Read the directions thoroughly. Used as instructed. Removed only the very fine facial hair, not any of the annoying longer or thicker individual hairs that pop up. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from amazon after reading the reviews and deciding that I need to try something new from shaving everyday for keeping my body hairless and smooth. I am very hairy with thick black hair especially on my legs.   This works 90% of the time for me. It does not \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; hair out 100% of the time, more like 80-90%. The skin is not as smooth as it would be if you were waxing your body, but it is much easier to use and way less messy. I have to use it at least couple of times a week to keep my arms and legs hairless. It take about 15-20 mins every time I use it. I have used it on my legs, hands and underarms.  It is not as painful as I expected it to be and you get used to the sensation after couple of uses. But I was familiar with waxing and threading before I started epilating. I do make sure that I have a hot shower and exfoilate before I epilate.  So far - so good. I would recommend the product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator to replace an older Emjoi one that didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers. I was hoping I&#x27;d have the same experience as the reviewer who ordered the corded version but got the cordless (and more expensive) one by mistake, but no such luck. The cord is a little annoying, but you do get a lot of power so it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator gets the job done quickly and something about the number of tweezers or the shape of the head really helps make it less painful and most of all FAST. I&#x27;m happy I purchased it and I hope it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I wish the main gear was metal instead of plastic. I enjoy the product and this is my 4th one in 10 years. I have not had to shave my legs for 10 years using this product and my legs remain smooth, stubble free and hair free. Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got this epilator and have only used it once.  I still feel a few prickly hairs, but that is to be expected.  You cannot expect it to get them all on the first use.  Hair grows at different speeds so wait a few days and go over the hair again.  That should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pain issue goes.... WOW!!!!  IT HURTS!!!! Anyone who says otherwise is either lying or has no nerve endings.  To the point it&#x27;s almost a slight burn.  I don&#x27;t think you get use to it, it just doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad when most of the hair has been removed from the area.  I have used it on my bikini area, but not yet under my arms.  I will do that in a few days.  I just shaved 2 days ago so the hair does need to grow a little.  I&#x27;m not looking forward to it, but if it lasts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m impressed and that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, don&#x27;t be too intimidated by how quickly the tweezers rotate.  It scared me at frist.  :)</li>
            <li> Like the headline says, this epilator works well up until the cheapo plastic drive gears on either the epilator head, or the epilator itself wear out due to regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would be much better suited to have at least brass gearing to stand up to dude hairs with regular use (weekly to monthly in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have both owned and worn out 3 of these.  The most recent was purchased on Nov 17, 2014, which equates to approximately less than 3 months of regular use before they have crapped out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than waxing?  For sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money for the lifetime I have experienced?  Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I would gladly pay an extra $5-10 dollars for Emjoi to get their act together and use quality materials for the gearing on the heads/body of this epilator.  That alone would no doubt increase the lifespan beyond of this product beyond ~3 months for a user such as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV, I am a hairy dude.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my Braun epilator motor stopped working after 7 months of use so I purchased this epilator and after paying this much money I thought it would be an excellent product. I was wrong as I have used this epilator and it seems to shave my leg hair not pull them, so in one to two days time I have hair growing again. I did not have this problem with the Braun epilator as it pulled the hair out and my skin was smooth and hair free for at least a week. I would have bought another Braun but I did not want the motor to burn out again and have to replace it. I guess there is no happy medium with this type of product it is a hit or miss when it comes to epilators.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product&lt;br /&gt;A little painful, but you get use to it.</li>
            <li> Not better then Braun Silk epil, gives ingrown hair, skin coming off giving rashes.</li>
            <li> this epilator works wonders. I&#x27;ve had many before and after having read the many reviews I finally bought it and I do not regret it one bit. In NO time are my legs free of any hair, smooth and all of this with very little pain. I highly recommend this nice looking shiny red little \\&quot;thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Works better than waxing and cuts down time. Yes removing hair is painful. However, after it&#x27;s been pulled once, the pain level lowers because the hair follicle gets use to it, and comes back slower. I would not recommend for the face unless you are a man. The product is a little hard to get in  the creases (not including underarms), but other than that I will not be returning this one. You can use this epilator any time of the day, as many times in a day you want, and you do not have to &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; in more ways than one, like wax, and clean up is easy. Helps lower or stop the pain you get from shaving and does not remove skin like wax does. Also, exfoliating with a sugar scrub will help with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The Emagine is a great epilator-I&#x27;m impressed with how thorough it is. But it does have a few draw-backs. First, you really need to us it every day for the first few weeks  in order to get maximum results. It&#x27;s really tough to do anything else while you use it,so that&#x27;s time that has to be dedicated to that specific purpose. Second, no matter  how often you epilate, it&#x27;s very tough to get smooth enough to pass the touch test. I&#x27;ve noticed that it is particularly difficult to get smooth results over boney or prominent areas like shins and knees. On the other hand, it&#x27;s truly fabulous on slower-growth areas like the bikini line. The third draw-back is how noisy it is. The manual recommends using the Emagine at night to give any redness a chance to fade. But I have 7 children who are trying to SLEEP at night, so I have to hide in a far corner of the house so as not to keep them up. Still, I am very happy with this purchase. Consider it an investment. Much easier and cheaper than waxing,and you save money  on disposable razor costs.</li>
            <li> ... and this one takes the cake! Absolutely amazing. And compared to others, this one is practically pain-free. I could feel the difference in the results between this and the single row of tweezers models. Powerful and quick. One pass accomplishes what it took several to do with every other epilator I have tried. I know this may sound crazy, but it works so well that I almost miss getting to use it more often (being new and all ...) Definitely the cream of the crop.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by getting to the facts about MY experience with this epilator.  It&#x27;s just like any other epilator meaning you have to keep going over areas because it doesn&#x27;t remove the ingrown hair, or the fine hair within one stroke like it states.  The settings is either too fast or too slow when it comes to removing the fine hairs.  I used this 3 times within two weeks because I hate to admit I&#x27;m a pretty hairy person.  That should tell you your hair will grow back within a few days.  Not 4-6 weeks.  If you have a lot of testosterone and your hair grows fast like mine I would say you will be hair free for 2-3 days max!  I used this last Friday and I have little hair spikes throughout my legs already.  The Emjoi post epilation cream doesn&#x27;t work either, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have had to use this 3 times within two weeks. The other irritating thing is once you think you&#x27;re done removing your hair, you go back and find some stragglies that you know you ran the epilator over but can&#x27;t figure out how you manage to miss that certain area thus causing you to have to go over the same spot again.  Now the good thing about this is that when I started on one leg at 8:23 p.m., I was done with both legs probably before 8:56 p.m..  I cleaned up my mess and forgot I was timing my hair removal and remembered to look at the clock at 8:56.  The reason I timed this was because my old epilator took me about 48 minutes to an hour to remove hair from both my legs.  That&#x27;s very time consuming to me.  I say this OK because it is fast but there&#x27;s nothing special that this does that my other epilator don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wish I had heard of these like 15 years ago! I felt like a body hair expert (because, for a female, I have dark, coarse body hair and shaving leaves stubble and ingrown hairs, waxing is alright but expensive and obnoxious to have to go get it done all the time and/or it hurts and sucks to do it yourself. I have gotten some laser hair removal but its so expensive! I&#x27;m probably going to get the tria (at home laser hair remover) but I got this in the meantime until I save up for the tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great! Now, it is painful as hell sometimes. I have a decently high tolerance to pain and yet sometimes I&#x27;m like gritting my teeth trying to just hurry and get through it. It&#x27;s basically tweezing a million hairs at once so you can imagine the pain of tweezing a hair somewhere sensitive but times a million. That&#x27;s my warning, is that it can and usually is painful. BUT, I&#x27;ve noticed it gets less painful each time. Also, I always take advil or some type of pain reliever before doing it. It helps some. (Probably not good to do this but I also did it while slightly intoxicated once too and it was still painful but not bad since I was too buzzed to really care haha). First time is a killer. Especially in some areas... for me, the tops of my thighs, the bottom (or underside) of the top of my calves (like right below the back of the knee), etc. Oh, I also recently started doing my underarms with it too which is awesome to finally see them look nice and practically hairless but that is PAIN! I mean I would have bitten down on a belt strap if it had been nearby. haha. I think its because my legs are at least used to past torturous methods like waxing and hair creams, etc but my underarms have ONLY been shaven. They actually bled a bit but I just showered right after and put on a soft dove deodorant and all was well. There are also numbing creams or sprays you can buy too but I haven&#x27;t tried any yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the pain issue, its amazing. I use it pretty much everywhere. Arms, legs, underarms, bikini area, even my lower back and happy trail. Oh and sometimes the back of my neck. (I&#x27;m not THAT hairy, I just don&#x27;t like hair and mine is a bit darker so I feel better without it. -And I have a weird hairline on the back of my neck). Sometimes the first few times I got little bumps. Maybe irritation or something but it went away. Oh, I&#x27;ve also used it on my face because I have little whiskers on my chin I always tweeze and because I have peach fuzz on the sideburn area. It worked great for that as well and really does get all the littlest hairs whether separate random hairs or tiny peach fuzz. Sometimes you want to go over the area again and again until you see or feel its all gone. I mix up going up and down where the hair is and then will go around in circles (which is usually what works best). I thought at first that you would go against the hair slowly but it actually works best (in my opinion) to go somewhat fast in circular motions over the hair you want to get. Like on my legs I&#x27;ll usually go over them first from down to up in strips as if I was shaving and then I&#x27;ll go over numerous times in circular motions. Just hold it to your skin close but not pushing and its pretty easy to follow the directions and all so just hold it to where the button is closest to your skin. As in it is supposed to be held a certain way to go against the hair follicles a certain way but not really anything different than how you would shave or wax, etc. There are videos on how to use it and to watch people use it which I felt helped to see because it shows you the pace and circular motions, etc. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have probably known that and just went up and down. Anyways, there&#x27;s a lot of different epilators out there but I did research and chose this one because I liked that it had the most tweezer things. (72 I think?) I was wondering if it really would do what it says and would get hairs that are like .05 cm or whatever the ad says. Well, for the most part it does! Sometimes you have to go over and over or push a little or whatever but for the most part it gets everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downfall, since hair grows in waves or phases (I think thats the more technical term or what the laser hair removal technicians call it) but you can use this epilator and get all your hair but days later have a tiny bit of stubble. It&#x27;s mostly probably hair that was in the &amp;#34;just budding&amp;#34; phase (anagen phase?). Anyways, for me I was a little disappointed at first thinking I&#x27;d still have to shave along with doing the epilator. I did maybe the first week or 2 and haven&#x27;t needed to since. I think that the more you keep up with epilating your (talking about legs here) hair, the less it grows back and honestly I sometimes don&#x27;t even remember the last time I&#x27;ve used a shaver on my legs at all! My bikini line is immaculate and I&#x27;ve never had that before. I was a swimmer in high school and always felt embarrassed for having razor burn around my bikini line and also never felt like I could show my legs unless I had shaven that day. Now, I can and will put on shorts or walk around the house (with boyfriend) in underwear or wear leggings and can pull them up without worrying because they are always hairless and even if they need to be done again its only sparse hairs here and there. It&#x27;s an amazing feeling for someone like me who thought that until I spend a fortune and years on laser hair removal treatments that I was just a hairy girl that always hid my body with clothes and spent too much money and time on grooming and different things that never REALLY did enough to give me the confidence of smooth legs or no stubble or razor burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rambling but I wanted to say that this is an amazing product and that it works and that yes, it has cons like the pain, but, it pays for itself in like 1-2 uses compared to paying for waxing, it hurts about the same as waxing (it&#x27;s just more constant as you&#x27;re going on and on around and around rather than just the initial burn from each wax strip being pulled off) and it can be helped with advil, numbing creams/gels/sprays, etc, booze and narcotics (no I&#x27;m kidding). It&#x27;s worth it and the only last thing I&#x27;ll say is to clean it out and sort of like use the little white bristle brush thing after every few good rounds with it to get any hair out of the tweezing area. It comes out during use but it works best if you keep stopping here and there and just clean it out a bit sometimes. Do this somewhere you can either vacuum or sweep or on a towel because the hairs all fall and shoot out and they get all over the floor and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, thats it for my novel. Good luck and I hope that was useful to anyone. I am really glad that I purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li> This product is too painful to use.  I have tried using it after a hot shower like suggested but still cannot handle the pain.  I will be looking for a refund.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair smaller than 2-3 mm but does the job well and quickly. Especially on underarms.</li>
            <li> I have used an Epilady since the late 80s.  My last one, a Legend, recently started cutting off the hairs instead of pulling them out ... leaving that after shaving bristle.  Since it was time to buy a new one, I thought I would try the Emjoi AP-18 Dual head.  WOW!  What a difference!  My Epilady, when new did a very good job of getting the hairs ... *but* I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it pulled my skin in with the hairs.  It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how taut I pulled my skin, it would still manage to pull in my skin.  This Emjoi doesn&#x27;t pull my skin, leave little blood blisters, or hurt.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve been doing epilators for a while, so the hairs are use to being pulled out, but the difference is so impressive!  It does leave my legs, and bikini line VERY Smooth.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!  :-)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really rough hair.  It took it all off!  It is not entirely painless, for your hair is stuck to you, but because it is going so fast, you just feel it rather quickly.  It pays for itself on the first 3 uses.  When this one dies, we&#x27;re sure to buy a new one.  Greatly recommend, for stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shortly after purchasing a Philips model.  I am new to epilating but wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with the Philips&#x27; performance at grabbing the last 10% of my hair.  I am so sorry I ever purchased this Emjoi.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it also doesn&#x27;t grab most of the hair!  I had some long hairs that I had neglected with the Philips but the Emjoi didn&#x27;t grab them.  It barely grabbed ANYTHING.  It sounds powerful and it looks powerful but in reality, it just doesn&#x27;t work.  Even if it did, the way that it is set up makes it terrible for bony areas such as the knee, ankle, and bikini line.  Save your money and buy a different epilator.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie using an epilator and this is my first time and first epilator and let me tell you it hurts like HELL!!! It hurt so much I had to take so many breaks cause it was that bad! So far today I only done one leg! It hurt so bad and so much I couldn&#x27;t do both legs in one day and my first leg took me hours to do because of the pain!!! At first when I used this epilator on my leg it felt like my flesh was being ripped out! No joke! It took so long to do only one leg because it&#x27;s so hard to deal with the all the pain. It also drew some red blood dots and actually drew small specks of blood. I left loads of little red dots all over my leg from all the hairs being ripped out. It said the small red dots will go away in a few hours it&#x27;s been 8 hours and they still have not fade one bit. On top of that I am disappointed it left some hair stubble and broke some of the hairs off instead of pulling the hairs. Hopefully if I keep using this epilator it will get better and better. They say if you keep using the epilator the hairs grow back softer, lighter, and slower and it hurts less and less everytime you use it. It did hurt a wee bit less when I kept using it. But it&#x27;s my first time so what do I expect. I have really thick coarse black body hairs with really pale ghost white skin which is really sensitive. All in all the epilator is good but could be better. I&#x27;m always gonna keep this in mind... \\&quot;BEAUTY IS PAIN\\&quot; But for the most part my legs are pretty smooth and pulled out about 75% of the hairs but 25% were broken off. If you&#x27;re a newbie like me and have sensitive baby white skin with thick dark hairs and this is your first time using an epilator Expect lots and lots of pain! But keep in mind... Beauty is pain!</li>
            <li> I tried this epilator (I have not used other models or brands) because shaving can be annoying.  It works pretty well, but be prepared to clean up a lot of little hairs.  Unfortunately, it is time-consuming to use as it takes several passes to remove all hair, and forget trying to use it on soft/cushy areas of skin--it will pull your skin into the unit.  I went back to shaving because the abrasiveness of the process really irritated my skin, and when my hair grew back it hurt (for some reason it was more prickly?? which doesn&#x27;t make sense.)</li>
            <li> The item was never received althpugh my credit card was billed. I have been to the post office and they cannot track it. I will never order anything from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Takes alot less time than my old one.But not for the weak.It is painful,especially the first time.Gets better each time you use it.Legs smooth for so much longer than with shaving,like 2 weeks longer. Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> Ive used it MAYBE 6 times, and it has fallen apart. The heads lock up and wear away the plastic drive gear. This only gets worse and worse. To top that off, after using it I can still find hair that it didnt pull out; after going over the same spot multiple times. I used to have a Satinelle, and I used it for over ten years with awesome results. Tried to find another, but decided on this one. Wow. What a BIG mistake. This is a waste of your money. Get something else- anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade for my current epilator, but it did not do a good job. It was very painless but didnt pull the hair out form the roots. It only cut them so they were back within a few days. My current epiator works better even tho it takes longer.</li>
            <li> I am (was) a huge fan of waxing. I hate shaving because I have sensitive skin and either get ingrown hairs or rasor bumps in sensitive areas, therefore I waxed. Waxing of course is a little messy and a little more time consuming, but the real downfall was that you have to let your hair growout before you can do it again! I just recently discovered threading and was on a mission to find the thread so I could do my own legs/body cause it got the small hair. On this search I came across this and I can only regret that I never looked before. I LOVE THIS THING! As a previous waxer (done it since I was 14 and ever since) the pain factor that everyone talks about was non existent! However, we did do my husbans back and that took forever...I have seriously never seen a bigger wimp! The point tho is if you have any prior experience it is not bad at all! And even so,if it did hurt the sacrifice is so worth it. This thing isn&#x27;t joking when it says it gets her to .05mm! So worth every penny! I will never ever wax, shave, nair again!</li>
            <li> I use this product only for removing armpit hair. While it removes quite a few and not with much pain, it doesn&#x27;t remove all of them. I have to use tweezers to totally get rid of all the armpit hair. So, it makes the epilation less time consuming, but a user shouldn&#x27;t expect it to remove all of their hair in any body area.</li>
            <li> Great epilator! Have been using Emjoil products for 10 years.  Wish motor lasted longer than 2-3 yrs. If you wax then you would love the convenience of the Emjoi. No mess no fuss and removes hair from root.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I bought it for about $90, and it was well worth the price! I had previously been using Braun&#x27;s SE 3170 silk epilator, and this was infinitely better!  The Braun epilator actually chaffed my skin and left it irritated. It also made epilating more painful because it had so many fewer tweezers and the tweezers spun at a slower rate. This epilator pulls the hairs out MUCH more quickly and with a great amount of ease!! It also gets hairs that are extremely short! My Braun epilator would only get the longer hairs, which left for prickly skin even after epilating. This epilator works GREAT for the bikini area, the legs, and underarms. While epilating the bikini area can be particularly painful in general, this epilator reduces the pain because of how quickly it removes the hairs. Also, the opposed tweezer heads make shaving the bikini area MUCH more comfortable! I got several cuts from my Braun epilator in the bikini area, but with this epilator I have absolutely nothing of the sort. I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is serious about epilating.</li>
            <li> I am a veteran \\&quot;epilator\\&quot; (I haven&#x27;t used a razor for my underarms in over 10 years), and decided it was time for a new epilator. I read the reviews of the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine and was totally swayed into buying one. Oh my gosh, the thing hurt so much, I was hopping from one foot to the other while trying to remove my underarm hair. Sooo painful. It was also fairly noisy, and I was sure the neighbors could hear me \\&quot;landscaping\\&quot;. It felt weighty in my hand and it looked sleek and cool, but I knew I would never use it again so I returned it. What a pity, since so many other people had a good experience with it. I&#x27;ll just stick to my pink BaByliss (bought in Israel and truly excellent), and chalk this one up to a dud.</li>
            <li> This is her second Emjoi of this model. The first one burned out after 2 years, but we are hoping that was just a lemon and this one will last longer because she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for about 2 years.  Sure, that&#x27;s what helps this be painless for me, but it is a much gentler epilator than others.  I used another cheaper brand for a few years, but it seemed to take longer and longer to remove the hair (more passes with the device), so I splurged on this model.  It has A LOT of heads, which makes it work faster, and as I said, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  This is much better than the other model, but still can take a couple of passes to pick up all the hair (hence the 4, not 5 star review).  If you haven&#x27;t epilated before, I highly recommend it.  I used to have thick stiff stuble on parts of my legs when I shaved, and had to shave a couple times a week.  Now I epilate about once a week and the sparse hair that comes in at all is soft and fair - very hard to see even when it gets longish.  It takes a little getting used to, and still leaves little red pin prick type marks, but those go away quickly.  I much prefer this to shaving.  I&#x27;ve also used this on my underarms (not too painful if I epilate weekly) and my upper lip (ouch), but it works so well.  Be careful in areas with more \\&quot;soft tissue\\&quot; - if the skin isn&#x27;t relatively taught it could pinch - so be smart about where you use it.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this Item... Had one for a few years and wanted another to replace it , but I guess they don&#x27;t make them like they use to... I might have gotten 3 uses out of my new one before it broke, the tweezers stopped moving and when I took off the head of it thinking that something was stuck to find out that the roller that is suppose to move the tweezers were all worn down and was not able to move the tweezers.... I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> This epilator works great. If you are new to using one of these it is going to hurt. Use this thing after you shower and it will be less painful and you will get less ingrown hairs. It will hurt less and less the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun silk epil for many years, and although it worked well, I figured this newer Emjoi epilator with more tweezers would work even better. However, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Braun. Had to go over the hairs many times to remove them, and as it&#x27;s quite bulky, it doesn&#x27;t work well over bony areas. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> when i bought it i was waiting that it would be fast becouse it has 72 tweezer, but i was shoked when i used it becouse it was too fast and i cant imagine that it mihgt be such fast, it is very painless.. it is best epilator i have ever used..im very happy whith it.. i advice it every women. i think i solved very big problem whit it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for years now and started with a really simple Philips which did the trick until it recently broke. While researching my next model, I found most epilator reviews ridiculous and unhelpful! Basing a product review on \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot; is quite silly, as the whole point of the product is to rip hair out of your body - which frankly is not a marvelous experience no matter how hard core you are. Plus everyone&#x27;s pain threshold is completely different, so please don&#x27;t ever base your purchase on that sort of feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my decision to go with the Emjoi based on a few simple reasons: 72 tweezers have a better chance of a quick efficient process than 20 or 40, for a 72 tweezer-head epilator the Emjoi is well priced, and the product itself has a very robust design that appeals to me. After a really quick delivery I have been using the product now for about 5 weeks and am really happy with it. It is substantially faster to do my full legs in comparison to my old Philips which is a huge plus. Time is precious and I would rather not spend hours doing my legs if it can be avoided. Aside from that I am not going to evaluate the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; issue, but one quick tip: every epilator will hurt more if you leave your hairs grow long. If you epilate regularly the hairs will be much finer and extract without much ado after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I am delighted with the Emjoi and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> unfortunately the things I had read about this product did not match its actual performance, at least not for me. Perhaps as far as epilators go it is a good product, but I still found it to be incredibly time consuming and painful although not so painful if it actually worked. I also had a lot of ingrown hairs after using it which the product claims not to cause or \\&quot;lessons\\&quot;. Perhaps stubborn or coarse hair plays a role as well. I was very enthusiastic and determined in using it at first but it just wasn&#x27;t effective enough to keep me motivated and I eventually ended up throwing it away. I was desperate to find a hair removal alternative &amp; have tried many different methods in my life but sadly I think at this point I will just go back to the basic razor until I find something else. Would really like to try the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; system next. Happy hunting!</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the usage tips provided to care for your skin such as bathing in hot water and exfoliating with a lufa before epilating, the Emjoi AP-18 is quite accurate in removing most hairs. (It is normal to miss one or two that are super fine hairs or too short for epilation). This device was not very painful, and has not pinched my skin at all. There is also a safety feature of automatic shutoff if you push too hard on your skin to prevent injury. Great with more sensitive regions of the body that require more gentle removal of unwanted hair. The only downside is the corded operation, I would prefer cordless and don&#x27;t know how I missed that one detail, however, the AC cord provided for power supply is quite lengthy and does not interfere much.</li>
            <li> Just received my Emjoi AP-18 and have to say it&#x27;s amazing!  I had these small patches of hair on my lower-mid back and within minutes the Emjoi devoured the hair and left my skin smooth as a baby!  I have nicknamed this little beauty \\&quot;Tasmanian Devil\\&quot; because it&#x27;s strong and fierce when it comes to hair removal.  Yes, it is somewhat painful but far better than shaving or waxing in my opinion.  Even used it on my ears getting the smallest and finest of hairs without any issues or irritation - and I have very sensitive skin. Just showered right after used a quality exfoliating skin soap which I think minimized the redness.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used so I have no baseline to compare it to. It works as well as I expected from other reviews I have seen. I have some trouble with it breaking off hairs instead of pulling them, but this could be due to me not having used one before. It seems to work better on coarser hair than fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual as a Christmas gift for myself. I reviewed at least 20 different kinds of epilators before making this purchase. I was hoping that I would not be disappointed as I have been before with a couple epilators that I had bought. After using it, I was very pleased with it. It has been 3 weeks since I used it and my legs are still smooth. I have gotten used to the pain since I used to wax before, therefore pain was not my issue. I wanted a product that could leave my skin feeling soft and wouldn&#x27;t leave bumps on my skin afterward. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an epilator, and the 72 tweezer heads do the job so much quicker... I am a very happy customer! Very happy with my purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have another epilator and have used it for a number of years, I wanted one that does the job faster. This one does the job much, much faster. This is the one to buy. No complaints with it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I am done with shaving.  It&#x27;s painful but nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> I loved the predecessor to this item and think I would like this one just as well if it wasnt&#x27; a defective item. I&#x27;m in the process of replacing it and hope that will go well to make this a better experience.</li>
            <li> 3/12/14 update: **Originally 5/5 stars, now 1/5**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically did not use it after that summer. This was way too time consuming and painful. I think waxing is less painful and more efficient, but it comes with a learning curve. I feel like this rips out hair instead of pulling it. This has been sitting in the back of my drawer for the last 3 years. Waxing is not perfect but it wins for now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my original review from June 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is only for people who have serious issues with body hair. (I am one of these people.) Think about it - Who in their right mind would subject themselves to something like this? If body hair bothers you enough that you will inflict considerable, repetitive (though short lived) pain upon yourself, then yes, this product does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this is that it absolutely gets the hair by the roots! I just did my underarms for the first time and there is NO HAIR THERE! Not a single \\&quot;black dot\\&quot; can be seen. That alone makes this worth it to me. They are a little red and tender, but I am sure it will heal overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve. It sounds simple enough to hold it as instructed my Emjoi, but there is a technique to it, and you naturally get better the more you use it. I have started moving it in all different directions (left/right, up/down, circles) in short motions and it works great. I have been doing my lower legs every few days for almost a month and my last epilation was by far the best! I feel like I got ALL except for the extremely smallest of hairs this time. Keep in mind that hair grows in cycles. So when you have hair 2 days after you epilate, it&#x27;s not the same hair growing back. It&#x27;s DIFFERENT hair, that wasn&#x27;t there when you epilated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it on my legs, I was not satisfied at all and questioned my purchase. Now that I have been consistent and patient, I have no doubts! I have a lot of \\&quot;bald\\&quot; patches and my legs simply LOOK 50x smoother because the roots are gone. If I wanted them to pass the \\&quot;touch test\\&quot; I would still have to shave, but they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The first swipe is the worst. If it&#x27;s your first time epilating, I would recommend \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; that area with the epilator instead of \\&quot;sweeping\\&quot; it in a smooth motion. After you have tapped an area about 3-5 times, the \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; is infinitely more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) After epilating, I use a cotton ball + witch hazel and then apply a triple antibiotic ointment. This prevents infection and red bumps. To prevent ingrown hairs, I exfoliate daily in the shower using some rough gloves. After I get out, I use the towel to rub away any dead skin. If I see any ingrown hairs, I sometimes use a pumice stone. UPDATE: Be careful about this! Early on, I was exfoliating too harshly and it left my skin looking red and bumpy. Be sure to give your skin a break to heal. It will look and feel a lot smoother. To moisturize, I use olive oil - no fancy fragrances/ingredients that can cause irritation to the inflamed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Give it time. Don&#x27;t expect to do all of your body in one day. Do small areas at a time. Don&#x27;t try to be 100% thorough the first time. Just do a little bit each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. A.) It is extremely loud. B.) The cord doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This epilator was quick at removing hairs and completely painless, but unfortunately it did not remove the hair roots. I have had a Braun epilator for years that is painful, but does a great job at ripping out the hair roots. If you want an epilator that actually removes the entire hair root, do not buy this one!</li>
            <li> Product&#x27;s as described. Fast delivery. Great packaging!!! A+!!!&lt;br /&gt;Works good...but , if you have somewhat aggressive hair breakage on the face ( females) I think esthetically it looks better and cleaner if you find a good threading salon.&lt;br /&gt;And these things are still totally overpriced...but if u got extra cash, why not.</li>
            <li> My spouse is very happy with this product.  Good price and quality manufacture with a nice design.  A great gift for the ladies.</li>
            <li> I have used epilators for as long as they were available. Since EpiLady.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this one, I used Norelco Satinelle for maybe 18 years. I have fine sparse hair and am used to this technique of removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Emjoi is hands down the best ever. It is fast so it is not as painful. Pain is a subjective thing that depends on length of use, and thickness and coarseness of hair. If you are prone to ingrown hairs this method may not be the best for you. With each epilation, hair roots seem to get less sensitive so it gets easier to use. I can get by on two uses a month; your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cord. It has the power you need to do the job. Battery run ones are too weak and slow, it requires many passes to get anything done, and the batteries constantly run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the only epilator I have used on my face that does not hurt a lot, especially in the sensitive area above the lip. Highly recommended for people familiar with this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this item but it is much better than most for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> The first epilator I purchased was a Braun Silk-epil 7 for $120.00 vs $80 for the Emojoi brand. The Braun worked great, as my first epilator I was excited to skip shaving for a couple weeks, vs having to shave every day. It had 40 built in tweezers, two different speeds and was cordless in operation. After about a year, I had to replace it, and decided on the Emojoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Braun and the Emojoi came with two speeds. Compared to the Emojoi the Braun might as well have been slow and slower. It would take me at least an hour to do both my legs with the Braun, that time is cut in half by the Emojoi. This was also probably helped by the fact the Braun has 40 tweezers vs Emojoi&#x27;s 70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using epilators for awhile now, I know epilators do not remove every single hair. I&#x27;d say maybe 5% of the hair is broken or missed when epilating and I&#x27;ve come to accept this. Sometimes you have to go over it again, or wait a day or two for it to grow before epilating again. With consistent use, this gets better. I&#x27;d say the Braun and the Emojoi are about the same in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added note, occasionally I had a problem with the Braun where it would grab onto my skin with the tweezers. It was incredibly painful and would leave red marks/tiny scratches on my skin. I have never had this problem with the Emojoi (thank goodness!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord vs Cordless:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be different from others, but my favorite thing about the Emojoi is that it is corded. Why? No internal battery to deal with! The Braun worked great at first but after a few months the battery would die in about 15-20 minutes - which did not work if it took an hour to do my legs. What&#x27;s worse, it would take two hours to charge. So that is over three hours dedicated to epilating and trust me, it got old fast. I hated epilating, it became such a chore I just shaved most the time. Dealing with a cord (which is conveniently very long) is way better than worrying about a dwindling battery life and a two hour charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is the Emojoi corded unit cannot be used in the bath or shower. I rarely used my Braun in the shower. I did not find it any less painful or more effective, and it was just easier for me to epilate outside of the bath. So the lack of this feature in the Emojoi does not bother me, but might be important to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun epilator came with a wide variety of different caps / attachments including one with a razors to shave any left over hair. All of which I never ended up using. I&#x27;m not sure if I am alone on this, but the attachments seemed pretty pointless so I considered them a waste of money. The normal cap worked just fine for my legs and armpits, though I never used the epilator on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emojoi only came with the cord and a cleaning brush, but considering I never once used the other attachments provided from Braun, Emojoi wins this catagory as well - less is sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emojoi claims to be &#x27;gentle&#x27; and if you&#x27;ve ever epilated, you know there is nothing gentle or comfortable about ripping your hair out at the root. However, I did find the Emojoi considerably less painful than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smartlight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun comes with a built in smartlight which was actually very helpful in spotting short or very light, thin hairs. This is a great feature that the Emojoi lacks. It might seem silly, but you&#x27;d be surprised how helpful it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, compared to the Braun, the Emojoi AP-18 wins. It is faster, overall less painful, and more efficient with a corded operation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emjoi epilators before, but not this model.  I decided to try it based on the description provided.  I use an epilator on my legs.  This particular model does an okay job, but it&#x27;s noisier than others I&#x27;ve used and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as well made.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34;, as they all do, but I would not purchase this model again.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator.  Gets less painless as you use it more and more.  Kind of fun to use and it got the attention of my man friends, now they ask me to use it on their backs (works great).  I would recommend exfoliating the target area prior to use as well as afterwards.  This makes hair regrowth less uncomfortable.  Go forth and buy this epilator!  Oh yeah! It&#x27;s great for the pits!</li>
            <li> Okay now...when I first saw this I was very surprised to come a crossed something like this and cut on cost of waxing for myself. When it arrived everything looked  good. I&#x27;ve used one like this before and it work but after i used this one... it did nothing but break the hair off and left me with what looked like a lot of stubble LIKE I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN SHAVE. I used it as I&#x27;ve used others but this one is for the birds. Its very time consuming to use this one since u have to keep going over the same area over and over again...it wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money and i can shave with a razor or waxing quicker and come out with a lot better results without as much aggravation and unnecessary skin irritation like i experienced with this thing. I rather wax before using this again!</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave this review for any guys that are thinking about this product. I bought this to use on my chest. I have very curly chest hair and unless I keep it shaved or trimmed very short, its itches unbearably.I have been using an electric razor and thought this would allow me to decrease the frequency of maintenance. As far as pain, yes it hurts! Its ripping the hairs out! The first time was by far the worst. Ive been using this for about two months and while it still stings a bit, the pain has diminished considerably. I would imagine the pain will vary depending on the region of your body. If the hairs are very short, it has a hard time grabbing them, so you will have to let the hair grow out a bit before it will grab. The construction I would rate as fair. Its mostly plasticky and flimsy. The on off button on my is defective. It will always turn on but some time I cant get it to  turn off. Since I keep it unplugged when not in use, I don&#x27;t find this a huge problem. I just unplug it to turn off. Its not cordless and will only work when plugged into the wall outlet. I dont expect this to last for years but for the price I&#x27;ll buy new ones as they die. Over all I give it high ratings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to come back after 6 months to a year to give an update., but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this epilator. My 10+ years old Emoji epilator, which I hadn&#x27;t treated too well, like the cleaning instructions said, lasted a long time, but eventually the epilator gears were too stressed to properly come together (I can still use the shaving attachment on that ancient thing, so its still of benefit). I did a lot of research before deciding to stay with Emoji, and particularly this model. My cost/benefit analysis saw this as the best option. Sure, it might not catch fine hairs, which a razor can catch and &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; things out; however, it will get the thick, noticible hairs and a good amount of fine ones if the skin is properly exfoliated, and the product will continue to get the fine hairs if the head is cleaned as the instructions say. And its just like mowing a tall grass lawn: don&#x27;t do it while its wet and don&#x27;t move the device fast, or you&#x27;ll miss some hairs and burn out the engine. I never want permanent hair removal because it reduces skin firmness, but I do have neurological issues that cause muscle spasms and the only scars I get are keloids, so this device works great for me and the with the updated gear design in this device, I know its going to last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Only one downside about this product - it hurts when it pulls your body hair out.  Suggest painless epilating for next model.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great. I bought it 3-4 years ago and still works as new. You won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
            <li> It is my second emjoi epilater and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I had some different one, but this one really is the best I found so far. It is a very smooth worker, specially when you use it regularly. It is very handy and keeps up a very smooth surface. Just have to watch not to get tangled up with clothes, so it will stop working properly.&lt;br /&gt;I rate it a five star because I&#x27;m use it twice a week and I&#x27;m really satisfiede.</li>
            <li> This is a brutal way to remove hair from the back.  I would even consider waxing with a double dip before returning to this device.  Could be operator error but I don&#x27;t think an expert could make this approach a better method of hair removal.  Definitely need to be sedated before attempting this approach.</li>
            <li> I really loved my Emjoi epilator that I had for years! So much so that i didn&#x27;t think another one of their epilators could beat it. When i lost it (4 kids, 2 dogs, no telling what happened) I was very skeptical about trying anything else. I didn&#x27;t think anything could compare but finally ordered the Emjoi Emagine. It worked even better! It was fast and covered a larger area than I was used to. I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain doesn&#x27;t effect me anymore as i am used to epilating. However if you are not once you get past the majority of the hair removal the daily upkeep is easy. I spend about 5 - 10 minutes a day doing upkeep on my legs and bikini area. It also helps to take tylenol 30 minutes prior to epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very course, think hair and lots of it. I would shave in the morning and by afternoon needed to shave again. So this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Well built unit,.. powerful motor easy cleaning.The reason I gave it a three is its not rechargeable.This is a plug in unit only, must use a cord.&lt;br /&gt;The return was fast and simple,and credit was within two days.</li>
            <li> This epilator broke after I had used it for just a year.  Also it was super noisy.  I am back to using the Braun I used before I bought this.  I would expect it to last longer considering it is more expensive than most epilators.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun epilators for over 15 years. Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not, but after a few weeks it started to slow down, and within on year it was impossible to properly epilate. It never did a thourough job. I was about to go back and buy a Braun Xelle, when I decided to read all the review and found out about the Emjoi Emagine AP18. I ordered it on Amazon, got it today and...I am in heaven. What took me ages before, took me a few minutes today. And with less pain. Can it be? I am so happy that I wanted to post a review immediately for both items. OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   Good luck!</li>
            <li> Not really sure how great it works. I seem to need to use it weekly. Not every 6 weeks. Can&#x27;t tell if there is less hair after several weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Emjoi epilator product I have used, replacing 2 that wore out over time.    The Emjoi AP-18 is comfortable and easy to use. I have vericose veins and don&#x27;t want to risk shaving due to the danger of nicking myself. I like that it is comfortable in my hand, light, and charges quickly.  I spend less time going over areas than I have with past epilators.  It is easy to clean.  I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.It barely hurt and didn&#x27;t take that much time. I would recommend it to anyone. [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]</li>
            <li> As I normally shave my legs I was looking for a solution that would last longer and replace shaving for me all together.   A friend who also has tried a few depilatory like devices sold me on this one as the least painful of whats out on the market.    It comes in a kids shoe box sized plastic box and has a detachable cord.  The device was easy to use and has two speeds. One for fine hair and one for course hair.    I am currently doing laser treatments for my bikini and under arms so I really only used it on my arms and legs.  My arms and upper thighs have very fine hair, as I do not shave them, and the emjoi did not really hurt at all. My lower legs took me two sessions to get it done as it was quiet painful. My BF tried it and likened it to getting a tatoo.  I am very thin so the closer it was to my ankles the more painful it was.   But I bit my lip and worked through the pain.  I have a theory that the next time will not hurt near as bad since the new hair growing in will be finer and I will likely get used to it.      If I try this on my bikini area I will get waxed a few times before attempting it.      Good luck and happy hairlessness.</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome. The epilators I had in the past were frustrating - it took me amost an hour to do both legs and still left some hairs. This one works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, even on new areas that have never been done like the tops of my feet and toes. I found that when the hair is longer it hurts more for some reason. I have even started using it under my arms which I was always afraid to do. At first you may feel an uncomfortable sensation, but after that it is painless. I have thrown away my razors and shave gel and I love love love only having to epilate once a week or so. Now I can do it in minutes, just a touch up, really. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull all the hairs out. It is fast but I ended up using twice a week instead of twice a month like I&#x27;m used to with other epilators.</li>
            <li> Best epilator made I couldn&#x27;t live without it .  So to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen I have two of them if one dies I have a back up so far the first one is still going strong .  Would recommend to anyone that hates shaving.  You epilate and it lasts for days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and convenient product, but it does hurt. Honestly though, beauty is pain and when it costs only $73, and you can use AT HOME without getting ready to leave. You practically save money on gas and everything. I recommend it. Definitely. What are you doing still reading? BUY IT RIGHT NOW. (:</li>
            <li> I was excited, though nervous, to try the Emjoi Emagine (AP-18 Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epliator) because the hair on my legs grows fairly quickly, meaning that the results of shaving don&#x27;t last very long.  As a reference, I shave every other day and don&#x27;t wear anything that will expose my legs on the off day because my hair is already noticeable.  So, after reading reviews, I purchased this epilator.  Not knowing how long the hairs had to be (ok, .4mm, but seriously, who can measure that?), I waited for over 48 hours before trying it the first time.  I then, due to very limited success, tried again the next day (greater than 72 hours at that point).  Below are my thoughts on various categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: This is what was most concerning to me.  I have to say, this is the one area where I was pleasantly surprised.  Do you feel it?  Yes.  Is it unbearable, even the first time?  No, not to me.  Sometimes I&#x27;d be targeting a specific hair (more on that later) and, after a pass, be thinking that it hadn&#x27;t worked because I didn&#x27;t feel anything, only to be surprised that it was gone.  Sometimes, though, I specifically could feel that I had gotten it.  The sensation is a little like a light electric zap, not really like a pinch.  After using it, my legs felt tingly for about an hour.  Not really painful, just noticeable and unusual.  As a side note, I did use it on my underarms and that was more painful and I&#x27;m not sure I actually got any hair.  To be fair, the hair there was much shorter, having been shaved the day before, but I suspect I was mostly experiencing skin pinching not hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ability to remove hair: Not so good.  I tried many different approaches - with the growth (as the guide says), against the growth.  Long passes, short passes.  Quick passes, slow passes.  No pressure, light pressure.  The thing that seemed to work best was light pressure, slow, short passes.  Direction seemed hair dependent - sometimes I&#x27;d have no success for several passes going in the growth direction, then I&#x27;d go against the growth and get it the first time.  Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  After about 15 minutes I began targeting the hairs I could see, specifically.  Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine) I didn&#x27;t stand a chance.  I gave up after about 30 minutes and went and shaved my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  These bumps were everywhere I had pulled hair from which, though not a lot, was still not a pleasant sight.  The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m returning it.  I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  You&#x27;d still have to shave at the same interval, there&#x27;d just be less hair to remove.  I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t say that this is a bad product when compared to others, but compared to expectations, this falls way short.veral passes going in the growth direction, then I&#x27;d go against the growth and get it the first time.  Other times it&#x27;d be the exact opposite.  After about 15 minutes I began targeting the hairs I could see, specifically.  Contorting my leg in various ways to get the light to hit it just right to see a patch of hair, then going over and over and over it.  Eventually, in the end, I don&#x27;t think there was a single targeted hair that I ever gave up on, but some took several (i.e. more than 10) passes.  For hair I couldn&#x27;t see (light in color or very fine) I didn&#x27;t stand a chance.  I gave up after about 30 minutes and went and shaved my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look of legs after use: Not so good.  The epilator, on both uses, left red bumps on my legs, similar to the kind you get with razor burn or heat rash.  These bumps were everywhere I had pulled hair from which, though not a lot, was still not a pleasant sight.  The bumps seem to go away in about half a day, but I would not have been able to wear shorts either day after use without the bumps being highly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m returning it.  I could see how this might be useful to minimize the amount of shaving you&#x27;d have to do on a vacation, but it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate it.  You&#x27;d still have to shave at the same interval, there&#x27;d just be less hair to remove.  I would say this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the time, pain, or effort.  I was prepared to be in pain to look good and save shaving time, but in the end I got less pain than expected, but also fewer results.  This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t say that this is a bad product when compared to others, but compared to expectations, this falls way short.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after much research and review-reading, hoping that it would be the perfect replacement for my older epilator (used regularly for 3 years) that wasn&#x27;t as effective as it had once been.  My first thought upon using this was, \\&quot;Wow, this really DOESN&#x27;T hurt as much as my old epilator!\\&quot;  And then my second thought was, \\&quot;Aw, man, it&#x27;s not getting even half of everything.\\&quot;  I mean, I&#x27;m no epilating newbie: I expect it to be at least a little painful.  Pain free (or less painful) without efficacy does not cut it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an epilator that is touted to get more hairs in fewer passes, it just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  It took me just as long to epilate as with my old one (Braun SE 5 series.)  Also, it didn&#x27;t get my soft, fine, blond hairs that tend to lie flat against the skin.  So basically, it really worked about as well as a 3 year-old less expensive appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, if you look at the way the head is designed, it obviously can&#x27;t get right next to your skin because of the way the head is built up around the tweezer wheels, and the wheels themselves are almost concave, so if your legs/underarms/what have you aren&#x27;t curved in the same degree that the heads are, you&#x27;re gonna be sitting there for a while.  It also kind of grossed me out that there&#x27;s no way to really clean the tweezer heads.  Combined with the lack of an LED light (which I was really used to in my old appliance and depended on), the significant learning curve of the current angle to which you need to direct it to your skin, and the reduced efficacy, I returned this item and purchased a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously many people love this epilator, and I love that it&#x27;s corded (doesn&#x27;t lose steam, as it were) and the pulls really are MUCH less painful, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify keeping it.  So maybe this isn&#x27;t a good choice epi for natural blondies.</li>
            <li> I use this item on my arms and upper lip. It is faster than using tweezers and easier than using wax strips. Really great machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emjoi products for years and have always been happy. This is a new and improved model. Seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this Emjoi 72-Tweezer Head Epilator because I LOVE the Emjoi EpiSlim so much for my upper lip and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment and waste of money. It barely captures any hair on my legs (I have to try it at different angles and go over the same area at least four times before it will capture the most obvious hairs) and the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; in the middle is pointless--It does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work decently on my bikini line, but I could just use my EpiSlim there, so that&#x27;s not much of a saving grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hoped to give this a high rating, but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I have been using several kinds of epilators and this one is by far the best one! I used to have a cordless dry/wet Panasonic and a Braun Silk Epil - both good machines but none nearly as fast as this one.  Definitely beats the heck out of cordless epilators in terms of power.  That being said, if you are a newbie in epilating this Emjoi maybe a little overwhelming because it is REALLY powerful and I would imagine it would hurt if you have been shaving before.  My advise would be to get professionally waxed first and then epilate as hairs regrow, it would hurt way less than if you just do it after having shaved for years.  If it hurts a bit (and it will) just take it and keep epilating, I promise it will stop hurting after a few times and you wouldn&#x27;t have to ruin your skin shaving every other day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator primarily to remove the hair fuzz on my face.  The instructions tell you not to use it on your face - but if you use the side blade and are very gentle it works just fine.  I have used it on my legs and underarms as well.  I really love this product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you make the investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these in the past 2 years. In general terms, I like this epilator more than any other I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I&#x27;ve tried many. The two rolls of tweezers work to remove hair faster and it misses less hairs than other devices, though it still misses quite a few. My main problem with this epilator is that after a year or so of use (I use it once a month during cold weather, and probably once a week or every other week during the summer time) the gears in the rollers break and the thing gets stuck and stops working. This has happened twice already and I&#x27;m on the fence on whether I want to spend another $80 in a product that I KNOW will BREAK again in a year. I wish they sold the attachment on its own, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! I went over all the amazon reviews for multiple epilators and chose this one. Big Mistake! It gave me so many ingrowns and I didn&#x27;t even realize it until it was too late (1-2 months after first use). My hairs are growing in multiple directions including inwards. I&#x27;ve popped ingrowns that released 3 inch long hairs. You can see dark spots where it&#x27;s jammed in and even lines across my leg where the hair is high enough to see but deep enough that I&#x27;d bleed if I tried to pick it out. I went to a dermatologist and they told me the only way to stop it is to do laser hair removal and then have multiple incision operations to get the rest out. This may not happen to you but I thought that same thing about the bad reviews I saw myself. IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH THE RISK!!! I think part of the problem is that the blades go in two different directions, but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying others.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for around 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was a Braun fan for years although I wasn&#x27;t happy with the second braun silk 7 (in/ out of water.) I was epilating so long each time,the battery would run out and I would have to plug it back in. It would not work until it was charged(pros and cons to cord and cordless.) I do miss the little light on that one,with this one you don&#x27;t need to look.The emjoi is getting all of the hairs so no need to keep looking. However with the Braun 7 I would have to go over and over to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Emjoi is amazing. It did not hurt it was weird. It was almost as simple as shaving, just a little longer. I was done in no time. Usually I have to spend hours on a saturday or sunday. It just came tonight and I though well I will just try it and see how it works. It was so easy , I just kept going and was finished with both, legs armpits in 30-to 45 minutes.My back would actually hurt from doing it to long with my old one. I can&#x27;t seem to do around my mouth very easily  with the Emjoi like I could with the Braun ,maybe I am just chicken I will try again another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this is way better than the Braun plus I had the extra expense of the other attachment with the other one. I did not plan on getting rid of the Braun but it dropped on the floor and that was the end of that after probably 2-3 years.I am so glad it dropped now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this one make your life easy.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used.  It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes.  Other epilators could take me an hour to do my legs, since I would have to go over the same area repeatedly to get all of the hairs.  With 72 tweezer heads and plenty of power, I think the Emjoi AP-18 takes under 10 minutes to do both legs.  It&#x27;s not very noisy to operate, and if you&#x27;re used to epilating, the hair removal isn&#x27;t painful.  If you aren&#x27;t used to epilating, any epilator will be painful for the first several uses.  Even cleaning out this epilator is easy.  The only thing I would change about this epilator would be making it cordless.  Then again, they may not be able to keep the power level consistent enough while running on battery power, which may be the reason it&#x27;s operable only while plugged in to an outlet.    The Emjoi AP-18 is pricier than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade mine for anything!</li>
            <li> I bought the Emjoi AP 18 because it was time for me to either wax or shave my legs.  I rationalized buying this gizmo that IF it worked, it would pay for itself after 2 waxings of leg/underarm/bikini line.  I was incredibly sceptical that something like this would actually work.  I read about a lot of other elipilators and how long it took to use them and the varying results. I am still in awe with how well it works.  It does sting a bit but if you pull the skin taut, it hurts significantly less.  I have hairfree legs and have had no adverse reaction to it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes silky smooth skin.  Hand down, it is one of the best investments I have made.  I wish I had bought it years ago. After 32 years, I will no longer be waxing or shaving.  This is THE product for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator b/c I was going to the beach and did not want to have to shave everyday there.  I began using it on my legs six weeks ago and have great difficulty in getting my legs smooth.  I also used it on my underarms with good results.  I suspect that part of my problem is due to impatience with the time it takes to do the legs.  But also, I expected more perfection from the epilation and I do not think that is possible.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much the market (and the technology) has changed since 4 years ago when I purchased the (then version) Silk Épil. This is the fifth epilator I tried since I first started using electrical epilators. After reading different postings, I decided to switch to this Emjoi -- it seemed to be faster, and less &amp;#34;sophisticated.&amp;#34; My previous epilators all had special attachments, but I could never use them, the process was too painful on other parts of my body than my legs, so I preferred waxing. I cannot recommend this product enough, especially to women who never shave, opting for wax/electrical epilator. It is fast, easy to clean, and although bigger than other epilators, it is the size of the tweezers that matters. They are perfectly conceived, so they&#x27;ll solidly clip the hair and pull it so swiftly that you don&#x27;t even notice it is gone. The size and position of tweezers allow for the hair never to break, leaving the skin smooth and silky. It works PAINFREE on my underarms too, so I can skip my weekly visit to wax my underarms. I never imagines that an electrical epilator can compete with the benefits of waxing, until I tried this Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this.&lt;br /&gt;I got it as a gift for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very noisy, but not really THAT bad, and removes the hair well, giving her a smooth skin feel, easier than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s gotten used to the slight bit of &#x27;pain&#x27; from the tweezing action, and said it&#x27;s a lot less work than waxing was.  :)</li>
            <li> Holy WOW!!!! I have pretty thick hair and this thing doesn&#x27;t quit! I did a lot of research before selecting this specific model. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the epilator. I read all the reviews prior to buying the product so I would have a general idea of what to expect. I must say I was extremely pleased with the results. I use this product on my under arms and it does hurt but the end result was worth it. My under arm hair did not grow back for about two weeks. It felt nice to not have to shave that area everyday when I showered. My under arms now feel extremely smooth. I only use the epilator&lt;br /&gt;now for my under arms, but I believe I will use it for my arms and legs in the warmer months.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a good hair removal tool just know that you will feel some amount of pain in using this product. I believe the results are worth the small amount of pain endured.</li>
            <li> The EMJOI AP-18 is the Ferrari of the Epilator world. The dual opposing heads doing the job twice as fast as the single-head I&#x27;d owned by another manufacturer, it&#x27;s like getting two race cars for the price of one. Delightfully lightweight, the plug-in operation is better than dealing with the undue heaviness of a rechargeable battery. My legs, left razor-blade smooth in record time, I kept turning around, half expecting the cops to pull me over for speeding.</li>
            <li> Love it, works well. Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give you an option to use it as a cordless device and its a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> First time epilator...I bought my first epilator two weeks ago(it was an Emjoi gently Silken)  I loved the concept although it took a long time and I also didn&#x27;t like that it was cordless. It seemed to bog down. So i decidid to do some research and try to find one with good reviews and that looked like it would do the job.So I figured one with more tweezers and the hair lifting bar would definitely do the trick( it was also corded) Boy was I wrong, this thing sucked!! The sides of the epilator sit up to high so it does not get close to your skin...so that means your hair has do be long before it will grab it. The little bar does nothing to help that. So disappointed I went searching some more. I ended up at walgreen buying a $25 Remington smooth and silky and I&#x27;m gladbu did! Not only did I save some money but it works better that both of the emojis I bought.</li>
            <li> This little machine is amazing. It does hurt at first...and my armpits were sore for a day afterwards. All worth it! I love that I dont have to shave them anymore. My leg hair is pretty fine, I think I will just use it quickly every couple of days, so sometimes it just breaks it off at the skin. I have told everyone I know to get one of these even if they don&#x27;t get the same one...it is so nice to not have to mess with wax anymore. Buy it! It is entirely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Easy ... .quick ... relatively pain-free ... great results!  Electric (as opposed to battery) with a very long cord.  Fantastic product that sure beats threading or waxing.</li>
            <li> The Emjo Ap-18 is intimidating at first but it really does a quick job of facial hair removal.  The trick is holding your skin tight when using it.  The hair removal last longer which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few epilators but this one is the best I have found.  Because of the large head, it is quicker, and it grabs really short hairs.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi with a bit of apprehension.  After using the first time I was amazed at how smooth my legs were.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurts but it is a bit uncomfortable.  I have dark kind of course hair and it worked great.  Yes it did break some of the hairs instead of pulling but that seemed to be some of the finer hair.  I usually have stubble the day after shaving so being able to go 2 weeks after the first use was great. I did get a bit braver and used it on my arm pit hair today.  Wow it worked great and was the pulling wasn&#x27;t near what I was worried it would be.  Trying to epilate my arms was painful, but the arm pits was a breeze.  Also I have a couple of \\&quot;skin tags\\&quot; that I was concerned about going over.  Was better than my razor, no pulling or nicks. It doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp really fine hairs as well just FYI.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the Emjoi and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> My first time ever in using a depilator and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have another model of Emjoi which I was pretty happy with, but the one I have has an odd shape and bit difficult to use. I bought this one because can be used for your face. I tried on my face just to try and was pleasantly surprise that it does not hurt as much as I thought it would. The shape is easy to hold and very light. Still noisy though....but I think over all I like it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I thought I&#x27;m making a good choice, but this is not really a good one!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so slow! you have to go on and on for like 4 times per each area!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, I have an old Philips, I might just go and buy the new version of Philips again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a customer from overseas and here in the Netherlands you cannot get a dual head epilator.&lt;br /&gt;After using many different epilators I can say that this one is the fastest and best one ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the dual head you never miss an unwanted hair. When the first one missed a hair the second one will pick him up. So removing hair I can do now in half of the time I was used to!!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this one!!!! Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair remover. I wasn&#x27;t sure on which one to get, but by reading reviews, I chose this one. I am glad I bought it. It works very well. Much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li> This was the second or third epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so I&#x27;m not new to these. After my last braun epil 7 locked up prematurely I went for this one because it had a cord and was supposed to be the fastest epilator around. So it is quite fast, and hurts a bit less than some of the other epilators I&#x27;ve used. However... the reason it hurts less is because this epilator doesn&#x27;t make good contact with your skin and/or doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the hairs as well as other ones I&#x27;ve used. I do have very course thick hair, which could be part of the issue, maybe this epilator is good for people with finer hair? Either way, the shape of the head on this epilator is really bad for getting at any part of your body other than your legs (and its really challenging to get your knees with it). Other epilators have some flexibility in how they make contact with your skin, but this one is just fixed and open faced, so even if there&#x27;s more tweezers and it goes faster, you&#x27;re going to lose time making passes over the same area because it hasn&#x27;t made contact with your skin. Another annoying issue related to time is that because you&#x27;re spending so much time going over the same places/taking so long in general, the epilator starts to heat up and burn your skin. It took me a while to figure out that was why epilating became more painful over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: corded, fast, somewhat less painful than other epilators&lt;br /&gt;Cons: horrible unflexible head that wont make contact with your skin, heating up and burning you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, maybe this works better for people with lighter hair, but after using it for about 6 months, I&#x27;m buying a new braun epilator since they actually make contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  I have strawberry blonde hair and this product ripped my legs up.  I followed directions and tried multiple times (thinking perhaps I just had to &amp;#34;get used to&amp;#34; the pain).  No - I used it months ago and my legs are still not fully recovered.  This product is awful - tried to get my money back - to no avail.  Not worth it - stick to Nair hair removal or shaving….</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little faster.  I think the 6-week interval between use is just a myth though. I use it every 1-3 days.</li>
            <li> this one is ok just not as good as the one i&#x27;ve been using for the pass 5yrs i wish now that i had sticked to what i know works good. i only tried this one because it&#x27;s suppose have more tweezers than my  Panasonic ES2045P Wet Dry Epiglide Epilator. This Emjoi can only be used while its connect to the cord my Pananosic works just fine without the cord n in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, so I can only compare it to conventional women&#x27;s shaving, but I have to say I am SOLD.  I got a nice smooth shave and it didn&#x27;t hurt my legs at all.  As for elsewhere....yes, that hurt.  But I understand that gets better.  And even though it hurt, I don&#x27;t have all the gnarly skin irritation that I get after stroking  a razorblade over those areas.  The fact that there&#x27;s no stinging after I put on my &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; (lime juice) is testament to how much this ISN&#x27;T irritating my skin.  So a little pain during, but none afterwards?  Yeah, I&#x27;ll take that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides my skin, my conscious feels better, too.  Okay, yes it uses electricity.  But the amount of electricity it uses as compared to all those razor blades getting dumped into landfills?  Seems like a no-brainer to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t run on battery just because it doesn&#x27;t lose any power during use.  It specifies on the packaging that you must use a proper power source.  I know there are converters, but it is my understanding that those converters only change the voltage and not the wattage.  For many of my appliances, that will not do.  I&#x27;m not sure where this product falls, so it may or may not wind up on the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t take to Finland&amp;#34; list.  I&#x27;ll have to research that.  However, it&#x27;s an electric device and that&#x27;s just an unavoidable issue one runs into with electric devices when moving between 110 and 220 volt countries., so I won&#x27;t hold that against it if that turns out to be the case.  Oh yes, last but not least, the cord is really long, which is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit loud...enough that it freaked out my cat.  But all in all, I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I had been toying with the idea of buying an epilator for years and finally bit the bullet and bought this one.  Fair warning, the first time you use it, it is pretty uncomfortable.  The phrase &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; came to mind a few times during my first use.  After that though, it is much more comfortable and the results really do last significantly longer than shaving.  I use this on my legs, underarms, and bikini area.  Even if you only plan on using this under your arms, it is completely worth the purchase.  I can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators since it is the only one I have used, but I&#x27;m glad that I started with this one.</li>
            <li> The speed in which it plucks hair diminishes the ouch factor. Purchased this same one for the second time as the first broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Emjoi AP-18 for about 5 months.  I purchased it for my legs.  The first time I used it on my lower legs, it hurt so bad it brought tears to my eyes and I could only use it on 1/3 of my lower legs.  The hair on the portions I used it grew back much slower, so eventually I made it up past my knee.  I love the results... hardly any hair grows back after a week.  It&#x27;s just as effective as waxing, and as long as I use it at least 1x a week, it&#x27;s not painful.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my upper lip, and it&#x27;s always painful and makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to throw up, so I continue to wax.  I would purchase this again for my lower legs, but I would not recommend it for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after a recommendation.  This brand is used in upscale salons and recommended by estheticians.  This is far superior compared to the emjoi portable with only 16 tweezers.  Using this device is easy and hardly painful.  Since it has 72 tweezers, areas don&#x27;t have to be repeated over and over.  It does not run on battery and therefore always has to be plugged in, but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li> This epilator works twice as fast and twice as good as the one I had (a braun), love it</li>
            <li> I have used similar models of epilators, and this by far was the worse. I have returned the item and ordered one that I had and that finally had worn out. I would not recommend paying that much when you can get one that works a whole lot better for less money.</li>
            <li> I had one of the original &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; epilators from 15 years ago.  It finally died.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive they had become.  The Emjoi is reasonably priced for this type of item.  I find it much more comfortable and does a better job on really short hairs.</li>
            <li> Mom asked me to buy this for her.  She says it works great, but I didn&#x27;t really push the subject.</li>
            <li> the Item i received does not work... pretty dissapointed when i had to have it mailed all the way over from US to Singapore, paying all the postage and it doesnt work... :[</li>
            <li> its great! works much better and faster than my smaller cordless emjoi silken but I thought it was also cordless. but no big deal you don&#x27;t have to worry about it loosing its charge and waiting to charge up again like the emjoi silken</li>
            <li> it does what it says it will do. I tried a different type of hair remover machine (a top name) &amp; it did not work for me. I like this one much better.</li>
            <li> Much less painful than my previous Emjoi only drawback is it&#x27;s not designed to get bikini area. It does somewhat but not as well as other models</li>
            <li> This item works exactly as I had hoped for. Would reccomend it to others as an alternative to shaving! Thanks</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and this product didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs on my top lip or arm. when you turn it on it sounds like a drill. Maybe other nationalities have a better response from this product, but I did not. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I already had a single tweezer autoplucker that worked splendidly so I thought a 72 tweezer would be that much better. The reality is that this one is far less precise than the single tweez. I often have to go over a spot 2 or 3 times before it plucks the hair and sometimes it just won&#x27;t pluck it at all. Also, this plcker requires 2 days growth to work whereas my last one only requires I go without shaving for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I am a male who is using this to pluck out my facial hair--which is definitely NOT what it was designed to do. Still, I expected it would be superior to the single tweeze auto-plucker I was already using.</li>
            <li> This thing is so awesome💯 👌🏾😉😉😊&lt;br /&gt;This is the best epilator I have ever used. Things just go so fast with this epilator. I have hirsutism. Hirsutism: medical condition involving excessive hair growth on women. My hirsutism is pretty mild I just use this for my chin. And omg this is like a life saver. 😊😊😊😊</li>
            <li> love this!!!! it does hurt a little butyou can get use to it.  hair stays gone longer than shaving</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was excited when I heard about emjoi.  thinking I had finally found a product that would help me not have to shave so much.  I had never used an epilator before and thought I would ty it.  the first time was great and got all of the hair,  however a week later itI had stubble used it again. from then till now if I use it it breaks my hair off and I end up having to shave two days later.  the reviews for this had said the pain would subside some after getting used to the product. that hasnt happened.  this hasnt worked the way I had hoped based on what reviews said.  now  I&#x27;m out over $100 and still having to buy razors and refills.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.  It works great.  It does tweeze short hair.  I would recommend.  The only inconvenient, it&#x27;s not cordless.</li>
            <li> Slow painful and didnt even get all the hair. A cheaper version would have done just as well. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> The epilator does not have a wide enough surface and doesn&#x27;t work well on underarms.  The epilator itself sometimes ends up cutting hair instead of pulling from the root. Definitely prefer my Braun wet and dry that I broke.  I&#x27;m ordering another since this epilator isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> Guess it depends where you&#x27;re going to use it. It can work on the Bikini area.... but you have to &amp;#34;prepare&amp;#34; the area first.... trim the hairs (longer hair will hurt A LOT more). You have to be prepared for some pain... stinging.... but it&#x27;s NOT intolerable. Take a shower first -- warm up the skin.... then use powder so the epilator will glide easily over the skin... I can&#x27;t use it w/o powder.  Never tried it on legs... that seems like too much skin to cover. It helps to have a distraction ... put on a good TV show or the news, haha and DON&#x27;T try to cover big sweeping areas of skin.... just do little areas at a time.... that way you&#x27;re not gobbling up too many hairs all at once. That will hurt more.</li>
            <li> I love this thing &amp; I will never go back to shaving!  I&#x27;m not going to lie, it does hurt but you get used to it after a couple of times.  I have very dry skin and I used to itch really bad after shaving, but ever since I&#x27;ve been using this epilator, I&#x27;ve had no more itching on my legs. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as much or as thick as it does when you shave.  I definitely recommend this product and if it ever broke, I would buy it again no questions asked.  I have been using it on my legs, bikini area &amp; arms for 6 months and it still works like a charm! My arms &amp; bikini area always come out soft &amp; smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt. My legs have thicker hair so it may not always come out silky smooth, but it gets rid of all the visible hair (which is all I&#x27;m worried about), but when I am worried about being smooth to the touch, I can always go over it with a razor and it will still last a whole week. I do not recommend using it if your legs have lotion because I did that and the tweezers got all gooey for a while, but I was able to clean them with a Q-Tip and some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of epilators ever since the 90s. I love that they can get the shortest of hairs, so I don&#x27;t have to grow my hair out to have it waxed, and that I can remove hair from my entire body without having to go to a salon. I&#x27;ve been considering a dual head epilator since the emjoi optima came out, but could never convince myself to spend the extra money. When I finally decided I was sick of how long it took with my old Philips (which, compared to the Braun it replaced, I&#x27;ve never been terribly happy with) and came to amazon to pick up the optima, I found this improved model and pounced on it. Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out the night it was delivered, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in the speed. I&#x27;ve shelved it since, but decided today to get it back out to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my legs weren&#x27;t that bad, it didn&#x27;t take long, but I still didn&#x27;t feel it was working miraculously fast, and when I had removed as much hair as the epliator could, my legs still felt somewhat stubbly. That gave me the idea to compare it to my old epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Philips back out. Started by running it over my legs. Yep, they felt smoother. Then I decided to time it. Since my legs were done, I decided to do my arms. To keep it fair, I used my dominant hand (left) to hold the Emjoi and my right hand for the Philips. It took the Emjoi five minutes to clear as much hair as possible my right arm. It took seven with the Philips on my left. However, again, my left arm was noticeably smoother than my right and the Philips&#x27; single row of tweezers felt more nimble going over bony areas. I ended up finishing off my right arm with the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only upside I found was that the Emjoi seemed less painful than the Philips. I could see using the Emjoi to start an area that had been neglected for a while. Still, as a daily epilator, the Philips, and the Braun before it, were both far superior, if a tiny bit slower.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was supposed to be a workhorse, but it always seems like its about to quit.  I have purchased this brand epilator in the past with great results, but this one is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Hi, my name is Katy. I&#x27;m eighteen years old, and hopefully this review will help you decide whether this product is for you. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving over the years almost never gave me the smooth legs I wanted. After a few months or so of shaving, I got horrible red bumps all over my legs (that wouldn&#x27;t go away), you know, razor bumps, and occasionally razor burn as well. No matter what I did - shaving cream, conditioner, brand new razors, etc., I just never got the results I wanted. Shaving wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered the epilator. After researching online looking for the best one, I decided to purchase this one, the Emjoi Emagine. I made sure I knew how to use it and was prepared for the pain that people talked about. Despite that, I was so excited and used it minutes after it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to have the smooth legs I had desired for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to my dismay, the results were not what I was looking for. I could still feel the hair on my legs, it wasn&#x27;t much better than shaving, and it hurt. It hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I didn&#x27;t give up on epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m soooo glad that I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is likely to break hair instead of plucking it -- IF you use it incorrectly. I think there are a few reasons why I didn&#x27;t instantly get the results I wanted. I had very dry skin. I sped through epilation. I used the higher speed right away even though my hair is very fine. Epilating irritated my skin at first. I didn&#x27;t exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes some practice, but at this point I am incredibly happy with how my legs feel and this epilator&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips for those of you who are having problems:&lt;br /&gt;- EXFOLIATE. This is one of the most important steps. If you don&#x27;t exfoliate often enough, your skin is going to be harder to epilate. Exfoliating also helps to maintain smooth skin when there isn&#x27;t hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Buy a moisturizing body wash, moisturizing bath salts,etc. Use them when you exfoliate, especially if you have dry skin. This did wonders for me. (I have Walgreens bath beads with Vitamin E and mineral oil, it&#x27;s really cheap and I love it!)&lt;br /&gt;- GO SLOWLY. This might be the most important thing. I recommend starting on the lower speed, even though it may be more painful, you will get better results. I find the best technique is to go in slow, tiny circles in the direction the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;- Be thorough. You may think you&#x27;re done, but if you can feel hair, it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t do it too often! The hair does have to grow a bit so the epilator can grab it. Don&#x27;t worry - you probably won&#x27;t even see the hair once it&#x27;s long enough. Every few days or once a week per area is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;- Stick with it! It&#x27;s not instantaneous, but I&#x27;m confident that if you dedicate yourself and are determined, you will eventually get great results. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped you, I know this product is expensive and lots of people depend on these reviews when deciding whether to purchase things or not. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and takes multiple passes; however I used it on pretty short (shaved three days previous) hair that is blonde and fairly thin/fine! I like it cause I can use it while a watch a show and not worry about nicking myself and also save on my water bill since when I shave I do it in the shower with the water running! Another slight problem is it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs on my knee cap, but even regular shaving does not do really great job on that area for me... not sure why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pleased overall and I can already see it getting better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel much discomfort, but I have fine hair like said before and exfoliate very often :)</li>
            <li> Wow! The best I have used - bar none! I highly recommend it to anyone in need of an efficient hair removal tool! The best part is that it can also be used on lip and chin! Keeping the lip and chin smooth has been a challenge for me, but no more! This epilator removed the fine hair with less discomfort and more thoroughly than waxing; and without the redness, burning and dryness that follows the use of creams. I felt a mild pinching sensation while using it on the short hair of my legs and armpits; on hair that was longer it pulled and left a very pinching sensation, although not bad. I like that it is corded and will not run out of power! Very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li> Hurts like bloody hell, but definitely rips the hairs out by the root, and they take some time to grow back! I&#x27;d recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 18 months and stopped rotating. As often as my wife used it that is not impressive. Purchased a cordless one.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful. It did take a little adjusting to figure out a good angle. All in all - a solid product. This is my third epilator and I like it the best so far.</li>
            <li> it is the best epilator I have tried so far,totally beat out the Braun silk epilator 7. with a little help from numb master I was able to epilate my underarms completely smooth.Once  you learn how to hold it and let it do the work on its own it is fabulous. A tip for nubies to epilating, I first plucked the really stubborn hairs from my legs with regular tweezers around the ankles and the shin will be the most sensitive&lt;br /&gt;also using a numbing cream on the underarms and always use after epilation cream. after a few times it really does not hurt that bad but be prepared the first few times yikes  it hurts but it is so worth it</li>
            <li> This works, but it takes a lot of time and gives a lot of pain! I&#x27;d rather shave thank you.</li>
            <li> It hurts.... but it works! Some areas it doesn&#x27;t hurt, others it REALLY hurts, but mostly its tolerable. I drank two mikes hard lemonades first and got a good buzz going and went to town on my legs! Nice and smooth and haven&#x27;t had to shave in days. This is the best worst invention ever. I have a love hate relationship with this awesome gadget. It works well and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and works quickly.  This epilator is twice as fast as the last one I owned.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the speed of this epilator but quickly realized it was breaking a majority of my hairs rather than removinging them from the root. This means using it at least once a week and dealing with a lot of ingrowns. Also not very effective on underarms. I was red raw by the time I&#x27;d managed to get it smooth. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for about 6 years now - this is the second epilator that I bought and I am extremely happy with it! My first epilator, the [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]], seemed to take FOREVER to get my legs done, and I&#x27;d have to go over the same area SEVERAL times before all the hair was removed (BTW, the Braun system is currently double the price that I paid for it back in 2007 - not sure why that is). I finally switched to the Emjoi epilator in October 2011 and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I love the fact that it has two rotating heads - it gets the job done so much faster! I still have to go over some areas more than once, but I&#x27;ve had much better results than I did with the Braun epilator. I also swear I have way less ingrown hairs than I used to have. I even use this thing on my husband&#x27;s back (sometimes I find pleasure in torturing him, LOL) and I can get his entire back done in 20 to 30 minutes (vs a full hour with the Braun). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> im african american female who WAS prone to nasty ingrown hairs from shaving.  I used to get hollywood waxes a few years ago but it was expensive at $60-$75 a pop. i like how it came packaged. it came with a user manaual, manufacturer warranty and also a pouch to put it in.  I have had this epilator since the week of Christmas and so far I really like it. As it has been stated , it does hurt when you first use it but with frequent use , it gets better after time.  i use this on my legs and pubic area.  My legs are so so as i have a mixture of fine hair and coarse on my legs. i would rate this a 5 star if it would get the finer hair. however its amazing for thick coarse hair!!!  i do wish i can clean the head of the emjoi a bit better. i have to brush it with the brush it came with and shake it a little bit after detaching the head.  i use a q-tip with alcohol or witch hazel to clean the tweezer heads. I attempted my arm pit, but it was too tender for me, i will attempt it later on when i can figure out how to hold the skin taut for my arm pit LOL. I epilate the &amp;#34;happy place&amp;#34;  as in the mound, bikini line area, the &amp;#34; happy place curtains&amp;#34;  and all the way to the anus ( tmi, i know but it may help some one who likes a complete bare look ;-) ) . here are some tips i hope can help  :-D&lt;br /&gt;****first shave the area you will epilate or trim the hair down with some clippers some. if you shave wait a day or 2. if its too long it will hurt a whole lot more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;*Take a shower bath or whatever you use to keep your self clean. i like to use a apricot scrub to exfoliate before i epilate.I LOVE THAT WORD..EPILATE LOL!!! .&lt;br /&gt;*rinse and dry off really well. place a towel or something underneath you to catch the hairs. makes for easy clean up as well.&lt;br /&gt;*depending on your &amp;#34; happy place anatomy&amp;#34; , figure out a way to hold the skin nice and taught. brace yourself ladies and gents, the pain will come but it is very brief.&lt;br /&gt;*move  the emjoi in fast circles.  i change the direction of my circles in an area as pubic hair grows in different directions untill the area is smooth. work in small areas at a time. take a break if you have to. the first time epilating the pubic area will take a while, especially if its your first time. it took me almost 45 minutes to pretty much give my self the hollywood. ( i use to get waxes a while ago but stopped as it was expensive to maintain)&lt;br /&gt;*have a flash light and mirror on hand too.&lt;br /&gt;*after you  are done, apply whatever kind of lotion or gel or whatever on it.  My &amp;#34;happy place&amp;#34; looked like the skin of a raw chicken. just all bumpy form the hairs being pulled but it went away the next day. over the next few days i epilated the region again as hair grows at different rates. it hardly hurt, just a prick. the less hair the  less it hurts. i kind of like how it feels lol.  Takes me 3 to 5 minutes  to touch up areas where the hair has grown . after the first week, it was a week before i noted i had hair growing back. i felt the prickly hair and i epilated again. i think im adicted  to epilating, i love it.  My ingrown hairs are gone down like 98% .  Just keep exfoliating every few days . its to early for me to note if my pubic hair has gotten finer, i would need atleast 5 more months to notice.</li>
            <li> I bought this like everyone else thinking, &amp;#34;Hey, I won&#x27;t have to shave anymore!&amp;#34; Well as a woman with a huge side tattoo that hurt like the rays of a thousand suns, I&#x27;d choose a tattoo any day. It hurt so bad to do. Also, this came to me already opened, but I tried it anyways. Plus you cant use it in the shower because it has to be plugged in. My friends all tried it as well and after making one of them bleed pretty bad, we decided it was my worst purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of epilators (I hate shaving).  I&#x27;ve used emjoi before and they work well - it takes a lot longer before you start seeing \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  There is always an element of pain with epilators (especially when you first start using one).  This one was noticeably less painful.</li>
            <li> I had heard about the joys of epilators (the results, not the process) and thought I would finally give it a try. After weeks of research online and talking with others, I thought this would be the best purchase. Well, it is, ... for an electric shaver. My leg hair was trimmed, not plucked. I was so worried that it would hurt. Nope. It&#x27;s a shaver, not an epilator.  I thought the \\&quot;72 tweezer head\\&quot; would change my world. Nope. I can just shave my knees without being cut. I think I&#x27;m going to stick with waxing and use this \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; for emergencies and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators since I was a teen. The Emjoi is not my first machine.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product because despite of the number of tweezers and the two heads rotating in opposite directions, it is only as efficient as the machine I had 8 years ago. Where is the progress in technology?&lt;br /&gt;It has a hard time grabing onto the hair, requiring more passes over the skin &amp; consequently I end up spending as much time, if not more, than with my last Braun Silk Epil (it died on me recently after 6 years of faithful service). Also, despite the two rotating heads, I have to try epilating in all directions to get the finnest or the random isolated hairs off.&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Emagine misses a lot of hair, and when it doesn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t always get it right, breaking the hair instead of pulling it out. I have to use my epilator every week instead of every other week now...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see much difference between the 2 speeds provided.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t think I would, but I miss the light I had on the Silk Epil, which helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally the last critic is that the bulky head makes it difficult to take care of curved areas such as knees or armpits.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I found is that using the Emagine is relatively painless, which would be good for beginners. However, it is also reflective on the lack of efficiency, again, breaking the hair instead of pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you are a beginner and have the time and patience to use the Emjoi, it might be a good machine for you. However, for about the same price I truly believe you can get a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: lack of efficiency, breaks half of the hair instead of pulling it out, no light to help you see what you are doing, harder to clean than other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: relatively painless.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth epilator, it&#x27;s less painful and faster. It&#x27;s bulky and Misses the shorter hairs. A light would make it great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good epilator. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I changed from 5 stars to 3 stars due to poor customer service :( :( The epilator quit functioning properly about 8 months after purchase. A couple months after that I completely quit working. The warranty process is a complete hassle and SLOW!!! Not good when you rely on this for your regular hair removal method!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed. Quality product. Poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  The I have been waxing and/or epilating for at least five years now. I&#x27;ve used many different methods and products. I can&#x27;t shave because the hair starts growing back in just a few hours. I found epilating to be a better choice but it is so time consuming! This was the third epilator I have purchased over the years. The last one was a Braun. The Emojoi is FAR superior. I can&#x27;t believe how much faster it is and how much more hair it removes. Not only that, it is much less painful too! I think the pain is less because it so quickly and effectively pulls out the hair. I used to only be able to use epilate my armpits after applying a numbing cream because the area is so sensitive. With the Emjoi, I don&#x27;t need to use the cream and it is not even painful!! I use \\&quot;relax and wax, get the bump out of here\\&quot; to help with razor bumps. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> It only lasts a few months until it slowly starts to stop working and It breaks the hair off but does not pull out the root.  The hair grows back right away.  Also caused a lot of ingrown hairs.  It only makes your legs feel smooth if you wait until your hair is very long.  Otherwise, never get a totally smooth feeling.  The best part about this one is it never pulls your skin like my past ones have.  This company only has a 30 day money back guarantee which is pretty lame.  So I&#x27;m stuck buying one every 5 months.  Will probably spend more and go with a seller that has a longer return time!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was impressed by the 72 tweezer system. I thought it would be faster and cleaner. But in reality it does not even come closer to giving a good epilation. It is painless, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair even after several runs. I had to use a plucker after epilating with this product to remove those left over hairs. I have returned this product and ordered Braun silk epil and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> As a waxing aficionado of having a professional set-up at home for 6 years I began to dread the once a month set-up and clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic and alarmed the first time I used the Emjoi AP-18 Epilator.  Ecstatic because the little machine achieved similar results as waxing in a short amount of time with little set-up/ cleaning.  Alarmed due to my first reaction of the tweezers on taut lower front calf skin as if I was being electrically shocked a billion times and I almost instinctually threw the little machine at a wall.  It hurt.  Over time, I learned to brace myself for the first 30 seconds on the first leg.  Very different feeling from waxing oddly.&lt;br /&gt;Over time I noticed I had to epilate more often than waxing due to the root of hair not being pulled out.  That was okay.  Every 3 weeks of 15 minutes is great!&lt;br /&gt;After nine months of use, the little torture machine has begun to disfunction.  After 11 months it&#x27;s dead.  The rollers of tweezers do not rotate- they lock up and jam.  This is directly due to the tiny gear beginning to strip which transfers motion from the motor body of the little machine to the tweezer head rollers.  Possible cause of the stripping? Maybe pushing the moving head too firmly to catch all those little leg hairs not removed like they would be waxing...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the little leg fuzzes but I do mind this $77.69 machine dying in one year.  It&#x27;s beyond the return window too.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m pondering what to do with my hairy legs, I&#x27;m on Amazon shopping for the same epilator thinking that I could not press firmly this time, or I could try another epilator, or resume waxing (dread), or just shave again (lazy short term solution)...&lt;br /&gt;Three stars b/c it worked well when it worked (5 stars) and -2 stars because it has proven not to be a well engineered little machine past nine months.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, take care not to press firmly and brace yourself for that first 30 seconds.  It&#x27;s shocking!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1 year later:&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Braun epilator 6 months ago and found it worked, but not as good as the Emjoi on my legs.  It does out-manuever in bikini and underarm areas.  So, I bought another Emjoi AP-18.  I am so happy I did.  It efficiently does a detailed job on my legs.  I purchased the 2 year warranty from Square for $7 covering 100% malfunction if it dies in two years.  Maybe if I do not press with it, the gears will not strip.  Smooth leg wishes to you all!</li>
            <li> Shipping was great &amp; fast.&lt;br /&gt;The product just works but not effectively, it pulls the hairs &#x27;half way&#x27; not fully,making hairs to grow again in a few days, its like a shaver really. I only liked that it worked quickly but just didnt pull the hairs completely. Also didnt like that it only works with the charger intact.</li>
            <li> Holy crap this hurts! I&#x27;m a man and I&#x27;ve been a professional cyclist for years and have shaved my legs for as long as most women. I&#x27;d heard that pulling the hair out would last much longer than shaving. So in the interest of time I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. It made me want to cry and I don&#x27;t really like crying. Since I heard it gets better the more you use it I used it several more times and no it didn&#x27;t get better. It was agonizing every time. It was an exercise in self punishment. Since I decided I respect myself ( as much as a guy who shaves his legs can) I retired this little extension of hell to the dark corner under the bathroom sink. I only keep it in case someday I start working for the CIA and need an alternative to water boarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it does pull your hair out, but not particularly well IMO.</li>
            <li> It is the best. I had one before long time a go. I had forgotten how good it was. My aunt give me the idea to get one again</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Works and gets every little hair.</li>
            <li> My experience with epilators is somewhat limited since this would be only the second one that I&#x27;ve owned. My previous epilator was a Braun SE 7681. While I do like the epilation it offers, I unfortunately was dumb enough to believe that the battery would actually benefit me. So a year down the road, it barely held a charge so I decided to seek out something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought the Emjoi because of my curiosity for the dual head design. Too bad it turned out to be a marketing gimmic. Firstly, this epilator is loud, even for an epilator. The thing will blare at you which is a tad annoying, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Where the product ultimately fails is that it is simply horrible at getting hairs. It takes way too many passes for something with 72 tweezers to grab hairs and even then, it does a poor job. One thing that I noticed was that was almost painless which really bothered me for good reason. Very often, the Emjoi does not even pull hair out from the root, but just shaves it off somewhere near the top. It leaves behind very visible hair follicles and is very prone to ingrown hairs. In short, it takes way too long to do anything and it does a terrible job on top of that. I&#x27;ll certainly return this within the next two weeks; and will probably go for another Braun, but a corded model this time since their epilators seem to actually work well.</li>
            <li> I really like it! The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because it is hard to reach some areas, but that is obvious given the size. It pulls more hairs that previous ones i&#x27;ve had. Happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I would definitely recommend it. The pain level from my personal experience is equivalent to waxing, which for me it&#x27;s not that bad unless I just have a high pain tolerance. Also, in comparison to waxing you save so much time with this epilator. I usually wax my under arms and legs and this cuts the time spent on waxing by half. The epilator is a little bit loud when it&#x27;s on, but it does not bother me. I researched to see which epilator would be the best and I really like the fact that it has the dual opposed tweezers, it works pretty fast. This is the first and only epilator I have purchased and it works great! Hope this was helpful! (:</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 months ago and it&#x27;s broke now. The gear that turns the tweezers is plastic. Now it will not turn the tweezers because a toothe broke in the gear. I liked it when it worked. It just did not last. I called the Emjoi company in New York. They were wonderful. They are mailing me a replacement tweezer free of charge. It&#x27;s still under warranty. Yes, I do recommend this product. I does the job. Great customer service from Emjoi.com. The Amazon store I bought this from is Shave Now. They offer refund or replacement for one month after purchase. So, I did not contact them since it had been 6 months.</li>
            <li> I had been waxing for years. I have a thick, coarse hair but not luckily not very abundant on my legs. However, recently I suffered a severe burn in my underarms that took a lot to heal. As summer was approaching I need to seriously look for an alternative. Waxing was out of the question, it was not the first time I got burn but this time healing was much longer and painful than before. Since I used a small Emjoi epilator on my face, I decided to check on the reviews of other Emjoi products. I liked the Emagine in particular because reviewers specified it was fast and powerful. As usual, some people complain -in general- that epilators are sort of painful or uncomfortable. Honestly, I had been to a lot already. However, I did considered that the Emagine is not battery operated. Regardless, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did! Even when my underarm skin was still delicate and in process of healing the Emagine did an excellent job, very quick and with much less discomfort than anticipated. In less than 12 minutes I was done with my legs and underarms! That beats any record using epilators let alone the time-consuming waxing. Although, I did follow the recommendations of taking a shower to dilate the pores and using the exfoliating buff.&lt;br /&gt;And who cares about a cordless epilator if this one does the job in a fraction of the time and almost pain-free. I am very please with my new Emagine. Never I had been so hair-less confident during Summer.</li>
            <li> i used braun epilator for almost nine years i was looking for new one, when i read the review i wanted to give it a shot .......i am really really impressed the way it cleans amazing and the motor seems so powerful it ........it does what it says</li>
            <li> I got this product in perfect time. It was exactly what I ordered. I Think it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to finagle trying to shave my legs as often since I&#x27;m recovering from back surgery. I&#x27;ve used it only once so far, and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as closely as traditional shaving does; however, the rewards of no next-day stubble are great! I did use it on my arms and LOVE being hair-free there! I&#x27;m certain that with time and more experience using the Emjoi, I&#x27;ll become a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; at hair removal. Using the Emjoi after taking a bath or shower is a must, so the skin can soften, and I won&#x27;t lie - it does hurt to use it, but I just tried to think about the outcome. My skin was a bit red after use, but that quickly went away. I would definitely recommend the Emjoi. Just take a shower (and maybe an acetaminophen!) and learn to exercise patience, as it takes awhile to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> After using the braun 5280 for a few years I can say the AP-18 is by far the better epilator! It is more powerful, quieter, and best of all it won&#x27;t pinch your skin!!! I&#x27;ve used it over all types of skin and it has performed flawlessly. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied, the only thing I can&#x27;t talk about is how long it will last. The last Braun was good for 8 months before it started to act up. I&#x27;d buy it again :0)</li>
            <li> Bought this in June and already started having issues. The head keeps getting jammed and it cuts the hair instead of pulling it off the roots. Definitely will never buy this epitalor or even this brand. I&#x27;ve bought Emjoi for years and they just never last!! Going with the Braun 7681 instead. Not worth the price at all!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once. I definitely like it better than my last epilator. It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much. At first, I thought it was slower, but it&#x27;s actually more efficient than my last one. It gets super short hairs. Make sure you follow directions about how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the braun silk-epil for years and thought I give this a try.  I definitely was less painful than the silk-epil and it removed the hair a lot faster.  It worked great on my lips and chin without causing me to break out like the silk-epil did.</li>
            <li> These epilator is super easy to use, pain free and it really works, I use it in my legs, underarm and facial hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> does NOT get the fine hairs like stated, and with 72 tweezers takes just as long to remove hair as my worn out one</li>
            <li> I love it, i don&#x27;t have to shave every other day anymore, my skin feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li> This epilator has you moving it down in sweeping strokes. It works pretty well for my legs. It isn&#x27;t necessarily faster, but I&#x27;d say it has cut down on ingrown hairs. As for bikini lines and beyond, it doesn&#x27;t work well for smaller areas. Underarms is okay, but whatever surface you use it on has to be one where the large double head can be down in a long stroke.</li>
            <li> The best so far I have it or more than one year and I will definite recommend this product. It does the job amazing. Great seller too.</li>
            <li> Loooooove not having to shave as often. It doesn&#x27;t get me as smooth as a razor simply cause the grow back hair has to have time to get to the right length to epilate, but its so fine and soft that it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so think and legs used to get so stubbley the day after a shave it felt quite a bit like sandpaper. Much better! now i only really shave then i really need it completely smooth for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I&#x27;ve never had a problem and it&#x27;s been a while now. Definitely recomend.</li>
            <li> Epilator has 2 speeds, one is fast and the other is jet fast...I found when I used the \\&quot;jet fast\\&quot; speed~ the epilator broke my hair off instead of pulling my hair out~ Leaving a stubble like feeling to my legs. (afterwards...the lower speed could not pick up the broken hairs left behind) If you use the slower speed it works great but with the higher price of this epilator...I could purchase a less expensive model and get the same results. Thats why I am giving this epilator a 2 stars ....jet fast speed doesn&#x27;t hurt because you&#x27;re not pulling out any/all hair...Faster isn&#x27;t always better........</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators during the last 10 years of my life and I am happy with this one. Good price, faster than average, however it is a little louder (probably because it has two heads) the most epilators. It would be nice if it had a light but other than that it does a great job for me.&lt;br /&gt;Those who say it is painful are most likely not used to epilating. Maybe an epilator with attached massager would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This little device works really well! I got used to the pulling sensation pretty quickly. It&#x27;s not painful but you can feel it. The best thing&#x27;s how slowly the hair grew back. Sweet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally hairy gal... as in my leg/armpit hair grows back noticeably within 1-2 days and I can&#x27;t keep going to get it waxed because I just don&#x27;t have the time and money!!!! I will never go back to shaving because it has made my hair thicker than that of a mans due to shaving. I regret ever picking up my first razor and shaving cream bottle. I&#x27;m tired of wearing pants that cover my legs during the summer and not being able to wear tank tops so I finally decided to try something new -- this epilator. BEST PURCHASE I&#x27;VE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Boy do I love this thing. Now I can wear shorts that show my butt cheeks and I don&#x27;t have to have people staring at my legs because they&#x27;re hairy but rather because of my sweet booty!!!! My favorite part is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean!!! It comes in a cute little bag too!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after watching one of my favorite Youtube Beauty Gurus. I am Hispanic and have very dark brown hair, I live in Miami, FL so I am always wearing sleeveless tops. I also have very sensitive skin. By sensitive I mean I shave my underarms and I get red bumps and it itches and hurts. After many years (I am 29 years old &#x3D;)) of shaving I noticed that I had dark under arms. In attempts to lighten them as naturally as possible I decided to give this epilator a try. I will be very honest with you, it hurt like heck. I put my big girl panties on and used it. I removed all the hair and I was happy. I had a little bit of redness which subsided within minutes and I was hair free for 2 almost 3 weeks. When I tried it again it wasn&#x27;t as painful. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year and I must say it does the job. It does leave some stray tiny hairs. So you might have to use tweezers. I have noticed the hair goes back thinner and it has helped with the dark spots. I recommend washing the area with soap and water, drying it thoroughly and patting on some baby powder to help the epilator grab the hair with less irritation to your skin. I really hope this review helps you. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of dark underarms or people who are getting any type of irritation from shaving or other hair removal products. Set realistic expectations, know that it will hurt, but it&#x27;s worth it. Everyone is different so what works for me may not work for you.</li>
            <li> works better than I expected! hair from my arms was so easy to take off and hasn&#x27;t come back at all for over a week now! works really well anywhere else, especially underarms.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful epilator. I&#x27;ve owned this model for several months now and it&#x27;s use has only caused me great joy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an epilator I&#x27;ve been using for several years and it has been missing more and more hairs as well as breaking many off at the skin instead of removing the root. I was very excited to try this when I took it out of the box and I was not disappointed! I&#x27;ve always started at my ankles and worked my way up because it hurts the least there and a little more the further you get up your legs, and when I started at my ankle there was almost no pain. The pain on the rest of my leg was definitely less than what I had experienced with my old epilator, though I wouldn&#x27;t say there was none and it took significantly less time to do them. I was very hopeful to try this on my underarms because it had always been way too rough for me and I have a high tolerance for pain, but it still hurt very badly and I even noticed some little drops of blood where hair had been pulled out on the spot that I tried. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as I don&#x27;t have much of a need for that. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a shaver attachment because my old one had one, as well as a plastic piece to put on the shaver that trimmed your hair to a shorter length that was still long enough for the epilator to easily grab it, but not too long that it pulled more than it needed to, and I think that was helpful.</li>
            <li> I have owned an epilator for a few years and have had good success with it until more recently when I started to get nasty red bumps on my legs every time I epilate.  I thought maybe it was the epilator getting too old so I decided to try this one because of the reviews.  It does work but seems to take many, many passes before all of the hair is removed and even then I am left with strays. Not sure if I am doing something wrong?  It is definitely not as painful (can barely feel it, actually) as compared to my previous epilator but seems to pull fewer hairs for sure. Still have those red bumps though, so maybe it is time to go back to the dreaded razor.</li>
            <li> Too awkward to use on anything but your legs, and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I gave it a six month trial, and finally got rid of it.  It truly was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Emjoy epilators are great they last and work well. Nice not to have to shave with a razor and cut myself!</li>
            <li> this works greats. got if for christmas. works better and twice as fast. Also alot less painful!&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how effective this product is. I did one strip up my leg...yes it was a bit stinging at first...many little ones...but it covered a wide are at once. The next time was MUCH better, to get the little ones missed which grew up about 4days later. I am doing small sections at a time, knowing that the first round is the one to get through. After that, smooth sailing! Will update again later. This is an epilator I will use!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not  good&lt;br /&gt;it cuts hair not remove it from the root like i thought&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a good choice</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  Get&#x27;s the job done efficiently, and hair take a few weeks before it begins to grow back.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It broke after 6-7 times of using First days it was great but one of the gears got worn out after 6-7 times of using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple types of these. This one is the best. the crazy amount of 72 tweezerheads makes the grueling pain of exorcising the hair demons from all my public and private parts go by much faster. Yes, I use this on secret garden. The trick is to pull the skin taut, so it WON&#x27;T flap your skin around like pulling on the whiskers of a hound dogs mouth. If you try to use this on the back end near your back door, then good luck. It&#x27;s too wide for me to try and tidy up that porch. Otherwise, this is BY FAR the quickest, easiest, way out of all hair removal I&#x27;ve had for my secret garden. I&#x27;ve seen what other reviews have said, and yeah it hurts. You&#x27;re pulling hair out. However, the results are ammmmmazzzzing. 5 stars for the two speed options, the cute travel bag, the crazy amount of tweezerheads, and the wicked awesome results.</li>
            <li> Bought five years ago and still using once a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my back because I hate shaving and waxing. This was way worse than both. Extremely painful to the level that I could only get a few inches done and I gave up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading several reviews. I have dark corse hair and i was tired of shaving and waxing. It took me a long time to get the job done, enjoy is also very noisy but I like it still and i&#x27;ll tell you why. Once you&#x27;ve get shaved, the maintenance is very easy, just go over the spots that need to be shaved and that&#x27;s it. It does not hurt at all, it is confortable and very easy to use and clean. You&#x27;ll need to go over the spots several times until the hair is completeley removed but once again after the first time, the maintenance is a piece of cake. No more messy wax , shave cream and razor bumps for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, removes a lot of hair per pass, a little annoying to have cord always, but my main problem with it is it is too big to get into small spaces like around the side of your ankles. As far as pain goes, yeah, it hurts, but less and less each time, and pain is beauty as my grandma likes to say. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating since they first came out in the &#x27;80s  and this is the easiest and least painful one of three I&#x27;ve used.  Good price, maybe one day I&#x27;ll buy the cordless, but I have so few hairs left on my legs and underarms, this one will last for years.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and absolutely hate shaving for numerous reasons. I don&#x27;t live near a waxing salon and could not upkeep as well as I would have liked. I even had my husband help me with waxing and he hates it. My friend told me about this thing and she stated she hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2 weeks! I immediately purchased the Emjoi Dual and will never, ever shave again!</li>
            <li> Hurts like a b#$%! but for those of us who are sick and tired of shaving, it does the trick. Some spots are so painful that you need to go to your happy place to get through it. It&#x27;s kinda like waxing really slowly. It does what it says it should do, and often times the area stays hair free for longer than it would shaving, but some areas it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference. Yes it hurts - yes it works. Beauty is pain :)</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to it, but with each use it&#x27;s much easier than the last. Take your time, don&#x27;t be in a hurry. It&#x27;s very user friendly, easy to clean. (Yes, hairs get all over the place, but because this is a dry epilator, the hair is easy to wipe up and throw away, the hair don&#x27;t stick to anything.) The first use was quite intense for me, but that was because I&#x27;ve never epilated before, the second time was way less intense. I love being hair free longer than shaving, but like I said, if it&#x27;s your first time, just take your time.</li>
            <li> Using the Emjoi was astonishingly painful the first time- I did not Enjoy it. Having no stubble was terrific enough to get over my initial dislike and it&#x27;s not intense anymore since I use it frequently. It also doesn&#x27;t chew on my armpits like my (previous) inexpensive tweezer did, and that&#x27;s worth the price upgrade alone.</li>
            <li> While using this does mean a bit if pain the results are well worth the discomfort!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and I was loosing the battle of facial hair.  I used to wax my  upper lip and that worked great and it disappeared for a while to come back as whiskers in my old age and not just as a mustache but whiskers on my chin and neck.  I didn&#x27;t want the hassle and mess of waxing any more so I started plucking and shaving.  That was not good because now the whiskers were coming in more  and were white.  So I checked into the epilators and this one had very good reviews.  I thought I don&#x27;t really need such a big epilator for my face but I read other reviews that recommended it so I figured it was the best one for me.  I didn&#x27;t worry about the pain because waxing hurts and this is just nothing compared to waxing (which I got used to).  I only felt this a little bit but it was a good feeling to me knowing that I was getting rid those awful whiskers and the result would last longer than shaving.  I will be using it on my legs and underarms but my main purpose is my face.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Braun Braun epilators - unfortunately the Braun epilators with more tweezers are for use wet/dry and these only can be used without the cord.  The attached cord has never been a problem for me and I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to charge the epilator so ordered the Emjoi.  I don&#x27;t find it picks up the hair as well as the Braun did and though there are more tweezers than my old Braun, I feel that I have to pass over the area more times.</li>
            <li> It does hurt when you first began but with more use its just a tickle but make sure to put lotion on after unless you don&#x27;t the issue of dry skin after using it.</li>
            <li> perfect.  Once or twice a week a quick once over and done!  LOVE IT  not like epilady of the &#x27;80;s where it yanked everything out.  smooth and quick</li>
            <li> The quality and effectiveness of this product both deliver excellence. I do recommend this purchase as it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> i would give this a 3.5, just because i thought it was not worth paying $80. It didnt meet my expectation ...which was to remove all my baby hair but over all this epilator gets the job done</li>
            <li> I am a hairy female, and it sucks! This gadget has made my life so much easier. I do my arms . underarms and stomach area. The hair is soft and grows back extremely slow.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it so much we bought two more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I have owned 5 Emjoi epilators over the last 15 years and this is the most flexible as it rolls over my knobby knees. I do need to go over the same area a few times to remove all my leg hairs - some just seem to grow out in different directions. I usually only need to use the Epilator every week or 2 - much better than when I was shaving every day or 2!</li>
            <li> You know... I like this epilator, because of the way you can move it - back and forth like an electric razor - but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my little Phillips satinelle epilator; which is cheaper and pulls the hair out better and with the root. :/</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but it is worth it. Keeps hairs from coming back so soon. I hate to shave. It does get better as you get use to it</li>
            <li> Best Epi ever. I have used Epis for 12 years and this one is fast, easy and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> Went over and over the same spot and still left hair behind. Also irritated my skin, leaving me with red bumps everywhere. Complete waste of money. Will stick to shaving or depilatory creams</li>
            <li> This is the best way to remove hair I have found in a very long time.  I use it primarily to remove facial hair.  I have been waxing for a few years now and have become tired of the time and money spent.  Bought this after seeing it rated high elsewhere.  It works very well only missing the most stubborn hairs which I can then tweeze myself.  I have not yet tried this product on my legs or underarms.</li>
            <li> I chose this to replace my old Braun because it had lots of good reviews, but I didn&#x27;t really believe the claims of one pass does the trick. It arrived today and I tried it out and I have to admit that I was wrong. One pass is all I needed. Not only that, it got all the fine fair hairs that previous epilators always have missed. The extra tweezing heads, and their small size, seems to make the difference. In addition it was almost completely painless, I think because the hairs were coming out cleanly instead of being tugged and missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble, and it&#x27;s not a big one, is that my old Braun had a light on the business end so I could easily see what I was doing and there&#x27;s no light on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now and they usually last me about 2 years. This one one only lasted for 9 months. It was OK for the first 6 months then the effectiveness went down and it was taking longer to do my legs. I&#x27;m now trying the Braun.</li>
            <li> I had the Emjoi Optima until it finally wore out.  I thought it was great but when I got the Emagine I was amazed.  It works faster and gets more hair becaue of the additional tweezers.  It is also easier to clean because of the sealed head.  Works great on my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found the hair removal brilliant, it requires a number of repeated visits to the offending area in order to remove a significant (and still not all) proportion of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said for the price of a single wax or thereabouts this is a reasonable tool for its purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally if you have a couple of drinks first it becomes much less painful...</li>
            <li> I used to own the Remington ep1060 and that broke off more hairs than it pulled out which was inexcusable. The emjoi is definitely better and surprisingly is the fraction of the pain. Sure I can&#x27;t get 100% silky smooth legs but this makes it close with lasting effects.</li>
            <li> it removes hair fast but unlike Braun brand, skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft and the hair grow back after 2 weeks. it seems it does not epil from roots.</li>
            <li> bought this for a friend . she said it works great</li>
            <li> Its my first time using it, but i love it, It doesn&#x27;t hurt as I was told before or all the reviews made me believe, I was more afraid reading all the reviews and thinking on use it.&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to use and I am so happy with the final results, of course the first time takes some time but it is worth.</li>
            <li> So I bought this epilator after having seen a review on it from a youtuber named Naptural85. I&#x27;m an African American woman and needed something to get rid of hair since shaving my curly hair constantly ended up with ingrowns and painful bumps. After hearing the review from her, as well as a few other bloggers and youtubers, I thought that I would give it a chance. With tax and shipping, this was around a $80 purchase and I&#x27;m not sure now if it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, I like the packaging that it comes in. The box comes filled with everything from a brush to clean the device with to a full blown, down to the nitty-gritty manual. I did exactly what the directions instructed that I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I took a warm bath and exfoliated all areas that I was going to use the device on with a loofa&lt;br /&gt;-Made sure all areas were dry and free of lotions, creams, powders, etc&lt;br /&gt;-Turned it on, made sure the logo faced me, and began epilating in the direction the hair grew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what I heard from others was that it only took a few strokes for this device to get all of your hairs and leave you with smooth skin. I have no idea how many times I went over the same small patch of skin trying to make sure that all of the hair was removed only to find that IT WOULD NOT GET ALL OF THE HAIR. I was left with a scattering of stubble, irritated looking bumps decorating my underarms, and I could have just been panicking but I could have sworn that my underarms were darker afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not smooth, they are bumpy. The hair is not gone. I was unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I followed the directions in the manual of how to take the device apart to clean it and that was fine, but in trying to put it back together, I accidentally put the silver ring that surrounds the tweezers on backwards and now it won&#x27;t come off. Because it won&#x27;t come off, I can not put the device back together and now I can not use it. I only just received this device today. I&#x27;m not blaming this on the device or company since it was MY FAULT that I put a piece back incorrectly, but I am saying that it would have been nice to have a bit of room for error since my $80 purchase is now obsolete because of one simple mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say overall that this was a bad product (since I did not have much time to use it before it became unusable), but for being on the closer end of $100, I could have just stuck to using electric clippers and saved my money. I am giving this 2 stars because my hopes for this product have been severely dashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to get the silver ring off and put back on correctly.  It was not easy by any means, I had to use a screwdriver. Still, I can use the device again and I noticed that after applying baby powder (which I recommend to anyone epilating) and waiting over night, the bumps were not as bad. I still had to go over my underarms again, but they did feel softer. I am hoping that it gets better the more often I do this and that the bumps were just a result of my sensitive skin not being used to be tweezed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this considered, I will change my rating to 4 stars since this does work wonderfully on my legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my bikini line, but, I am using it also now for my legs, the first time hurts a little, but you get used to it quickly; and in my opinion it is much better than shaving every other day.  I had the smaller one before, but this one is much quicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first start by saying that I am a male, nineteen years of age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy guy with about 2-3 hairs hairs growing out of many of my hair follicles, I bought this epilator to remove the rather thick, coarse hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;Painful doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe how it felt removing the hair from my knuckles, but I continued until I saw that some of my follicles were bleeding. I considered the fact that fingers are sensitive and that plucking the 1/2 inch hairs from them first really wasn&#x27;t a good way to judge the product.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it on my leg after trimming the hair to 1/8th inch, it&#x27;s good at plucking the hair but I didn&#x27;t get far since it was leaving my skin with red bumps ,blotchy patches and bleeding hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, pale, and thin so I guess this it to be expected. Overall it did a good job at catching the hairs, but it&#x27;s just too painful to use and I don&#x27;t want my skin to get infected from being abused like that. If you can tolerate pain and have tougher skin this would work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li> Strong motor. Open it up... inside... cheap Chinese plastic gears.... Big surprise... after a few weeks the gears are stripped.....  STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> I tried the Epilady many many years ago when i first came out and felt like my skin was being ripped off.  After many years of shaving and waxing I decided to take a plunge and try epilation again.  The technology sure has come a long way.  I am using it for my legs, underarms and bikini area with minimal discomfort.  I had been self-waxing before and I love not having the messy wax everywhere.  I&#x27;m writing this review to let people who tried epilation in the past and gave up that they may want to try it again.</li>
            <li> I did not worked even a 3 months and after that they are saying product can not be returned. Why the hell do they sell such product which does not even work for 3 months. I am very disappointed with the product which can not be returned even though it was under 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product. So far, I have used it three times, in less that 2 weeks, and it has not delivered the smoothness it purports.  The product description  says results last for six weeks; that hasn&#x27;t proven to be true.  I would return it except that I do not have the original packaging  &amp; receipt.  I got equal results from a Remington Electric Shaver which was 3/4ths less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the product was not as painful to me as others reported.  As well, my skin did not get irritated the way it does with a manual razor. I have very sensitive skin so I am impressed with that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still,  I am under-whelmed &amp; would not recommend this fairly expensive product.</li>
            <li> I have had the replace the head after less than a year and this happened with another of there models. It tok almost 3 months to get the replacement part due to availability. What does that tell you?  It does not last 6 weeks unless your you have fine hair. Now this product is making a squeaking noise and barely turns.... I am not going to waste more money on this failing product. It is too much money for this piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> I tried an epilady back when they first came out, I was in Jr High and it was way too painful. I haven&#x27;t tried anything like it until the Emjoi eMagine and I really, really love it. I&#x27;ve only done my arms, so far. It honestly feels exactly like getting a tattoo. (I have many) I finished my arms about thirty minutes ago and now my skin is just softly tingly. It&#x27;s hard to explain.  But, I know it&#x27;ll hurt less and less the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m really happy with the results. It even plucked every one of my tiny invisible hairs on my upper arms. It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it does a very good job. I have gone back to using a depilatory. Don&#x27;t have to worry about missing places.</li>
            <li> very nice product I wish everyone can get for $30 less like myself. For the price it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> -Entry below asterisks is my previous review-  As I suspected a bit over a year ago, the sad undersized gearing ... smaller and narrower than those in our Phillips Satinelle or our Emjoi Erase which both still work, stripped awhile back rendering the unit unusable. Either increasing the width of the gears or improving materials would make this the best epilator we have used. It&#x27;s a shame if they haven&#x27;t since it was our favorite of 3 epilators and isn&#x27;t cheap. We are debating whether to go ahead and buy it again every two years or try a higher-end Braun or Phillips in hope that it works as well and  lasts 4-5 years. A problem that corded epilators face is the adapter cord tends to stress inside the plastic and break over time  I really don&#x27;t care for cordless batteries dying even sooner, so that option is ruled out I will affirm what many others have noted. Having a Phillips Satinelle in addition allows getting hairs the Emjoi misses, and vice-versa.  ************************************************************************ This unit surprised me a bit in both plus and minus columns. A plus, the opposed tweezer heads do a good job of getting more done in one swipe, and have a rubber element that tries to lift flatter hairs for better removal. It does this quite well, though some smaller finer hairs seem to get missed. Truth be told, my old unit of another brand did no better in that regard, and didn&#x27;t do as thorough job overall.  Minus is my previous unit had a larger gear system which made me suspect the small, single gear on this Emjoi unit maynot hold up. So far it&#x27;s doing fine. I will follow up if that changes in the future.  I would at this point recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Earlier last year, I bought a [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7]].  Of course, it was painful since it was the first time I&#x27;d ever used an epilator, but I kept with it.  Over time, the pain was easier to withstand, but some places still hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun every week or two since then, but the downside is that it&#x27;s battery-operated only (the cord is for charging, only).  Since I&#x27;m a guy and have a tad more hair than the ladies (although, it&#x27;s much thinner and more sparse since I&#x27;ve been epilating), it takes a little while longer for me to do the job (and I&#x27;ve got to do my thighs, chest, torso, and arms, ugh!).  I could only get one arm or leg on one charge, so I&#x27;d have to either wait between areas for a charge, or spread out my epilating over a few days to get it all done.  That, and it seemed to break the hears more often than actually pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Emjoi because I liked that it was corded, which meant unlimited power that wouldn&#x27;t fade.  I really don&#x27;t need the portability of a battery operated epilator, nor do I need it to be waterproof (epilating in a dim shower really has no benefits, I found).  The light on the Braun is very handy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Emjoi for the first time last night, and let me tell you, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  It&#x27;s noisy, and it has no light, but it sure gets the job done.  I got both legs done in less than the time it took to do just one leg with the Braun!  And since I didn&#x27;t have to wait for a charge, I was able to do my entire body all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what so amazing, though: the heads on this Emjoi seem to run much faster than my Braun, and because of this, I experienced a LOT less pain!  I did not expect this at all!  I assumed all epilators offered the same amount of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who&#x27;s experienced with epilating knows what broken hairs feel like: visually, the hairs are gone, but you can feel the tops of them at the surface of the skin.  Withthis Emjoi, I felt smoother than I ever have.  I was weary, though, because I didn&#x27;t have the same amount of redness that I&#x27;d grown accustomed to after using the Braun. But, the smoothness doesn&#x27;t lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside to the Emjoi, which will cause me to continue using my Braun.  It doesn&#x27;t get into the very small areas.  Since I&#x27;m a guy, I have hair on my hands and fingers.  The Emjoi is much too bulky to fit close enough on my fingers and hands.  So, the Braun works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, The Emjoi is a HUGE improvement over my Braun.  Not only is it faster, but it&#x27;s also more effective and causes less pain and redness.  Trust me, this is a much better buy!</li>
            <li> I used this just one time so far but am already in love with it. Hurts much less than my old emjoy and is so much faster to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i received the box i was thinking returning it before trying because i was afraid of the pain, but i couldn&#x27;t, so, i gave it a try and am glad i did. Like i said, i had much less pain what made me happy and encouraged me to do my whole legs, and now, they are just smooth with almost no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairs were very short and they were pulled out like that, different of wax that i would need wait they grow more to depilate. I read a few reviews that said if the hair is short would hurt more, and seems thruth because i had longer hair on the top of my legs and hurt more. Even with the pain i was glad of getting rid of all that ugly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used in my whole legs, bikini area, under arms and over my lips... No problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you never used epilator like this before, you will hurt... it is normal, but you will get used to it and will hurt less the next times. Also, by experience with wax and other methods, if you never had depilation pulling the hair, when we do the first time can bleed a tiny bit (specially under arms and sometimes bikini area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just good things to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Emjoy for making this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator.  The first two were by Braun and I bought each of them in the $50-60 price range.  I figured I can afford to splurge and get a fancier epilator, so I decided to get the emjoi.  You would assume with more tweezer heads it would be able to remove more hairs, but compared to my Brauns, this one does not pick up as many hairs and works a lot slower.  I find myself going over an area at least three times, if not more for most of the hair to be picked up.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well on picking up the shorter hairs either as my other ones...(I have lost or the one my sister has claimed).  Overall, it does a lousy job...I&#x27;ve even considered going back to waxing while using it since it does such a poor job at picking up hairs.  I guess more money doesn&#x27;t always equate to better quality...sigh...and I refuse to buy another epilator right now after dishing out a $100 on this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that I would be better able to cover large areas such as my legs and arms for longer hair removal; specifically for summer time. I personally find waxing these areas to be a nightmare and very hit or miss, and did not want to spend a fortune going to a salon.     Pros-  -fast, the extra heads do what you would expect, cover large areas more efficiently.  -less painful than other epilator varieties....the function that presses down on the area does help ease the pain as the alternate side pulls out the hair...keep in mind that the angle does have to be correct, but that is not too tricky  -dual speeds, one for softer one for rougher hair....I tend to use the faster speed anyways but it helps with comfort to start with the gentler speed then transition    cons-    dont, dont, dont, use this on sensitive areas such as the face or armpit or even the bikini line.....at least for me. It says that you can if you manuever it correctly, but trust me its easier to use one of the smaller units made more specifically for these areas or to simply use another method of hair removal.    must be plugged in during use...not a big deal but never the less    price- but then again, just one trip to a salon will cost you pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Using this fits into my schedule so much easier than waxing. With waxing at home or otherwise you need to commit to getting the job done all at once. With this epilator - you can start one leg when the baby is down for a nap and then get the other when you have another moment. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t pick everything up in one pass...but that still doesn&#x27;t matter to me because of the time savings and ease of use. Didn&#x27;t hurt much but I&#x27;m a veteran waxer. It is also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Broke after three years - The motor died and that was with infrequent use??</li>
            <li> ok so before i bought emjoy i already had braun silk epil which broke down after only two years after i bought it so i was so skeptical of what to buy !   i am really happy of the product, i like it because it is fast and  doesn hurt comparing to the other one , i barely feels it , it&#x27;s amazing ! just go for it :)</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.. at all.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Very comfortable shape to hold and point at various angles.  Large tweezer surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Motor action feels and sounds the most hollow and rickety compared to other epilators I&#x27;ve ever had.  Also, I rather suspect it is breaking off more hairs than it is pulling out.  At $80, the price.  Certainly, I would expect better for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Emjoi Optima is still hands down the best for me.</li>
            <li> I used the Emjoi gently silken epilator for about two years before getting the Emagine - definitely happy with my purchase. I had read the reviews on several different websites before buying this product and it is definitely less painful than my previous epilator. Works quite fast as well - I use it for maintenance after getting my arms and legs waxed and it works like a charm. Few tips - make sure to stretch the skin to help reduce pain and try to do it after a shower so that the hair is a little easier to pull out. Also lay a towel or something to catch the hair because it tend to fly around a little when it is plucked out by the machine. Wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me, b/c it is so much more convenient and less expensive than going to a salon. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work out.  I have a bad back, and shaving can be a pain.  I figured to use this once every week or so was better than shaving every day.  WRONG.    It did pull out some of the hairs, but for the most part, it snapped the hairs instead, leaving me worse off then when shaving.  The snapped hairs led to very painful ingrown hairs, VERY quickly.  I hardly ever got an ingrown hair when shaving, so this really surprised me.  I ended up with tons of little cuts all over my legs from having to dig the ingrown hairs out.  On top of that, my legs always felt like I had not shaved in two days; NEVER smooth.    My sister tried it thinking she might have better luck and buy it, but it was so painful for her that she could not do more than a square inch; needless to say, she regretted letting her hair grow out all week.    Within two to three weeks, I returned it.  My back hurt worse than ever because it took so long to get those ingrown hairs out.      Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I purchased an Emjoi  AP-18 last May after my old epilator (Braun) bit the dust.  This product is AMAZING. Fast and effective.  I can do both legs in just under 30 minutes. My old epilator used to take an hour or more. I use the Emjoi on my under arms and I experience considerably less discomfort.  I would highly recommed Emjoi AP-18 to anyone interested in purchasing an epilator. The only thing I miss about my old epilator is that it had a light on it... but who needs a light to search for hairs left behind when there aren&#x27;t any?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product exclusively for the removal of hair on my face. I do not have hair on my legs, arms or under arms, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do have patches of hair that grow under my chin (over my top lip, around the lower sides of my mouth, and on my chin). After carefully researching and comparing epilators, I bought this one because it seemed most ideal for my specific need. I also thoroughly read the instructions that came with the unit. There was no mention by the manufacturer that this epilator painfully pinches and grabs your skin while in use. I am a seasoned user of facial wax, so I know that hair removal is not a pain-free process by any means. My first use of the Emjoi produced somewhat satisfactory results, but I still had to tweeze some hairs away. Not wanting to give up on this unit, I cleaned it according to the instructions, and stored it away. I waited the 6-8 weeks for the next round of growth, and to my dismay, was not happy with the results (not to mention the almost unbearable pain of the pinching and grabbing of my skin by the machine). I contacted Amazon, and there is basically nothing that can be done. I wasted money on a product that cannot be returned at this juncture, and most certainly one that I will never use again. Perhaps I can sell it at a garage sale and recoup some of my money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that I could shave less often. I waited until the hair on my legs was grown out to the recommended length to use the epilator. However, it didn&#x27;t pull out the hair. I went over my legs multiple times and still, almost no hair was removed. I have fairly light and thin hair, so perhaps it didn&#x27;t work for that reason. I had to return the item because it simply did not work.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific epilator!! I will never go back to waxing again.  Not nearly as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well but is so hard to use!</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons to this product as with any.&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the cons: it lacks a light. You have to be in a very well lit room or outside to see the lighter or finer hairs on your legs. My vision is fine, I do not require glasses, but with out the light, I am straining to see the backs of my legs and lower down near the ankle. Also, it will not work if not plugged in. It isn&#x27;t a charger cord, it&#x27;s a power cord. This is annoying because you can&#x27;t use it wherever you want in the house with out something ridiculous like an extension cord. I mean, why not just shave? Additionally, there are two speeds, 1 is slower, 2 is faster. At first, the slower speed was more efficient because the fastest speed would just tear hair in half instead of pluck the whole follicle. As time went by, the motor got weak and the faster speed was the better choice. And I have to say it is a little pricey. Around $70 for something that had better be worth it. And for my final con- the motor gave out. I bought this about 4 years ago. I took good care of it, I cleaned it, I stored it with the cap on and kept it out of damp, moist areas. None of that mattered to the little motor that couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;As for the pros: it is easy to use. The double sided heads are good for one reason, not because they pluck double the hair, because any seasoned epilator knows, you have to come to hair at the right angle, but because you can go back and forth on your arm pits with out having to turn it around. And if you are someone who has hair growing out of your legs every which way, then you might consider the double sided heads to be more efficient, otherwise, its really only an arm pit benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I keep trying to think of pros, and I think I might just be super irritated that this thing no longer works after 4 years, but c&#x27;mon, can&#x27;t anything last anymore? Why must everything be made so cheaply? There is no true quality anymore. So, I give it a two, because, while it lasted, it did the job.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I bought this one instead of my Braun on which the battery failed after about a year. I was very happy at first, since this is an epilator with a cord, so I thought it should definitely last longer. I am sure it will, except that for me there is no use in it at all. This epilator hardly pulls any hair from my skin. Big plus is that it never pinched my skin, no matter what direction I go. Huge minus is that it leaves short hair untouched. Unlike Braun it does not lift a hair at its root, passing over it instead. I need to spend twice as much time, manually trying to lift my hair so the damn thing grabs it in the end. The whole process now turned into a disaster, with me spending 40 minutes every other day. I need to use it that often because it leaves so many hairs behind. I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to come to the office recently and now switched to waxing again. I think I will go back to Braun. Even though it lasted a bit less than a year, it was a year I never had to worry about smoothness of my legs.</li>
            <li> Save ur money, hurts like b**ch. ouchy.......&lt;br /&gt;Go get laser hair removes or something else.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to the epilator and I think it&#x27;s more about me getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 5 years now and it still works great!</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 months and finally decided that it&#x27;s just easier to shave. Hair grows back too fast to invest the time it takes and to put up with the pain. Might try one of the flash things next.</li>
            <li> first epilator. I really love it. I had been a long-time waxer, so no stranger to that type of pain. This barely hurts at all now that Ive used it a few times. It hurt much less than I thought it would when I first used it. Also, the company &amp;#34;Shave Now&amp;#34; was terrific to deal with. Top notch.</li>
            <li> Does not remove hair as good as I expected it too.  This Epilator was rated number one for best buy when I went on line to find the best Epilator for 2015.  I was really disappointed in the quality; it is so cheaply made compared to my previous Epilator.  And does not remove hair as good either.  I wanted to buy the Epilator I had previously used but it is no longer made.  Spend a little more and get something that will work and last for awhile.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the hair removal pretty good.  It is not painful, although it felt tingly at first to me.  It doesn&#x27;t make you smooth like shaving, but it creates an acceptable situation.  I like it better than shaving and it stays away a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I still find it easier to just get waxed.</li>
            <li> I use this for my whole leg. It misses a lot of fine hair and the hair seems to grow back quite fast. Or at least I have to touch up every day or every other day. My sister in law has this also and on her hair it works great and she can go a long time in between needing to touch up. So it just must be my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years (so it&#x27;s not like I just started) and it&#x27;s great, but not nearly as good as waxing (which I can usually get a good 2 weeks out of), but great for in between waxings and is much cheaper than waxing (if you go somewhere) and less of a hassle (if you wax at home, which I do).</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand. Maybe there was something wrong with the one I received. It broke after about four uses. I need to double check the refund/return policy because this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I cannot event trust this. I received the product. Even in the first trial it stopped working. it doesn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this removes hair extremely well, even when going over the area several times. Plus, it seems rather tough on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Despite having more tweezers, the way this epilator keeps the skin taught, means it&#x27;s less painful than the others I have used.  It is faster than my others as well, and does an awesome job on my bikini line, though the size does make it a bit awkward in spots.  As with most epilators, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs on my legs (they are fine and blonde), but definitely enough to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I bought it to use on my arms which are a little hairier than I&#x27;d like.  It took some getting used to and it can be a little loud, but once you get the hang of it, just keep going and then I make sure to moisturize with a good moisturizer.  Then I have no red bumps or anything the next day and completely smooth arms.  Works like a charm!  Plus, it really does take much longer to grow back than I would have expected which is a great side benefit!</li>
            <li> After researching epilators i choose to get this one, so i ordered it and was very excited. It never came. I contacted ShaveNow but they were no help, they would not work with me. I ended up getting an amazon giftcard for reimbursement, not a problem. but shave now will not work with you!!</li>
            <li> This multi-head epilator does the job of my old one in half the time.  It&#x27;s a little louder, but works twice as hard to get even the tiniest hair.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  It does not get all the hairs.  Leave some stubs behind.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product for the third time since I&#x27;ve received it.  I consider myself a somewhat hairy guy.  I purchased this to remove my torso body hair.  Thanks to Webisites on Epilators and reviews from others.  I would like to share that the more you use it the less painful it is.  I have sensitive skin and coarse hair the areas that I epilate are red and tender to the touch.  I redness lasts awhile.  From other reviewers Baby Powder, Aloe Vera and a good Exfoliant make the process efficient and hurt less.  The price is less than waxing, lazering and razor blades.  I am ahead in the long run achieving a positive body image.  I have accepted that I will not have a hairless torso but it&#x27;s leaps and bounds from thicket I had.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to one I already have.  Have had for a couple of years, and is starting to have signs of age.  Wanted this as a backup until my original one dies.  Love Love Love this item.  Have been using Emjoi&#x27;s for years.  I have sensitive skin and this works the best on me.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using epilators because I get airbrush tans and shaving removes the color.This is my FOURTH epilator in the past month. It works very well. The other epilators either cut the hair and I had to repeat the process after a couple of days or left my skin feeling bumpy and not soft and just shaved. This leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth. The dual rotating heads make the process fast and easy. Unbelievably, there is SLIGHT pain, but barely noticeable. The downside is that it must be used with a cord. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> While it was working it did an ok job but the hair didn&#x27;t stay away as long as my last epilator. It didn&#x27;t pick up the short hairs as well. To make things worse it was loud, kept getting louder and stopped working 14 months. The blades stopped turning.</li>
            <li> I own several Emjoi products. I normally order directly from Emjoi. I purchased this one from Amazon. I don&#x27;t understand how but it is not the same quality.</li>
            <li> i m trying epilater  the first time. i was little worried it will hurt. but i didnt feel that much pain and i was able to remove my legs and hands in just 15 mins.. i love the product .</li>
            <li> What the heck! How does this have outstanding reviews! I even youtubed this device to make sure I was using it to it&#x27;s potential. The results are NOT worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I love these emjoi products! I bought this one and the smaller one. They work great and I use them often. This product shipped in a timely manner and arrived before it was scheduled to. I would recommend to anyone who hates shaving!</li>
            <li> Good product and thanks again.</li>
            <li> So glad we got the corded version.  very powerful, works great. Not too painful after you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have used my Emjoi 3 times this week. Worked great on the bikini region, but I could only take so much discomfort on my legs. I will continue to use my Emjoi, but with a 72 tweezer head I expected to not have any hair left behind, less stubble feel at the end of the treatment. My salon uses the same product, which is why I purchased this epilator. I understand that the more I use it the better the results. So, I will keep using it to hopfully get the results I want and will take an aspirin about an hour before I use it on my legs next time.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilator. Being sick of waiting forever for full hair growth to was, and not a big fan of shaving, I was considering laser hair removal and then a friend suggested I try epilators. I looked online for different ones, and the Emjoi had the best reviews so as always, I trusted the reviewers, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this is a corded epilator, but the cord is long (about 7-8 feet). Using a corded epilator is better because there is no question of the battery charge lasting, and it is faster (as I&#x27;ve heard from friends that use battery powered ones). I just wish it came with some kind of suction system that would suck up the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi has two speed settings, and even the speed level 1 is faster than the Braun. Speed level 2 almost makes hair removal a super fast and easy task. It does a good job with hands and legs, stomach, bikini line, underarms and even chin, leaving your body smooth and worry-free for at least a week or more, depending on your hair growth. And the best part is, you don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to get long. This epilator can pull out hair as small as 2mm in length without any trouble! And it almost takes the same time as waxing yourself, but with much lesser mess and clean-up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s included: The epilator, power cord, loofah, cleaning brush and a handy pouch that fits all of these.</li>
            <li> I really like this Epilator.  I had another one (same brand) but this one works so much better.  Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering why their video ad has the woman going through the same surface area over and over, its because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in one pass regardless of how you do it (lightly over the hair or pressing into the skin as they tell you not to).  Nor does it pull out most of the hair, the rest it cuts it like a razor would.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t get ingrown nowadays, but do not expect smooth skin when running your hands on it</li>
            <li> I previously had a battery operated one and I hated it.  I probably spent more money on the batteries on the long run.  Eventually it died.  I ordered this one because it covers a lot more area in a shorter amount of time.  I love it because my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for around a week and a half and when it does come back it grows a lot thinner.  Since it does start growing thinner sometimes I have to shave my under arms so the hair will grow thick and it can pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this for my under arms, toes, and bikini area.  It is too thick for the upper lip, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get used to the pain on that area.  I don&#x27;t use it on my legs because it is too time consuming.  I&#x27;d recommend waxing instead.  Other than that I love it.  I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I am a new epilator, but this is the best investment.  I have no experience with any other brand, but I would definitely recommend this!  It&#x27;s great not having to shave every day.  I did get little bumps at first, but I get minimal now.</li>
            <li> It hurts so bad lol not even fun no joke hahaha like its not worth it at all hahah i mean it works but ouchhhhh</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi epilator. The first was the small EpiSlim, I liked it so much i got the EMJOI AP-18 72 tweezer Epilator.  Works great for full legs, underarms and even arms, virtually painless. Other more sensitive areas will not be so pain free, But it&#x27;s the price of beauty.  This is corded - makes sense because it does have good power on both low and high settings.  Recommend you use it in the bathroom with good light and a hard floor for easy clean up, because there is no receptacle to catch the tweezed hair.   I like it a lot and will only buy Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun Silk Epil for years, but the one I had was getting worn out and needed to be replaced.  I saw this Emjoi Emagine with the 72 tweezer head and thought it would be a good replacement if it did the job as well and was faster.  From the reviews I read, it sounded pretty good.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work so well.  It sure isn&#x27;t very good at pulling all the hairs out.  It misses A LOT of them on my legs.  It can&#x27;t get close enough to do the fronts of my legs because there is a small bar that goes between the tweezers.  There is no way this would ever get all the hairs on my legs, no matter how many times I went over the same spot.  So I ended up returning it and getting another Silk Epil (which CAN pull the tiniest hairs off of me!)  There is no comparison for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time waxing myself, I decided to purchase a couple epilators: a small one for the bikini (great product:&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover) and a bigger one for the legs and underarms. Maybe it&#x27;s because it has too many tweezers and it goes too fast, but it breaks hairs more often than it pulls them.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my niece, who seems satisfied with it, but she is used to shaving, so for her this probably seems like an improvement. Anyway, not totally bad, but not the best. I got another one (Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator, White/Gray), it&#x27;s better as far as pulling but takes longer and is not comfortable to maneuver. So my quest isn&#x27;t over...</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this epilator. I finish doing my half legs within 5-10 minutes. So, handy and convenient. I am not afraid to wear skirts or capris anytime of the season now. Recommended to my friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> This works great on my mix of thin and thick hairs.  Great for legs and underarms.  Does not require a lot of repetitive motions.</li>
            <li> This epilator broke inside while I was using it and because it happen after a warranty I was not able to return it. I contacted the seller, manufacturer and Amazon, no one would help me get my money back or fix it. I have to say this was very disappointing for me considering I have purchased many things on Amazon and they were not willing to help. Be wary of this product, a small &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; to a gear broke off inside and it no longer works properly. Now I am stuck with an $80.00 epilator that I can&#x27;t use. I have a Satinelle that I have had for 13 years and it still works, I guess I will go back to them next time.</li>
            <li> Gross fact: I´m very hairy (thanks, dad). So I´ve tried everything out there, except laser because I don´t have the money for it. I do like epilators in general because I hate the results of shaving and the mess of waxing. I wish I could afford to try Silk&#x27;n or Tria laser systems, but for now, a epilator will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;After more than eight years, I had to toss my old Philips epilator because it finally stop working. I wasn&#x27;t super happy with it, so I decided to try another brand, especially after reading so many positive reviews. Since my old epilator was so, well, old, I expected technology would have improved this devices. I was expecting something more efficient in removing short hair and ergonomic, to reach even the more difficult areas. I have to say, this failed in both accounts. It got harder to remove my armpit hair and does not get short hairs. My old one did.&lt;br /&gt;When I was using my old epilator, it hurt much more than this one. That should be a great thing, right? Well, now I think it hurts less because it´s not getting all the hairs by the root. It does remove most of them as it was supposed to, but part of them brake. So now, I have to use it more often because parches of hair are growing at different times.&lt;br /&gt;Only positive thing about it is that it is faster than my old one. Nonetheless, I would&#x27;ve preferred it to be more efficient than fast.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a good buy, and I liked the positive reviews this epilator had. But I noticed it had a tendency to snap off the hair rather than pulling it, and the epilator never was very good at getting all the little tiny hairs on my legs, leaving them stubbly. Then, almost immediately after the one-year warranty expired, the plastic gears inside stripped and the thing broke. It&#x27;s completely unusable now. After the Emjoi broke, I purchased a slightly more expensive Philips Satin Perfect epilator, and I immediately noticed a marked difference in quality. It was able to keep my legs smooth in a way that the Emjoi had not, feels more solidly built, plus it has a two-year warranty. Stay away from the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife.It gives some pain and moreover she had to go at least 3-4 times to each place to completely get rid of the hairs. All in all just ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working ok but most definitely doesn&#x27;t clean up everything the first time.  You will have to run it over the same area multiple times to get most of the hair out, even then it doesn&#x27;t get everything like some ppl claims it does.  And if you have in-grown problem, like I do, this definitely doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a problem.  Bottom line, it works ok but it&#x27;s not magic like you want to believe it.</li>
            <li> This Emjoi Epiator seems to be alot faster than other Emjoi Epiators Ive used in the past. It seems a bit noisey but not any more than the others Ive used. It is corded which I dont mind but others may not like that. I think because there are so many tweezer heads it makes it quicker and I think it gets more hairs. You certainly do not have to keep going over the same spots over and over to get it smoothe. I like it alot :-)</li>
            <li> Emjoi AP-18 is a fine piece of equipment.  If used every five to six weeks there is little new hair to remove from body.  Also, some of hairs never regrow and some regrow very slowly.  It is a good hair removal maintenance product.  One can have almost a smooth body appearance during the summer tanning and swimming season.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. It gets the job done quick and it&#x27;s virtually painless. I use it only on my arms and it leaves them smooth even when the hair is growing back because it&#x27;s soft hair instead of prickly hair like when you save.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hairy legs and this product works well on them. I have found it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair but about 90% and takes about 0 mins a leg. I noticed I had a lot of ingrown hairs at first after using this product and I had to use every couple of days at first. Now it is about every two weeks. Normally, I would have to shave every other day so this has been a time saver for me.</li>
            <li> I love my Epilator. It works for what I wanted it to work for. I have a hard time with the hair underneath my arms. I&#x27;m really prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs having very curly hair. But this Epilator does the trick for me there. I literally online have to use it every three weeks under my arms! However, I tried using it on my legs and I don&#x27;t know if its because the hair on my legs is a little finer, but It never gets all the hairs off my leg. I end up shaving right after using it to get the rest of the hairs. I did hear that you might want to let your hair grow out a little longer for best results. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I had to send back the epilator as it did not perform any better than my 36 tweezer head. It is heavier and does not move smoothly on bony areas like the knees. The efficiency of the 72 tweezer head was no more than my 36 tweezer head. I had to still go over the area several times. It just wasnt worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This item is a sad excuse for an epilator made by Emjoi.....Their Optima is the best...hands down!!    Why they price this item at $100 is beyond me, it might be worth $45 at the most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many heads this thing has. It doesn&#x27;t pluck all of the hair no matter how many passes I make. And it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with location on the body because I tried them all nor does it have to do with coarse or fine hair, tried that too. This was such a waste of money I can&#x27;t believe after reading reviews for hours I got stuck with it because I threw away the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;So far the Braun Silk Epil, Xelle is the best one. I&#x27;ve used it every day for a few years now. I just wanted to buy a new one because I think the tweezer blades are dull and so, I thought I could find an even better one. Not! I was disappointed with the Braun until I removed the protective plastic for the tweezer head so just the tweezers are showing but that requires paying attention because, until I got the hand of it, I was creating raw places on my body. Once I got the hang of it, it was terrific. Much better than the piece of garbage I just bought.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this product and it takes a very short time for me to epilate my legs!</li>
            <li> Very inefficient in removing hair. I have used epilators for 4 years now so I don&#x27;t have issues with pain. This one is advertised as 72 tweezer epilator and therefore, should quickly remove hair from a large area. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all. I went over an area on my legs 10 times and I could still see a number of full hair strands and many smaller broken hair strands on my red, peeling skin (thanks to the repeated tweezers exposure). Much better to get the Philips satinelle, been using it for the last 2 years, half the price and very efficient.</li>
            <li> Awesome epilator. Quick and very effective.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is the best epilator I have ever used !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st great thing is that It takes half the time to do my legs with the 72 Tweezer Head, hence half the pain and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd awesome thing is that the Dual Opposed Head pick up the hairs from all directions of growth, instead of having to go over the same spot multiple times causing more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd fantastic thing is that this is not a cordless epilator, requiring it to be plugged in, using more power, for faster moving tweezers. once again, getting the job done faster while saving us some of the pain.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works like a top.....it is fast and I can remove hair in about half the time of my previous Epi-lady.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This works well but not outstanding</li>
            <li> Once a week 15-20 min of epilation with Emjoy is definitely better for me than every other day shaving. 4/5 because it is harder to do it in certain places and you have to go through the same spot over and over. In any case, Emjoy by far better than other epilators I had before and much better than shaving. I would recommend this epilator to a friend.</li>
            <li> The epilator does not perform as advertised/described on the website. It does not pick up hair on one pass, takes 5-7 passes and even then most of hair are broken off instead of pulled from the root. Having more tweezers does not seem to add to the performance of the product. I find Braun epilators much better quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I had an older Emjoi, so I have been used to the pain when using this.  This new one is so great and MUCH less painful.  For anyone just starting to use one of these, give it time for your skin to get used to it.  The pain gets very minimal.  The AP-18 is so fast and does a great job, even on the sensitive bikini line.  I haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Like the shape and it works just right. I miss having a bag or case to stow it and to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is 100% better then waxing. It takes 5 weeks to grow back the hair and it is so easy to use. After a while your hair on your legs gets thinner and not so much. Same effect as waxing.</li>
            <li> Removes unwanted hair from anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> love it. works great I think it&#x27;s actually less painful than waxing and a lot easier to use</li>
            <li> The wide head makes fast work  of what I find to be a chore. Cleans easily. Cord is long enough. I haven&#x27;t had it a  long time ( for me that means years)  but so far so good.</li>
            <li> found it to be very sturdy and does exactly as expected as advertised, a little pain but what did you expect :-)  I like it and use it...try it  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;D RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!  After years of research and hesitation I decided to purchase a replacement for my 14 yr old Braun silk epil. The Braun is still running but had lost the necessary speed to effectively pluck and do it&#x27;s job. My mom bought a Braun just a year ago to replace her old one and said she can&#x27;t tell much of a difference from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the emjoi for several reasons, mostly because the tweezers got the highest ratings on several reviews I read. I must say I&#x27;m very happy with the choice.  This thing kicks butt!  Fast and effective hair removal.  Does it have all the bells and whistles available - no, but I just want the job of hair removal done quickly and done well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife.  This is the second one, as the first one was bought a couple years ago.  It held up pretty well, and if you consider the cost of waxing, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I have had a Braun Silk-epil for a few years and recently decided to upgrade. The Emjoi is higher quality, as you would expect with a much higher priced epilator. The tweezers are metal on the Emjoi, I assume steel, but plastic on the Braun. I expected better performance but this is much better than I expected. The Silk-epil required multiple passes to removed all of the hair and you could feel it tugging and losing the hairs, particularly painful in more sensitive areas. The Emjoi pulled much better and did not tug on hairs but grabbed and pulled them out much more quickly, meaning a much less painful experience. I found this definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The rotators depend on two set of gears. One set is in the head piece and the other in the body of the epilator.  The gears are made of cheap plastic and one of the teeth on the gear in the head piece broke. So the thing stops rotating when it hits the broken tooth. I am sure they could cut down 10 cents on the profits and put in a more durable gear. I think they expect us to keep buying the head piece but to me that would be throwing good money after the bad. I am buying a Philips....</li>
            <li> It works good, but it does truly miss a lot of hairs, big hairs. I still love mine, but this is my first epilator, so there may be better on the market, this one does work though and for anybody who has never used one its well worth the money. I&#x27;ve been shaving, plucking and waxing for years and I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I had tried the tria hair remover at a much greater cost with no positive results.  The Emjoi works well with minimal discomfort.  I am very satisfied with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good for flat surface where skin is tight...Broke hair off in other spots.... Design isn&#x27;t great unless you are super model thin...</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and it is ok.  Not as painful as I thought it would be.  My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a close shave feel afterwards like a razor does.</li>
            <li> EDIT: After a few months of use.... this product has led to so many in-grown hairs that I almost considered going to the hospital. It&#x27;s foul and I hate it and I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, ignore anyone who says that using an epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt. What does it feel like? It feels like it&#x27;s using 72 tweezers to rip 72 hairs simultaneously from the root out of your God-Knows-What-Part. Of course it hurts. It does get much easier if you keep it up because then you&#x27;ll only be covering 1/3-1/2 of your hair. Still, though, ouch. However, I have gotten certain sensitive parts of skin &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the epilator, which sounds extremely painful but was actually not bad--their safety feature stopping the heads from spinning works great! (Thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, precede epilation with the consumption of half a bottle of wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it gets kind of hot? I&#x27;m worried about it burning me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the coverage isn&#x27;t excellent. It&#x27;s hard to get all of the hair in one area. I think I still have to train myself not to expect the perfectly smooth results of shaving, though. So that may be common among epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, in-grown hairs result from un-tweezed hairs snapping back into the folicles. Not all of the time, but it never happened to this extent with shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - It doesn&#x27;t result in razor burn at all, and it is nice (especially during the summer) not to worry about hair removal for a week at a time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many epilators and this one is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li> So, this is the second epilator I&#x27;ve tried. My first was the Braun 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil, a device so torturous that I didn&#x27;t try again for 4 years. Before the Braun, I&#x27;d occasionally waxed. Now, I only shave. So, I knew to expect a much higher sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I steeled myself for what I knew would be mind-blowing pain and proceeded to epilate, and it was... uncomfortable? Even the bikini area was pretty okay. The only problem was that it took soooo many passes to clear an area, but, even with the multiple passes, my skin didn&#x27;t really get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taken me 2 weeks, epilating for an hour every 2 days, to clear my legs, underarms, and bikini area. I&#x27;d stop after an hour, not because it hurt, but because my patience had run out. It really does take a LOT of passes to clear an area. Now, though, I&#x27;m just doing touch-up, which only takes several minutes.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that epilating is no joke, but this emjoi works so great. It pulls the hair so quickly and make this process go so much faster. At first it does hurt but after continuous use it get a lot better. I started out waxing but it was just time consuming so I decided to get this and was so excited that it only takes a few minutes. Thank goodness I have this little gadget!!</li>
            <li> I am not unfamiliar with this type of ladies \\&quot;razor\\&quot; .  I previously owned a Norelco of a similar product for the last 30 years.  The Emjoi does exactly what it claims to do, which is unusual in this day and age.  Removing hair from my legs is so much faster and even less painful.  Wonderful product and priced economically for what it does.  I go 2 months without having to shave. No need to spend money having your legs waxed.  The razor removes hair from the root.!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago. If you&#x27;re like me, CANT stand pain, it&#x27;s not for you.  On the other hand, I like stepping out of my comfort zone every once in a while, which is why I gave this a try and I love it...but don&#x27;t try it on sensitive areas without using numbing cream. (bikini line)</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review since I almost did not buy this product based on the negative reviews. I am so glad I bought it!     History: I have been a long time epilator and have a 2.5yr old Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle. I have no complaints nor does my old Braun owe me anything, it just wasn&#x27;t grabbing the hair and would take three passes to pluck a hair. So, I ordered the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine.     Design: Seems to be designed well based on the location of the gears versus the Braun. With the Braun, periodic cleaning of the gears was required since hair would fall down the gaps. The Emjoi has the gears located on the sides which makes more sense, but time will tell if this design is better.    Results: It took me 15 minutes to do my underarms, bikini area and legs; 5 minutes to read the manual + 10 minutes to do the work. It does work, and well at that, provided you follow the given instructions. I had no issues even in small spaces. It pulled out the hair in a single pass (I could see the root base so it was not breaking the hair), and it did a stellar job. Thank you Emjoi for a great product!    Amazon has always been great shipping things to me, so 5 stars to Amazon too!</li>
            <li> Yes, this removes more hair, but it lacks a light which is a necessary element.  It also takes more passes over the skin to remove the hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the Epilady, but it also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my other one.  This one also is stuck in the on position -- the only way I can turn it off is to unplug it.  All in all -- not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is replacing a single head model from the same manufacturer. The original words well...the new one is even better.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and used it after a hot shower, I got to say its the best epilader I have ever owned. I have been using epilators for 7 years now and this will be the third one I have purchased. This is by far the fastest one of the bunch, cutting the time in half. Its still painful but without taking painkillers or putting on a product that numbs the skin I&#x27;m not sure there is much you can do about that. One down side of this product is it is awkward to hold but otherwise I think I made a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have had great results in most areas of my body and only noticed major discomfort in the center of my chest and armpits. The pubic area was nowhere near what I anticipated it being due to some of the reviews I read. I am still in the trial and error stage of what works best for me (ie. once or twice a week, after a shower VS after a bath, pre or post loufah use, etc...). There were suggestions given in the instruction manual and in the reviews of other users, I will eventually try most  to find out what works best for me. I prefer using the slower speed as it seems to pull the hair from the root where the faster speed seems to break a lot of the hairs off at the surface, meaning a faster regrowth and more frequent usage. My regrowth has been reduced, a lot of the hairs don&#x27;t come back, and the ones that do seem thinner and softer, also, the weekly use in the beginning is now around every two weeks, however, there are the one or two hairs that are fast growers and the ones missed because I can&#x27;t see some areas. One improvement I would make is the addition of a light since most room lighting is eye to ceiling level, not in the shadow areas of the body or below the shoulder level. All in all I give the item a very high rating, but not at the very top, maybe a 9 out of a possible 10.</li>
            <li> Love it,not painful at all,and it is very fast.only prob is that the package says it has a shaving attachment but i did not find it.first time epilating :-) piece of cake</li>
            <li> I bought this item a long couple of years now and it still works great. Except that I don&#x27;t have so much hair to remove from my legs and under arms. My first time using this, I must admit, it was tickling painful, but I got used to it. From there, I use it less and less now because I don&#x27;t have so much hair any more. I use it after a shower because the water and scrubbing opens the hair pores which makes it much easier to tweeze. Another note, tie up long head hair and clothing when tweezing your under arms because you can pull your long hair into this tweezer and... I seriously dont know how you would get it out, but to turn off the device and pull out the hair/ thread itself.     I like the fact that I dont need to continuously buy batteries for it because it comes with a cord. It&#x27;s not like I will be tweezing my legs in public. The item also came with a carry bag and a little brush to clean the tweezer head, the cord, and the cover for the tweezer area. Also, this is a some what loud device.    I first saw this product review on You Tube and I thought I should try it. I did and I&#x27;m glad that I did because with a couple of minutes use and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast. Or if it does, there isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi was destroyed and I found myself searching for a new epilator. I love my old Emjoi.  It was much less painful that other epilators I had used in the past.  When searching for it&#x27;s replacement I was happy to find this newer model but wondered if it was worth the higher price.  It was.    This model has plenty of power and the dual heads do make a difference.  More hairs are picked up faster.  Now, I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t always get every hair, but that may be more my fault.  I have neither the time nor inclination to ensure every single hair has been plucked.  One of the beauties of epilating (and why I switched all those years ago) is that, over time, the hairs grow back much thinner and weaker. Besides, I have never had an epilator that gets every single hair.    Back when I shaved my legs, I would have to shave them every, single day (twice a day if I had a date that night).  If I missed a day or two the stubble was thick and dark, and noticeable rough to touch.  I tried epilating once in a while but found it too painful.  Only with the Emjoi was I able to stand it long enough to really get the long term effects.  Dont&#x27; get me wrong, even with the Emjoi, the first few days were like torture, but tolerable      After several years of epilating, I could miss even a whole week (camping) and the stubble was sparse and thin and softer to the touch.  I have been using an epilator without switching back for almost 10 years now so it isn&#x27;t really a big deal if it misses a hair or two here or there. Besides, anyone noticing that one missed hair has bigger issues to deal with :-).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Emjoi epilators.  I just dropped and broke my first one, so I needed this one to replace it.  I hope to never have to use any other hair removal again. It&#x27;s as close to being painless as can be. I love that, and that it only needs done every several weeks!  I saw on some other reviews there were remarks on pain at first...my recommendation, as I had done myself, is to &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; one time, and then begin with the epilator.  Any hair that returns after a wax is slower, and there aren&#x27;t so many hairs to pull at the same time. I also use it under arms, and all around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> We bought the smaller version of this brand of epilator. It worked pertty good, but took way too long to use. I showed my husband this one and we ordered it. We love it! It works so good, and is way faster! I always get in grown hairs bad every time I wax, or shave. With this I don&#x27;t get them nearly as bad. With our old epilator my husband would always complain about hairs growing back right under the skin. You could see them but he would have to remove that thin skin covering it to get it out. With this new epilator he hasn&#x27;t had that problem. I love this so much I told my mom and sister about it.</li>
            <li> Does not do as good of a job removing the hair as other models I have purchased</li>
            <li> I owned a previous generation of the Emjoi epilator and used it until it wore out.  I had to get another as I love the way it works.  This later generation works even better than my old one.  There is some minor discomfort on the most sensitive areas but you get used to the sensation with continued use.</li>
            <li> I bought this last December. And I like it. For 2 months I used it, now it&#x27;s broke I don&#x27;t what happen.</li>
            <li> The speed and performance is worth the price,  however you will need another one that gets the tiny hairs. In my expericence, this one won&#x27;t completely do that.</li>
            <li> This works so much faster than my old one. The one I ordered was on back order so they upgraded me for free to the cordless one. This version doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and I am really excited to have it.</li>
            <li> The Epilator works perfectly, but not as effectively as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Awesome for all &#x27;trunk&#x27; areas.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over upper and middle body as far down as the top of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is a little intense to start with but if you follow the MANY internet instructions on how and how often to use this, you&#x27;ll be just fine after the first week or so.</li>
            <li> Great service and product. Highly recommend seller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had the much older version, and Emjoi Gold. This one doesn&#x27;t get to the hairs as easily, has chafed my skin, and sometimes caused ingrown hairs and blocked follicles (very nasty). Compared to shaving, though, this is much better for me. I use on my underarms and bikini line, as I have very little hair on my legs. Probably better on legs than contoured areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using the Braun Silk-Epil5 for about a year. The Braun epilator was my very first experience with epilation and it definitely took some getting used to dealing with the pain. But once I saw the hairless results, I was hooked on epilation! Being of Indian decent, I&#x27;m a female who unfortunately has battled with every form of hair removal with little success - until I found epilation. After about a year of using the Braun with little decrease or resistance build up to the pain I started searching for another alternative and found the Emoji Ap-18. After reading such positive reviews I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase and haven&#x27;t looked back since! The Emoji is so much less painful that the Braun! I guess the 72 heads help minimize the pain, although on the flip side, I find that the Emoji doesn&#x27;t get as many as the finer, smaller hairs that the Braun used to. Although I have to make a few more passes with the Emoji than I had to with the Braun, it&#x27;s totally worth it due to the minimized pain levels! I definitely recommend the Emoji AP-18 to anyone looking for an efficient, low pain (no epilator will be pain free) Epilator.</li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap, broke after about 3 months (gears dont turn right). Had a braun for over 3 years (which I feel is a reasonable life for an epilator), so I bought this one to replace it. When I first got it it worked as good, maybe slightly better than the bruan, but even after only a few uses I could tell the piece of crap was breaking down. Really cheaply made, get a braun instead.</li>
            <li> I bought the gen 1 version over a decade ago and it was still working but wanted this one as it seemed better with the two rotating heads.  It works so much faster than the previous model.  And I can also say it is a million times better than the &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34; which does nothing.  Keeps my legs smooth for over a month and when the hair does grow back it is baby fine and sparse.  Very loyal to this brand as it really does work.</li>
            <li> Good bye shaving. Emjoi  works great on legs and arms. Underarms takes several times before it&#x27;s comfortable.... the first few times...ouch! It&#x27;s well worth it though. Careful on the face, use the slower speed and angled but upper lip area definitely ouchie. Overall, I am very pleased with this product because of the longer intervals between hair removal..</li>
            <li> An excellent choice for unwanted facial hair.The product works and I was given an upgrade to rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;My Emjoi  rocks!</li>
            <li> First one lasted 18 months but I prefer it to shaving.  No scratchy stubble.  About twice a week works for me.</li>
            <li> Not as painful as I expected it to be, considering my pain tolerance isn&#x27;t very high. Works great! Great substitute to waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for two years now. Originally I used it as a backup for when I couldn&#x27;t get in to get my legs waxed and it worked well enough. But over the past year it was my main go to for leg hair removal. (I won&#x27;t talk about whether it&#x27;s painful or not because that&#x27;s subjective.) My leg hair varies between fine and medium coarse. I would always exfoliate before epilating and in between but not that often. I found that no matter how much time I spent on each leg there were always patches of hair left over. I would spend an average of 30 minutes for both legs combined! I also have been having major ingrown hairs that were never a problem for me in the past. And I&#x27;ve been removing my hair with various methods for over 30 years! I decided to make the purchase because of a friend and all the positive reviews. But I have to say that it didn&#x27;t work for me and was a waste of money. I can only conclude that it doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> A Mans perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cutting myself shaving my chest and back too many times I researched and found this product to have very high ratings and so purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for pain in the first use if you have a lot of hair. The hair that is removed will be about 3X longer than what you see on the surface because this device is pulling the hair out from the root. You will be amazed at the quantity of hair that is being removed.  As mentioned before the first use is the most painful. I did the process the next day then every day for the next week. Each day that goes by the amount of hair will be reduced and the pain will decrease. Don&#x27;t worry, my nipples are still intact. Use with confidence :) I&#x27;m now using every 3 days or so and have been using this product for about 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not prepared to use this device in the intimate areas of my body as the rotation of these hair pullers remind me too much of a mining device used to cut through rock walls. No thanks around my privates. I&#x27;m not that brave yet :) Women probably will have no problem using there.</li>
            <li> The best I didn&#x27;t go by everyone&#x27;s opinion I bought it and I love it</li>
            <li> BIGGGGG waste of money.  It does not hurt like other epilators, but it barely removes any hair.  I DEFINITELY WANT A REFUND.  I don&#x27;t even use this.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than any you will find in a drugstore. That&#x27;s how I originally started epilating. This works really quickly, so it&#x27;s not nearly as painful as the cheaper models. I find I only really have to pass over an area twice to pull almost all of the hair. My legs stay smooth for weeks. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this epilator... Pulls out the hair fast, I use the highest speed and because it pulls so many hairs out at once, so quickly, it seems less painful.. I used it on my legs and arms and it took less then ten minutes, and I&#x27;m very thorough.&lt;br /&gt;  I like using epilators because they are cheaper than waxing in the long run, and you get to the point, after consistently using it on an area, that you only have to do a touch up here or there, the hair just doesn&#x27;t grow back as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To people who have never used one - it hurts. It hurts a lot at first..your ripping hair out of your body.  But you get used to it, and it&#x27;s not so bad. And the first few times you use, you might get the little red bumps/pimples/irritation. Your traumatizing your skin by ripping hair out. So you apply some triple antibiotic cream on the area after you use the epilator and that really heals things up quicker..</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT.  Anywhere you want to use it.. it works! Even the whole bikini area! Yes it is painful, but lets be honest here.. beauty ALWAYS hurts. Armpits to chin to your back, it works great.  I highly recommend it if you have a decent pain tolerance.  NO PAIN NO GAIN ;)</li>
            <li> I bought the Emoji 18 72 tweezers because my old 48 tweezer just wasn&#x27;t doing the job. I had to go over places several times. This tweezer cuts time in half. It&#x27;s like using an electric razor. Gets all the hair &amp; leaves area so smooth. I truly love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I expected a little more from emjoi. Maybe it hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I expected because I expected much considering it has 72 tweezers. I think the Braun Silk-Epil 7 removed hair a lot faster, however the emagine doesn&#x27;t snag against your skin the way Braun does. So...not really sure.</li>
            <li> best epilator thus far!!!! love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Was Really hesitant about buying but love it. So glad I did. First time I used it I felt some sting but not now. Just read instructions and be sure to keep skin taught.  After one or two times you want even need to do this. Hair doesn&#x27;t come back as quickly.  Will always use.</li>
            <li> Works Great...I Love it!!  This is my third Emjoi and the best one so far.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I didn&#x27;t even take mine out of the box as it was obviously already used.  Hairs were stuck on inside and outside of box.  Unhygienic.  Returning.</li>
            <li> Love this machine!!! Cant say more.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old epilator and thought the dual head was a smart choice, but for me it is too bulky to really be effective on  my bikini line.  it does a great job on my legs, but I did go by a Braun today as a replacement for my underarms and bikini line.  I just got tired of having to work so hard to reach  an those areas.  Plus, I missed having a light like my previous one had.  With the dual head system I don&#x27;t think they could put a light on this model though.</li>
            <li> I thought long and hard before tossing my old Epilady -- which, while a little slow, was still working after a decade! -- and buying this model. I&#x27;m really glad I did. The Emjoi AP-18 tweezers move fast, making the epilation process a lot less uncomfortable, and it grabs the tiniest hairs, so you get a nice smooth finish. It has a good ergonomic design, too, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this gadget! I never want to shave again.  I got used to the pain quickly and am so glad I took a chance and tried it!</li>
            <li> I have owned several epilators before and i was hoping that this would be a SUPER DUPER epilator. the reviews said so many good things, but to be honest i was not impressed. it misses so many hairs on my legs and does not remove hair from my bikini line at all. it yanks but then releases the hair. after 40 minutes of torture and still no progress, i bit down hard on a towel and used the old one. i would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> What a time saver this item is.  I can use it and be finished in a matter of minutes and am good to go for at least 6 weeks after.  I would highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this thing works great. It preformed way beyond what I was expecting. I am a male, So if it removed my hair as well as it did it should work wonders on women. I really don&#x27;t understand how folks have given it bad reviews. I followed the instructions and had amazing results. Now for the cons, Because everything has it&#x27;s drawbacks. It hurts a lot! Well at first anyways, I think my body turned off pain signals to prevent me from going into shock... Well it is not that bad but here is a brief run down of my experience. From the neckline to the bottom of my pecs was painful, But very tolerable (I&#x27;d give it a 1-2 from 1-10, 10 being very painful). Bottoms of my pecs to my bellybutton gradually got more and more painful the farther south I went (I&#x27;d give it a 3 from 1-10). Belly button down hurt a lot so prepare yourself(An easy 7 on the pain scale... mind you my tattoos were all 3-4s to include to one on my rib cage which is a very tender area). It was not painful at all around nipples (I was very worried that area would hurt a lot! It was maybe a 1 from 1-10) Arms are not that bad to do either (maybe a 1-2 from 1-10) Tops of my feet (yeah, stop laughing) was about a 2 on the pain scale. I don&#x27;t shave my armpits or legs, So I do not know how that feels.. I do not have back hair so don&#x27;t know how that feels either.     I used it on the same areas for about 5 days in a row, the last time I used it was 7 days ago and have not noticed ANY new hair growth after the last session (remember your hair grows in cycles, so it takes about a week to get all of it, then you should not have to do it again for about 3 weeks) I found that a glass of wine before, then enjoy one during helps a ton with the pain. Also in my experience, the first session was the most painful, the ones that followed were not as bad at all. also make sure of you plan on using this in a area that has not been groomed in awhile, TRIM the hair first! I learned the hard way.    Well that&#x27;s all I got, I hope this helps someone. I gave it 5 stars, Because it works great! I have not had to do grooming of any kind in a week, so it is well worth the little bit of pain.</li>
            <li> I use this epilator only on my underarms and bikini line. It does a pretty good job on my underarms but can also take some skin with it, and I end up with a brush burn. But I do get a much closer shave than with a manual razor. It works fine on my darker bikini line. It is useless on my blond leg hair which is much finer. I don&#x27;t see this epilator getting the root out like I do see sometimes with waxing. But it is much less painful and messy than waxing. It&#x27;s just another tool in my arsenal in my war against my own body hair.</li>
            <li> I love the twin heads making it quicker to do my legs.  But more importantly for me is that other epilators have caused small cuts on the sensitive skin of my inner thighs.  With this epilator I have no problems at all. I can take it over sensitive or normal skin with no worries that it&#x27;s going to mistake my skin for small hairs.  However I would not recommend this one to a newbie, the first time is torture enough without 72 tweezers pulling at the same time.    I started epilating because shaving was a dangerous act for me since I couldn&#x27;t wear my glasses in the shower.  And if I didn&#x27;t shave every day I had stubble, it was that bad.  But I&#x27;m really glad I stared epilating and continue to do it even though I got lasik.  The hair on my legs and under my arms is so thin now I can comfortably not epilate for weeks without worrying about the hair.  It has really made a difference in my life and managing my leg hair is soooo much easier now. This epilator is great because it has so much power and can get the job done quickly, efficiently, and with little to no pain.  I&#x27;d recommended it to anyone (who is already epilating or waxing).</li>
            <li> This is actually a very effective efficient epilator however it breaks consistently after about a year of regular use.  The plastic gearing strips and the heads stop grabbing hair.  I have had three of these over the last three years and my current one, about 8 months old, is starting to fail - gears stripped again.</li>
            <li> The emjoi imagine 72 tweezers epilator works fast and efficiently. I know it can be a tough time around at first. But as your hair grows back thinner this device becomes your best friend. Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I works perfectly fine and it is really fast. I feel a litle pain but I had it worst with other brands so I am really happy with Emjoi. I suppose it depends on the person&#x27;s hair and skin, but in my case it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, the only bad thing about it, is that is kind of too noisy. Otherwise is nice product!</li>
            <li> I have owned most every generation of epilator that has hit the market in the past 25 - 30 years, and this is by far the best one, so far. It is quick, and does a good job with minimal number of passes. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This model works well for dudes, too.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I don&#x27;t write reviews. I was initially going to complain about how long it took to get my emagine, but it was well worth the wait. I normally pay to get waxed or use a hair removal lotion. I haven&#x27;t done either in a while. I took a warm shower before I used my epilator. I started with my under arms. The last time I had them waxed I wanted to slap the lady when she ripped up the strip. It was so painful. I felt almost nothing using this. There was no irritation at all. I didn&#x27;t use deodorant directly after using this but I feel like I could without it burning (after waxing or using the removal creams such as nair or veet I can&#x27;t say the same). Next, I used it on my legs.  It did sting, but again waxing is more painful and the creams are more irritating. I even used this on very tender areas. I have gotten brazillian waxes before, but I only planed on \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; around the edges of the bikini area. It was such an improvement to waxing I ended up taking more than I started out to and taking it all off.     As far as breaking hairs... there were a few pieces of stubble left. Not much at all and definatly not enough to complain about. I will epilate again in a week to get those. I figure some hairs are weaker than others, finer than others, and different lengths (plus I am new to this and was practicing how to hold it and how much pressure to use). I have very sensitive skin and I usually feel horrible after waxing and even after using creams. My skin feels warm and a little like I just had a massage vs removing hair.     Advice- do not apply any pressure. Just glide it softly over the skin. Lie down and relax your arm while doing underarms or it can prove to be very difficult. Hold skin taut everywhere. Start at the edge of an area and work your way into the hair little by little by using small back and forth strokes until you have cleaned the area. Last of all go back over clean areas in the perpendicular direction of what you first used to make sure you get any wild hairs growing in a different direction.    Enjoy your Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Amazing what 72 opposing rotating tweasers can do. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I already have been using a Braun cordless epilator on my legs and underarm for about 2 years. It was not holding a charge, so I decided to buy a corded model. I&#x27;ve heard of Emjoi and found this one in a google search...    I could not wait to try it. It works so much better than any epilator that I&#x27;ve used (my first one I bought was in the 90s...ouch!).    I don&#x27;t think you can go by my experience as far as pain level since I&#x27;m not a first time epilator, but I felt no plnching at all. My legs were much smoother with this one over my old one.    I would definately recommend this epilator!  ~Cathy</li>
            <li> In our household we have 3 Emjoi epilators (all from Amazon) and we like them all for different things.  So I will post this same review for all three.  We started with the AP-9T Tweezers - about $13.95. It is a small battery-operated unit.  At first we had to learn how to use an epilator - how to hold it, etc., but once we got all that down, we found it worked really well for the small areas like upper and lower lip. Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  It is not particularly useful for underarms and it would take too long to do the legs.  But since we had got quite addicted to being hairless (and didn&#x27;t have to run out to be threaded every 3 weeks), we decided to buy another so that my daughter and I would each have one.  This time we went up a notch to the Emjoi AP-9L Epi-Slim.  It is about $14.77 at Amazon and also battery operated.  We like it much better.  It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and chin.      But we decided to also try a more expensive one.  This time we bought the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Tweezer set.  It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  It is corded and more powerful.  This one does great under the arms and on the legs and even in the bikini area.  It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  It makes your face so smooth.  But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.      Ladies, there is no reason to be hairy!  These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li> Always a great product. You would be crazy not to use these. I know In america they are not as popular, but the rest of the world uses these all the time, its unique and does what it needs to over any other product. I never have a time when I don&#x27;t have this in my house!</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed product, but considering the amount of pain involved, this is just not for me. Prepping my skin takes far too long (exfoliating etc) and this epilator seems to miss quite a bit even on spots where there are hairs long enough to grab with my fingers. I would like to try the optional shaving head (which was not included!) but it doesn&#x27;t seem as if Amazon carries it. This was a wasted $80 in my case. The epilator itself is very sturdy, and although it did hurt, it didn&#x27;t once pinch my skin (a worry when doing my underarms).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and that&#x27;s my first epilator.  I was afraid to be in pain.  I wanted to buy this one because the head is larger, so I thought that will be stronger and faster.  And I was right: of course that hurts, but because the head is strong, you do little rounds and you know the hairs are leaving. You don&#x27;t need to pass over and over at a spot to remove all the hairs, and that&#x27;s awesome.  So I did my 2 legs and thighs, and then I even did my \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; zone ( even if that was my first time with an epilator :)! ).  I did that 6 hours ago, and I still have little red dots, I&#x27;ll see if there is a cream or something, but.. really great product!  ( And I like the red color. )</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on waxing, this has paid for inself in 1 use, it is painful when you use it at first but so is waxing and I feel I&#x27;m saving so much money, it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s not really great for places like the knees but a couple of wax strips and it&#x27;s fine.  Skin feels smooth after use and the hair takes a few weeks to grow back. Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this yrs ago !!  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because for the price, I feel they could have included a smaller head for the bikini area as this is too big to use on that area. All said though I love it !!</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this gadget years ago.  I am very pleased with the end result. I&#x27;ve struggled with excess hair on my chin for years. I watched a video on you tube advertising this product and was also warned that it might be uncomfortable after the first several uses.  They were correct, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is the best epilator.  I read all the reviews before buying and was concerned about the negative ones.  I have use a Braun epilator for many years and decided to try a newer one.  This Emjoi epilator is fabulous!!  Forget the negative reviews; those people do not know what they are talking about!   It is now a pleasure to remove the hair from my legs!  This one is so fast and does not miss a hair.  As a long time user, I did not know it could be so good.  Now in comparison to the old one, this new one saves me time and I now have ALL the hairs gone.  I have smooth legs!  I highly recommend this product![[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]</li>
            <li> Outstanding product! I had an Epilady for about 15 years and it finally gave out. This is a better product with a wider surface area that really grips the hair. Didn&#x27;t have to make several passes over the same area. Used this on legs that had very thick unshaved 2 month old hair and was done in no time at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Emagine Epilator is a good device for removing unwanted hair. It does hurt at first, in some areas more then others but after the second or third use the pain decreases. After using this epilator my skin was smooth and most of the hair was removed. I found that if you take your time and go over each area twice the epilator will remove 90-95% of the hair. This product works good for your legs, underarms, bikini line and where ever you have unwanted hair. I would recomend this product to any women who are sick of shaving all the time and hate the rough stubble feeling when hair starts to grow back after shaving. After using the epilator hair grows back much slower then with saving and also much finer. The hair that does grow back seems to be soft baby hairs that are easily removied by the emjoi emagine. Over all i think this is a very good product. It works like its suposed to and is worth the price. This is my first epilator so i cant compare it to others but from what i researched this is one of the best on the market with the most tweezer heads. I could not emagine another epilator being any better! ;)</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have been using it for a year. But they did not like it  takes many passes in the same area to get all the hairs and after a year it became so weak that it stops working when you push it against the skin.</li>
            <li> Good so far I only have&#x27;t for couple weeks</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after much nagging. She likes it and so do I at this point. It cuts close enough to get rid of her stubbles, making her legs nice and feminine, like woman&#x27;s leg is suppose to be. Thought about using it on my leg next.</li>
            <li> My life has forever changed. I&#x27;m going to be saving a lot on razors now.</li>
            <li> Should have invested more money.</li>
            <li> Love this model. Have had several over the years</li>
            <li> Compared to other epilators used in the past - this was a very big disappointment !!!  It lasted about 7 months before the gears started skipping and chirping, the unit never removed hair as well as other epilators - much slower and less efficient.  I am very sorry that we purchased this unit - it was a 90% waste of money (to be fair) - - -</li>
            <li> I have tried several different epilators and this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have two other corded Emjoi epilators, both of which I am happy with, and particularly satisfied with the Emjoi Divine.  But, I thought that I could upgrade and order an item that would do the work in half the time.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with pulling out hairs with this item--in that manner, it did do it&#x27;s job.  However, for some reason, the surface of the machine is very abrasive where it feels like it&#x27;s cutting into your skin.  My only guess for the difference is that this machine has no buffering on the sides where the other Emjoi Divine is curved and provides buffers for pain release (meanwhile still satisfactorily pulling out the hair).  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, like I do, you may not have any issues with the machine.  But for myself, I&#x27;d rather use something that doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s tearing my skin apart.  Needless to say, I returned the item.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this.  It&#x27;s not painless, but not horrible either.... the first time is the worst... then it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> works fast and it&#x27;s very effective but I have to bite my lips every time I use it</li>
            <li> It works a lot better/faster than my old Braun, but I wish it had a light. The cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> It works great as far as removing all hair but the case on top scratches and leaves a mark</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one (I burned my last one up while in England) I love it - it does the job.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that claim this product is quicker because of the two head action; this is the main reason I bought this item. I am sad to say this claim is a blaitent lie. I used it for an hour and resorted back to my single head. I am an extremely hairy man who uses this item over every part of my body excluding my head and face. A pair of tweezers would be quicker then this emjoi. Do yourself a favor and destroy any thought of trying this emjoi unless your goal is to remain hairy.</li>
            <li> This epilator works well. It doesn&#x27;t require your stubble to be long. My legs stay stubble free all week.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work so much better than the one I was previously using that only had one head.  I thought the  dual heads of this product would work better.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement, as a matter of fact, it removes even less hair than my old standby.  It is also very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  It is so loud and clunky.  It sounds and feels like it will fall apart.  I would put up with that if it worked well.  It doesn&#x27;t even get all the hair.  I finally went back over the area with my inexpensive old Braun silk epi 3 which is on its last legs after years of use, and it still got the hairs this new one missed repeatedly.  I don&#x27;t understand how it can be so expensive.  I ordered another Braun today.  I wish I&#x27;d kept the box so I could send this one back, but my hubby threw it away as soon as I opened it.  (We have a small place.)</li>
            <li> This is also a great product comes in handy very much</li>
            <li> This is truly the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever used....and there have a few previous ones.  This is quite powerful, most likely because it&#x27;s using a cord not batteries.  Fortunately the cord is quite long so you have a good amount of maneuverability without the cord being a hassle (something I was concerned about.)  Two speeds, although they seem to be almost the same and the lower speed works for me on all areas.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet; not too heavy and easy to clean.  Be aware as of this date (12/31/14) there is a discrepancy in Amazon description - between violet and red.  I thought I ordered the violet, but red was delivered.  It&#x27;s ok; not a problem for me, but I saw similar comment on prior review, so be aware.  (Amazon&#x27;s been notified of this.)</li>
            <li> I have used many Emjoi products for a long time. This epilator stopped working after almost a year from date of purchase. I returned it to Emjoi within 2 days they replaced it with a new epilator. Great epilator, great customer service and Amazon is #1!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Whoa.  This is great!  I&#x27;ve had a couple of the smaller epilators which were really noisy and flimsy.  It would take an hour to do my legs with those, let alone arms.  I can do my arms and legs in about 15 minutes with this larger model.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as noisy as my smaller ones.  I prefer the corded models because (a) batteries create waste and (b) batteries lose charge quickly in a device like this.  If you&#x27;re new to epilators, realize that you get what you pay for and don&#x27;t go cheap and then complain.  Also realize that the first time you use it, it will be torture (unless you&#x27;re used to waxing); but before too long it&#x27;ll be just a minor discomfort.  Keep some solarcaine handy for afterwards if you think you&#x27;ll need it.  Also, it only works if you hold it absolutely perpendicular to your skin, unlike an electric razor which can go off the 90-degree angle and still work (I think this may be the source of some people&#x27;s complaints that epilators don&#x27;t work for them).  Best thing:  I don&#x27;t have to shave again in 2 days.  What a savings over constantly buying razors!</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost a year consistently, and am overall pleased with it..It is my first epilator to use and do not regret it. At first, I would get little bumps on certain follicles and I almost gave up on it but after doing research online, I found that is common especially on people with thick hair, which I definitely had (I use it on my legs and underarms), one solution I found was using this product right out of the shower so pores are open, and cleaning the areas with witch hazel afterwards and using non-comodogenic lotions after that..I am glad I kept using bc now I notice not only less hair growth, but it is much thinner..I hope that in due time, I have to use it less and less. My mom told me to try this years ago, oh how I should have listened then lol..I recommend :D</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I don&#x27;t have much to compare too. It does require many passes to get a area smooth. It doesn&#x27;t hurt on my legs, but more sensitive parts like arms/under arms are too painful for me. But Im a wuss. Easy to clean, easy to use and seems fairly powerful. Its a lot less work then shaving that is for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who needs to shave large areas of your body. While it takes longer to clear a area then shaving, the area stays clear for 1-2 weeks. Compared to the number of times you would shave over that period, you save a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife. She likes the color and it works good, but she wishes it was a little wider.</li>
            <li> It works great, I use it once a week and it goes much easier after the first 3-4 weeks. The first 3-4 weeks I was beginning to question my decision to not shave cause of the stinging pain and the time epilating took, But then after about the 4th. week it all got much better, quicker &amp; easier.</li>
            <li> As a person with terrible eczema on my legs, I have struggled for YEARS to find a solution to my leg hair removal problem.  Everything I had tried irritated my eczema further and caused flair-ups - shaving with a razor, shaving with an electric shaver, neet, the sandpaper type leg-hair remover, home waxing...until I began getting professional leg-waxing.  That seemed to be the only thing that my legs could tolerate and didn&#x27;t cause my eczema to get out of control.  I even tried at-home Brazilian waxing to try to get a cleaner hair removal at home without the expense of the professional services every month, all to no avail.  When I was a teenager, I had owned an Epilady and couldn&#x27;t stand the pain of it so I only used it once, but I knew that with the pain of childbirth behind me and being used to leg waxing, I should now be able to handle epilation without a problem.  I don&#x27;t know what made me think of ordering an epilator at this time.  I have let my hair go for quite some time.  Not having the finances or local resources (only one place near me does it and they did a HORRIBLE job the one time I went there) to get professional leg waxing done, I really had no choice.  I was getting desperate and broke down to purchase the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator after reading the reviews.  I rationalized the expense with the fact that professional leg waxing costs anywhere from $65 to $90 a visit depending on location and full/half leg services.  This thing would pay for itself in two uses if it worked...and work it did.  I just used it for the first time.  Not only did it take half the time of a professional leg waxing, but the discomfort was SO MUCH LESS AND the hair removal was even better! I am thrilled to have found a leg hair removal system that works for me.  My legs responded the same way that they do to a professional leg waxing as far as my skin is concerned and my eczema seems to be remaining unaffected!  I am ECSTATIC and, I should also mention, so is my husband!  :)  I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!o mention, so is my husband!  :)  I am so GLAD that I broke down and made this purchase and I will be HIGHLY recommending it to anyone and EVERYONE that I can!</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more hair I have and the darker and coarser it gets.  I had to do something, and I deliberated quite a while.  I read every review about several epilators, but finally settled on this one.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It took a little while to get it all done, but my skin is so much smoother.  Yes, the first hair ripping was a bit of a challenge, but I&#x27;d just do as much as I could stand and do more the next day.  I&#x27;ve done my mustache and beard, my armpits, my forearms, my hobbit feet, my legs and my bikini line.  Under my nose was the most difficult but once it was done, the results were worth it.  Surprisingly, the bikini line was not bad at all.  Now I&#x27;m just doing maintenance and I&#x27;m real happy with this little gizmo.  (under the nose still takes my breath away)  :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s so much better than the Remmington model I started with.  Note for those who haven&#x27;t used an epilator before - it hurts!  The cheaper models that take longer because they don&#x27;t have as many tweezers might actually be a good way to start.  They won&#x27;t pull out so many hairs at once, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.  After a few months it stops hurting at all and you can upgrade to the Emjoi and be done much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A year later - I still love this.  It&#x27;s so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I used an epilator before... the noise always sounds a little scary and intimidating, but it got the job done fairly quick and fast. A recommendation though, try your best to scrub your legs well before use.. and watch for new hairs growing shortly after use.. because its expected you may get a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is only good physically but durability is a different matter.  It only lasted not even six months.  I would like to know how can return or replace it to get my money&#x27;s worth.  Hello manufacturer hope your reading this.  Redesign this product,  the appearance &amp; color is the only positive thing I can tell about this because this is the reason I got it.  Consumer I advice you NOT TO BUY this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She uses it on her legs all the time and constantly says how much better using an epilator is than shaving.  I tried the thing on my hairy legs and a literally cried from pain.  I don&#x27;t know how women can stand it...</li>
            <li> After watching several videos on Youtube decided to give it a try. After the first few months my hair is growing back finer. The first 5 times were painful, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  My first still works after over 20 years. Just sticks a little.  This one has more  tweezers but it doesn.t work that much faster.  I would never go back to shaving. If you can stand a little pain, this is the way to go. I&#x27;m fairly hairy but I  only do my legs every other week, if that.</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations at all - Optomini is much better.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it...leaves your skin smooth and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other one i had</li>
            <li> It has been 6 plus months since I started using this product. I thought I should update my review. I am going to try a different product, as this one does not do legs well. I am only doing my underarms well. Legs are pretty bad. I like the concept, I will try a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at getting those little hairs.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this epilator as a gift about 18 months ago. It would take me a very long time to epilate my legs and they never felt smooth. A lot of the hair grew back after a couple days which leads me to believe it was just breaking off the hair rather than pulling it at the root. Also caused a lot of ingrown hairs and dry skin, though I&#x27;m sure I needed to exfoliate and moisturize more regularly. Recently, one of the plastic gears broke so it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. So overall I was disappointed with this product, especially considering how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my Braun Silk-Epil was dying after many years of great service. In comparison with my old Braun, the new epilator is pretty slow and doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair very well. Will get another Braun next time!</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Best find of this summer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it has been working out so far.  Obviously, a machine that rips your hair out of the follicle is going to hurt, but you get used to it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> We all know that, for the most part, epilating isn&#x27;t a pleasurable experience, but it works wonders vs. shaving. So when I reference pain in this review, it&#x27;s not unbearable, but in all honesty, it hurts. I really love this Emjoi compared to the other one I had. My old Emjoi had only 21 tweezers, making it a little bit more of a painful experience every time. With this one, it&#x27;s not as painful at all. I believe it&#x27;s because there are 72 tweezers working hard to make your skin silky smooth, :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair removal time has decreased under my arms, but on my legs, I still spend about 10 or so minutes on each leg. Which brings me to why I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars. It doesn&#x27;t do a wonderful job at getting the smaller hairs. I have to work a little harder to get those, which increases my usage time. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve been using epilators for a good year and a half to two years, and they all work pretty much the same. I think the head doesn&#x27;t contour enough to your leg to get that really smooth experience. BUT, I do still love it. I use this once a week, and that is perfect for me, especially when I would shave in the AM and at the first sign of goosebumps, I felt stubble (Winter is hard on a chick!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from getting laser hair removal, this is the next best thing. I do recommend this epilator for a less painful experience and being hair free for longer than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I love this for removing facial hair!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Loves it! Does its job!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this epilator and it is really good!  I used to have another brand epilator I bought abroad several years ago.  Unlike that one, this Emjoi is less painful and I am able to finish shaving my legs with much fewer passes (I suspect because it has more tweezers).  It does get all the hair, and I don&#x27;t have to shave for weeks.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!!! I have an extremely low tolerance for pain, and although the pain is there, it is over before your brain has a chance to notice it! I have found that the trick is to make sure that it makes the same sound while it is on your skin that it does when it is not on your skin. If you press too hard, it slows down, so press it just up to the point right before it changes sound. I was able to remove a large area of unwanted body hair within a relatively short period of time, so the device is fairly fast as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the older Emjoi Gold model for about 10 years now, so I thought it was time for an upgrade. I purchased this unit and it works great because it has double tweezer heads, but its only good for the legs. Since the dual tweezer head its soo thick it&#x27;s hard to do your bikini or your underarms. Therefore, for those areas I still use my old emjoi gold since the head is thinner. This unit is good for the legs cause you can do them faster ,but not any other part. I have never shaved, I have alwasy used the Emjoi and soon I will start the laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I just tried to place my order. Do you not ship this to Canada?  You advertise that you do, but I kept getting a message that said \\&quot; cannot ship to my destination. Change my destination or delete my order\\&quot;.  I have had the Optima for years and it just died...id really like to purchase another epilator by Emjoi.....Please advise......</li>
            <li> I bought the emjoi Ap-18 dual opposed 72 tweezer head because I liked that it would work faster on my girlfriend than the others. However, this product is not wireless but seems to be more powerful than other emjoi products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that this product works quick and if they are used to the pain than they will  remove hairs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both enjoy this product and my girlfriend is very smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to people who are trying out epilators for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other epilators are cuter but I went with efficiency.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and the first time i used it, it was awesome! it was fast, removed all my hair and it didnt grow back for a longer time. But i was using it for 4-5 months maybe and it was loosing the strenght. And then it died. The twizlers didnt move anymore,there was the sound but nothing moved, and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money cause I have a cheaper one,like 40$ one and it works perfect for more than 5 years..This only lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little on the first use, but it got much better after that.  I only have to shave about once a month right now and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had the Braun Silk Epil for about 4 years.  I have only had the Emjoi Emagine for about three weeks, and already I love it so much better.  The Braun was my first epilator and I thought that was how they were supposed to work.  I always had red bumps on my legs for about 12-24 hours after use.  I don&#x27;t get red bumps/irritation at all with the Emjoi.  I could never do my bikini line the the Braun because it hurt way too much and it left the annoying red bumps.  I tried my bikini line with the Emjoi and fell in love.  The pain was completely managable for a first time (the pain decreases the more you epilate)and left no red bumps.  I&#x27;m completely sold on the Emjoi.  The only thing I miss about the Braun is the light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using similiar products for the last 25 years. I tried to experiment with different methods as well, but always go back to epilators. This was replacement for the same brand, but different model, that I had for the last 5 years. This works like a miracle! It is considerably faster than just one row of tweezers. What can I say. I definitely recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Review from a guy, using this to remove stomach hair that has been resistant to IPL removal. This product works, but is not leaps and bounds above the cheaper models. Marketing alone must have been in charge of the claims of less pain, because the pain is either the same or close enough to others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NEVER recommend this to someone as a long term solution, but given deeper rooted and coarser hair, the removal is more painful for me. Only went back to using this because I have grown tired of the delayed IPL (Silknsense) results on this particular area. All other areas of my body have responded much faster. I would guess I have 70% reduction in total hair and thickness from Silknsense on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this product works. Does it work better enough for the price tag? Debatable. Is it a long term practical solution for a guy in deep rooted areas like the chest or stomach? Absolutely not. If you are looking to be hair free for a season, or an occasion - this works. If you have deep, coarse, hard rooted guy hair, you are going to tire of the pain and repetition quickly. Just realize this is NOT something you are going to be wanting to use every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> first time I have used an Epilator and I was pleasently surprised. The Emjoi does what it is supposed to do in a very efficent manner. And it did not even hurt that much :) I would always recommend this product. Good quality and nothing to complain about after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  After years of waxing I found a great alternative.  The pain is almost non existant.  It does not last as long as waxing, but very close</li>
            <li> A little painful but you do get used to it.  The best epilator I have used.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Epilator as a replacement. It was such a disappointment, The lowest speed is still to fast, and seem to miss ALOT of hair. I wish i hadn&#x27;t thrown out my previous one and gotten the same model instead.</li>
            <li> The best of all of them! Have had 4 or 5 previous models and this is by far  the Best Yet!!</li>
            <li> I have had Braun, Philips and Some Other Brands but this is my First Emjoi. I Found Braun the Best in quality but I give 5 Star for their Customer service</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator. I liked the idea of it. But when I got it, plugged it in and turned it on... I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it. Those tweezers move FAST. And the thing is loud, like really loud. I have nothing to compare this particular one, too. Several days later I finally got brave, got it out and just did it. It hurts, I won&#x27;t lie. It&#x27;s not unbearable. I imagine it is very similar to getting a tattoo. After a few passes your skin starts to go a little numb. It takes some time, longer than shaving. I had to go over several areas more than once. I only did my calves. They immediately got red bumps ALL over. But by morning the red bumps were gone. It was just irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the speed of these tweezers rolling around the barrels... it moves fast. I was terrified to set it against my skin! So the first calve that I did had way more irritation and red bumps because I was having to go over spots several times. By the time I got to my second calve I was more comfortable and was able to work faster and more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I just barely have any stubble and it&#x27;s been about five days since I first used it. I usually have stubble the NEXT day after shaving. As I use it more I expect the redness from irritation to lessen and lessen. Worth not having to shave for a week or two! I knocked off a star because I hate how loud it is (it annoyed everyone!).</li>
            <li> I was debating on buying one, I didn&#x27;t want to just buy a cheaper $30 one and not like it and just have the investment wasted. So after consideration I purchased this, and it is amazing! Especially for the armpits, it just makes all the hair grow at least 3x slower and when it does grow back it isn&#x27;t an issue waiting for it to get long enough to epilate again since it&#x27;s so light now. Such a clean alternative to waxing!</li>
            <li> WOW!!! This is the BEST epilator I have ever used!  I am a 20+ year veteran of epilating.  I started with waxing when I was around 20.  My first epilator was called an Epilady and I think it pulled about one hair at a time.  I graduated to Braun equipment after that and have had several.  My last Braun was a Silk-epil 5 which only lasted a couple of years.  It did pretty well, but the cord fell out constantly until I used a hair rubberband to keep it in place.  The headlight on it was probably my favorite feature.  It died a few weeks back and when I went online to get another one, I started reading the customer reviews (I love Amazon most for these reviews!) where someone mentioned the Emjoi, which I had never heard of.  After reading more about it, I figured I certainly couldn&#x27;t go wrong with almost double the number of tweezers.  I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the Emjoi!  A job that usually takes anywhere from 2 1/2 - 3 hours took about 1/2 hour.  I was so happy with the results I was sure I heard a choir of angels singing!  I can&#x27;t wait to buy one for my teenager!  And can I just say WOW!!! again!  Thank you Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars only.  I would give it only 1 but it does remove some hair.  The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t remove the majority so I end up having to waste a lot of time still tweezing. My last epilator always removed all hairs with less tweezer heads, and although it lasted me over 7 years it finally died.  I cannot find out again so I decided to try this one since it seemed like our would do a great job.  Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work good at all. And after the first month it works even less,  even after being cleaned.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My old emjoi epilator broke several years ago.  After shaving for a couple of years, I decided to go back to the epilator and purchased another brand.  The other brand seemed to break the hair more often than tweeze it out so I returned the device.  Subsequently, I ordered/received the Emjoi 72 Tweezer head epilator.  I am very satisfied with this device - it works great and having the extra tweezing capacity gets the job done in less time.</li>
            <li> I love only having once a week, and sometimes less in the winter.  Your hairs grow back soft so you don&#x27;t notice rough nubs. Occasionally I get an ingrown hair but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the benefits.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  It does take several swipes with the razor but you are only doing it once a week wo it&#x27;s worth the extra time.  Hairs grow at different rates, so I don&#x27;t find I can wait 6 weeks like the product says.  I&#x27;ve used an Emjoi Epilator for years and won&#x27;t go back to hand held or electric razor.  I am sold on the product and they last for years!!!</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for a while now and needed a 2nd epilator due to travel, etc. I have a Silk braun Xelle that has a cord and it has worked wonderfully for me. I couldnt find the same model I have, so decided to try this one, thinking that the dual heads would make it easier to epilate hard to reach areas where the hair follicles grow in different directions. When receiving this item the first thing that immediately disappointed me was the lack of a built in light. My Silk epilator has a small light near the head that clearly illuminates the fine hairs that are otherwise very difficult to see, even in a well lit room. My next disappointment was the fact that the unit does not come with any form of trimmer head. The trimmer is necessary to shorten the hairs and make them much easier for the tweezer heads to grab.  Other then that, the epilator works, but definitely doesnt work as well as the braun. It seems to have a harder time grabbing fine hairs and doesnt do as good of a job of removing hairs after a single pass. The only positive is it really doesnt cause much pain, but I think that is because its not pulling the hairs like it is suppose to. If I was able to return this model I would, but I kept it for a while to try it out. Will definitely be looking for a replacement as it doesnt work well enough to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using a single wheeled epilator for years and was happy with everything about it, except how long it took me to do my legs. It would take 20-30 minutes PER leg because my hair was so thick. So, the epilator I&#x27;ve been using finally just got to be useless and I decided to treat myself to a new one. This one is AWESOME. I had each leg done in about 4 minutes and it did just as good a job as the other one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this might not do as good a job if you have really fine hair. It does rotate pretty fast, and I can&#x27;t tell if it would actually pull out the fine hairs or just break them, but if you have coarse hair that is hard to pull out, this is the epilator you want! I am SOOOO happy I bought this!!</li>
            <li> Not long ago I went to a local laser hair removal tech to get an estimate on getting my back and shoulders done.  On the radio they were running ads for a 50% off sale.  Even with the sale it was over $4,000 which is more than I care to spend.  So I did a little research on hair removal and decided to try the Emjoi.  In the past I had my daughter use electric clippers on my back and the hair would grow back in a few weeks.  I&#x27;d heard that if I used and epilator and K-low hair inhibitor that it would eventually make the hair stop growing back.  This still remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m a pretty tough guy.  I&#x27;ve broken bones and sometimes driven myself to the hospital.  I&#x27;ve suffered a bad back and back surgery, a bad knee and knee surgery, and had my ankle fused.  I&#x27;ve been cut, burned, and scraped.  But I must be honest here.  This hurts like a mu@#$#%&amp;*@%er!!!!  It works extremely well and leaves the skin hair free and smooth, but I swear to God that I felt like punching my daughter in the face if she didn&#x27;t stop.  Luckily she didn&#x27;t.  Maybe next time it won&#x27;t be as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, rip the hairs out.  So be careful what you wish for.</li>
            <li> I searched at malls for an Epilady replacement and learned they were no longer available at Brookstone etc.  I found this one on Amazon for less than I paid 10 years ago and this new improved model is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 3rd Emjoi AP 18..... Its amazing and fast but after about a year.... the gears start to slip.</li>
            <li> I expected more.... I have an old epilator from Braun that I have had for years.  It still works better than this one did.  Also thought I would like the dual blades... did not.  single works more persise.</li>
            <li> Its actually pretty good it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my previous tweezer. I recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before so I may have had unrealistic expectations. I follow the directions, exfoliate Very Well each time, but my skin on legs &amp; arms are never completely smooth - feels bumpy. It&#x27;s much better than shaving every other day! It lasts at least a couple of weeks before the stubble is really noticible.  I use it on underarms and it works very well on upper lip and around faint &#x27;sideburns&#x27;!  The pain that some report is not a problem-equal to tweezing and diminishes with use. It&#x27;s actually quite worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed. Works pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve been epilating for years, so I&amp;#34;m  past the uncomfortable stage, but I think it&#x27;s more comfortable even than my old single-tweezer head device.</li>
            <li> Great product! I read MANY reviews prior to ordering this epilator and I have been very happy with my choice. I strongly recommend reading up on tips and tricks of epilator use before using this for the first time...let my mistake save you some pain! A few minutes on Google will save you a few days of painful, red bumps and irritation. It is not a pleasant experience the first few times but I&#x27;ve found that with regular use the pain is minimal and worth it for the result. Keeping up on the hair removal makes it so much faster and easier and there is noticeably less regrowth over time. The product is a bit noisy and it doesn&#x27;t get into small areas easily but with some contorting you can get the job done. The long cord is helpful for just this reason! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well! Wish it had a light on it and was easier to use in smaller areas. But, it is very powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item. So fast and easy to use. Better than shaving, results last longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, very reliable and lasting</li>
            <li> I like emjoi. I had the version before and adjusting to this model took only couple uses. This one for sure is more gentle while removing the hair. The only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy with is that it does not cashes fine hair as easy so I have to use manual epilator for this purpuse. Otherwise I think is a great product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have tried every method of hair removal, besides laser. Unfortunately, having Greek blood, I was not so blessed with the hairy gene. I have very fair light skin, and very dark, course, thick (body) hair. Shaving rarely works for me, as soon as I step out into the cold bathroom air, I&#x27;m ready for another shave. I turned to waxing, which I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with. I hated growing out all of my hair so the wax could pick it up. I would have wax stuck to my legs, underarms, and bikini for days. It was truly a horrible mess. I decided to try an epilator after coming across them on Amazon. I did a ton of research and decided on the emjoi, because it had the most tweezers heads, and well, I have a lot of hair. I received it today, and went to town. I am 110% happy with this purchase so far! I wish I had found this years ago. Favorite purchase from Amazon so far!</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for many years and was very pleased with the Emagine dual head version.  It is faster and much less painful than the other models by this company and others.  The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is that the little gear wheel which drives the tweezer head is made out of plastic.  This is the second Emjoi product which has failed me after less than 2 years due to breakage of the wheel&#x27;s plastic spokes.   So be prepared to replace this item more frequently than should be necessary for its cost.  I&#x27;m no engineer, but it seems to me the wheel should be made of metal, not plastic.</li>
            <li> Got this product on time and in good condition. This is definitely an amazing product. If you don&#x27;t want to spend time waxing just buy this. Its easy to use. There was very slight and bearable pain when I used it the first time. As I kept using it , its no longer painful. But please be careful if you have thick hair, it may be little more painful. But when hair regrows its thinner than before.As you keep using it gets easier and quicker too. So don&#x27;t think twice ,just get it , if you want to do it yourself and quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I tried following the directions and all advice I could get from other reviews. I&#x27;ve decided that it is total B.S. and I wish I hadn&#x27;t blown 80 bucks on such a P.O.S.   My esthecitian friend says that epilators aren&#x27;t good for anything but making a wax last a little longer. Hmmm... I think I believe her.   It takes too many passes to do my legs completely bare, and then I have to do it again soon to get the hairs that were just broken off, not plucked. So I do a combo of epilating and shaving now. It does make it so I have less stubble after a shave, but W.T.H.   Oh yeah, and it already did the over heating not gonna work for a while thing. Twice! After using it on high speed for 20 mins. Now I stick to low, think there&#x27;s less hair breakage.</li>
            <li> This device is amazing. Emjoi discourages re-growth of hair, and the hair that does grow back is much sparser. There are some areas that are not affected by the Emjoi, such as my upper lip; it just doesn&#x27;t get to that hair. But considering how much less hair I now have on my arms and legs, that&#x27;s fine with me. I&#x27;ll find another method to remove the upper lip hair. Over time, Emjoi is capable of permanently removing most, if not all, of the hair from the larger areas of the body, and that&#x27;s a miracle for me. It&#x27;s a very powerful device, and I don&#x27;t know if a cordless device would have as much power as the Emjoi. But the power cord is so long, it allows me the flexibility to use Emjoi anywhere in the house. I love it! This is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I was skeptical at first because I had never used an epilator before, however, this product is easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li> This product is better than the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.It is still painful to use,but the pain does lessen every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This works great!!! it doesn&#x27;t hurt and you can use every time, it&#x27;s so easy and safe, I really like it, and my family too!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt!  It works just like the literature and video says it will - I use on face and legs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve probably had your share of struggles with painful razors, messy creams, and sticky waxes. Look no further! You&#x27;ve found the product that will help you retire those troubles allow you to have a much more pleasant hair-removal experience. I&#x27;ve had this epilator for 4 years now, and it has not failed me yet! Not once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PROS]&lt;br /&gt;-About a month at a time of hair-free worry&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to contour curves&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly painless, even with sensitive skin (let&#x27;s be realistic, beauty requires some pain)&lt;br /&gt;-Product lasts a long time without damaging your skin (as razors do) or becoming dull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[CONS]&lt;br /&gt;-Can take some adjustment time (approx. 5-10 minutes) for those with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;-Can take a long time to get a clean look (up to 30 min per leg)&lt;br /&gt;-Hair has to be at least 1/2&#x27;&#x27; long to be pulled out successfully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[RECOMMENDATIONS]&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for touch-ups (ie - wax under-arms or legs first in large swaths, then touch-up with epilator for smooth skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Tylenol prior to the procedure if you&#x27;re unable to tolerate any amount of pain&lt;br /&gt;-Easiest to do after a hot shower on dry skin (do not use on oily/lotion-covered skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Set aside about 30-40 minutes if you&#x27;re serious - can be time-consuming&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of lotion after you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my ancient, dying epilator and thought I would splurge on this one.  I only wish is was half as powerful as my old one.  Sure, it hurts less, but that&#x27;s because it only pulls out a few hairs at a time!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model, particularly at its cost.</li>
            <li> I had my last Emjol for over 20 years and loved it.  It still works, but this Emjol is much faster and better. Love their products, and they are made well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one and you will not have to keep shaving. I use it about every 6 weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than regular shaving, but your skin feels much softer than when using a razor. Every women should have one, and they really do work well.  Would never buy another kind but this Brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating  for more than 5 years,  and have used a Remington,  and my latest was a Braun.  The Braun kept missing hairs and took me quite awhile to finish.  This one takes me between 1/2  to an hour,  depending on how long it&#x27;s been. Alot less pain  as well. I absolutely love this one.  Doesn&#x27;t  have a light,  but that is small compared to how much better it is. I  have found much better results with exfoliating daily and using exfoliating gloves before and after I epilate.</li>
            <li> In 1998, I bought my first epilator, which was the Emjoi Gently Gold and I used it primarily on my underarms, bikini area and the inner and back area of my legs. I should also say that I have very coarse, thick black hair which I can shave with a razor at 5am and have a shadow by 9am! After over 10 years of faithful service, I had to replace my Gently Gold and I vascillated between the AP-18 and the Lighted Caress model.  I wish I could say I choose the right one, but I did not. I went cheaper and bought the Caress model, which for some time now has exuded a blackish powdery substance each time I used it (?) I decided it was time to upgrade and bought the AP-18 and what a difference!  It is much faster and for some reason, less painful.  Starting about 3 years ago, due to problems with persistent, itchy bumps on my legs, I started epilating my entire leg, and yes, the first time was the worst! Even after I got used to it, the areas around my ankles and knees were always the most sensitive, but not so bad with this new model. With time, I had gotten used to it anyway and the pain, to me, was minimal and now, with the AP-18, it is practically non existent.  I am so pleased with the speed of it, it takes me about 10 minutes per leg. It also does a much better job on my armpits, but of course, you have to be sure your armpits are COMPLETELY dry (also necessary with the legs).  I wish I could tell you that the hairless effect lasts for weeks as advertised, but not so for me.  My hair grows VERY quickly and so if I want to keep things fairly hairless, I need to do it at least once a week. I will say though, that the growth that does come in the course of the week is pretty hard to see, unless someone is really looking for it.  Even doing it once a week is thrilling for me compared to daily shaving and still not smooth.  I cannot say I have tried any other brands of epilators other than Emjoi, but if you are looking for a really good one in their lineup, I highly recommendthe AP-18.</li>
            <li> I owned one of the first epiladys many years ago. The theory was great, but the pain stronger.&lt;br /&gt;This product with 72 tweezer heads works great. Much less discomfort and long lasting results. I am very satisfied with the product and enjoy not having stubble to contend with.</li>
            <li> I have used other epilators with fewer tweezers and have had to go over the same area two or three times in order to get all of the hairs. With the wider head this is reduced.  Does in get every hair on the first pass? No, but I don&#x27;t know of any  brand that does. It does have a powerful motor and with the two speeds there is plenty of power. Is it any noisier then other models? Maybe. I think epilating pain is reduced somewhat because you have to make fewer passes. But the sting is really no worse if you are used to it. Personally i think it is less painful in the bikini area and in the area of the Brazil wax. I wore out the other less expensive brand of Enjoli in less than a year. It will be interesting to see how this brand performs long term. For now, I am glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> My wife used to use Braun epilator. After using for one years it was time to get a new one. Although she was very happy with Braun, we decided to purchase a new one. But after the first 5 minutes it was clear that her old epilator with almost died battery was much better than a new Emjoi. The Emjoi just didn&#x27;t grab hairs as Braun did. So what is the point of going over and over for many times and spend much time trying to get a smooth skin even if epilator would still miss A LOT of hairs? So, my wife told me to send it back, because she wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone and is going to get Braun again.</li>
            <li> I have always been the person who shaves their legs in the morning, and by afternoon I could feel stubble. Bought the Emjoi AP-18 after reading many reviews, chose this one after reading that the battery operated epilators blow thru batteries like crazy. Some complained about the cord, the cord is plenty long enough, and the results are amazing! Since it is pulling the hair out at the root, it does hurt a little, but like anything - you get used to it. My legs have never been this smoothe, I use the emjoi once a week to catch any little hairs it may have missed the last go around. A little more painful on the underarms and bikini line, but that&#x27;s a given, isn&#x27;t it? Again, you get used to it, and truthfully it really only hurts the first time because that is when you have the most hair. After the initial use, it just catches the \\&quot;strays\\&quot; All in all, I love this product and am thinking of buying another, just for back-up in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say, this was my FIRST TIME using ANY EPILATOR, and this is my FIRST time Experience; I will Update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It picked up a lot of hair, and missed a lot of hair....BUT, THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING ANY EPILATOR. I think I need a few more times to get the technique right.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m a LIFE TIME Shaver/Waxer/Threader of ALMOST EVERY AREA OF MY BODY (moderate Skin sensitivity, mostly to Artificial things, &amp; I&#x27;m used to the \\&quot; sensations \\&quot; of threading, waxing, etc); it started before 13,i started shaving before most girls. I&#x27;m Southern European (those that are KNOW that we have not only MORE hair in MORE areas of the BODY, and A LOT of it is Thick too, and it&#x27;s ALWAYS Jet Black), so I wanted something that cut down (out, completely is what I wish for) the Waxing/Threading time. To keep \\&quot;Fuzz Free\\&quot; I have to Wax (EVERYWHERE from the Chin down, except a small portion of my upper back, and i don&#x27;t do upper arms, also I THREAD my Face), then THREAD my Face (Cheeks, eyebrows, chin, &amp;  where the hair line goes in front of ear. From Wash/scrubbing, set up for lightening, floor protection, mirrors, etc to running back and forth to the Microwave  to heat/warm the Wax, to Waxing, then Threading, then Calming the Skin and putting the Mirrors and such away and cleaning the Area(s), it (NO JOKE) can take upwards of 10 Hours, average begin about 7/8. This has to be done about every TWO WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;3. ANYTHING, that cuts down this time and arduous task, is needed ,that&#x27;s why I looked at this, (Laser is too expensive &amp; ruins Tattoos, &amp; some other products have rather bad reviews). I used it instead of Waxing/Threading today.&lt;br /&gt;4. My First time results (not sure if any of the hair was \\&quot;plucked\\&quot; from the \\&quot;root\\&quot;; will update with the grow to see):&lt;br /&gt;Forearms- First areas I used it on, felt \\&quot;Prickly\\&quot; the First few Sweeps, then, nothing notable, once in awhile, that Prickly sensation was felt. It removed about 40% of the Hair. It was done over 9 hours ago, and I still have bumps &amp; some red pin marks where the skin was caught.&lt;br /&gt;Neck/Chest/Upper Abdomen- Removed about 60% of the hairs. Practically felt nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits- Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the technique but MAYBE Removed a couple hairs. Prickly, like the ForeArms, mayhaps a tad bit more.&lt;br /&gt;Back of Neck- No sure if it removed any hair. I didn&#x27;t feel anything.&lt;br /&gt;Legs- Still feels like there&#x27;s quite a bit of \\&quot;Stubble\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not sure if it really got any hairs. I didn&#x27;t feel anything really, except the Top, Inner Thighs (the wobbly, not firm bit I have)were Certainly uncomfortable; Thusly I have yet to proceed to all the Bikini Area yet. I still have bumps &amp; some red pin marks where the skin was caught, more then the ForeArms.&lt;br /&gt;Lower Back/ Bum/ Upper Back of Thighs/ Partial Bikini Area - Removed quite a bit, maybe more then 60%!!! I didn&#x27;t feel anything, EXCEPT the closer you get to the more *fragile* Zones. Left with a few red pinpricks/Irritation bumps, probably less the waxing though!!!&lt;br /&gt;Face , Cheeks/ Upper Lip/ Beside the Ears/ Chin/ JawLine -  Took (possibly) more then 60% of the Hairs away. Felt a little prickly, sometimes. No Bumps so far!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even if I have to to this once (I hope it will be less, but lets say maybe even 2 - 3 Times a week) and EyeBrow Threading ( Can&#x27;t/Shouldn&#x27;t Epilate There! )  It would still take LESS time AND EFFORT/TROUBLE to do this then the Waxing/Threading Routine. I still will Shave some areas, but maybe (and I HOPE) I can get it to where I no longer have to SHAVE EITHER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update, I look forward to things getting easier, and more Effective .... I hope!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Emjoi I purchased in 1989 and decided it was time to give those fingers a rest as they must be tired.  This one is really good.  Much faster.  The first time I used my other epilator, it really hurt.  You are literally pulling out a bunch of hairs from the roots all at once.  For women who pluck eyebrows, they understand.  It hurts at first, but the results are worth it.  After you use it a few times, there is NO pain.  NONE, NOT EVER.  I do not have to shave my legs at all.  The hair grows in soft so there is no stubble.  And, over time, the hair gets more and more fine and less of it.  I&#x27;ll say that I use it about once every week or 2 just to keep tidy, but it only takes a few minutes and if I skip, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;For those who swim in salt water, which is why I started in the first place, it is wonderful.  No more stinging after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up...get ready for some discomfort which only lasts while you do it and only for a few times...and then enjoy years of shave free living.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator in summer of 2012. I used it for a year and it broke in summer 2013. It just didn&#x27;t turn on one day. After tapping it a bit on my hand I was able to get the motor running but it would keep freezing and getting stuck. It was pretty useless. Good thing it was still under the warranty, so I sent it in and they sent a replacement.  Also used that for a year and now its summer 2014 and it doesn&#x27;t work that well again. It keeps sticking and freezing and picks up significantly less than hair before. I have to make several passes and by that time by skin is red raw. I’m disappointed that I had a bad experience with this since I heard such great things about it. A few things: 1. Both worked fantastically well in the beginning. It’s just that they both had a very short life apparently. 2. My hair isn&#x27;t super thick or coarse or anything; its medium hair. And I wasn&#x27;t tampering with it in any way. I think I will get a Braun now.</li>
            <li> I like the 72 tweezer head, does a good job, not mush pull or pain w/ this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she only used it once so I took it and after the initial shock of pain you actually do get used to it. I did shave first then use the epilator everyday to get used to it and now I love it.</li>
            <li> this is my 6th epilator and its from far the best... faster than any other brand i bought before. it goes so fast to take off hair that you dont feel the pain</li>
            <li> This is def an upgrade from the optima!  Constructed better , faster, excellent contour!! Would recommend it.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love it! And it came on time ^-^ Very comfortable to use ^-^</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore or have to bother with hair growing back in a day. Takes some more time, but to me, it is worth it. It didn&#x27;t hurt, except when I got adventurous, but that also hurts less with time ;)</li>
            <li> does the job i guess, but very rough on the skin.. deos not get very small hais, obviuosly i would want every single hair to grow otherwise its pointless</li>
            <li> The overall performance of this product is good but I would suggest not spending the extra money on the dual head because its not any more useful then the extra pass you have to make anyway to get the hair thats normally missed.</li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY SOLD THIS PRODUCT UNDER FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION AND WHEN I COULDN&#x27;T USE THE PRODUCE AS I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA NOT THE US (WHICH THEY DIDN&#x27;T SAY WOULD BE A PROBLEM) THE WERE RELUCTANT TO HELP IN ANY WAY. TOTALLY DIAPPOINTED WITH THE WHOLE TURN OF EVENTS.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of thinking it would be the best epilator out there! It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;ve been epilating for a long time. This works, but I feel like my hairs break off easily when used on high speed and I end up with ingrown hairs! Anyway, this only works when plugged into an outlet. It&#x27;s not battery operated, it only works on dry skin!!! And it&#x27;s kinda loud. All in all, I would go for a cheaper one. They work about the same, but without such a high price tag!</li>
            <li> Great quality! I use mine regularly, no problems.</li>
            <li> Not bad but prefer my old Braur.</li>
            <li> Works great and does a very good job and fast. I would recommend if you are looking for a machine that works like a miracle.</li>
            <li> This does not pull out hairs well. Ended up going back to my Braun with fewer heads. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me while it worked, but the motor died after about seven months of weekly use.  I&#x27;m going back to my other brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  Love this epilator!</li>
            <li> The quickest epilator in the market. The best I had so far.</li>
            <li> It does not pick up the little short hairs as it is described.  I don&#x27;t think it gets close enough to the skin to be able to pick up the hair without going over and over and over the area.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I ended up with terrible scrapes on my skin that co- workers thought I had fallen. Used it twice as instructed. It pulled the skin and left the hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing like its reviews. Was not satisfied at all. Didn&#x27;t pull out short hairs and took even longer then my Braun brand. Returned the product.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with it! It is pretty quick and much less painful than I am used to, having had other epilators before this one... I find it fun to use which might sound weird but it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m waiting to see if I have any problems with ingrown hairs or not, but so far so good. I also found it more quiet than my previous epilators which is nice</li>
            <li> So, I tried this because I kept getting awful ingrown hairs (YUCK) from waxing. I used this on my bikini area and legs. First off, if you are used to waxing it is pretty much the same comfort level (i.e. hairs ripping from your skin).  The end result for me was the same bumps, redness and overall yuckiness.  I have to apply a mix of vitamin E oil and tea tree oil (anti-bacterial) to the aggravated area for days and still do not look flawless for quite some time. It sucks.  I also tried it on my legs which wasn&#x27;t as bad as my bikini area but I still notice some red bumps. I did it last night so maybe it will go away.  I think that the bikini area is just a sensitive area and I had better luck with my legs (and maybe armpits).  The product itself is not bad it&#x27;s just not for me.  I think my only option at this point is electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic cordless and I thought the Emjoi corded version would be more powerful and more effective at taking the hair out on the first pass. I found it was quieter than the Panasonic, but not as effective as the Panasonic. Still take several passes to get a hair free finish. I still prefer the Panasonic better.</li>
            <li> This works so fast and is painless. I hate shaving and have tried several epilators. This one is quicker and needs less passes. Super!</li>
            <li> Ca fait des années que j&#x27;utilise un épilateur mais je dois dire que celui ci est vraiment efficace et la durée de la repousse des poils est prolongé à comparer celui que j&#x27;utilisais auparavant. Bon achat!</li>
            <li> Below is only based on my own experiences after a couple times epilating. I am by far no expert on this yet. I&#x27;m also a male if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Very easy to do the arms and legs with only some pain after you get used to epilating a few times&lt;br /&gt;*Makes the legs very smooth if you make sure to go back and get those spots you missed at first&lt;br /&gt;*Even when I am rough with it I only receive a small amount of ingrown hairs. I think I&#x27;ve only ever got 10 total (currently) and most were centered on the upper right leg which is hidden under any type of clothing in the summer anyhow unless I wore a speedo, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Red bumps last 3-4 days longer on my upper chest than anywhere else and at first is a sea of red&lt;br /&gt;*Can get all but the last few pieces of hair on my underarms which still leave some hair noticable. A smaller epilator will be needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it sure beats shaving multiple times a week and worked well for my first epilator ever. I will need to invest in a smaller one for my face/underarms though, but that&#x27;s probably just my body.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used philips eplilator for a while and though abt time for a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the epilators seeing the review but it was total waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It says it picks up  multiple hair in 1 run ( It didnt at all only made my skin have allergies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It will pick up small hairs  --- No way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Advice buy something chea[p. Price never guarentess better resul</li>
            <li> I have very hairy legs and very sensitive skin.  I usually have to use an electric shaver but that only keeps me smooth for half a day before I have stubble.  I figured that epilating would be the way to go and would keep me hair free longer.  I&#x27;m no wimp when it comes to pain (I just sat through 2 hours of tattooing yesterday) and while it did hurt I could totally handle it.  I prepped my skin like the directions say and sat for hours the first time with my headphones in and watched a movie while I went over and over my leg without much to show for it.  I thought maybe my hair was too short (I had shaved the previous day like I was advised) so I let it grow out for a couple of days more and tried again.  I would go over and over the same spots but it was only grabbing about 60% of my hair.  I even did my armpits and while that did hurt pretty bad it actually worked really well.  I only had a couple of stray hairs I grabbed with tweezers afterwards.  Unfortunately I developed really bad ingrown hairs under my arms so although it worked I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do that again.  I did it on my arms with long hair but it really just broke off the hair because they were stubbly the next day.  I think I tried it a couple more times on my legs with even longer hair but it never grabbed enough.  I would totally sit through the pain once a week if it meant that my legs would be smooth but as it was I was dealing with the pain and the maintenance of shaving angry epliated skin anyway.  Worked so badly I returned it.</li>
            <li> My mother asked for this for Christmas because word of mouth said it wasn&#x27;t painful. She used it for awhile and has stopped because it is just too painful to continue using.</li>
            <li> excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I got it, my best epilator yet. The problem was it died after a few months, I got two more emjois and the same thing happened. The motor just starts to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used epilators for over 20 years and my older ones lasted a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to try a different brand because these should not be burning out after a few months.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say this is the first epilator i have owned. I used to shave and i am in my late 20&#x27;s, i was sick of shaving. I figured there had to be another way to loose unwanted hair! I did some research and found out about &amp;#34;Epilating&amp;#34; a hand held device much like an electrical shaver except it plucks your hair with tweezers instead of shaves. I read many reviewers saying Emjoi AP-18 was the best, i also read some reviewers saying it was NOT the best. Many of the reviewers that did not like Emjoi AP-18 preferred the Braun SE7681 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator or just the &amp;#34;braun&amp;#34; brand in general. I personally choose the Emjoi AP-18 because i wanted to try out the 72 tweezers. In my mind i think the 72 tweezers would be the fastest hair removal and it was corded so i did not have to worry about battery life. The down side to this is you cannot use the Emjoi AP-18 in water, at the time when i was purchasing i figured this would not be a big deal. Well Now i am looking to purchase the braun NOT because the Emjoi AP-18 does not work but because i think i would prefer using an Epilator while i take a HOT bath. My Emjoi AP-18 works great and i love that it is corded because i do not have to worry about the battery dying. The flip side to this is buying the Braun SE7681 with the battery dying but being able to use while i take a HOT bath, so i plan to purchase the Braun SE7681 Only because i can use this while i take a bath. I also would like to note i have a high pain tolerance and I am able to Epilate sensitive area&#x27;s like arm pits, bikini area, face. I just think that now i would like to experience epilating under hot water to dull some of the pain i do experience while epilating my bikini area. So to all the women and men thinking about buying your first epilator, these are my personal experiences and this may help you in your decision making with a epilator.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made in construction but it has the most tweezers and gets the job done.  The best one I have owned and I have purchased many</li>
            <li> Great, works as described!  We used it a couple times and feel this is a good epilator at its pricepoint!</li>
            <li> No problem so far. Works very good, had a different brand before. I liked to try another brands, I might buy another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the fiancee, she loves it and thanks the person who invented these epilators. She also went by many youtubers recommending this one and now she too recommends it after using.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected. Better than my first Emjoi epilator which lasted me 3 years. I am hoping that this one lasts longer. My only main complaint is the product description. Not that it really matters to me but posting the accurate color would be appreciated. Prior to ordering, it said that it was *violet* when the  color on the picture showed red, then it was actually red when it arrived. Like I said, nothing major.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary if you have never used an epilator before, but it works so well, I forgot I ever grew armpit hair in the first place!</li>
            <li> This product is very fast and works great!.  No it does not always completely remove hair in one swipe but that just depends on type of hair and how course or thick it is.  It is not completely pain free but i never expected it to be.  It is pain free enough that I don&#x27;t ever have to go get another brazilan wax again.  With this product I will never need to buy razors again!</li>
            <li> Okay, so this is my very first time using an epilator and ouch!! it literally felt like thousands of little electricity bolts hitting you at one time... BUT to my surprise the initial shock and pain didn&#x27;t last long, and you can see the roots of the hairs that got pulled. By the third attempt of trying the epilator, I no longer felt the sharp pain on the areas I have gone over before. I only did one leg that night though,i&#x27;ll work up the courage for the other leg, later.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi Epilators for years. This new one is much larger and can cover a larger surface area. It is perfect for legs or large areas.  I see no cons to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epil actor for 6 months now, and I don&#x27;t use it often, but the motor in it is already dying.  It&#x27;s fine just running, but as soon as you apply any pressure, you can hear and feel it struggling.  The blades slow down and it isn&#x27;t pulling all the hair even with multiple passes.  Luckily I have very light blond very thin hair, so it&#x27;s not noticeable if I don&#x27;t also shave.  I would not get this product again.  Actually I wouldn&#x27;t get an emjoi again.  My first on was also an emjoi and the motor works fine, but the blade rotators don&#x27;t catch.  That on also only lasted months.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! My legs usually get itchy after I shave with a razor, so I tried this and no more itch! It was kinda painful the first time I used it, but now I don&#x27;t feel a thing. My legs are nice and silky for days/weeks after.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Emjoi Emagine!! I am glad I got the model with the 72 tweezers. It pulls out the hair with the root and the initial pain goes away after the first swipe. Then after that it is so much more tolerable! I was really obsessed when I got it so much so that I epilated my legs and my arms in 1 sitting and even did my boyfriends back lol! He was scared that it would be painful at first and then when I did it he was like, \\&quot;That&#x27;s it? Keep going\\&quot; haha!</li>
            <li> Waste of money! So loud! Tried it on face, arms and legs and guess what.. It doesn&#x27;t do anything besides sound like a small lawnmower and break off a few hairs here and there.  No thanks! Returning it</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator but fast and aggressive and maybe not for beginners. I love it because it has cut the time in 2/3rds of my old epilator, which was slow and had to make many, many passes over the same area to get all the hair. I have been epilating for many years now so I feel no pain anywhere I use it and I so appreciate the time saving efficiency of this Emjoi AP-18. I had been wanting to buy it for over a year but did not want to spend the money on but it is totally worth it and if anything happens to it, I will immediately buy another.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had been using a smaller one for seven years now and really liked it but this is better. It cut down my shave time by 2/3 I now spend only 7 min on a leg! It barely hurts at all. Now if ur starting out it&#x27;s going to hurt more but the more you use it tge les it hurts. I also use it on my face, armpits, bikini area and well anywhere I want. I still use my smaller one for smaller spaces when needed. I have exama and using a regular razor really bothers it but with this no worries! I haven used a normal razor in over a year and I couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> This item works very well and removes the growth quickly without to much trouble. would recommend this item for anyone.</li>
            <li> saves me a ton of money versus waxing and even less painful than the other Epilady I was using</li>
            <li> love it and easy to use</li>
            <li> Best investment you can make for women!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this one and it lay unopened for over a year, not kidding. Finally got motivated and followed the instructions. It is perfect! Even for first time ever use! So this review is targeted at anyone out there nervous or skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;Take a warm shower, exfoliate. The pack comes with one.&lt;br /&gt;Pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;Hod the epilator at right angle to the area, hold the skin taut and move it gently in circular motion&lt;br /&gt;( I initially did it in straight lines and all that happened was red irritated skin)&lt;br /&gt;Circular motion. It works like magic and the pain is more like a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend. Now waiting to see if the results really last longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for chin area. Has not performed as advertised. Does alright on lip.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who complains about using a shaver.  She loves it because she only has to use it only every 2-3 weeks and probably less as she continues to use it.  Her hair is getting thinner and grows back slower.  She said it was painful at first, but now since her hair is thinner she barely feels a tug.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic before, and I liked it a lot , but I love that this one can be used while its plugged in  and I love the 72 tweezers it gets my legs done in half the time.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I even try it in slow motion and didn&#x27;t work.  I gave it away since I could not return it.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but the end product wonderful. The hair returns less frequently and less noticeably.</li>
            <li> Best epilator ever!  Only used it once and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! This brand tends to only last a year before the motor gives out, but they are the best I&#x27;ve found. I wish they made a higher quality product, but as it stands, it&#x27;s more cost effective and more convenient than waxing....</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a battery operating alternative but does the job we were expecting</li>
            <li> This emulator is amazing. It was everything I hoped for. Fast, efficient, and my favorite part is that it plugs in so I don&#x27;t have to wait for my epilator to charge.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Emjoi AP-18 after researching several epilators.  I&#x27;d read that many lacked power and required several times going over the same spot to get all the hair.  After reading the reviews for this one, including many lying lechers who noted that it was relatively pain free, I decided it met both standards and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I unpacked it I immediately went to the bathroom, took a shower to open my pores as recommended, and thoroughly dried.  I then sat down on the floor, plugged in my Emjoi, and began mass-tweezing my leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface to say that I&#x27;m not a very hairy girl, and I&#x27;m actually lucky in the leg hair arena that it&#x27;s only dark below my knees.  At about 1/4&amp;#34; in length I thought it would be perfect.  OH and it was.  Let me tell you what tweezing with 72 fast-moving tweezers on your shins feels like.  I imagine it&#x27;s similar to dipping your leg in boiling acid, or perhaps peeling your skin off with a potato peeler.  After several failed reattempts at starting and screaming like my 3-year old child mid-tantrum, my husband came to make sure I was still alive.  Or, I should say, well, because with the ruckus I was making there would be no mistake that I was still living.  Much hysterical laughing on his part later, I decided to take some pain medicine and wait a half hour to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes and a chugged Blue Moon later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the bathroom, feeling more brave if not very numb, I begin again, my husband in audience for his own personal amusement.  Starting again, the pain was about 98% as horrible as it was the first time, but I was COMMITTED now.  I bought and paid for this implement of pain and I was going to see it through to the bitter end!  So I continued torturing myself and managed to make a full circuit around the bottom part of my leg.  Feeling accomplished, I reach down to rub what I assume will be a smooth, though very red, leg, only to find that it only removed about 70% of the hair.  I would have to go over my already tortured skin once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was shaking.  There were tears.  We won&#x27;t even mention my attempt at the bikini area...there was blood.  When you rip hair out from the root, it often protests by bleeding.  Oh yes, there was pain.  I made an attempt at my knees, but the curved bony area didn&#x27;t take well to the Emjoi, it barely removed any hair.  By the end, I was more relieved it was over than the birth of my first child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I do it again?  Well I&#x27;m stubborn, so I&#x27;m betting I will after maybe a few much stronger pain killers in the hopes that after time the nerves will deaden like my eyebrows after years of tweezing.  Do I recommend this item?  Well, that depends.  If you are a man, run screaming.  You don&#x27;t have the genetic capability to handle this much pain.  If you are a NSA agent who needs information out of someone, or perhaps a wife with a cheating spouse, this product is for you!  IMMENSE amounts of pain while barely leaving evidence of said torture!  If you are a woman looking for a new way to remove leg hair, stick to shaving, or waxing, or Nair.  Do not, I repeat, do NOT try this at home.</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work extremely well.  High quality manufacturing.  The draw string bag is a poor afterthought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JL Thomas</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN AN REVIEW BEFORE, BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS SO UNUSUAL ND SHOCKING TO ME THAT I HAD TO SPREAD THE WORD. I AM A VERY HAIRY WOMEN ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER. THIS PRODUCT PULLED EVERY LAST PEICE OF MY LEG HAIR, WAS IT PAINFUL? YES VERY, BUT WAS VERY SHOCKED AT THE RESULTS. JUST IMAGINE HOW 72 TWEEZERS GOING 100 MILES PER HOUR PULLING LONG PEICES OF YOUR HAIR. THATS HOW IT FELT TO ME. TOOK ME A BIT LONGER BECAUSE MY HAIR GREW OUTRAGEOUS. IVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT. MY LEGS ARE NOW AS SMOOTH AS A BABIES BOTTOM HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)</li>
            <li> I had more fun watching some of the goofy videos! The more serious ones were very helpful...but the goofy ones were much more fun! I loved the woman jumping around and throwing herself off the couch as she screamed in agony...tooooo funny.  Seriously, this works. It takes a little practice and personal preference on how you progress around your body. Some areas obviously are going to be more sensitive than others, though you might be suprised on that subject. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT WILL GET EASIER...MUCH EASIER...AFTER THE FIRST TIME. The second time I used it on areas that were almost unbearable the first time around, and I was prepard for it to hurt, it did not. Really. You can always feel it pulling hairs, you are tweezing afterall and that is what tells you the job is not done yet, but it was absolutely tolerable and in some cases a complete snooze.  I did some \\&quot;tender\\&quot; areas that I thought would be uncomfortable...nothing! Just be careful to get some of that loose skin stretched nice and tight or you may tweeze off a bit of flesh. Suprisingly, that didn&#x27;t hurt so much as afterward, as would any minor abrasion or razor nick. A little Neosporin to avoid any inflamation (translated: infection) and it was no big thing.  It works better after a nice hot shower. I use a long handled stiff brush to exfoliate before...it seems to help prepare the skin. Do not push against your skin. Let it lightly ride along your skin and let the tweezing action do all the work. If the motor slows down, you are pushing too hard.  In the very sensitive areas, the first time might be difficult. Take you time and take a break if it gets very uncomfortable. Come back to that area later and work very small areas overlapping as you progress into the unremoved hair. It is not going to hurt as much to pull out 1/4 inch of hair line as it would doing the entire 1 1/2 (or so) inch wide head. So, don&#x27;t go full bore into a thicker area or sensitive area. Go at it from the edge and work in slowly.If that starts to become uncomfortable, move to the other side of the area and come at it from that side, a 1/4 inch at a time...sort of like cutting grass!  Some people complain about how loud it is. Think about this...it is a set of metal tweezer jaws, opening and closing hundreds of times a minute as they rotate around hundreds of times a minute. To ensure they firmly hold the hair to extract it, they have to slam together pretty hard. You don&#x27;t want those tiny little hairs slipping out, now do you? How in the world do you do that quietly???? Pleeease!  DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON THE BLACK \\&quot;MEN&#x27;S\\&quot; VERSION...GET THE RED ONE AND SAVE THE $40 OR SO DOLLARS.  If it lasts a year, and I use it every few weeks (though in most areas it lasts a month or more because it is new growth, not cut razor stubble so it comes in soft and light), then the cost is less than one \\&quot;large\\&quot; area wax and you can do it in privacy.  I hope this was helpful. Now, go watch that chick flop around like a fish!</li>
            <li> I am a first time epilator user although I have waxed in the past. I have used the Emjoi AP-18 for about three weeks now and love it. I have very thick, straight hair that is hard to pull out. It works best for my underarms and bikini area. It does pretty good on my legs. Sometimes I use baby powder to dry the area before using it and it seems to work better at grabbing the hair. You just have to make sure you clean it well afterwards. It is not painful at all for me, however I do not have an abundance of hair. I will keep using this until I can afford laser hair removal!!</li>
            <li> When the Emjoi Optima that I purchased ten years ago stopped working only because I accidentally got it tangled up in something and burnt the motor, I chose this as the replacement.  Very happy with it.  I haven&#x27;t shaved in over ten years and my hair just keeps growing back sparser and softer.  This product was delivered quickly and I have been using it for several months with no problems.  Very happy with the supplier.</li>
            <li> Used a Braun Silk for a couple of years before the motor burned out.  Decided I would upgrade to a fancy new Emjoi model. Talk about a waste of $90.  This new opposite rotating design is flawed.  It does not catch many hairs, and what hair it does catch it breaks above the surface of the skin rather than pulling it out at the root.  Will probably be going back to Braun Silk, even though the motor seems to have a 2-year shelf life.</li>
            <li> This Emjoi Epilator seems to work well.  After reading several reviews for several epilators I decided to buy this one.  The 72 tweezers do seem to make shorter work for removing hair.  I can&#x27;t say it cut my time in half, but it did seem shorter than usual.  It is very easy to clean and the cord is nice and long.  I think the discomfort level isn&#x27;t as bad with Emjoi, for some reason.  I was using a Braun before it gave up the ghost unexpectedly, and it was a little more discomforting on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating is that for the price (all these devices are too expensive) I&#x27;d have liked to see a light.  My old epilator had a light and I actually found that to be quite nice and handy.</li>
            <li> I have to say this thing works that&#x27;s for sure but you often need to go back and forth more than once and if there are many hairs you&#x27;re on for a LONG job and it&#x27;s freaking painful I wont lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reverted back to shaving after a while since it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain. I still have it but do not use it anymore. Might come in handy someday but... I&#x27;m affraid I do not have any terrorists to &#x27;&#x27;interrogate&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I read a blog pertaining to epilators being a girl&#x27;s best friend and decided to try it out. I looked on amazon and due to the reviews decided to go for this one. This was definitely best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought in regards to hair removal. I&#x27;ve tried everything! depilatories give me a rashes and inflamed skin , waxing pulls skin, even no!no!, which did not work for me. I am left with shaving which I need to do everyday and sometimes if I shave in the morning I need to redo it if I&#x27;m going out at night, It is such a hassle. This was so fast although there was some discomfort it wasn&#x27;t too bad. It did pull out a majority of the hair from the root but there rest was easily nicked with a razor. I did not have to shave the next day and that was a major improvement. I am on the 3rd day and I just need to shave tiny stubble from the hair that was not pulled from the root. overall I liked it ans will continue to use it. Its also great for underarm hair.</li>
            <li> So my girlfriend said I&#x27;m a bit too hairy...&lt;br /&gt;She bought one of these a few months ago and was using it to get rid of unwanted body hair. In the idea that it will thin out the hair that grows back, like waxing. She warned me it hurts, a lot, but told me I should start to shave in the least, and at best to get one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this now for literally 2 days. Yesterday I started with my legs. Now I&#x27;m not a man-bear, I&#x27;m a blond white male, not thick hair just fairly noticeable on the legs. And I started shaving every once in a while for the past few months, and I had a few millimeters of growth on my legs at worst 1/4 inch. I started with the legs as I said, I turned the thing on, and it whirred away. Carefully I jabbed it at my leg, the pain was noticeable, but bearable. I started to move it around, uprooting the forest on my shins, and heading towards the calves. The inside was tender, but no where near as tender as the outside calf. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I grit my teeth and continue on... Small hairs are still noticeable on the legs, but not seen, and with each day and pass it keeps getting less and less.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight after reassuring my legs are still smooth, my girlfriend mentioned, \\&quot;I thought you would just use it on your stomach and chest!\\&quot;... So I lifted my shirt, and started near the belly button. The pain is almost incomparable. I say almost, because I do know what I can compare it to, getting a tattoo! I have 4 tattoos, and actually the pain in those were less than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain in this is getting the whole tattoo done in one instant. Yes, this is crazy painful!&lt;br /&gt;In fact it&#x27;s so bad, that it pulled skin from the roots of the hair on my stomach, which is why it hurts so bad. And I know it&#x27;s pulling skin, because its on the hair in the little catch bin (which is difficult to clean, because it doesn&#x27;t pull apart for cleaning), and because i&#x27;m bleeding from the spots where the hair follicles were! Yes, pin hole sized scabs on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because the packaging is misleading, it mentions something about \\&quot;Silver ION Antibateral\\&quot; something or other, which is just bull. There&#x27;s no heating element or something, there&#x27;s no magic ion generator to stop bacterial growth on it, or while using it. I can only assume they mean the tweezer heads are electrically doped with silver, for the same reason they (sarcasm) use silver in medical facilities. (They use \\&quot;surgical\\&quot; steel for a reason.[if i&#x27;m wrong here don&#x27;t blame me, i&#x27;m just writing a review.])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this thing was ~$80 for something that doesn&#x27;t even have a battery? Yes it&#x27;s portable! If you take the wall plug with you, it&#x27;s not a charger, as it&#x27;s not CHARGING ANYTHING! So in other words, \\&quot;No, it&#x27;s not something that is mounted to a wall!\\&quot; Seriously, this probably pissed me off the most. And I should give it 3 stars for the more misleading advertisement that \\&quot;it&#x27;s portable.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do give you a s***ty bag, that you might as well throw away, it&#x27;s just junk.&lt;br /&gt;And the cleaning brush, is too small to do anything. The bristles need to be about twice as long to clean the catch basin, or at least let me remove the tweezer head barrels to actually clean this thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more notes about first use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It HURTS! If you&#x27;ve ever had a tattoo, it&#x27;s along those lines of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get red bumps that look nasty for a few hours. You just ripped a bunch of hair from those bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get tiny stuff, so small hair will stay till it grows out, then you can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend has had major problems with ingrown hairs! This is a big issue, the ingrown hair will cause infections, and pimple like boils. You have to cut the skin open and get the hair out! BEWARE, this is the worst problem from this, but is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;ve done an area once, it&#x27;s not as bad the second time around, as long as you keep up with it. The first time is the worst. But even after you&#x27;ve got the worst, you can go right over it again and get more, and it wont hurt as bad even in the first 5 minutes. So you can go over an area a few times in one night, with the bad pain once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circular motions! This gets the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite your teeth and just do it, I know it hurts... but it&#x27;ll get better. (until you hit a new area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have, it&#x27;s good, nothing to get excited about, and it hurts. (at least for men, with coarse hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I have not attempted my rear end... I&#x27;m too afraid to.t time is the worst. But even after you&#x27;ve got the worst, you can go right over it again and get more, and it wont hurt as bad even in the first 5 minutes. So you can go over an area a few times in one night, with the bad pain once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circular motions!

            <li> I received this in May, and LOVED it, until I took it with me to Australia, plugged it in to the proper converter and it never turned on nor has it since. What happened? I contacted Customer Support for this product but did not receive a return call. I want to use it but it will NOT turn on when plugged in. I don&#x27;t know how to reach the seller for help. Perhaps the seller will contact me now that I have written this. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> It is to painful to use, don&#x27;t remove hair very well and all it does is pulls out the hair</li>
            <li> I am not one to review product, but this is an exception.&lt;br /&gt;this removes that hair from under arms and bikini area perfectly and you do it yourself! no more paying a fortune for waxing or showing you bikini area to strangers. I find that this hurts less than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I am used to waxing underarms and bikini and this did not hurt much, but i cannot use it for my legs yet. it hurt like hell. So for now i will still shave my legs but at least i will have a great bikini line and underarms.</li>
            <li> Overall the product does what it advertises.  I expected more discomfort and was pleasantly surprised at how much it did not hurt.  I used it on bikini line, legs and underarms.  I am happy with this purchase.  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less painful than my previous epilator!</li>
            <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
            <li> Dual opposed heads is a terrible idea. The designer who came up with it should be fired. I have had this epilator for about a week and I really regret buying it. Because the two heads want to run in different directions, you are constantly trying to fight with it to stay in one place or run in one direction. It&#x27;s impossible to control where it will remove hair and if you have a tricky area, it will constantly fight you to keep moving. It moves like a vacuum. Ridiculous. I never had this problem with Braun.</li>
            <li> This is the amazon purchase I regret the most!  This worked amazing on my armpits about thd first 7 times...smooth for about 5 days those 7 first tries... And actually not so smaxing because I had to go over the same area multiple times ...But that&#x27;s when it all ended ... After that it started cutting and snagging hairs from all directions ...it was a nightmare I even tried it on the bikini area ...oh dear what a mistake ! Stay away from this ! Maybe I got a bad one from a third party here at amazon who knows but I&#x27;m done with epilators but if you are still curious to try this my advise would be to exfoliate very well and watch how the machine is slicing your hair every use if ...if you notice it starting to cut poorly just stop and return if you&#x27;re still within the 30 days ...good luck!</li>
            <li> I was very much hoping the extra tweezers would make the hair removal process faster and more efficient, not the case. It functions with the same inefficiency as other brands (I have tried the epilady, the remington and the braun) but with more ergonomic issues. The large thick handle is cumbersome and tiring to hold for the time it takes.The two chunky plastic pieces on both sides of the tweezer face make the product difficult to manipulate for proper hair removal from knees and other more curvy areas of the body.</li>
            <li> Used this once all over.  It did seem to cut some of the hairs, instead of pulling from root.  The thicker the hair, the better it works, I&#x27;ve noticed.  Overall I achieved  smooth underarms and arms, semi smooth legs.  It&#x27;s not catching the invisible hairs.  What I mean is I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve smoothness on my legs and knees.  It feels as though I shaved a day ago and have peach fuzz regrowth.  Not as painful as some say it is.  It is very tolerable. Alas I&#x27;m Very happy with my purchase.  Am enjoying not having to shave my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li> Used it right away and it is everything as advertised....very satisfied with item and performance.</li>
            <li> I wish it were better</li>
            <li> Ouch, Ouch and Ouch! Its something you have to get used to...I haven&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> this is the first time I have used an epilator, so I&#x27;m no expert, but after first use , I am not impressed. It seems to break off the hair instead of pulling it out. Five hours later I have way more stubble than if I had shaved. I will keep trying it, but if I don&#x27;t start getting better results, I will return it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and wow does it hurt. This product got all the thick hairs near my bikini line and arm pits. Ouch! The good news is it also gets the short, thin hairs. The only thing is it didn&#x27;t seem to get the hair that was near the bony areas of my legs(shins and knees)too well the first time I used it. It may need more hair length in those areas. The thick hairs hurt the most coming out hands down. Any thin hair just feels like a light prickle. I am surprised how well it works and definitely wish I would have gotten one sooner. It would have avoided the use of that dreaded nair and other horrible products.</li>
            <li> can someone that uses this epilator tell me how well it works? i want one with a double head like this and more tweezers but ive seen how others have commented and complained for so long about how the epilator&#x27;s gears mess up for after so long or one of the little teeth break off then all the rest do and i want an eplilator thats of good quality and will last a long time. so which should i go for?Emjoi, Philips, Panasonic, or Braun? and i want one with the most tweezers on it like 40 tweezers or above and i wont take less than 36.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement for a much earlier model  This does the job swiftly and well.  Guess it is sharper and larger than the one that died, 10-12 years after purchase. It is even better than the former model.  I hope it lasts as long. It does not cause pain, a bit of a tightness and maybe a quick twinge, nothing earthshaking.  Hairs grow back in 3-4 weeks softer and lighter....</li>
            <li> Even with the two heads it takes longer Than my older one. It&#x27;s also difficult to get your under arms done. The angle is difficult to get right.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my legs, bikini, arms, underarms, and face myself for almost 10 years now (I am a licensed aesthetician) and I was getting tired of how messy the waxing process is. I have very course hair on my legs and moderate hair on the rest of my body, and very sensitive skin. The Emjoi is a bit painful, more than waxing, but not too bad. It really does get most of the hair, and I haven&#x27;t noticed more ingrown hairs than I would get from waxing. The only area it does not work well on is my face, but I use hard wax there anyway which is much less messy than soft wax, so I don&#x27;t mind continuing to wax my face. It is very convenient (I can do pretty much my whole body in 30 min) and I like that it just plugs in as opposed to having a battery to charge, because I have heard that batteries run down pretty quick on epilators and I never have to wait for it to charge. I would highly recommend that people with course hair have 3 or 4 rounds of waxing (and no shaving) before starting with an epilator, as waxing is much less painful and the hair will start to grow back thinner making the initial epilation treatments much more tolerable. I did try an epilator many years ago before I had ever waxed, and it was too painful so I couldn&#x27;t use it. So overall it does exactly what I hoped it would do, and does not irritate my skin like waxing and shaving does.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi Emagine a couple of years ago and was originally pleased with its performance.  Recently, however, I noiced that it is not picking up short fine hairs and is now missing the long, coarser hairs as well.  I use the Emjoi on my arms and legs about once a week (even less during cooler months) and am disappointed that this epilator--which cost more when I purchased it--has lost its functionality after about 100-200 uses.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised But very happy at what A good job it did the first time.It was recomended by A friend that has used one for years.I have a heavy mustache &amp; beard caused by some heavy medication in the past.This Epilator has taken that away and has done a great job on my legs and under arms.I was worried about it pulling but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.Kudoos to my EmjoiAp-18 duel emagine 72 tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;  One Happy Customer&lt;br /&gt;  M.J.</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned epilator, and thought I&#x27;d share my experience for those who are debating which epilator to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that using an epilator WILL HURT the first few times, but after a while, you become so accustomed that you no longer feel pain, but rather a slight discomfort.  As a frame of reference, I epilate my legs, arms and am pretty adventurous with the bikini line (I use it for a Brazilian - which is why I own 3 epilators, one is for my nether region only, and I clean it with alcohol after each use. I especially recommend you do this as well if you plan to do your bikini area and other body parts with the same epilator).  For some reason I can&#x27;t stand the sensation on my armpits - IT REALLY HURTS! I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use it on my face, but I don&#x27;t think it should be too uncomfortable.  Also, epilating will not leave you as smooth as shaving, but it is pretty darn great because you will only have to do it once a month (after the first 4 weeks which you should do it once a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, HOW DOES THE EMJOY COMPARE TO [[ASIN:B004TGUKG0 Braun&#x27;s SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator, Orange/Copper]] Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ****** IF YOUR ARE NEW TO EPILATING -&gt; I DO VERY MUCH LIKE the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachemnt the Braun has (this emjoi does NOT have any attachments). When you are a first time epilator, the rolling beads  give you a different sentation and therefore \\&quot;distract\\&quot; your skin so you don&#x27;t seem to feel the yanking of your hairs quite as terribly. BUT REALLY, IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIMER, IT WILL HURT at least the 1st 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have taken the Bruan Epil 7 Epilator into the shower (because it is completely water proof, which this emjoi is NOT), and it really feels the same as dry epilating.  Maybe I felt less discomfort with the warm water, but honestly speaking, it takes 20 minutes to epilate my legs and, I am not taking a 20 minute shower! So, to me, it is not a critical feature. In addition, because of the lighting in the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light we all have so if you are there with your husband your wobbly bits are not so obvious), I miss quite a bit of the hair on my body. So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating.  I never tried it in the bath, but in the bath the last thing I want to do is epilate.  A bath serves 2 purposes:  Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you.  Neither which includes the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40) does make it faster because I am yanking hair from a larger area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** IMPORTANT ****** Lastly, my Braun&#x27;s battery fried after 6 months of use.  WHICH REALLY STINKS! That is why I would recommend getting an epilator that has an electrical cord.  I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works). The Braun (liked above) I had purchased can ONLY be used after it has been charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy this emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months if you use it as heavily as I do. I gave this epilator 4 stars, because it doees not have the light, the massaging head and it is not fully water proof which the Braun is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.n the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light we all have so if you are there with your husband your wobbly bits are not so obvious), I miss quite a bit of the hair on my body.

            <li> I have been shaving all my life and I have very thick hair on my legs that literally would grow back everyday. And I would often get ingrown hairs and dark marks on my legs . I have been using the emoji for about a month now and I love it. No ingrown. And the marks are finally starting to fade. You just have to be patient when you first start using be star the hair cycle is different for different hairs on your legs. I wouldn&#x27;t say my legs are silky smooth just yet but much much improvement. Overall I  am very satisfied I won&#x27;t go back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and exfoliate!!!!!</li>
            <li> The eplilating head broke, I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.  This is my third epilator and the construction right out of the box was cheap, I immediately wasn&#x27;t impressed.  It worked, and like all epilators leaves some hairs, making you go over them repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two gears which you can see when you take the head component off.  The gear within the machine broke off a few of the teeth on the epilating head and now it does not function.  It makes a grinding noise and there is no way to buy a replacement head.  I&#x27;m and throwing it away along with the Emoji brand and sticking to Braun</li>
            <li> So I did some research and most of what I found suggested to shave and exfoliate the day before prior to using this product. I did just that. And boy did it hurt. I only turned it on for a few seconds but it was a few seconds of torture! I decided to try again. This time I took a hot shower to open up my pores and of course exfoliated. Right after my shower, I tried it. It was much more bearable to use and I got used to the pain. After awhile I didn&#x27;t notice the pain. Took about 30 min or so to shave both legs a little past my knees. Gave it 4 stars due to the initial pain. Will see how long this lasts before growth returns. After epilating, I used Gigi Slow Grow Skin Maintenance Lotion Hair Inhibitor (also purchased from Amazon).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love this epilator, it works great... Well apart from the pain  but I only gave it a three star rating because I&#x27;m now on my third one it seems as if after one year the previous two just stop working! No sure why but it just goes kaput! Finito, dead. I need to find one that has a warranty! Because I can&#x27;t keep spending $100+ A pop on this machine! Anyone ok else has this problem let me know!</li>
            <li> Beware, this epilator does not pull out at the follicles and it hurts a lot. Try waxing instead.It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi and it&#x27;s the best way I have found to remove hair.  Initially, it felt a bit prickly (can be minimized by pulling the skin taut) when I used it but after the first month or so, there was no discomfort whatsoever.  The hair follicles cried &amp;#34;uncle&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s easy-peasy!  I used to get terrible &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; after shaving but not with the Emjoi.  My hair grows in very light and often times, I don&#x27;t realize how long it is until I sit in the sun a certain way because the hair growth is so soft and so light.  I believe hair growth has slowed as well.  I use the Emjoi on my legs, bikini line, underarms and face.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator! This is my 2nd one in 5 years. The 1st one wore out because I pressed too hard. Just remember to exfoliate. This device has made my life so much easier. I will never go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I used to own one that was cordless, and I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read about this one, and how much more power it had, because it was plugged directly in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, this one is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I can do my armpits and my legs in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is not bad, you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Better to do it when your hair is short, once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I think this pulls out hairs that my old braun missed.  I&#x27;m pleased!  My legs are smoother longer and I seem to have less irritation than I had with the braun.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> well was sent with american plug so not compactiable with australia, so had to go and buy another adapter, but doesnt keep the charge up so diappointed with it</li>
            <li> With the dual tweezer head, my epilating time was cut by a three-forths.  Was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t charge and have to remain plugged in, but the cord is quite long and it has not been a problem.  LOVE this epilator and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great epilator. I used a coil epilator for almost 25 yrs and could not tolerate using it on the upper leg. I can use this on my entire leg and arms. The first time I used it I did have quite a bit of irritation but I tryed benadryl spray and it cleared it up. I have been using this epilator for about 2 months now and have found that if I use it about once a week I have very little irritation and that clears in a few hours. I have thick,dark hair and shaved everyday. I would definitely recommend this product.,</li>
            <li> I am a 19 year old male and I found out about epilators through my cousin who recently purchased one. I hate shaving. I shave my chest because I do not like the feeling of being hairy but shaving causes me to itch and gives me a rash at times. After finding about epilators, I decided to give it a try so I ordered this one. I was expecting to be painful like waxing but not extremely painful to where I couldn&#x27;t handle it since I know that if it were that painful then no sane person would use it. I received the product today and decided to give it a go. I plugged it in and proceeded to glide it down my chest. It stung so I pulled it back but then I continued without stopping and it just felt like being lightly pinched. It really wasn&#x27;t painful at all and this was my first time using an epilator (note: I have never waxed or pulled hair out from the roots.) It might be because I have a high pain tolerance as people state, but I never really thought I did. I think part of it is due to determination which causes you to numb some of the pain. The product did everything I was expecting and my chest felt smooth.</li>
            <li> *This is my first epilator (and my first experience with epilating)*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself a day between receiving it and using it...for mental preparation.  It also gave me a chance to gather my necessary items to accompany my epilating adventure: witch hazel, cocoa butter with aloe, and a nice salt scrub (you can make this pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did that I found worked pretty well:&lt;br /&gt;-I took some Tylenol and hopped in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-Scrubbed vigorously with the salt scrub, focusing on the victims (my legs)&lt;br /&gt;-Finished shower, toweled off, and resisted the urge to moisturize&lt;br /&gt;-I let myself dry off completely and took some extra time (about an hour) to get all my things together, set up my area, and made sure I had no dampness left&lt;br /&gt;-Grabbed my blow dryer (just in case I got cold, and to reopen my pores without making the hair flexible)&lt;br /&gt;-Took a deep breath and got to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it stings.  For some reason my right leg stung more than my left, no idea why.  It took me a solid half hour on each leg, but I really wanted to be thorough.  I worked an area until it no longer hurt, then I did a visual check and ran across it again.  This thing is NOT a shaver.  You CANNOT go quickly with this or else it will break hairs.  You have to go slowly, I had to keep telling myself this constantly.  Even if you go in circles make them slow circles so it gives the tweezers a chance.  I did, by the way, find that circles helped get the hairs that happened to be growing in a different direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished I:&lt;br /&gt;-Immediately applied my witch hazel using a cotton ball on the entire area I had epilated. I let that settle on one leg while I epilated the other&lt;br /&gt;-After applying witch hazel to both legs and allowing it to dry, I applied my cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very pale legs were dotted in red for the rest of the evening, but not uncomfortable.  I was surprised by how smooth they actually got.  From many of thedescriptions I expected to feel maybe a day or two&#x27;s worth of stubble, but it only felt like a few hours&#x27; worth.  Not as close as shaving, but pretty darn close.  It&#x27;s a couple days after epilating and I&#x27;m still that smooth.  I do plan on running it on my legs again (slowly, of course) just to keep up with the growth cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...TL;DR:&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a really nice machine and I love not having to charge it.  Please GO SLOWLY and don&#x27;t use it right after a shower.  Try an hour or two later (it helps the hair not break).  Exfoliate, epilate, get an alcohol free toner (witch hazel), and moisturize with cocoa or Shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get ingrowns try Tend Skin or some medicated cream from Bikini Zone, they will help tremendously.</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times now and have been very pleased.  It&#x27;s a bit painful, but not terribly so.  I rarely have to deal with my leg hair anymore and I LOVE that!  Hopefully in time, it will be even less of a bother.</li>
            <li> Found it here and love it , can not do without this item. I rather use this than have tweezers everyday.</li>
            <li> Much better than the last epilator.  I had a single row of tweezers and took forever...also missed or brook off a lot of hair.  This one removes more hair better and faster.  They all are going to have you experience some pain when you first begin.  But you desensitize to it, I suppose.  And if you epilate more often (hair are shorter) you are better off.  But it is good and I am happy with it.  Just wish it removed ALL the hair and not leave the very few it does leave....guess I&#x27;m deep rooted. :)</li>
            <li> Oh boy ... one of those good intended products that will pave the road to oh well :-)&lt;br /&gt;1. The dual head doesn&#x27;t work ... it doesn&#x27;t conform to the curves of my body, so I ended up having to angle it and use just one head at a time ... in other words a have two 36 tweezer machine and NOT a 72 one.&lt;br /&gt;2. It exfoliated my skin, but not in a good way ... and even so, it wasn&#x27;t able to remove the ingrown hair or maybe it caused ingrown hair, not sure which of the two - I&#x27;ll put this way, my skin feels more bumpy/rough than when I use a Braun Silk.&lt;br /&gt;3.For whatever reason, despite the opposing rotating heads, the 72 twezers, the speed and the brutality :-) of it, it still didn&#x27;t get the hair the first time around. I had to cover the same area, several times for it to pick up most (not all) of the hair in that area. In its defense ... I do have very fine hair, but again it is performing worse than other epilator</li>
            <li> Good product, the best corded available.</li>
            <li> works good very happy</li>
            <li> This thing does NOT work and pulls your leg hair but doesnt remove it.</li>
            <li> Faster hair removal...love it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it ever... this product is pain in the butt... it not as smooth as it is described.. buy if you can bear the pain...</li>
            <li> I havent opened the box yet as i need the adaptor for UK use.&lt;br /&gt;However i have read hundreds of reviews and if my old eppi is anything to go by with a single tweezer head then this bad boy is going to be a beast :-)</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator.  Decided on emjoi after reading reviews by others.  I liked that it had the most tweezer heads.  I use it on my legs and underarms.  I had mine for approximately three years and the power cord just stopped working. I would have gave it four stars if it had lasted longer.  I can&#x27;t give it five stars because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since I&#x27;m a first time user.  I agree with all others that say when using an  epilator, exfoliating is important. I learned this after a bit when I started seeing a few ingrown hairs on my legs.  I think the product worked well. Sure it&#x27;s a bit painful, but tolerable, in the beginning but after a few times doing it, it really doesn&#x27;t bug me anymore.  I could go days without worrying about having hairy legs.  I used to have to shave everyday.  Now I only shave every couple weeks just as a way of exfoliating and if I want an extra clean shave for shorts or a bathing suit day. My hairs did soften up and became less thick.  I also prefer a corded over an rechargeable.  I think you get better power and time with a corded product. It worked out fine for this product since the cord it comes with is extra long.  That&#x27;s a plus!  I&#x27;m going to be purchasing a replacement.</li>
            <li> Bought this about a year ago and there are only positive things to say. There is a learning curve when it comes to using the machine and a level of tolerance for pain that&#x27;s necessary (especially initially).  Other than that it&#x27;s a great invention! Worth every dollar!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> used it the first time last  night. Seemed to do a good job.it felt like little pins ,but nothing you can&#x27;t live with . I like the idea of no blades.</li>
            <li> This was pretty pricey, but I loved it until my cat chewed the power chord up. Wish amazon had it. Instead I have to buy from emjoi site.</li>
            <li> Took forever to use and the hair came back stronger.  My legs would be smooth right after although it took HOURS to get them that way.  I went back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought this one. I think it is easy to use. My leg hair is fine, and I like shaving less. I also use it carefully on my chin and lower face, even though they say not to. It works fine...much better than plucking!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. It makes a loud noise when you turn it on. I can&#x27;t say it does a better job than my razor because it has a tendency of breaking the hair off when you go in the direction it&#x27;s supposed to. I have to run this over my legs more than once to get everything out. It does work great on the armpit but again, you have to run this over it a couple of times to get everything out. Bad thing about it is that it leaves shave bumps on your legs. Like you end up getting a lot of ingrown hair and you have to make sure the hair grows back enough before you can use it again to make your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Virtually pain free epilation. I recommend this product to anyone who is will to rip their hair out :)</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator about two years ago.  I use it once a week.  I hardly ever shave unless I have to go to an event.  My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as shaving but my leg hair is noticeably thinned (at least 70 percent!).  You can still feel stubble, which is why I shave sometimes.  Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this has definitely has me in love.  Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> For several years, I have been unable to shave my legs properly because of arthritis.  Trying to shave in the shower was especially difficult due to back pain when bending over.  My shower has no seat and I hate the mess and inconvenience of using a shower chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting lightheaded bending over in the shower was also a problem and danger for me..  Upon receiving this epilator, I was able to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my legs completely in about thirty minutes while sitting in a comfortable, safe chair.  It was virtually painless, just a little stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator seems to be well built and is very easy to use.  It is noisy, as others have mentioned, but that is not at all an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very exciting to know that my legs are virtually hair free and that I no longer need to be embarrassed due to poor shaving.</li>
            <li> Just a little &amp;#34;bulky&amp;#34; to use because a little larger than my last one.  It works great because of the head style.</li>
            <li> It only works on the US voltage and the device does not have resilience to take in any other voltage. Have tried with the step-change transformers also, still doesn&#x27;t work!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a drag!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years. I liked the idea of the larger epilator. I use it on my face/neck area. It was too big for the area. I found that it broke off most hair rather than pulled it by the root.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi products and definitely prefers using tweezer head epilator to shaving or waxing.  However, I prefer the previous model that this once replaced.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with this epilator. The one I happened to get was defective after only 1 week of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The $30 Panasonic I bought at Walgreens out does this one by a mile. I&#x27;ve  recently biught the Braun and  love it!! The seller</li>
            <li> This product gets the job done but I found it harder on the skin than the one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a wider tweezer area.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This epilator is a must have if you want silky smooth legs! Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get use to it so quickly and it is so worth it! I love it!</li>
            <li> A few days later when the hair follicles grow back, skin is bumpy with in growth. Waxing is way better.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it still hurts. But this little guy makes it go by faster, and it seems to hurt less than other epilators I&#x27;ve tried. There is no magic, pain-free solution. But if you can handle the sting, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been using emjoi for 10+ years.  There isn&#x27;t a complete elimination of shaving, but I only have to shave once a week.  I could go out in the summer and wear a pair of shorts after 3-4 days of shaving and not have to worry about hairy legs.  Before I used emjoi I had thick dark hair on my legs and it look as though I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs.  When my legs hit water they were like a chia pet!  Not fun or sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used emjoi were uncomfortable and time consuming, but the more I used it and the slower the hair started growing back reduced the amount of time I spent shaving. Your legs do get use to using emjoi if you use it consistently and it is well worth a little bit of discomfort (in the beginning) for long term results.</li>
            <li> After having this product for 6 months I feel like I can write a good review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I did a TON of research before finally committing to buy an epilator at all. I&#x27;m so glad I went with this one! I specifically wanted an epilator for use under my arms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, the noise was a little intimidating, but no longer! It did and does not hurt at all, it merely feels like someone gently tugging at my skin. I use this epilator daily (only because I cannot STAND feeling anything but baby butt smooth under my arms and due to my very quick hair growth and hairs having different growth cycles, it is necessary for my sanity). When I first used it -before my hair had an opportunity to get on different growth schedules- I could go at least a week and a half before seeing any regrowth. I might start trying it on my legs in the future, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with a few passes under my arms after my morning shower and no longer feeling the scratches of razor stubble by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided against getting a rechargeable one as the ones I looked at would not let you use them while plugged in and there were many reviews saying the battery started going bad and not holding a charge after a year or so. The cord honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me since I just use it quickly in the bathroom. Some reviewers had said that the corded ones make it difficult to use the epilator while watching TV, but this cord is pretty long. Mine also came with a sweet little carrying bag (for travel) with a plastic divider inside in the center and a little brush to help clean the tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - love it!</li>
            <li> I had this machine for just over one year before it stopped working - given that this is one of the more expensive epilators, I was expecting something a little more durable.  After 12 months, the adaptor stopped consistently providing power to the unit and it would start and stop depending on the angle I was holding the unit.  So I ordered a new adaptor for about $20.  Then within about 3 months, the rotating blades would periodically seize up and jam, even though there was nothing caught in them and I would clean it after every use.  The jams became more and more frequent until it was perpetually jammed and I couldn&#x27;t even use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a cheaper and simpler model - my old Braun Epilady lasted over 8 years (and still works, just too slowly to be effective).  Will be getting a single-head model next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Emjoi Golf for years and loved it.  I felt it needed to replaced after more than 5 years and thought the AP-18 would be even better.  NO!  It breaks off the hair at the surface and three days later it looks like I never epilated.  I&#x27;m pas the return date (my bad) and really wished I hadn&#x27;t thrown away my old Emjoi Gold with enthusiasm when I opened this beast.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing I can say about how painful this thing is in the beginning that hasn&#x27;t been said, so let&#x27;s just get that out of the way. It does get better after a few uses, I promise! I have hair issues, and I cannot tolerate stubble!! This thing has been a life saver. I use it everywhere. I touch up my legs maybe once a week, facial area once every couple of weeks, underarms once a month but I stay on top of my bikini like because I absolutely cannot tolerate stubble there. Hair grows back thinner and much more manageable. I looooovvveeee this product!!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this, although I wish the instructions on how to actually use were better explained. It is still taking me awhile to figure out, to get all removed. I feel this is a good product and I am happy with the service. Jane</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new emjoi product since my old one broke after a long time of use.  I am pleased with the new product</li>
            <li> This item works well and so far we are quite satisfied with it. No complaints. Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;Would reorder a similiar product.</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s a little early for me to be posting this review, as I just ordered this yesterday on my Prime account. For one, they offered FREE one-day shipping so I literally received it in less than 24 hours. For two, this thing is an absolute GODSEND. A little background on me, I have very pale strawberry blonde fuzz ALL OVER my body. My butt, stomach, arms, low back, sideburns…It&#x27;s just freaking everywhere. I&#x27;ve always been insecure about it, but usually it&#x27;s not really an issue unless I&#x27;m laying out in my bikini. My mom swore by the old school epilators, but according to her they were incredibly painful. I never really looked into it until I started getting some tattoos. Over time I got more comfortable with the pain of tattooing, and I knew this thing couldn&#x27;t hurt that bad. So I finally broke down and ordered it, after comparing several products and their corresponding reviews. That being said, I can&#x27;t compare this to any of it&#x27;s competitors or even to other Emjoi models. But I can compare it to my before furry body and my after, and I am VERY happy with the results. So far, I have done my butt cheeks, low back, stomach and the center of my chest, my sideburns, chin, and upper lip (the face being VERY fine blond hair, hardly discernible). I haven&#x27;t done my arms or legs yet because I shave both, and have to let the hair grow out a little. The most painful spots were the very center of my stomach up to my chest bone and my low back. I made sure to pull the skin as taut as possible, like other reviewers and the instructions recommended, and that definitely helped. Also, on the more painful spots I would go over quickly a couple of times, so the pain was in short bursts rather than constant. Then, once I&#x27;d removed some of it and I was getting it totally smooth, the pain would subside as there was less and less hair to go over. The blond hairs on my upper lip are pretty short, so I couldn&#x27;t get them all (plus I have a monroe piercing above one side and didn&#x27;t feellike taking it out) so I&#x27;m thinking I might purchase the face model specifically for this purpose. I also think I read that the fine hairs are harder to get and I definitely had to go over spots more than once. But honestly - who freaking cares that it&#x27;s not one swipe and done? This thing is a godsend. I give it my full endorsement. Oh, and a word of advice for the pain: When I&#x27;m getting tattoos I do yogic breathing and hum quietly and constantly to myself, like an OM for those of you who have been to yoga LOL. For some reason it makes the pain bearable for me. I didn&#x27;t really find that I needed it for this, but you might try it if you&#x27;ve got a low pain tolerance. Happy hair removal!!!</li>
            <li> The machine is not very efficient, it takes a long time to clean the hair. It is very expensive for the poor performance. Not bad enough to return it,but I would not recommend it .</li>
            <li> I love this product. My friend bought this item and I tried it and I liked it. I decided to buy the item and now I love it. I had bought nono, creams, shave, wax and none of these did meet my expectation. This Emjoi is the best.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using an epilator, but after buying it and taking the risk, I&#x27;m glad I did you will be too</li>
            <li> I like it! It makes my life easier. It saves me time and money. I never thought I would be this happy :)</li>
            <li> Minor discomfort the first time, but considering I did almost every area, it wasn&#x27;t at all as I had expected. The cautions about ingrown hairs are warranted. I am careful to exfoliate and I took the advice about also buying a Mr Tweezerman to remove the hairs that get stuck. I love this Emjoi, though, for the ease of use and the improved appearane of my legs, not to mention how nice it is not to have to shave. I haven&#x27;t picked up my razor since it arrived!  I&#x27;m 60 years old and I wish I had started using this machine years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one purchased. I use it for my entire body. Does a great job and pain level is low!</li>
            <li> This is Samuel M&#x27;s wife speaking:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS EPILATOR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been epilating for over ten years, and this is my fourth epilator. One broke after 8 years, one broke immediately, and my third one was broken by the TSA after they searched my bag. I wanted to find one that was going to be effective and last a long time. This one is so fast because of the 72 tweezer head. I also thought I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with the cord b/c I had a cordless one prior to this one. But, because the cord they provide is long, it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent, I loved it the minute I got it.!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of Emjoi epilators over the years.  All have had the tweezer head design, though my previous ones were gold plated (no idea why).  This particular model basically has two heads and the tweezers go opposite directions.  That seemed like a good plan.  However, I&#x27;ve found that the head is too big to use effectively anywhere but my legs and arms.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something for the underarm or bikini areas, this is not it.  Also, my previous models were able to remove very short hair.  That does not seem to be the case with this one.  Overall I&#x27;m disappointed.  I will say that this is the least painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever used though!</li>
            <li> got broken after 4-5 months of use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hair removal creams for years but recently they have begun to irritate my skin (even when following the box instructions). So I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. At first, it was a little intimidating because I remember the pain when I first started tweezing my eyebrows. The first time I used the epilator I only took off a few hairs then put it away while trying to get up my nerve. A few days later I got up my nerve, after looking on youtube to find out how to use it properly, and decided to try it again. This time I felt no pain and it worked really well. I had no trouble with skin irritation either. My advice would be to use the epilator as soon as you get out of the shower or bath which seems to eliminate the pain since your pores are still open. This process also worked well when I was using the creams which helped the hair to remove easier. Also, be sure to keep your skin taut and don&#x27;t push it down hard on your skin. Just glide it across lightly in different directions for the best results. I can&#x27;t wait to throw away my cream hair removers.</li>
            <li> So I have used this product for about 2-3 months now and I am very disappointed with how it works. First of it hurts like hell and it darkens my skin which I don&#x27;t like. Sometimes it hurts my skin and leaves light scars on it. I tried to cope up with it but I can&#x27;t. The reason I bought this one is because I wanted to do my job on my own and in less time. But it takes so much of time. I din&#x27;t believe it takes so much of time when I read other reviews. But it actually does. It does not remove all the hair at once. We have spend so much of time on it. For my both legs and arms, it takes more than an hour which is very disappointing. And the hair starts growing in a couple of days and that irritates you a lot. I would never ever recommend. It would be a waste of money, time, effort and patience.</li>
            <li> great product. wife loves it</li>
            <li> Very fine (leg) hairs tend to just break instead of being pulled out by the root, so stubble in a day or two. Works great on thicker hair, such as underarms. Additional tweezers make this work faster than other epilators with fewer heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and less painful but as all the other products it causes ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;double tweezer head make the job easy but ingrown hairs look ugly</li>
            <li> This is by far the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve been epilating for six years now, and owned four different epilators from three different manufacturers, the Emjoi - Emagine is my favorite. It&#x27;s a little noisier than some,  and I really thought I&#x27;d miss the light that&#x27;s found on many others, but these are both non-issues. The Emagine is able to remove hair much faster, more efficiently, and somehow with less pain. Yes lady&#x27;s, I&#x27;m sorry to say, but even after removing hair for six years there&#x27;s still a little discomfort.  Furthermore, the rotating tweezers of many other epilators will grab, pinch, or really irritate the skin if you don&#x27;t ensure that its pulled tight.  (underarm for example) I&#x27;ve never had this problem with the Emagine.&lt;br /&gt; Finally, this epilator is much easier to clean. Without all the nooks and crannies found on others, less hair and peach fuzz gets into the head, making cleanup a breeze.</li>
            <li> I really did my homework before purchasing this product. I hunted all over Amazon, hair forums, and general google searches. Even though I had a gut feeling it might not be the best one for me I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation of 72 tweezing heads. Prior to this I had been using an Epilady Legend (I had it for 4 years before I thought it was becoming less efficient), so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll cut to the chase, it didn&#x27;t get the short hairs on my leg. I think the hair lifting bar in the middle of it actually hinders its performance. I did exfoliate my skin (twice) to ensure my pores were open (employed the hair dryer technique when my skin cooled off, as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT use this on my bikini line as the large head on it doesn&#x27;t lend itself to capturing the hair on anything beyond a relatively flat surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rather loud (compared to my old epilator), but it is said to have a very powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it was somewhat less painful than my old epilator, but that is a sort of a moot point considering everything it left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had incredibly high hopes for this epilator, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions: exfoliated, dried, made my chin and upper lip taut. My face has been scraped and the hair remains. This product may work for underarms and bikini areas but I wouldn&#x27;t know. I wanted the item to remove hair from my upper lip and chin. This product is terrible for it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Used another brand in the past that took FOREVER, but the Emjoi is so quick with minimal discomfort.  Good-bye razors!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have been using depilatory for ten years and this one is light yet powerful.  I have two or three hairs in each pore so shaving only makes things worse, have stubble &amp; grow back faster.  After using this for so many years i actually have places where the hair is not growing anymore without doing laser treatments.  This is just as good as waxing, expect in the hard to reach places so i use it mostly for underarms and the lower half of my leg.  I have tried it on thighs too but too hard to do the back of my thighs or bikini.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator, which also has the wireless option, works a lot better and appeared to be more powerful this this product .</li>
            <li> This is the best epilator - and I&#x27;ve used two other brands over the years. It&#x27;s fast with great coverage. I sadly got it caught in a piece of clothing and it no longer works. But after years of use, I&#x27;m buying the same kind again. It really is the best. Until my clothing snafu, I never had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> I just got the epilator in the mail yesterday.  This thing is amazing!  Look no further this is the best thing since sliced bread...    LOL really I am So pleased with this item.  The only thing I would change is that I wish it was cordless.  But honest I am thrilled!    Gina   California</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing and decided to get the best of the best, which the Emjoi was considered to be by most reviewers.  I did everything that people suggested: take a shower first to open the pores, no lotion beforehand, maybe shave the day before so you&#x27;re pulling shorter hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, even growing my leg hairs long didn&#x27;t help.  The Emjoi just wouldn&#x27;t grab my hairs.  I&#x27;m a blonde and perhaps my hairs are too fine to get a hold of but whatever the reason, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It broke my hairs off instead of pulling out so I returned it and am now back to shaving, boo!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT  LOVE IT LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and does the job that I want it to do.  I have a little one&lt;br /&gt;and used it every day but now with this one I can go days.  Never&lt;br /&gt;used one on my legs but have tried this one and I am amazed at&lt;br /&gt;the job it does</li>
            <li> The double heads on this epilator are the charm.  I have spent my way through at least four other epilators over the years - all with single heads.  One round with the Emjoi AP-18 and I&#x27;m a believer.  My facial hair is gone in three or four strokes as compared to the several minutes a single headed epilator could take.  This heavyweight takes the gold.</li>
            <li> For the ones who are tough enough to epilate instead of shaving, this machine is it. I have been using the Braun Silk Epil for many, many years, which was already a good epilator. I tried the Panasonic, which didn&#x27;t work for me. The price was outragous and its performance is unsatisfying. I&#x27;m usually not always the one who thinks the more you spend the better is the quality. But here it was worth it. Epilating used to take forever but with the Emjoi AP-18 and its 72 tweezers, I&#x27;m out of the bathroom within 15-20 minutes for legs, bikini zone and arm pits. I&#x27;m very happy with the Emjoi AP-18.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll  never shave again thanks to this it is very loud but it gets rid of the hair. It hurts  obviously but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have a medium pain tolerance but to read some reviews that state, &amp;#34;not bad, feels like a pinch or you get used to it&amp;#34; are a massive understatement. this hurts so bad, I can only do a small area at a time and then quit... for like a week before I try again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and does a great job at pulling most of the hairs out, diffinitely would recommend to buy it!!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD. USING IS FROM LAST ONE YEAR WITHOUT ANY COMPLAIN. IT WORKES PERFECTLY AND MAINTAINED GOOD CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;WILL RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and I must say that I love it -- on certain areas of my body. While it&#x27;s too big for brows, I use it for my upper lip and I&#x27;M IN LOVE. Seeing as how it cost me around 8.00 to get my upper lid threaded every week, this will pay for itself faster than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain aspect of an epilator is what terrified me the most. After reading reviews, I noted that I should pull my skin taught where ever I was epilating and that seemed to do the trick! The pain I experienced on my upper lip was MINIMAL compared to threading. As for my legs, I did experience a lot of severe red bumps around my ankles the first time I used this, but they faded after two days and I haven&#x27;t gotten them again; I did not use epilating cream/lotion on my legs or lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I&#x27;ve noticed that the epilator misses a few hairs on my legs sometimes. It&#x27;s not a big deal to me though, as I prefer this over shaving, cutting myself, and worrying about scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the cord is super long, it makes for an easy sitting session in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> As a newbie with sensitive skin and coarse hair, I find epilating painful, but the results worth it. This is best epilator I have ever used, and I find this effective on the face as well as the body. However, this is not foolproof -- I thought that because it stops when it touches my skin, it could not burn me if I applied strong pressure repeatedly. Wrong. This is also stated on the instruction manual, but it can be easy to miss. All in all, I do think this is the best hair removal technique I&#x27;ve tried so far: shaving would not only leave black dots, but a shadow and ingrown hair, waxing was expensive and messy, and laser hair removal was costly and only semi-permanent. This is easy to use, fast, affordable, clean, and effective. The antimicrobial feature is helpful for preventing irritation and ingrown hairs. It is moderately noisy. The cord is not an issue. Cleaning is a breeze. I also find the design attractive. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is my first Epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I looked through all the reviews, compared prices, and made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pain is just a matter of getting used to it. I get a lot of annoying facial hairs - I&#x27;m a hairy person, no way aroun it.  However, I&#x27;m used to plucking on my chin and upperlip. Using this epilator on my chin and lip didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I was used to that type of pain.  However, when I tried to do my arm, it was like putting a lit match on my skin. It worked...but it took a solid week to build up my tolerance to use it for more than a few seconds in some places.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED ENJOI (OPTIMA) FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AM VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH IT!  BUT......IT FINALLY BIT THE DUST AND NOW I&#x27;VE ORDERED &#x27;EMAGINE&#x27; AND CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO GET IT!  IT SOUNDS EVEN BETTER THAN THE OPTIMA AND I&#x27;M LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING OUT!  MY HUSBAND EVEN USES IT TO SHAVE THE KNUCKLES ON HIS HANDS!  GREAT PRODUCT &amp; I HOPE THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT!</li>
            <li> This epilator is great! I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi one before but it didn&#x27;t have as many tweezers, so it took longer and was more painful to use. This one works GREAT. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now and I have nothing bad to say about it. It pulls the hair out quickly and keeps my legs smooth for much longer. The first time you use it, it will hurt but the more and more you use it the less it will hurt and the better the results. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hammacher Schlemmer used to mean quality to me. and possibly a whole lot of other folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a clock for a present and enjoyed it for quite a while. recently it was not functoning properly. I rung up the fine folks at HS and they told me I had to have proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;???? I have a product with the name HS on it and they want proof of sale. I got it as a gift. I donb&#x27;t remember from who or when. but they want proof of sale. remember it still has their name on it. they said I could have bought it from some place else. But Hey, It still HAS THEIR NAME ON IT. Would I buy from them ever? I think you can get the same unit from Oregon scientific</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator the first one I had stop working and decided to try this one. I though it would pick up more hairs since it&#x27;s has a 72 tweezer head but it was just okay. I had to go over the same area a few times just to get the hair and there was still spots of hair left over.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised. Using it is uncomfortable, but I would not go so far as to say it hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my legs are really hairy. I&#x27;ve tried shaving but it only last for a day. You have no idea how fast hair can grow. You&#x27;ll feel them in just half a day and you&#x27;ll have to shave again the next morning. So I let my leg hairs grow and tried waxing. I can tolerate the pain waxing brings but it just cost a lot. It&#x27;s quick and covers all the areas.&lt;br /&gt;Now with this epilator, I thought it would be just like waxing. Pulling hairs from the roots, yes. But the pain is different. IT IS MORE PAINFUL THAN WAXING. I had to clench my teeth and curl my toes just to get through the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair even if you sweep it in a slow one directional way. I just thought with 70+ tweezers it would do wonders but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford waxing, go do that instead of putting yourself in such pain. Anyway I&#x27;m gonna stick with this product and will be back for another review.</li>
            <li> The is the best epilator I have used.  I have tried 3 others and would not go back to any of them!</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators (Emjoi specifically) for over 10 years. This was my 3rd or 4th. I was very excited (and somewhat scared) to use this monster of a machine. But, it seemed to work pretty well...and quickly, I might add. But, after a couple months of use, it decided that the 2 opposing tweezer heads were going to continuously get stuck. They would spin when I first turned it on, but as soon as it came in contact with my skin/hair, they would freeze up. I cleaned the dang thing religiously after each use. So, it wasn&#x27;t that there was a bunch of hair stuck up in it making it clogged. I tried everything!!! Nope. Still won&#x27;t work. My Emjoi epilator before this one was a rechargeable one...and it also decided to stop working. Well, it decided not to hold a charge. So this if fun. Moving on to a different brand now. So long Emjoi! It&#x27;s been a pretty nice past decade with ya. Time to move on to greener pastures, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for something to help with ingrown hairs and was led to epilators.  The Emjoi was a top pick after some research and seemed to offer everything I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve never epilated before and so was hesitant to spend this kind of money on a first-time buy.  But my needs outweighed my concerns about money.  I made the leap and was glad I did.  It was a very good investment.  My course hair was removed very thoroughly and my legs were super smooth.  It also lasts much longer than shaving and when it grows back it grows very sparse and the hair seems somehow finer.  It also works well under the arms and in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hurt a little the first time I used it.  It felt exactly like someone was pulling hair from my legs one at a time.  So if you&#x27;re expecting it to feel like something else you may want to pass this up.  On the bright side it does seem to get better the more I use it.  And it didn&#x27;t take months.  By the third time I was removing hair from areas much faster.  The first time I removed hair was much slower to minimize the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how much it helps with ingrown hairs.  I get them primarily in the bikini area and they still seem to occur.  But i don&#x27;t know if a shaver/epilator can help with that.  I believe that depends on the way certain hair types grow back.  But I do not regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> The only epilator I used before is the classic coil one (my mom got me into it).  I was looking to buy my own, and came across the tweezer .  After a lot of research, this one is the greatest I&#x27;ve seen.  It has 72 tweezer heads and 2 different speeds.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as people complain-- the skin gets used to it and in a minute or so you won&#x27;t feel much.  This epilator gets the job done in such little time!  I used it 2 weeks before my wedding and still had smooth legs on my honeymoon.  It does not pull at the skin at all.  I recommend using it after a warm shower, since the hairs will be pulled out easier and more effectively.  Comes with a cap, a cleaning brush, and a neat drawstring bag!  It&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Epilator on May 4, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I am having great results with my underarms.  Yes it does hurt the first time but so worth it you will forget the pain with the results you get.  I did my underarms on May 5th and this is June 11 and I just had to do touch up work about 4 times in that period.&lt;br /&gt;My legs I&#x27;m having a little problem with a little stubble after Epilation.  I read reviews and I am thinking I am going to fast.  So the next time I Epilate I will go real slow.&lt;br /&gt;Saying that I am 100% pleased with the results I am getting on both my underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise people to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I had been epilating for years but frankly had trouble with how much time it took.  I spent way too long.  My mother offered to help me get a new one that would take me less time.  I did quite a bit of research and found this one.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have a little  guiding light but I don&#x27;t care.  The 72 tweezers all work excellent and cut down on my epilating.  I spend almost as much time as I did when I used to shave many moons ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;ve never epilated before it will likely hurt.  When you epilate for the first time, do little bits at a time because my body had to adjust when I first epilated.  The emjoi did not hurt me at all because my body had been used to epilating for many years.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are on this page because you want to cut down on epilating time and get excellent results... this is the epilator for you!  Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to epilation. Prior to this I was a die hard fan of the Philips Satin Perfect epilator. Based on recommendations though. I decided to give this one a try. The low price made me nervous.. (More expensive is better, right??) I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back to the Philips Epilator again. It was a great epilator, but this one is far superior. The Emjoi AP-18 is the most effective and comfortable epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. The dual heads are extremely efficient and my skin isn&#x27;t piched or pulled. One pass yields as much hair as 2 or 3 passes on my old epilator. It&#x27;s also somewhat quiet. (Comparatively speaking)</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun epilator for over 5 years now and it was time for a new one. After reading reviews on this epilator I purchased it to give it a try. It is terrible, grabs no hair and takes forever. I will be going back to the Braun.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator not quite 2 years ago. It is my third Emjoi epilator, and will likely be my last.  I bought this model because I had been happy with the first 2, and I figured 72 tweezer heads had to be better than 36, since epilating is so time-consuming.  I found that this model was not quite as effective as the other model I had, and it tends to break the hairs off rather than pulling them out.  Now, after less than 2 years, the gears have stripped and it no longer works.  If it had worked better than it did, I would consider just buying a replacement head instead of a whole new epilator, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with the performance of this one, and I am tired of replacing them every year or two, so I think I will try another brand this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two epilators I had were the Emjoi Light Caress 36 tweezer head model.  They worked pretty well (the first one I broke when it got too close to my towel and threads got wrapped up in the gears).  The second broke a year or two after I bought it (plastic gears stripped).  This seems to be a recurring problem with this brand.  This is the only brand I have tried so far, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a brand issue or a problem with epilators in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s still better than shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epillator, read the high reviews and opted for this one.  Comes with a neat bag(for ice?) And helpful instructioms. I dont see the dual speeds working very well, as in no difference. It tears out hair o.k. my lower legs it doesnt do a darned thing but irritate my skin. Upper thigh area it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hind sight I wouldnt pay the $80. Its a mediocre product for a pretty penny. In my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, which I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of months.  So maybe I need to learn some tricks, but I keep getting a fair amount of hair remaining after using it. They are mostly around uneven spots, like the knees and shinbone, and are usually pretty fine.  And, the results only seem to last about 1 week.</li>
            <li> I like it. I do wish it was not as loud and that it had an adapter that came with it for harder to reach areas but it did its job and thats all i can ask for. I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products like this for years (10+), it&#x27;s my fourth device, and I waxed before that. I don&#x27;t usually have pain when removing hair and found the same with the emagine.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Emjoi - it&#x27;s powerful even when cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating using the emagine is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate it the highest of all of my devices for removing hair from the bikini area. It also seems to be less irritating than my previous devices.&lt;br /&gt;Great device, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After my old epilator&#x27;s sudden death I decided to give this one a try. I love it! My old one only had 20 tweezers, so this one was a awesome upgrade. You still have to go over the area more than once, but it does the job and such a time saver. I&#x27;ll be recommending this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> It has helped me under arms darkness. I dont agree with people who say in ten minutes they are done with both legs, it takes much longer eventhough I have laser half of them (have almost no hair from my knee to the bottom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to pass it several times so all your hair dissapear. It is paintfull but you get used to it (weird!).</li>
            <li> It stated 6 weeks before hair would grow back. My hair grew back in 9 days.  I am Swedish decent so I do not have thick hair.  I take good care of my health and I know that from taking vitamin supplements my (head) hair grows fast so maybe this had something to do with my leg hair growing fast.  The item is easy to use and not painful, but you are better of shaving.  Plus my hair did not grow back evenly.  I had little hairs grow back right away and the rest grew back in 9 days. So NOW I have to wait till my hair grows back evenly before I can use the item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned numerous epilator products and this worked the worst.  It pulled few hairs and broke many hairs leaving stubble.  this product was totally inadequate.</li>
            <li> Virtually no discomfort, easy to use and clean, and worth every penny I spent.  I bought the corded type as I am certain it will last for many years.  The cord does not hinder the ability to use it all over. Letting it glide over your skin lightly works best.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.  I use it everywhere on my body.  Typically I had to shave my legs daily...but now I use the Emjoi about once a week or every 10 days or so.  The first time is painful...but no worse than waxing.  Then the pain diminishes with each use.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product. Doesn&#x27;t take out as many hairs as it says.  Not consistent in terms of grabbing hairs. Just disappointed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a hairy girl, but I am very fair skinned, so when I shave, the fast regrowth is pretty noticeable.  I have spent the majority of my hair removal days shaving, but have waxed on occasion too.  I just found waxing to be too pricey, and I&#x27;m not really skilled enough to do it myself and do a good job.  I did a LOT of research on epilators before I decided on the Emjoi Emagine.  The Emjoi Emagine is one of the larger models; it has 72 tweezer heads that rotate to pick up and pluck out hair from the root.  I purchased it from Amazon.com for close to $70.00.  While I find that expensive, I figured that once I bought several packs of replacement razors or a few trips to the salon for waxing, this thing pretty much paid for itself and would inevitably save me money.  I read so many good reviews and did research on how to prepare your skin for epilation (by exfoliating!).  I thought this was going to be the end all be all to my hair removal needs.  I was super psyched when I received it and waited until after I showered and exfoliated to try it out.  I was apprehensive about the pain because in general, many people said it was quite painful.  Having had two tattoos and recently given birth, I figured it would be a walk in the park.  I was surprised at how it really was painful.  Nowhere near childbirth on my pain scale, but it made my eyes water and it wasn&#x27;t something I ever really got used to.  I used the epilator on my legs, underarms and bikini line.  Holy Toledo, my first run at my underarms was AWFUL.  It hurt so bad, and the ache/sting didn&#x27;t go away when I was done.  It was a good 24-48 hours before my pits felt back to normal.  But they were smooth!  To my amazement, my bikini line was the least painful area I epilated.  While I didn&#x27;t expect to have 100% hair removal (I was prepared after reading reviews), I was fairly satisfied with the results.  Plus I figured it would get better the more I did it.  I did a touch-ups every couple of days and had little to no regrowth for about a week.  I have been exfoliating nearly every day during my shower to prevent ingrown hairs.  However, within the last few days the hair on my legs has started to come back with a vengeance.  My legs LOOK and FEEL terrible.  They are itchy, red, bumpy, and irritated.  I can see little black dots where the hair is trying to grow back.  Between the redness, bumps, and black, my legs look even worse than they did when I was shaving.  I am now concerned that it will take my legs a LONG time to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; if they do at all.  I am extremely disappointed with the results from the Emjoi Emagine Epilator.  When I did research prior to purchasing this, I did see a handful of reviewers who noted a similar [bad] experience like mine, but I figured I wouldn&#x27;t end up being one of those, but naturally I did.  I have followed the instructions to a T and even taken great care in exfoliating and keeping my legs moisturized.  I can&#x27;t say I did anything wrong, it just did not work for me.  Unfortunately I will be returning this item and going back to shaving with my razor.  While I won&#x27;t get smooth legs for a week at a time, at least I won&#x27;t have unsightly and painful legs for days on end.ays and had little to no regrowth for about a week.

            <li> I love this product.  I have had three in the past and I like this one better than the others.  You have to angle it a bit different because of the two rotating springs.  But it definitely does a great job.  I only have to shave my legs once every two weeks.  That is a blessing because I am so busy most of the time and I don&#x27;t have time to shave every two to three days.  And when your leg hair grows back, you can barely see it.  The first time I used an epilator it did hurt. But after you get through the initial time, it will be different. And each time you shave, you will see less hair that needs to be removed. Definitely worth the price!!  I am saving a fortune on shavers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your time and money on this product........it cut up my skin, leaving me all red and marked up for days afterwards and wasn&#x27;t even effective!!! To top it all off, it really HURTS too!! I did completely read the user guide prior to use, to make sure I was using it correctly..... Just completely unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I AM ONLY USING IT FOR MY LEGS!!! and even that doesnt take all my hair out! its still a little stuby the first use. its very painful underarms and bikini line. and I tried it more than once and the pain feels the same.I washed the area before with hot water and exfoliating scrub just to minimize as much pain as possible.....and it still hurts really bad. it has a pinching touch on legs but its not that bad. Under my arms feels like fire and im not being melodramatic. This 72 tweezers is really fast even on the lowest setting(they just have two diff.settings)and it sounds loud and scary.my hair wasnt even long. like 1mm. and i dont think it gets anything shorter than that,because my legs are still stubby from one use.Overall, it made everything but my legs have bleed spots and im scared that i might get ingrown hairs now!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why, but i can&#x27;t angle this thing right so that both sides of the tweezers touch my skin. i usually end up having just one side touch so it&#x27;s no different from a regular 36 tweezer epilator, other than the fact that i can&#x27;t see what i&#x27;m doing. sometimes i see a hair and i go over it like 50 times and i still can&#x27;t get it. my skin goes freaking RAW man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was trying to upgrade from the [...]k but i eventually just went back. i feel bad throwing this emjoi in the trash but it might have to happen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product with more tweezers doesn&#x27;t work as good as my older one that had less tweezers..It is ok product but not fantastic.</li>
            <li> After many years of reliable use I needed to replace my epilator. Naturally, I replaced it with the same brand I have been using for decades, an Emjoi. This epilator is not only reliable, it is easy to use and performs its job well.</li>
            <li> hair stays gone for 2+ weeks</li>
            <li> I bought a second one after I broke the first one by accident... goes to show you how much I like using this product. I think it&#x27;s well worth the investment for those who doesn&#x27;t really like to shave and/or wax. It does a great job in getting the soft baby hair and the stubborn one too. What more can you ask for?! I especially like this product b/c it&#x27;s not battery operated.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;PAINFUL looking leg hair plucker&amp;#34; for my wife because the other ones motor just overheated and stopped working. Could have been she overloaded it with TOO much leg hair, but who knows. The other one lasted 3 years. She likes this &amp;#34;leg hair plucker&amp;#34; so I bought her another one...</li>
            <li> I bought this item six months ago and today it has suddendly begin making a noise like a car breaking down then it stopped working. The noise continued but the tweesers did not move. It worked well before and I was very happy with it but having spent so much for this I expect it to last a very long time. No so it&#x27;s dead and I have to get another one. I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I cannot say that there were any products better than this, but I can believe there are some better ones out there. Having coarse/thick leg hair is really annoying and no matter how close the blade would be to my skin, i could still see the roots of the hairs under than thin layer. I got this and used it right away, but the pain made it to the point where it took about 3 days to get all the hair out of my legs. It went good until suddenly these red bumps started appearing. I used lotion, and creams to calm it down, but it was no use. It didn&#x27;t go away for about a week! It&#x27;d break the hairs to the point that it couldn&#x27;t pick it up anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe sticking to a good traditional/messy wax would be better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male that just hates body hair. I&#x27;ve shaved legs, underarms and chest for years. But thought I&#x27;d try an epilator. After reviewing several makes and models, this came out on top. As someone else said, they make a men&#x27;s model but there really is no difference other then some trim pieces that effect looks and the color. The men&#x27;s  cost more probably due to a limited market. I have a low threshold when it comes to pain. But I was surprised that this was no more than a 2 on a scale of 1-10 pain tolerance. I was able to do my legs in little more time than it takes to shave them. I was really afraid to try the chest hairs but again surprised that I can tolerate it and the pain is no more then maybe a 3. So if I can stand the pain or slight discomfort, so can you. If the discomfort level gets lower as I use this if would be about the same as shaving! I am very happy with the results and the product. Buy this one!</li>
            <li> this i s my 2nd epilator and i have got to say that this is the least painful and most powerful epilator on the market. the cord one does not get on my nerves and it stays super powerful, so i will never go back to a rechargeable or battery EVER again. I cam finally tolerate using this all over my body in one setting without wimping out due to pain or time. I do feel that the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t work the best on its high settings, i feel it skips over or breaks the hair so i just use the lower setting which is still very powerful. also its bulky and makes it hard to use in certain areas but I&#x27;ve managed to do my own Brazilian w/out much trouble. I would definitely recommend it and buy it again! don&#x27;t give up on using it it takes time to figure how to hold your skin just right and the direction of the epilator, sometimes i have to go in ever direction. its super easy to clean as well which i love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****adding on beware of ingrown hairs!!!! if you are like me and have thick, kinda wavy hair that grows with like 2-4 hairs for every follicle i would NOT use this. I had to go to my dermatolgist due to ingrown hairs that got severely infected. she said she doesn&#x27;t want me waxing or shaving bc it has misshaped my hair follicles so the hairs are always going to be ingrown. WTF</li>
            <li> IT IS GREAT FOR YOUR LEGS AND BODY. NOT SO GREAT FOR YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt; MUCH FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY OWNED EMJOI.</li>
            <li> I have used a cheaper epilator for the past two years and I have only been able to epliate the bottom of my legs, but this new one is amazing!!!!  It gets rid of the hair so much quicker, and it is less painful!!  I can&#x27;t believe how much better it is, I used to look at my hairs and then wait for the pain of it being pulled out to know it was gone, but with this one, it is so fast that I thought it wasn&#x27;t getting the hair, but it was, it just didn&#x27;t hurt!  Of course there is some discomfort, especially to new areas, but nothing compared to what I used to feel.  My skin is smooth and I don&#x27;t get all the little red bumps I used to get.  With this I was able to epliate my armpits and bikini area for the first time and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back for 3-4 weeks which is better than my old epilator, it used to come back in 2 weeks (still better than coming back the same day with shaving).  I have dark, thick hair on my legs and armpits, but this worked so well, and it got all the little blonde hairs my old epilator used to leave behind!!  I am so impressed with this product!! It also comes with a little brush to clean it, and a nice white pouch to keep it in, and added bonus!!</li>
            <li> Even though using this product may cause a little discomfort I used this with the Nisim Hair inhibitor and it left my skin smooth and it took the hair longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this and optimistic about the reviews, so am disappointed in its performance.  I give it a 3 rating only because it does remove the surface hair, though painfully slowly and sometimes very painfully.  I see no evidence that it is an epilator.  My hair grows back at the same rate it always did and still need to shave weekly.  I consider it an expensive electric razor for legs.  I do not recommend using on the face.  I did once and had an ugly abrasion on my chin for weeks afterwards.  It took off my skin but not the hair.</li>
            <li> THis is one of the best epilators I have ever used. I have been using epilators x over 20 years, I have used emjoi brands long ago and more recently Braun, Phillips, etc.  I find that this epilator does what they say, it takes far less time and gets all my hair out, for the first time ever I can go 2 weeks or more before shaving again, no more in-grown hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic wet/dry E5 WD51, I wanted to try it in the shower, which I did a few times, then I just found it easier to shave them dry again. The Panasonic left a lot of hair behind esp. the day after I shaved I noticed them. Maybe this would be a good one to start with since you have a barrier of running water and soap to get used to it?&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor!!</li>
            <li> Awful. Does not work nearly as well as my thirty dollar cheapo version and removes almost no hair at all. I returned this and bought an eighty dollar Braun, which is SO much better.</li>
            <li> I need to buy the accessories for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t see it here.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt that much and really did a great job.</li>
            <li> This product works just the same as if I got a wax at the salon. It takes about 30-40 min. and I am hair free (this includes my face and legs). Usually, if I don&#x27;t have money to go get a wax I have to jeans or long skirts until I can go, but now I have this machine at my house whenever I need to tend to my body hair. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Yes my wife seems to like it I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints, except when the dog chewed the cord but after a little solder and tape its all good.</li>
            <li> This epilator definitely works and manages to quickly remove all hair in any chosen spot. However, I recomend not using it on smaller parts of skin, like face (upper lip, eyebrows). Easily cleaned, all around good product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all! so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Well just came in and at first I thought it had cut me, well read then instructions again. It depends on the position, yeah right still hurts, Gives the impression of razors cutting you, my skin is red so I stop using it, not Good!! The seller was fast in sending too Bad the product wasn&#x27;t Good , so Bad Product Good Seller!!! Sorry Guys that&#x27;s The truth !!!</li>
            <li> This is my second emjoi. The first was the original one and it was great. This one takes longer to finish the job and does not pick light, short hair.</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi was fading fast so I bought this to replace it.  It works great.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and my skin remains smooth and hair free for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I have been depilating for over 15 years.  I have used many different appliances.  This product is POWERFUL.  I feel I have met my match!  It may be wise to keep searching if you are a first time user or if noise is a problem for you.  It has a rather loud motor but it is thorough.  Models that are cordless tend to lose their strength so this was a good choice for me.  The heads rotate away from each other and get every hair regardless of direction of growth.It is very comfortable to hold and is fast .  This is what makes it so good.  A beginner can get used to it by using the slower speed and depilating small sections at a time.  I could wish for a bright light on the device so that I may see the hairs better.  My particular device caused mild scratches on my skin.  This was due to a small burr on the rotating disc.  I used a nail file to smooth it down and now it is fine.  I would highly recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. I read a reviews on a lot of epilator brands before I decided on this. I am not disappointed. It is just so much faster and easier than any other methods of hair removal. It did not hurt quite as much as I expected it to hurt. Especially in the underarm area. It hurt a little bit the first time. But the pains decreases with every use. Now I hardly feel it. I dont think you can expect any less pain if you are planning to pull out your hairs by its roots.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and first time i used it hurts like crazy! After a week i decide to give it another try. I noticed if i used it just after i take a shower when my pores are open works better and don&#x27;t pull too much. Also when using it don&#x27;t try to do it a little and tke it away from your legs because it hurts. I realized that if i do it like shaving my legs with a electric razor close to the skin won&#x27;t hurt that much.The only problem is that if your hair is not long enough it won&#x27;t work. When starts growing back my legs are a little prickly like when i shave but the hair grows thinner not as coarse. I did my armpits and was surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt as much. I would give it 5 stars but i realized i have to buy another gadget for my facial hair. It&#x27;s not working at all, maybe because my facial hair is shorter and thinner? i&#x27;m not really sure but is better than shaving and having the hair showing after less than 24 hours. At least with this i&#x27;ll do it once a week.</li>
            <li> I have used several kinds of epilators, home wax kits, gotten professionally waxed etc for over 20 years.  I had used the Braun for several years and loved it, but like many other users, was frustrated with how long it took to epilate my legs.  I have exceptionally hairy legs with very dark course hair and it would take a total of 4 hours to clear my legs of hair with the Braun, if they were super hairy.  Like others have mentioned, the braun clears every single hair, whereas the emjoi, clears ALMOST every hair. (I think it might be because the emojoi breaks a few hairs off instead of pulling them.)  If you want that perfectly shaved feel, you would have to spend hours with the braun.  For me, I can use the emjoi in about 1/4 the time, and the time savings is definitely worth the few tiny hairs that remain.  I will also mention here that because your hair grows at different rates, the first time you clear your legs, whether it be with waxing or epilating, because all of the hairs have grown out, your legs will be much more smooth, and remain smooth for a longer period than subsequent epilations.  Therefore, just like with shaving, you have to deal with needing to re-epilate in a few days if you want that perfect smooth surface.  Personally, I can live with not being 100% hair free, so I epilate about once a week.  That is the best system for me.  If I let it go two weeks or more, then epilating becomes much more uncomfortable as you are pulling out so many hairs.  Plus it takes so much longer.  If you really want smooth legs, and you could afford it, I would suggest buying botht he emjoi and the braun.  I would clear the majority of hairs with the fast emjoi and then go over it again with the braun.  I haven&#x27;t done this personally, as I mentioned, I will tolerate less than smooth legs.  I do have a few additional suggestions for those of you who haven&#x27;t used an epilator before.  I had waxed for years, using both professional waxers and a home waxing kit.  But because of a terrible experience with the old &amp;#34;epilady&amp;#34; of the 1990&#x27;s I was literally terrified to try to epilate.  I finally broke down and bought a braun after my south american neighbor told me how much better it was than the epilady.  But I was still scared, and it sat in my closet for months after purchasing it. Finally, I did it, and it really was nothing as bad as the old epilady, but that could have been due to the fact that I had been waxing all those years.  If you have never epilated before, I STRONGLY suggest getting just breaking down and paying a one time cost of getting waxed by a professional just once before you start to epilate.  If you do that, then just a few hairs will grow back at first, and you can epilate them out without the torture of tearing ALL of them out at once.  I have done it both ways many times.  Especially when I had the braun, I as a working mom, I just wouldn&#x27;t have 4 hours to devote to it, so my leg hairs would grow and grow and grow. Even for me, after all those years of waxing, epilating ALL the hairs at once is really terrible.  So my biggest advice is keep up with it and you will love it.  For me, this is much easier to do with the faster emjoi.  No matter which brand you buy, if you do it at least once a week, it will go fairly easily.  I epilate everything with the emjoi, legs, arms, tummy, mustache, underarms, and a pretty close (but not crazy) bikini line.  And it takes me a total of only about 30-40 minutes with the emjoi if I do it once a week.  It would take longer if let the hair grow.  I can&#x27;t imagine how long the braun would take to do all of that.  It took 4 hours just to do the legs, but again, I often had let it go so long that my legs were really hairy.  I LOVED the emjoi at first.  It was SOOOOO much faster than the braun.  But the problem is, that it stops working after a while.  This is in fact the second emjoi I have bought.  And I will probably buy another one somewhat begrudgingly.  I loved the braun too, but it just took too long.  I will also mention that I am prone to ingrown hairs.  One thing that has really helped me is to use a loofah both before and after epilating.  I also try and do a quick loofah every time I am in the shower.  Your legs will never be as smooth as shaving with epilating.  (But they will actually be smother than waxing which may surprise you.  The epilators get many more of the tiny hairs than waxing does and fewer of them break.)  I could never go back to shaving at this point.  My hairs are so course that they are almost sharp when shaved.  But with either epilating or waxing, the hair is obviously pulled out completely, so when they do grow back, the end is a fine tip that isn&#x27;t nearly as irritating.  In the end, I do recommend both the emjoi and the braun, as well as the Clean and Easy home waxing kit.  Which is the one I used for years and was mostly happy with.  If you are going to home wax, it is by far the best.  For me, the time savings of the emjoi justifies me having to purchase a new one every year or so.</li>
            <li> results are great, chin hairs are disappearing, upper lip....hurts, but eventually I get them off.  Someone needs to invent a way to get rid of body hair permanently--this is no fun...but certainly is tolerable in some places.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading comments and researching epilators, before buying the Emjoi - a brand I hadn&#x27;t used before. I&#x27;m afraid after a month of use and some considerable damage to my armpits I&#x27;m going to be sending it back to the manufacturers - regardless of getting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine blonde hair, but with the Emjoi you have to cover the same area of skin on your legs 8-10 times to pick up all hairs. That is fristrating and time consuming. Cheaper brands by Phillips etc doa much better job.&lt;br /&gt;But the head on the Emjoi is just too big for my armpits (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and not exactly slight). It grabs at the skin and fails to get to half of the hairs. No bleeding, but bruising and trouble wearing deo-dorant for hte next couple of days. And still hairy.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not for me. And I have to question the real source of so many glwoing reviews for the product on this site.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi optima for about 10 years before it finally gave out. I figured since it was such a great product, I&#x27;d purchase the Emjoi AP-18. I find it really strange to say this, but this tweezer is far less painful than the Emjoi Optima. I don&#x27;t know if its because this model has 72 tweezer heads, but I find it way easier using this model. Plus, those 72 tweezer heads cut the hair removal process in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using an epilator ever and I was a little nervous about buying one for such a high price . The product was totally worth it though , it works quickly and you may have to do it several times to get all the hair , but it keeps hair away for at least two weeks. I am not gonna lie if you use it on your bikini line it will hurt badly ,but after the first few times the pain is minimal . All together the product is better to me because I would get horrible blood blister from waxing and the worst thing you get from this is that it may cause slight bleeding on spots with coarse hair. A lot of people have been complaining about ingrown hairs , but I have only had one or two because I purchased the lotion that is recommend for the product .</li>
            <li> The epilator is not working as it did when I first received it. After only a few months and only a few uses it no longer pulls out my hairs easily. Instead it takes much longer to cover the same area and often never pulls out all the hairs. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Perhaps mine was defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/2014: Recently, I have found that the epilator teeth lock up and make a loud sound when I have used it for more than 2 minutes. The only way to stop it is to turn it off and manually turn the rotating epilator unit. This happens frequently and makes it really difficult to epilate any body part. I&#x27;ve noticed this happens more frequently the longer I have had this. Now, it is unusable. It locks up within a minute and even when I manually turn the epilator to unlock it, when I restart it, it happens within seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this epilator.  I&#x27;ve had several in the past.  Almost a year to the day, the head has to be replaced.  This didn&#x27;t happen with the Optima.  Now I need to go to the company website and order the replacement for $24.95 + tax + shipping and its out of stock!!!  I&#x27;ll be waiting over 2 weeks for the head to come...</li>
            <li> This works really well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It does hurt at first, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s no big deal. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter got me this one to replace my epilator that I&#x27;ve had for a number of years, and was no longer giving me as good a &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like this one very much.  Gave me a much nicer result.  Love my Emjoi  as it is safer than shaving, and it does not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; like they did when they first came on the market way back.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the prompt delivery sevice of the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual....  as well with the product, everything was as specified. The item was received 2 or 3 days earlier than expected which was great. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product or not for it was not working very well for me. I tried using it again about 3 days later, and to my surprise I love it. It took awhile to get the hang of using it but so far I am very satisfied with it. How long it will be before I have to use it again, well I do not know! I have used other brands which all said 6 weeks in between usages,  that was not true, for me it was  every 3 days and the hair on my face is not course or thick. I&#x27;m hoping this time it is 6 weeks in between usages like it says.  I will be giving this item a 4 star rating,  if it is six weeks before I have to use it again then I will give it a 10 star rating.</li>
            <li> I think for speed, this is an okay epilator, but it doesn&#x27;t work that much faster and it really doesn&#x27;t grasp small hairs. You will have to wait for hair to grow long enough and you will have to use this often, consistently and after several weeks of using this for 45 minutes or longer sessions, you will find that the hair is sparser and less course. I think it feels rough and don&#x27;t like it for bikini area. This is such a long process to go through if you want to get to not shaving anymore. I like the Gently Gold better. It is much easier on the skin. The head on the Emjoi feels very rough and uncomfortable,</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few epilators over the years and I must say I was a little disappointed in this one.  I guess I expected that since it had so many more tweezers than than my Emjoi Emagine that it would be faster and miss less hairs.  It works, but it takes quite a few swipes over the same spot to make it catch all the little missed hairs.  I do still prefer using the epilator over the razor, but don&#x27;t expects baby smooth skin in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi would not work when I received it.  It seems the cord must have had a short, and the device would not stay running long enough to make using it possible.  Although I received free shipping when I purchased the device, I had to pay $10 to return it.  I didn&#x27;t receive anything for the $10 I had to spend to return it, just to get my refund.  Seems unfair to charge shipping to customers to return something when we are sent a defective product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used an epilator for more than 10 years. I have a Braun that is beginning to age and slow down so I ordered this one. First, it is great for longer hair and areas that have been ignored or never had epilation before. For the areas that are regularly groomed it does a poor job of grabbing the shorter hairs. even when you pass over the area repeatedly it misses the hairs. I am considering returning it for rather than having to use two to complete the job. It is very comfortable. It makes removing hair from new areas nearly pain free.</li>
            <li> Having used an epilator for many years, this is my 3rd or 4th one.  I can say it is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I can be finished in half the time it has taken me in the past.  Now I&#x27;ve read other reviews that have said it doesn&#x27;t hurt - well.... it does, but since it takes half the time, at least it doesn&#x27;t last as long. :).  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Powerful unit, but they sent me the purple one cause red not in stock. Works fine tho, and the purple has cord, but is also can work cordless as well. Nice upgrade. Not the perfect color, but who cares.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dark hair.  I used to shave.  It got to where I could not shave every day due to razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  But I could not bare my legs because of the dark rough stubble.  I then turned to waxing and was very satisfied with that.  But waxing your legs in the summer is not ideal because of the few weeks you have to let your hair grow out.  For every 2 weeks of smooth legs, I had three weeks of wearing nothing but pants or long skirts.&lt;br /&gt;Then my niece asked me if I ever epilated.  I heard of epilation, but did not know of anyone that did it.  And did not think much of it.  When my niece told me about her friend&#x27;s experiences and I did some online research, I was sold on the idea.  After careful consideration I opted to purchase the Emjoi AP-18.  The first time I did my legs was probably the longest, maybe 30 minutes?  But I was in the process of growing hair out for waxing and there was a lot of it.  That was 4 weeks ago.  It was not painful for me, but I have waxed and have a high pain tolerance.  I was hooked immediately after and continued to do my under arms, bikini and happy trail.  I love that it pulls the hair from the root, no more stubble!!  I love that it takes time to grow back like waxing, but I can just do touch ups once or twice a week and I never have to have legs full of hair.  I am prone to ingrowns, but I am exfoliating and using lactic acid lotion and Tend skin solution to keep it to a minimum.  I am so happy that I purchased this epilator.  I have not worn pants or long skirts since!!  It has changed my life!  I will be purchasing the smaller Emjoi to get to my bikini, underarms and facial hair a little better.  The larger head on this model is ideal for legs and can do other smaller areas, but with some difficulty.  I would recommend any women to start epilating!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs in the tweezers unless they are very long. Very loud.</li>
            <li> its hurts like hell when using on your body</li>
            <li> Disappointed that there is not a light nor internal battery</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this, but the truth is that it hurts.  Now I don&#x27;t mind a little pain, but this was a little ridiculous.  I would have to try my legs again after letting it grow again.  Mine grows fast enough in a day to shave everyday, but may have been a little short for a true trial.  I did use it on my face.  It hurt like the dickens, left scabs everywhere and pulled very little out.  Totally disappointed and probably will never try that again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for 25 years and this is a good one.  I don&#x27;t really care for the placement of the cord plug in, which is more towards the top rather than the end.</li>
            <li> Amaaaaaaazing. I used to wax, this saves me so much money and no ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> Wife happy with purchase and she says it works well. Happy with chord so no worries about charging it :-).</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected. Hurts like a b****, but gets every last hair. Worth it for girls with dark hair like me.  Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Though epilators will never replace razors in terms of removing every hair right down to the skin, this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - better than a spa wax!  Twice as fast as the Braun Silk-Epil I also have, plus twice as efficient in hair removal and half as noisy.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the smooth factor!</li>
            <li> I bought this for summer so I could wear shorts and not have to shave my legs so often.  I found it works well and is not painful which I was concerned about.  It leaves my legs very smooth.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Tried razors, tried the no-no, but this is perfect for my legs and underarms.  Gets more hair and I love it.  Not like the old ones that were more painful.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt me, but for someone who has never used this type of hair removal, it may hurt at first, but once you get used to it, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older epilator I had.  I have not been disappointed.  Much quicker to use.  Anyone looking to get one that will take less time to use, this one fits the bill.  I even have noticed less ingrown hairs than my old one.  I still get a few, but it seems not nearly as many.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun Silk Epil for nearly 8 years and loved it. Until I burned it one day :( so there i was shopping for a new epilator and this one had really good reviews. So I bought it. Very disappointed in the product. First of all for some reason it takes forever to do your legs. You have to go over and over the same spot.  Despite what the description says It does NOT pick up the shorter hair!!!!! And does not do the job underarms unless the hair is really long. But in that case it&#x27;s easier to wax :) oh! Also doesn&#x27;t work on thin hair. Sorry, I have really nothing good to say about this product. Waste of money. I did end up buying the newest Braun Silk Epil 7 recently, and I love it!!! Short hair, thin hair, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s painless. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I love this item, it makes my hair removal so much easier and faster and it saves me money by doing it myself in thge confort of my home</li>
            <li> My Braun Epilator finally died - it was old, probably 15, maybe even 20 years old.  Didn&#x27;t expect much difference between this product and the old, but they are totally different tools.  Super fast and grabs teeny, tiny hairs.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Makes a loud noise but it&#x27;s not bad at all and it does get the hair off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun as an alternative to shaving and this was the most expensive and least worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse dark hair and after many many times running across my legs this pulled little to nothing out.&lt;br /&gt;I really thought I was doing something wrong after all these glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different lengths of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried gliding it across my legs at various speeds.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried pressing hard and pressing lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seemed like I would end up taking half a day just epliating my legs. I don&#x27;t have the patience.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly painful and I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance. No WAY I&#x27;m putting this on my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also completely worthless about my chin and upper lip hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud too, but if it would have worked well I would have forgiven it&#x27;s noise.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi for two decades.  This latest product is fantastic.  Very comfortable and very fast.  I rarely need to use it on my under arms any longer, as so little hair grows there now.  I use it on my legs, bikini line and underarms, and now I need do so only about once every three weeks, as over the years there is less and less hair.</li>
            <li> I do love this tool. It is loud, but that is my only complaint. It works well, and gets the job done. As with any epilator, you need to be careful about ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: they send a small brush with the package,  make sure you use it. If you don&#x27;t it does get jammed, but that is user error, not a manufacturing problem.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review after I had used this product a few times.  My review compares this product to the original Epilady coil epilator (made in Israel) and to the Braun Silk-Epil model 5318.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some general comments:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pain - all epilation is painful. As a woman from the Indian subcontinent, I have lots of coarse hair and hair removal is something I&#x27;ve lived with for most of my life. I first started sugar-waxing at home in the 1970&#x27;s - very messy process. But because I&#x27;ve been yanking hair out from its roots for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore, especially on my legs. That said, underarms are quite painful the first time you do them. So once you start, don&#x27;t stop! Because if you let the hair grow out, it will hurt like the dickens again. Also, I can&#x27;t do my bikini area at all.  Too much pain! I use pre-waxed strips instead. Some people mention epilating after a shower. I guess this helps. I always epilate after I shower so that my skin is free of all lotion and deodorant, so I can&#x27;t really compare.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ingrown Hair - yes this is an issue. For some reason it&#x27;s a bigger problem for me with waxing and epilating than shaving. My solution is to use a loofah in the shower, very frequently. Dry brushing your skin with a mitt also helps. Those puffy plastic mesh things don&#x27;t work at all, too smooth. Most of my ingrown hair occurs where my legs rub together since I usually sit with my legs crossed.&lt;br /&gt;3. Time and repetition - epilation takes more time than shaving and you do need to go over the area more than once to remove all the hair. But I can wait a week or two between treatments vs shaving which I&#x27;d have to do pretty much every day so it&#x27;s worth it. In terms of frequency, I use the epilators on my underarms and calves once a week and on my thighs and forearms once every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;4. Corded vs. Cordless - I had both corded and rechargeable coil Epiladies (original and &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34;). I found that once the battery on the rechargeable unit wore out, it seemed to slow down even when it was plugged in. So now I only use corded units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original coil Epilady - I started using these about 20 years ago. I found them very forgiving in terms of how they had to be held against the skin, and how fast or slow you had to move them around on your skin. You could move it in straight lines or circles. They worked very well and they seemed to remove more hair in one pass than the newer designs. But I actually thought they worked better on longer hair than shorter hair. And their head shape meant that I never could do my underarms.  But they lasted a long time - about 15 years! Obviously they were pretty well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Silk-Epil 5318 - After my Epilady bit the dust, I moved to this product. This older model&#x27;s tweezers have two metal teeth vs one plastic and one metal. I have seen other reviews that mention that two metal teeth are better than one being plastic. That said, this product works very well for me. You need to follow its directions, though. Move slowly in long swoops and hold the device at a 90 degree angle against your skin. I use the slower speed on the device because I thought the faster speed was causing more hair breakage. Also, I work against the growth pattern of the hair. This device is the best for getting into nooks and crannies and works well in the underarm area, because its head is fairly small and its a bit curved. It works best with hair around 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, and seems to get even the finest hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was using the old Epilady I had to shave my underarms. But I decided to try epilating them with the Braun and it is fantastic. To give you an idea, I have already had laser hair removal on my underarms which thinned the hair out a bit but didn&#x27;t get rid of all of it. Now I use the epilator and although I&#x27;ll never be an underarm model, I am hair free in this area and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi Emagine - We built a winter home inthe south so I needed a second epilator and I picked this one based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good: it is fast! The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun. Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great. It&#x27;s tweezers also have two metal teeth, by the way. You still have to follow the directions. Hold the device at a 90 degree angle (upright) against your skin. Move in small swipes. I use the slower speed. The device works well on shorter hair, just like the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad - why I give it four stars instead of five. It is loud! Louder than the Braun. This isn&#x27;t a big deal at my house but I don&#x27;t think I could take it with me if I was visiting a friend. They&#x27;d wonder what the heck was going on. But the more important issue is that it&#x27;s head is quite large, and flat. So it is harder to use in the underarm and behind-the-knee areas. Also hard to use around the knees (mine are pretty boney and angular).  This isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me but I suppose it might be for some people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my Braun dies I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model. However, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with the Emjoi, so I can recommend it.the south so I needed a second epilator and I picked this one based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good: it is fast!

            <li> The Emjoi Epilator is the best personal grooming device I have ever bought.  The instructions were clear and the plucking was easy.  The only trouble I had, was reaching the backs of my legs, but with some yoga positions I was able to get everything.  If you are use to waxing, there is minimal pain involved. I highly recommend the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I had an epilator that would work without plugging it in, but it didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge well and it died within a year.  I have had this Emjoi for about 6  months and it is doing a much better job.  The duel head catches more hair so you do not have to go over your legs so many times.  It is noisy, but now that I have this model I won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Even though it has a 72 tweezer head, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair more efficiently, I absolutely do not recommend this product. I had to leave it in a drawer and buy another one.</li>
            <li> Does pull out fine hair quickly. Will leave rash. And takes several several tries to get coarse hair only gets about 60% of the hairs. I am so dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This little machine works great and does not hurt at all. It removes hair very fast. The only negative experience I have, is that it does not remove hair well in uneven areas like the knees. There I still use my trustworthy Braun Silkepil.</li>
            <li> It is loud, and when I first touched it to my skin it felt like getting zapped like static electricity. Once I set my mind to the thought of waxing again I was more able to tolerate the feeling. Also, as the hair is removed it is much easier to handle the feeling of tweeting. Virgin hair is always harder and more painful to remove so I know the next treatment will go much easier. I first tried it on my arm where I usually wax. And I was so surprised to have all the hair gone! I wish I knew about this product years ago. What a waste of time and money I spent on laser hair removal and waxing. I could have been doing it myself all along at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. I have never tried an epilator before so I don&#x27;t have a way to comparing it to others but I have paid thousands on laser hair removal and waxing.. This is much better!</li>
            <li> This HURTS but it&#x27;s worth using instead of shaving.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND LEAVES YOUR UNDERARMS VERY SMOOTH. ISNT TOO PAINFUL. YOU GET USED TO IT AFTER THE 1ST OR 2ND USE.</li>
            <li> I used Braun Silk Epil for 15 years and i loved it. This time i decided to get something new. I thought that my old epilator was fast... Emjoi is fast and effective. It took me less than 5 minutes to clean my lower leg. I read reviews that said that Emjoi was less painful comparing to other similar epilators and i agree with it. Perhaps the speed that this machine has has something to do with the low level of pain. I just got this epilator, so, i don&#x27;t have long-term experience with it, but so far so great!</li>
            <li> This epilator worked really well. It really does take much less time to get my legs done then any epilator I&#x27;ve had previously, and I really was a huge fan. However it only comes with a 1 year warrentee, and wouldn&#x27;t you know it just after a year it stopped working. I contacted Emjoi but they did not care. I feel like if a spend $80 on an epilator it should work more than 17 times.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to, but can go through a lot of hair in a hurry. Be patient though, these things take a few passes to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very corse hair this works better than any other one I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> This epilator is great. Yes - it can be uncomfortable/painful tweezing hair, but it has benefits. Ex. thinner hair, smoother skin, longer time frame without hair. Every epilator is going to be uncomfortable. The only difference is people have a different range of tolerance for the discomfort. It does get easier over time, especially when the hair regrows thinner.</li>
            <li> I loved this epilator, when it was working.  It started to make a loud clicking sound, and would intermittently stop running (it would run, click real loud, stop, click, run, click, etc).  So sad.  :(  I removed the head piece and cleaned it thoroughly, but that did not help.  I would have given it 5 stars if it worked longer.  FYI: It is pretty painful.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST epilator for those who have thick, coarse hair that needs to be removed quickly and painlessly!  In the past, I have purchased two of these and can say that no other epilator is as reliable or removes as many hairs as efficiently as the Emjoi AP-18.  Recently I purchased a cheap epilator at the drug store (in desperation, I must add, as it was the only one available!) and there is no comparison.  I&#x27;m going to order another one of these babies pronto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  At this point, I have owned four of these.  A new problem:  the gears that allow the tweezers to rotate are made of cheap plastic and will wear out in short time, leaving you with a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t recall this happening with the first two I owned, but the last two developed the same problem.  The points of the little plastic gears wear down, so they no longer make the needed connection in the related area.  You can hear the motor running, but nothing happens because the tweezers no longer rotate...hence, you are left with a useless device.  It is great when it is new and working, but the plastic gear will wear out quickly.  Why is almost everything (including moving mechanical parts!) made from cheap plastic today?  I don&#x27;t know what else to buy in place of this epilator!</li>
            <li> Okay, so as a college aged male I am stuck in a generation where no one likes hair, even on guys.  What people hate more than hair is stubble. So I bought this thing thinking it would be a good compromise.  I&#x27;m not a super hairy dude, I&#x27;m just trying to take preventive action.  Anyway, I really like this thing.  It easily grabbed and removed hair in areas that are often times touched, grabbed, etc.  I think all of the reviews saying this just broke the hairs off were primarily from females with thinner hair.  This may be best for people with pretty coarse hair.  It definitely took some getting used to, and I had to make sure to have a razor bump gel handy for immediately afterwards, but that&#x27;s expected with something that is ripping hair out from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going with 4 out of 5 because I feel like it does take a pass or two to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re a guy and your significant other doesn&#x27;t care for hair in various places, this will probably work for you. Just make sure to go to walmart and buy some bump patrol or something at the self checkout and you&#x27;ll be grand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Also, you may want to think about your pain tolerance when making this purchase.  Guys&#x27; hair is seriously rooted. Sometimes to the extent that there are tiny tiny droplets of blood from where the hair got ripped out... I have been told that as you keep doing it, the roots get less deep, but that first time is rough.</li>
            <li> After regular blade shaving, I end up with ingrown hairs and someone suggested I try this type of hair remover. After reading a bunch of reviews, I went with this one because of the tweezer head.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts the first time because you&#x27;re pulling so many hairs at one time, but it&#x27;s bearable.  Because the hairs grow in at different rates, it hurts less and less.  This was the firt time in my life that I got the smooth legs you see on women in shaving commercials.  Follow the directions because you don&#x27;t use it like a regular shaver with long strokes, but short strokes.  Go in the direction of hair growth for less pain.</li>
            <li> The product is good and very useful. I am loving it. It&#x27;s easy 2 use and very smooth, better than others I tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that truly works.</li>
            <li> Epilation is &amp;#34;pinchy&amp;#34;.  I can only stand just so much.  Also, it makes you itch so have some cortisone cream handy and use it IMMEDIATELY after epilating.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair remover I have ever used! First time removal of facial hair will be painful but effective, it gets easier after the second time. I had to use a razor daily on my face...I hated it, I hated the stubble and the shadow that always showed up everyday. I used the Emjoi Emagine it plucked the hair off my chin quickly and there was pain. I used a cold towel to calm my skin after my first use. Next day I notice my chin felt smooth and no stubble; I was impressed and very happy. Two weeks later a few hairs started to grow, I could not wait to use it again!!!...Hello, less pain! I can go weeks without shaving my face...I LOVE IT! the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li> Ummm I tried this ONCE on my leg... and it grabbed nothing which I was shocked by. I sold mine on ebay without ever having used it. The quality is good, it&#x27;s not too loud. I imagine if used correctly it might work very well... but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work. Sorry that&#x27;s why I had neutral rating :)</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because, after reading many reviews on the different products out there, it seemed to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it works well for the lower half of my shin and calf area, above this it does not perform as it should. Maybe it is because the hairs further up my shin and thigh are quite fine, so they tend to break before they can be tweezed out by the spinning discs. I&#x27;m not sure. Also, the shape of the head does not lend itself to corners, such as the bikini line has. It works until the crease where your underpants would sit and then you&#x27;ll need to tweeze manually the last little bit. But maybe it has worked for other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been too scared to try it on my armpits, after my mum told me how painful it was for her... :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is easy to hold. I don&#x27;t have any problems gripping it, but then I always have dry hands when I use it. The switch could be improved but I assume it is purposefully hard to switch on, to reduce the risk of accidental tweezing. It does make an absolute racket when it&#x27;s used; my dogs wont come in the bathroom when it&#x27;s on. It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean - just blow/brush the hairs out from the tweezing heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if your leg hair is thicker than mine, this would probably be a good purchase for you. I still don&#x27;t regret this purchase, because even though I have to do a little extra tweezing, I am no longer getting the itchy stubble I did when I shaved. Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any ingrown hairs. And after using it for a month I&#x27;ve already saved what I would have paid to get a full leg and bikini wax.</li>
            <li> Is as expected a great product for legs</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this epilator. I bought the emjoi optima at sharper image because I knew at the time is was the most powerful epilator I could buy. and I loved it, fast &amp; smooth results. I bought this one because I recently lost my optima but also assumed this must be a new and improved version since it&#x27;s been almost 5 years. I was very excited to receive it but just tried it for the first time and as other users stated, it is SLOW and INEFFICIENT! it will not pick up even longer hairs, I had to circle around some of them more than 10X to get it to grab (maybe). plucking would have been faster. im returning the item.</li>
            <li> worked pretty well. it was better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from Emjoi. It arrived today and I&#x27;ve already requested information on returning it. I have been using the Philips Satinelle for a while now, and wanted an upgrade. I thought with 72 tweezer heads, this would definitely be a step up from the Satinelle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed, exfoliated, and dried my legs thoroughly prior to using the Emjoi Emagine. When I first put it to my leg, I was braced for the pain I expected to follow. 72 tweezers should hurt more than the little Satinelle, right? It barely hurt at all. I was surprised - pleasantly at first, then skeptical. Why wasn&#x27;t it hurting? By all means, it should sting a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t hurting because it wasn&#x27;t pulling the hair out by the roots. It was breaking the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adjusted the angle. I tried reversing the unit. I went back and forth, I tried circles. I tried everything; no matter what I did, it broke the hair 3/4 of the time. My poor leg looks like it has a 5o&#x27;clock shadow. It looks like my legs did when I used to shave, a day or two later. I&#x27;m deeply unimpressed by this product. I expected a lot more!</li>
            <li> This product not very good, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Had an emjoi optima that just wore out.  This one does a better job.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the original epilator that first came out at Hudsons.  You talk about pain, my teeth were together like they were wired.  Then I purchased the Gold Emjoi, much better, less pain and still works but I decided to upgrade to this Emjoi.  This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Being run on an outlet, it funs fast and with 72 Tweezers the job is done in twice the time.  But the best thing about this model is, absolutely no pain.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator about 5 months ago. At first, I was very happy with it because it was very fast and powerful comparing to other epilators I had before. BUT it is broken now! The gears lose contact and the tweezer head could not rotate properly so although the small gear connected to the motor, rotates but it can not drive the teweezer heads. As a mechanical engineer, I believe the gears used in this product are not strong enough to transmit the power for a long period of time. The other disadvantage of design of this product is that it is not possible to open the case easily to fix it. Since hair can also go inside the case and stick to its mechanical part, it can cause a problem that it can not be cleaned thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I am very disappointed that I waste so much money on this product and now I can not use it any more.</li>
            <li> I  GAVE AWAY MY PREVIOUS EPILATOR (BASIC PHILLIPS) BECAUSE I WAS SURE IF I GOT ONE WITH MORE TWEZZERS IT WOULD DO THE JOB FASTER. I WAS WRONG... I ENDED UP PAYING MORE MONEY FOR THIS EMJOI AND NOW I WOULD GO BACK TO MY BASIC EPILATOR IN  A HEART BEAT. THIS EMJOI IS OKAY FOR THICKER HAIR, BUT WHEN IT IS THIN (LIKE MINE IN MY LEGS), THE EPILATOR DOESN&#x27;T PULL THEM OUT FROM THE ROOT BUT CUTS THEM.. REALLY FRUSTRATING..  I GOT THIS ONE BY MAIL (I DON&#x27;T LIVE IN THE US) SO ITS NOT LIKE I CAN RETURN IT...</li>
            <li> Wasted money unless your a blonde hair,blue eyes gal that doesn&#x27;t have to deal with thick, Italian, black/brown hair.</li>
            <li> First time epilator! NO PAIN.  After bathing and using a loofah with baking soda to exfoliate, I epilate.  (Every other day I use a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs but have not had any.) The only sensation I experienced on my lower legs was an occasional slight scraping sensation- like when u scratch your skin too hard with your nails. Small slow circular motions most effective.  Was able to see hundreds of long hair follicles on white towel that I had under my legs fall out.  It did irritate and scratch some areas as I think I pressed too hard, however, the areas had no discomfort at all.  Yes, you do need to go over some areas several times to get all hairs.  Even with that a few stubborn ones still remain- no big deal. The hair grows back so slowly and much less of it- it is  amazing.  It is not perfect.  Legs look smooth but do not feel as smooth as a fresh shave. Hair grows much faster on legs from the knee down.  Knee area is tricky.&lt;br /&gt;I found under arm hair removal more difficult.  I sprayed under my arms with Bactine for pain prevention and it also helped with irritation.  It did not work great for under my arms.  No discomfort (I was pleasantly surprised) just irritated which the Emjoi PX EJ Epilation cream helped with. Not sure if cream slows hair growth as after all Mother Nature is in control.  It is difficult to do as it is hard to stretch the skin but can easily be achieved.  I was able to see where the hair was actually tweezed out. I would suggest for the first time not to go over the area too much and get it better on the next epilation time.  Do not go for perfection the first time as I did and scrapes and irritations will be avoided.  Even with that I was able to wear deodorant next day with no problem.  But I do have scrapes under my arms and only removed about 75% of the hair.  Need more practice I guess.  (This is an edit to my original review for under arm hair removal- about 1 1/2 months later.  I finally gave up on using it under my armsand went back to shaving every other day.  Then I had a crazy idea to try it again.  well, after the epilator removed about 50% of my underarm hair without irritation to skin, I then shaved the rest off.  This worked ok.  Then I became ambitious and tried to epilate again as there was not much hair there.  I developed serious  uncomfortable skin irritations which lasted 7 days.  I am bright red under my arms.  As it heals it will probably turn brown- then disappear over time.  Not worth it as I can hardly raise my arms.  Does any on know of a special way to epilate under the arms?  Once I heal, I may go back to epilating occasionally, then still shaving every other day.  Poor me.)&lt;br /&gt;(I also tried it on my arms on low speed and came out great without redness or irritation.  Hair grows back slowly so arms look great- did not realize they were so hairy.)&lt;br /&gt;As for the noise, any hair dryer is much much louder than this and I am able to listen to a talk show on the radio while I epilate.  Takes less than 1 hour to do legs and underarms.  I did my thighs 2 weeks ago and not 1 hair has grown back.&lt;br /&gt;On lower legs and under arms I epilated 3 days after first time due to the difference in hair growth and that lasted 6 days.  Supposedly it will last longer with each use.  I do not see it lasting 5-6 weeks as stated in some reviews.  I use the Emjoi PX EJ Epilation cream immediately after which does help with irritation caused by epilating and use it every other day for a few times, then just use a regular moisturizer.  Under my arms I use every day for a few days.  Others may not need to.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of an electrical cord as opposed to batteries because as you know batteries loose their strength over time.  You definitely want this machine working at full capacity at all times.  I recommend this epilator due to the lack of pain and 72 tweezers making for a rapid and easy hair removal experience.</li>
            <li> I have had my Epilator for over 2 years now and i love it. I use it on my underarms and my legs. The first 3 to 4 times of use it did irritate my skin for the first hour but was worth it. During each use it has made my skin softer with no more ingrown hair. My underarms have become much lighter in color than before because of razers. Hair grows back 3 to 4 weeks later and much much thinner. Over all great investment. You will not regret it at all. Downfall if you dont like pain or cant take pain at all this is probably not for you. It does look it lot more intimating that is actually is.</li>
            <li> I think I really did a big favor to myself! This product is really fast, which I love about it. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction great product</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as well as waxing does on the legs and underarms, but for much cheaper. Normally, I would have to shave every day, but with this product, I used it once and now, three weeks later, I finally have a few hairs poking through enough for me to touch up my legs again. At seven months pregnant, this product is a life saver!</li>
            <li> I think I have about average hair growth and density, so I cannot promise that everyone will have my same amazing results, but I cannot say enough nice things about this device. The very first time I did both legs was uncomfortable, and because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react, I did a separate sitting for each leg. I have never epilated before, so I cannot compare the experience to using a different brand of this same product, but I will say that that to me it felt very similar to when I get a tattoo. Not fun, but certainly not agonizing. Afterward, both my legs broke out in red bumps all over; it looked like some horrible disease. But I needn&#x27;t have worried, because the inflammation subsided within a few hours, leaving me with baby soft legs. I have only been using it about once a week since then, to touch up stragglers. No ingrown hairs either. It is loud enough that I do have to turn up the volume if I&#x27;m watching TV while I epilate, but not nearly as loud as say, a blow dryer. In short, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in how this doesn&#x27;t work. You would think that with 72 tweeters I wouldn&#x27;t have to go over it a million tims.</li>
            <li> I got the smaller version of this to get rid of my upper lip hair and under arm hair. I used to shave my legs but I got tired, cause I really cant use my small epilator for my legs. It will just take me forever.  So I got this for my legs and took me around 20 minutes to finish my lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little pinching pain because it does tweeze out the hair but your legs will be hair free for about 3 weeks and if you use it regularly, the regrowth is thinner and less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a good hair removal product and this is it. What kept me from the epilators until now were the reviews that say it is painful. But for someone like me who has been waxing, the pain is tolerable. No more waxing for me! It does not clean up every single hair like waxing though. But I like the convenience of taking it out from the drawer and use it for a few minutes after shower to keep myself hair free. Not everyday, but once every two weeks. I don&#x27;t need to wait until the hair gets to a certain length like when IT used to wax. I would&#x27;ve given it five stars but it is a little hard to use on uneven surfaces like the knees and underarms. If the head was smaller or the tweezers protruding instead of concave shape, it may solve the problem. I wonder if they have different head sold.</li>
            <li> I had used other brands for years, this one is faster and I don&#x27;t feel pain at a all. I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: it is not cordless :(</li>
            <li> This epilator is not as good as my former one. The plastic head is kind of cheap feeling. In my opinion, the rotating tweezers don&#x27;t stick out far enough not be the most effective. I have to press it into my skin in some areas to get the hair. Shortly after using it for the first time, hair started growing back rather quickly. I think this is because the epilator didn&#x27;t successfully pull out many of the hairs from the root but instead broke off. Maybe is was because it rotating too fast?? Overall, disappointing but I guess, it&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years as razors leave my legs a &amp;#34;bloody mess&amp;#34; due to skin issues. Works great and really is very pain free for me .. either it&#x27;s that good or I am that used to it. Try it ... :)</li>
            <li> Ok so I am a guy and I epilate. I think being hairless is cleaner.  I typically use this for the pubic area and the underarms.  I do sometimes epilate my legs because the hair comes back thinner, but I don&#x27;t normally do my legs--maybe once every 6 months.  Overall I give the pain level about a 2 out of 10--of course this may be because I have used other epilators in the past.  There are so many tweezers and it moves so fast that you can barely feel it pulling the hair.  Yes, there is slight discomfort but nothing compared to the other epilators.  I had a Philips that I left a review on and it finally broke after 3 years.  The pain on this one compared to that one is much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly for the pubic area and underarms and both are considered sensitive areas.  If you are looking for a good epilator that removes hair from the root this is the one for you.  The price point is good as well because there are more expensive ones out there that can&#x27;t do what this can do.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product</li>
            <li> So I had seen this on a YouTube channel and mentioned it to my hubby that I wanted to try it.  He surprisingly got it for me.... And what can I say I freakin love it.  Not going to lie it totally hurts at first but now I can do it like nothing (legs and arm pits). Also the hair on my legs took forever to grow back and they grow back so fine not like when shaving. I would definitely purchase this again and again</li>
            <li> I thought this is painless...but I tired it first its painful ....we need to do it with charging accordingly....besides negatives..ya this is gud..no hair growth for longer tym</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This item does not work as expected; it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so for the most part, it did take most of the hair out... But not all. I found myself going over the same spots a few times. As a first timer, the pain was bearable. Followed by some Aloe, you&#x27;ll be A-ok. My hair started growing back by week 2. I won&#x27;t really use it much because of all the effort w/ just ONE leg (w/ short hair) followed by a razor.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived at my house, I was excited to try out my new epilator. It was my first experience with an epilator, so I expected it to be painful. Honestly, it just stung a little bit when I used it. However, I purchased it with the intent to remove my fiancé&#x27;s hair, so we tried it out on him. He found it too painful to bear.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m giving this a one-star review. We plugged it in, tried it out on a few spots, and then had to go run some errands. When we returned home with the intent to give the epilator another go, it had ceased to function entirely. We did not mistreat it in any way, yet now it is completely nonfunctional, no matter what we try. Hopefully I can return it easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on average every other day since my purchase.  I always feel stubble.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I don&#x27;t get a close smooth shave feeling.</li>
            <li> So cool, I have thick course hair and it pulls them out just fine. Left me feeling pretty smooth. It does take a minute the first time but I think that is with all epilators.</li>
            <li> works,does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Still hurting too much to write a review, lol!  But a good product.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s the best Epilator  that has come out on the market yet! The service was great, and they even upgraded it!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. The best in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different epilators and this one is by far the best. It is quick, pulls out the hair from the roots and leaves the skin very smooth. It is expensive but it is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this epilator after months of research. As all other reviews say. The process involve some discomfort but we get used to it after using it couple of times. It is definitely faster I am done with my full arms, legs, armpits and bikini area in about 30 -35 minutes. I use this couple of times a week and now I have noticed that my hair growth has reduced a lot. I am giving one star less just because I get some ingrown hair after usage but exfoliating the skin couple of times a week helps and then it doesn&#x27;t happen whole lot. So overall I am really happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product , I hate doing waxing looking for something like this product, at the same time  not a razor, this works like a magic, just a note use it after you take a bath.</li>
            <li> I have friends that have recommended the Emjoi brand to me for years. Well, I have finally tried it and I see what they&#x27;re raving about. This particular one is a good value.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product, I expected it to be way better than the previous epilators that I have purchased.  Its not cordless, and there is no light on it to help see the hairs on the body.  I will use it only because it has more tweezers and it removes the hair faster.</li>
            <li> Really love this product! The hair goes really fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Only criticism is that it still leaves me with my legs feeling a little stubble... but I haven&#x27;t been through a full 6 weeks growth cycle yet... However.... way better than shaving or using hair removal creams!!</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my older emjoi of many years (which I was very found of). Something is different in this model because with the older model I never felt any discomfort just a tingling sensation , but with this one I really feel the hair being pulled. I wish I had known that before buying it.</li>
            <li> Very painful on the jawline and my face broke out for two weeks after only one use.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi Gently Gold at some point in the past.  It was a rechargeable and ultimately the cord shorted out.  Great while it lasted.  This one, requiring the cord to work, is might lighter, has more tweezers, and works even faster.  The in-growns are annoying but not the fault of the product.  If it lasts for two years, it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I found that some spots are way more sensitive than others. For example, when doing my arms, below the elbow was definitely bearable, but I couldn&#x27;t handle doing above the elbow. Leaves my arms super soft, however, so I keep using it (below the elbow of course). Works well on my legs, too. Sure takes a lot longer than a regular razor since you have to pass over the same spot a few times. Overall, I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I  used a Satinelle for years. I needed to replace it. I was disappointed. I needed to go over the same area multiple times and some hairs remained.. I tried to remove a rogue facial hair. I went over the area several times. I wound up with irritated skin and the facial hair was till there. I used this for a couple of months. Finally, I got a another Satinelle. It does a much better job of removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Best on the market as far as I am concerned. Could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my friend as a gift and she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my underarms, legs, and my bikini area, full Brazilian. Disclaimer: I have a decent tolerance for pain, plus after a minute or two the area get desensitized. I live that it plugs into the wall because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it losing power in the middle of de-hairing myself. The cord is long enough that I can use it while standing/sitting in my bath tub (so I don&#x27;t get hair all on the floor and it makes for easier clean up, I just turn the shower on to rinse away all the hair). I have even used it to get rid of the hair on my boyfriends back...Anywho, if you&#x27;re debating, just go ahead and buy it. You will love it. Promise!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi 72 tweezer worked very well on my legs, underarms, and binki area. HOWEVER,  the pain was pretty bad....I&#x27;m hoping to get use to it over time.</li>
            <li> So far, so great. I&#x27;ve never had another epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have used other hair removal systems, including epilators....this is by far the most efficient, least painful...I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> okay ladies, and gents this a great tweezer, emjoi is awesome my hair was very thick, and would grow everytime i would get cold, as i started to use it (boy it hurt so so bad, seriously i was screaming as i started the machine lol) but after a bit it stopped and i was excited to see the bare skin it left behind, it did pinch and gave me goosebumps and a little irritaion and reddish skin. but not a big deal because i had no hair. i was excited. i use it every other week to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t come back. such a great product, i think i haven&#x27;t bought  any intuition shaving heads for a long long time. those are 6 for 22-23 dollars  so i figure this tweezer helps me. and ps great for arm pit hair too they hardly come out and not as coarse.</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 4 months, and then it started to fail. It completely stopped working in a less than 1 year. I bought another one for 1/4 the price, and it&#x27;s been working wonderfully for years.</li>
            <li> Its not worth for the price I paid for this item. I have had better experience with lower price epilators..  I don&#x27;t recommend this item at all...</li>
            <li> I have Phillips &amp; I loved it then decided to buy this one for the speed, now is broken make a crazy sound and I can&#x27;t used or returned.</li>
            <li> i bought this in september 2012 and it already has stopped working. one of the wheels that turn the tweezers is not rotating anymore. i only used it once or twice a month. the seller told me &amp;#34;sorry but it is not our policy to accept returns after 30 days&amp;#34;. i am now trying to get a replacement directly from the manufacturer but do not have much hope. absolutely disappointing for something that expensive.</li>
            <li> Love it. It comes in handy for dress season.</li>
            <li> Took too much time &amp; didn&#x27;t get the results expected.  For the price, was very disappointed. Could have gotten better faster results by shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an old Braun silk epil for years, and I mean years!  This is definately up do date, works quickly, and the motor is quieter so the whole house doesn&#x27;t know I am shaving.  Nice surprise feature!  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Burning my skin when I use it</li>
            <li> I have mostly fine blonde hair on my legs and a very few darker hairs on my shins. With that being said, this epilator did NOT work on the fine hair at all and only plucked the darker ones! All it did to the fine blonde hair is break it off. The epilator is also made of a light weight plastic which really surprised me given the price. I&#x27;m returning this epilator...</li>
            <li> iTS GREAT.REMOVES HAIR FAST AND EASILY .THIS IS MY THIRD EMJOI IN FOUR YEARS.THEY GET BETTER AS I BUY NEW AND IMPROVED VERSIONS</li>
            <li> When I first used this I thought it would tear me up but after watching many you tube videos I love it. This is a great product to get rid of leg and chin hair . I don&#x27;t have to use it but once a month. I still shave my underarms though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this emjoi  removed more than 2 hairs from my chin.  A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Epilator is very effective at removing 100% of hair however depending on where you use the epilator I cannot seem to prevent what I would refer to as razor rash. Hair will regrow slower than shaving because you are pulling from the root. Once the hair does regrow it pulls very easily with tweezers almost falls out. A lot easier than without prior epilating.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, I would recommend this product to anyone who hates to shave.  and it&#x27;s travelable with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li> What can I say - no more shaving, no more waxing -  Emjoi away  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased Emjoi AP-18, based on positive reviews. I have always had Braun before. and I can say that though the difference is ignorable overall, but Braun worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;pros: the pain is less and it spins fast.&lt;br /&gt;cons: it can not get very short hairs and you should go several times over the little ones to catch them! (Braun does a better job in this case)&lt;br /&gt;and the head is so large that it does not reach some angles and curves. also,&lt;br /&gt;the difference between speed one and two is not much.&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Love that my legs came out super soft but 2 weeks later I started to get bumps . I shaved them and they&#x27;re soft again , my hair hasn&#x27;t grown back , and no bumps.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an epliator.  After reading reviews of this and other epliators, I was a bit worried that it would hurt too much.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, of course you can feel the hairs being pulled out, but it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t even call it &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34;.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not that sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my underarms.  It does an acceptable job on my legs, but it takes several passes over each area.  It doesn&#x27;t really work on my bikini line.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the nature of the hair there or the shape/countours of the area itself.  The directions say that you can use it on your face (by angling it so that only one disc is touching the area), but I haven&#x27;t tried that and will probably continue to just tweeze there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use.  I like the little travel/storage pouch.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> excellent machine !! I do triathlon and need to use it. I dont feel much pain. It is very good and tolerable. No problem</li>
            <li> Feeling a little pinching.&lt;br /&gt;The first use it: break hair and miss hair here and there. Had to use a tweezer afterward to clean up. But it gets better the second time at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> Did not like the product.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I&#x27;ve had 3 in 5 years I broke 1 after 2 years and accidentally used one with the wrong power in Greece. I keep getting it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Bought from: ShaveNow. Completely defective from the very first use. Can&#x27;t maintain speed, and doesn&#x27;t move at all on lower setting.</li>
            <li> Why I waited so long to try an epilator, i do not know. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s soooooo much quicker than shaving and it leaves my body feeling as smooth as silk! Shaving and the removal creams always left me with bumps and burns due to my sensitive skin, plus, the very next day my skin felt like sandpaper!! This epilator is AMAZING and it leaves my skin feeling great soooo much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s not 100% pain free, but it&#x27;s not as bad as people are making it out to be. Every once in a while you feel a pluck, but besides that, it doesn&#x27;t hurt hardly at all.</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to be willing to stick with it. The time to do the entire leg is forever, however I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs since April. actually I use it for my underarms, bikini line, and the annoying peach fuzz mustache too. No more waxing! The pain is very minimal at first and now I honestly don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she has to use it more often than her last one,it has 72 tweezers and is no faster than any other brands she has used.</li>
            <li> I have been using only Braun Epilady for years. When I needed a replacement, I looked over reviews on Amazon and one customer recommended this Emjoi instead. I bought it right away. It took me a third of the time doing my entire legs compared with my epilady, granted it was an older one, so the motor did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback with the Emjoi is that is not great around contours like around the knees, the Epilady works better in that area. I will still use the Epilady for hairs around the mouth.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has stopped the process of daily shaving but still leaves me with smooth legs all the time.  I use this about once a week and find that to be enough to keep my legs smooth.  I will occasionally need to touch up around my knees mid-week but usually the one a week treatment is enough.  Yes, it does sting a little the first time but my skin quickly became use to the sensation and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now.  Would recommend to anyone who desires smooth legs but hates the daily drudgery of shaving.</li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed to find that it was made in China--I don&#x27;t care if it says PRC--it&#x27;s still China. So I was not at all surprised that this epilator didn&#x27;t last a year...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this epilator in February and it stopped working by September!&lt;br /&gt;It did work great when it was working...little to no pain as it removed almost all hairs.</li>
            <li> Seems to be less painful compared with my old Braun one and quicker too.</li>
            <li> I showered and used this for the first time yesterday for my arms and bikini area. It&#x27;s too painful to use under the arms and for the bikini area, I could only do the top, the rest was too painful. Besides that, I had to do SEVERAL passes to get majority of the hair. The reason I say majority is because after a hundred passes, I still had multiple strays on the sides etc. I had to go over it with an eyebrow razor to get everything.Later that night, I also used a tweezer on the very low hairs to try and not get razor bumps. Today I realized that another reviewer was correct in saying that it doesnt tweeze, it trims very low. The hair was regrowing already. Anyone that has ever tweezed their eyebrows knows that the hair won&#x27;t grow back until several days to a week later. Stubble was there the following day. So. I reused the device. I paid $70 for it, mind as well right? Wrong. After reusing and doing several passes on levels 1 &amp; 2, hair was still there. For the hairs that it did &amp;#34;get&amp;#34;, after looking closer with a small flashlight, it could see that the hair I thought was gone was just dangerously low and had to put my Tweezerman to heavy duty work. I brought this device to keep from bumps and for it to be easier. Waste of money. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is too curly, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m getting my money back. I also thought that this device was rechargeable, but you have to be close to an outlet to use it period. Big inconvenience.</li>
            <li> better than any other i tried</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but so far, this is amazing.  I used to have the Emjoi Caress, which lasted about 7 years until I fried it accidentally in Europe.  I liked the Caress, but this one is almost pain-free (assuming you are used to regular epilator pain).  The double head actually makes the tweezing comfortable--almost feels like the head is hugging your body.  Also, as other posters have mentioned, it takes about half the time than with my previous epilator--and really doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all.  The box also says that it can be used on the face--I think that would be scary, but given how easily it glided on my arm, I would think that it probably works just about everywhere you have tight skin.  HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> excellent and in the time</li>
            <li> The dual head works great, my wife loves it. The gear in the handheld part driving the head is the weak point, Don&#x27;t expect more than 3-4 years from this machine as the gear starts slipping and eats itself up. Our second machine is about to give up, but tis time we will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Before she had a Braun that lasted for 15 years and was still going.</li>
            <li> Hurts the first time, but I expected that. After that is wasn&#x27;t painful. My hair doesn&#x27;t have to be long at all to use it. And it grows back slower. love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  Must be plugged in to use.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Love this thing.. no more shaving!</li>
            <li> I had Braun epilator before and when my secon died I decided to try out Emjoi. I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance as well as no-pain quickness.&lt;br /&gt;I recommed it highly.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job removing hair, you do need to go over  the same spot several times, but once hair is removed your skin is left smooth to the touch and hairless.  This is so much better than messy wax which I hate. This is a clean and not messy way to remove hair. The only disadvantage is, your hair does need to have a little length, if too short, it will not grab.  It is perfect for bikini line and legs, if you are able to let it grow a little.  Same with wax but without the mess. It is just a little unpleasant at first, not painful, but once you go over your skin a couple of times, you are ok with it. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, it gives me another option to shaving, and I can throw away my wax kit.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator. It is easy to use and whips the hair right off. It hurts to do my face, and leaves bumps, however legs and armpits are fine. Some people wrote it hurt too much for underarms, I don&#x27;t even feel it. But get it near my ace and I almost want to cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have stubble, no different than waxing in my experience. I would go get waxed and the hair was back a day later due to different growth cycle. At least this is much cheaper.  It&#x27;s no laser treatment, but works for me.</li>
            <li> Review contains suggestions for pre- and after-care, areas tested, pain levels experienced, results of epilating, and level of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product! Please note that this product is NOT as thorough as waxing; it cannot get all of those frustrating little hairs that your professional will go back and touch up or tweeze - you know... that extra service that you&#x27;re actually paying for when you see a professional. For the price I paid (less than $70 with taxes and shipping), this machine in one use has almost paid for itself compared to my regular waxing appointments. Caveat - I&#x27;ve been seeing my estitician for 7 years now for regular waxing of my upper thighs, full face, and full brazilian - the real deal one. This is NOWHERE near as painful as repeated waxing (which I did get used to over several sessions); epilating with this machine is more like having someone lightly scratch me with their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my estitician gives A+ service, this epilator gives a low A to high A-. My body hair is so light in color it glows when it catches the sunlight; so my hair is fine but dense and grows very, very long (thus seeing a professional for so many years!). I got all of my upper thigh leg hair in less than 30 minutes - without a silly little light to eluminate things for me, thank you very much. I stood in my bathroom (the cord is long!) and leaned on the counter, sat on the edge of the counter, or proped a leg up on the counter to get to all the spots. Taking 30 minutes is actually probably a high estimate. Also, the unit is really not that loud. It&#x27;s no louder than any other electric shaver on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep work - exfoliated the night before with an over-the-counter sugar scrub. The night of, I showered and thoroughly dried before epilating; I did not use any talc or drying powders. I did pull the skin taut when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas epilated &amp; pain level (0 to 10, 10 hurting like holy heck)-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Ankle (those long hairs that I always miss with the razor and would shred myself if I tried to get) - took seconds to do and was so fast there was no pain (0). I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my toes; yes, us blondes do get light colored hair on our feet. (Doctor&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a sign of a healthy heart. I&#x27;m sticking to that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Knee - too bony. Did not hurt (1); just impractical. A safety razor is just as efficient. I&#x27;m thinking shins are going to be the same on me; so I&#x27;ll continue using my safety razor for the knee and below. Pfsh, after this many years of shaving (20+) I&#x27;m pretty handy with my safety razor and sometimes that just can&#x27;t be beat with a machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Back of knee - Fast! The machine contured to the curve in the back of the knee. I&#x27;d put it at a 1 to 2 for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Thighs - I did have to go over a few spots more than once, but in all fairness I&#x27;ve not been waxed since right before the New Year (2012) so maybe it was breaking a few of those long hairs before it could get down to tweeze them. This machine left me just as smooth as if I&#x27;d been waxed by my professional!!! For pain, I&#x27;d say maybe a 3 on the high side. Up near the \\&quot;bum\\&quot; on the backs of my thighs (where the \\&quot;seat\\&quot; and thigh meet) was a little sensitive; that&#x27;s probably a solid 3 for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Bikini - Honestly, this machine is too big for such a narrow/tight area where the leg meets the trunk of the body. I would put this upwards of a 4 on the pain level for as little as I got done; the machine really was too big to get any closer than the outer edges of the bikini area. I think I would like to invest in a smaller epilator for these tighter areas of the body. This machine would have done too much damage to the skin trying to pull the hairs out even for a yoga contortionist who could get in there to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Chin / under chin - YES!!! It worked and it worked well! Pain was practically non-existent(1), less than waxing that&#x27;s for sure! And oh, to have that smooth feel and look again! So worth it for the self-esteem level increase alone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cheeks - Again, this machine is a little big for getting up in to these sensitive areas. It worked on the cheeks, but I&#x27;d put the pain more along the lines of a 3. And you&#x27;ve got to be careful! You could easily catch or tear your skin with high number of rotating tweezers. But it did work; I just went really, really slowly over my skin and worked small areas at a time checking the work as I went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Upper lip - I&#x27;d put the pain upwards of a 7 - maybe 8. This hurt; I won&#x27;t lie to you and I did try several times to work up to getting my upper lip epilated. The bone contact was unpleasant, it was too small of an area for that big of a machine, and I was concerned about getting my skin caught. I think I&#x27;m going to look for a smaller unit for the face and bikini areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftercare - You will see a lot of red dots; hey, you&#x27;d see them right after getting waxed too. You just ripped hair out of your body for pity sake; don&#x27;t kid yourself here so don&#x27;t do anything stupid with your skin or think you can run right out in that sexy little skirt. Your estitician would say the same thing after waxing! However, I did NOT see any blood from any pores. For my face, I just used my usual facial moisturizer after epilating. Nothing more was needed; no ice the way I would after waxing. I used Aloe Vera Gel afterward to smooth over my thighs; the cooling helped as the skin is a little tingly (again, it would be after waxing too). By morning, there were NO little red dots on my legs. My skin looked absolutely normal - just fur free!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for those of you who are expecting miracles - move along. You&#x27;ll never be satisfied because you&#x27;re expecting professional quality results (which you would pay a lot to get) from an at-home-use / personal use hand-held machine. Get real, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you expecting \\&quot;good\\&quot; results froma small, one-time expense as opposed to the regular expense of waxing to get \\&quot;great\\&quot; results - this product is a dream come true! I&#x27;m beyond pleased with my purchase and hope to get many, many years of good service from it. My best friend recommended this unit to me, we did the necessary research, and I think I got a killer deal buying exactly what I was looking for in a epilator product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a couple of months now. Purchased it during a desperate attempt to rid of my dark, course arm pit hair. Naturally hairy female but I figured it&#x27;d be one less body part to worry about. That and it&#x27;s far too painful to use anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate it. The hair does take longer to grow back as opposed to shaving. If your hair is thick however (I&#x27;m talking terminal hair) it&#x27;ll take a couple of attempts to pluck most of the hair out. My armpit hair grows in different directions so it&#x27;s a bit of a task getting most of the hair out, let alone the fact it&#x27;s thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS painful the first few attempts, but your body gets use to it after awhile. As far as armpit discoloration goes, I feel it has helped lighten the area although not significantly. Expected it to be more efficient in retrieving hairs; I&#x27;ve never been able to get all of my hair and do have to use a razor afterwards for any remaining stray hair if I want to achieve that smooth, hairless look.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these (3 red 1 black). I like them when they work but they do not last. I have tried everything to try to make them last longer but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears. The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months. I&#x27;m moving on. I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well but takes a little long to get the hair out. Also, it doesn&#x27;t pick up thin and and finer hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Have used an epilator since they first came on the market and my old epilady still works but I will never use it again.  The Emjoy Epilator is less painful and faster and I am very glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This Epilator has more power and a more efficient tweezer action than any Epilator I have owned before.  It gets the job done in less time, leaving smoother skin than any razor ever could.</li>
            <li> I got this to upgrade my Panasonic epilator thinking it would grab more hairs and be an all around quicker experience-I was wrong. First the thing is so LOUD. Much louder than my Panasonic. I can barely stand using it. It seems to miss much more hair than my old one as well, making me go over legs over and over. Sometimes I even follow up with my old epilator to make sure my legs are smooth. I do use the circle method someone else mentioned in a review and that does work much better than any other method. Because of these two things I wouldn&#x27;t say this epilator is worth the price if you don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it is much nicer to my sensitive skin. With my previous epilator I was not able to stand the pain to do my bikini line or arm pits, with this I can easily do both pain free. I&#x27;ve found this to be the only thing that outweighs my old epilator. Perhaps this means it would be ideal for first time epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Does not impress me with ability to grab more hair, but does work better on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace my Emjoi Optima (which I loved and ran many years before its motor finally wore out). I was sad to see the Optima was phased out and didn&#x27;t do much research before purchasing this Emagine.  Lucky for me it was a good purchase.  I was delighted to find out that it was cordless and that it held a charge! It picks up almost all of my leg hair on the first pass (don&#x27;t press too hard). My armpit hair takes a bit more, likely due to the terrain.  In all fairness, I have never owned another brand, but I don&#x27;t see any reason to.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short, I have seen the hair come back slower and thinner as it should. And I am using it in conjunction with the Kalo Hair Inhibitor treatment. I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she liked it very much. There are no issues till date. Great product.</li>
            <li> Seriously saves me TONS of money. It is a bit painful but so is waxing or electrolysis! Best product ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a replacement to my old Emjoi that finally gave out after 5 years.  Like my old one, this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It gets the job done quickly and effortlessly.  The brush that&#x27;s included makes cleaning the epilator easy.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping,</li>
            <li> I expected this to work well (from all the reviews I read), but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it did not hurt anywhere near as much as I expected.  Did both legs (including behind the knees and upper thighs!) and underarms the very first use.  The nice part is, over time it gets easier!  I&#x27;ve tried products before (years ago) and couldn&#x27;t take the discomfort (aka pain).  This product rocks.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not like getting a nice massage in a candle lit room, but it does what it advertises at much less pain than anticipated.  I&#x27;m buying this for my girls.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how I am so pleased with this product! I said the next best thing because I think my hair removing problems will be solved by Laser Hair Removal, and since I cannot afford that yet, the next best thing is an epilator. I must say though that the very first time you will use it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world. It is NOT! But as you go on, each time will be a lot more tolerable. If you don&#x27;t have the guts to go get a bikini wax, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> I am hairy unfortunately and its painful no matter what i use honey wax, brazilian wax or epilator.... But i must say i was throughly satisfied with Emjoi.... U need to learn to use it ... Small clockwise or anti clockwise circular motions and u can get rid of tiniest of hair... I think i will get used to the pain but hey i was able to reach till the bikini line which otherwise was very difficult... So overall good product so far...Attached before and after pics ..</li>
            <li> I must add myself to the group who wonder how and why did I wait so long to try this??  Glad I waited for the 72 tweezer head, as both legs were done in 20 minutes first time around.  I may have tougher skin than some - discomfort was minimal.  Results truly amazing!  Highly recommend this must-have gem!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a blister pack, with little information in comparison to other models. It is not cordless and that requires the user to be flexible in where and when they use the device. The comfort level is high - nothing about epilation is nice - would suggest that you do follow the guidelines and bath and dry prior to use. The performance is adequate - but I found it did not work as well with dense area of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not cordless - construction is not good if you have small hands or mobility issues&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works well on legs and chest</li>
            <li> Great product - I use it on legs, bikini and underarms.  Perfect!  Not  very painful, does a great job I love it!</li>
            <li> Very much disappointed  with the product. It does not do the work promised in the propaganda. It does not depilate it shaves. I am not satisfied, regretful of paying 90 dollars for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Never shave again! Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I cannot use blades or shaving cream for my underarms because they are extra sensitive so I either get razor bumps or a really bad skin reaction which is not very desirable. Before I bought this, I could only wax my underarms without getting bumps or irritated skin but this HAS SAVED MY LIFE!!! (and a few dollars too) this epilator makes my underarms sexy, flawless and I have had it for about 3.5-4years. So worth the price and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product.  I have been waxing over the years and even tried laser treatment.  I felt no discomfort at all when using the product.  You do have to get the technique down, but that is the case with anything like this!  I read reviews and researched different products and brands.  I think I made the best decision. My hair is growing back much finer and slower.  I am so glad that I found this to keep me smooth this summer.</li>
            <li> Using it felt like running a lawn mower through a forest.</li>
