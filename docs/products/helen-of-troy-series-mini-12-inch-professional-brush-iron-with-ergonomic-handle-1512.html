            <li>The ergonomic handle makes it very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Bettye Baker...</li>
            <li>The Helen of Troy curling brush works better than any I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to purchase this item in stores around the area and it was to my delight to find on that could replace my 15yo item.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a 1/2 inch brush iron anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Im ok with this brush</li>
            <li>They need to use a better grade of plastic on the teeth so it can withstand the heat.  </li>
            <li>OK, my wife&#x27;s \\&quot;curling iron\\&quot; or whatever burnt out.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>Also wish it had more rows of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for short fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It needed something to help grip it more easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, compact and could not find one that size anywhere.  </li>
            <li>easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have had this particular curling brush for many years -- it works best for my short hair style.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to handle and does a good job of softly curling my hair.</li>
            <li>This knob turns freely allowing the brushes to slide off and fall to the floor.</li>
            <li>It has an ergonomic handle that I find really comfortable to use and</li>
            <li>This helps prevent burning because I can feel the tips on the brush iron and touch them lightly.</li>
            <li>I bought this since I broke my right wrist hoping it would be easy to use.</li>
            <li>just what i expected works great</li>
            <li>I love this brush because it heats fast</li>
            <li>but It will note give you curl or enough body.to do any good.</li>
            <li>the smaller (1/2 inch) size of the barrel/teeth provide tighter curling and it also works best with short hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a Curlmaster which I loved, it had 6 rows of bristles that were long and also had a nice long end tip.  </li>
            <li>This is the right size curling brush for me.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size &amp; works well</li>
            <li>Just the right size.  </li>
            <li>For women who wants volume on top, this can curl very short hair and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>To be fair - the iron is good, I am limited in using it to its fullest potential because of limited arm use from torn rotator cuff.</li>
            <li>I like that it gets quite hot.</li>
            <li>so I needed a curling iron that would grab the hair and &#x27;uncurl&#x27; or remove the frizzies in hot, humid or damp weather.</li>
            <li>I have a short hair style and love the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron is exactly as shown on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>which is a benson iron brush and the tip gets too hot.</li>
            <li>I received and initial message that the product was no longer available; then, a second message that it was available if I were willing to accept damaged packaging.  </li>
            <li>the button area on the end where the \\&quot;cool area\\&quot; is to hold while it is in use is short and could be easy to get burned if not careful.</li>
            <li>this iron does not do much</li>
            <li>It is all that I expected and more.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It came in very good&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like it even if it does take awhile to heat up.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and therefore it was much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>The barrel of this does get very hot, so maybe not for younger girls.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone with this type of hair.</li>
            <li>This little iron works nicely although I was really looking for an even smaller one.  </li>
            <li>my new one..</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this is better than other 1/2 inch brushes I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but cord does not swivel like the old brush does</li>
            <li>I bought two so far</li>
            <li>But, it simply does not get hot enough to serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>The first several times I used the product, I noticed a strange odor (a chemical smell).  </li>
            <li>the teeth on my old brush break off i hope the teeth on this brush doesnt do the same thing.</li>
            <li>This one has a small barrel and makes nice tight curls that last.</li>
            <li>They are not hard to put back in, as long as you don&#x27;t lose them.  </li>
            <li>One by one they kept sliding out and the brush was no long usable..</li>
            <li>You would have to almost dry your hair completely and then use it</li>
            <li>The end tip is not long enough and the bristles are also not long enough.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The end tip is not long enough and the bristles are also not long enough.  </li>
            <li> It is too large around and it is slick.  </li>
            <li> It seemed I did not have it too long last time and</li>
            <li> You cannot expect to dry your hair with it since it does not put out enough forced air pressure and does not  get hot enough to dry or curl your hair..</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is that the cord doesn&#x27;t swivel very well</li>
            <li> My hands are becoming numb and I burn my fingers with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> heat is minimal</li>
            <li> So shipped carefully and timely.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money</li>
            <li> I like it a lot-- until the plastic teeth become brittle and start breaking off, after only a few months of use!  </li>
            <li> I have cannabilized an old one to replace an broken one.  </li>
            <li> handle is a little \\&quot;fat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was not happy with is the handle.  </li>
            <li> My previous curling brush&#x27;s teeth were not so hard</li>
            <li> it is so small and</li>
            <li> Some times the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; get broken of due to my negligence.  </li>
            <li> Making it hard to grip.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained, so this product must be A-OK, or she would have said something</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks of using this, the barrel started spinning and wiggling, making using it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find small curling brushes and I am thankful for amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> The cord twists all around the handle while you are curling your hair  very annoying all my previous Helen of Troy  irons</li>
            <li> It has been very difficult to find a 1/2 inch brush wand curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very difficult to find a 1/2 inch brush iron.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they were bought out.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and should have returned it but did not.</li>
            <li> It is one of the worst hair care products I have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just what i expected works great</li>
            <li> I like the curling brush for I need the 1/2 inch brush..It seemed I did not have it too long last time and it started losing it&#x27;s teeth, One by one they kept sliding out and the brush was no long usable..I will keep tract this time and let you know when this happens again&lt;br /&gt;with my new one..There is a definite need for improvement on this issue..Sincerely, Bettye Baker...</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is the brushes falling out.  They are not hard to put back in, as long as you don&#x27;t lose them.  I like that it gets quite hot.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has 2 negatives.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little \\&quot;fat\\&quot;.  Making it hard to grip.&lt;br /&gt;Also the button area on the end where the \\&quot;cool area\\&quot; is to hold while it is in use is short and could be easy to get burned if not careful.</li>
            <li> For women who wants volume on top, this can curl very short hair and is easy to use.  Can also make smaller ringlets.  The barrel of this does get very hot, so maybe not for younger girls.  Otherwise,,,,, love it!</li>
            <li> this iron does not do much it is so small and heat is minimal</li>
            <li> The cord twists all around the handle while you are curling your hair  very annoying all my previous Helen of Troy  irons I never had this problem</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  It has been very difficult to find a 1/2 inch brush wand curling iron.  It appears the manufactures of these things do not think people with short hair exist.  We need the brush wand to hold the hair in place.  I cannot curl the hair on the back of my head and see what I am doing with the clamp type curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific brush curling iron. Heats quickly, easy to control, holds hair well, excellent product. So shipped carefully and timely. thank you</li>
            <li> I have very short hair. so I needed a curling iron that would grab the hair and &#x27;uncurl&#x27; or remove the frizzies in hot, humid or damp weather. This Helen of Troy series 1/2 inch brush does do the trick.  I do like it. But the end knob does not hold&lt;br /&gt;the brushes that slide on or off in their individual grooves. This knob turns freely allowing the brushes to slide off and fall to the floor. It has happened a couple of times after use. My dog found one of them. And, of course chewed it up. Product manufacturer needs to improve the product with a tighter end cap to prevent the brushes from falling out of their grooves. If it weren&#x27;t for this issue I would have rated the product 4 stars. This product needs work for improvement.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand before.  It is difficult to find small curling brushes and I am thankful for amazon.com.  It is all that I expected and more. thanks</li>
            <li> HELLO I HAVE BEEN GROWING OUT MY HAIR FROM, YEARS OF HAVING PERMS. AT ONE TIME I DID HAVE A MINI CURLING BRUSH, AND I LOVED IT. THEY ARE NO LONGER AVALIABLE IN CANADA. THIS ONE IS THE PERFECT SIZE , I LOVE IT.... I WILL ALWAYS HAVE ONE, IN MY BAG OF TRICKS.. THANK YOU !!!</li>
            <li> I received and initial message that the product was no longer available; then, a second message that it was available if I were willing to accept damaged packaging.  Eventually, I did received the product.  The first several times I used the product, I noticed a strange odor (a chemical smell).  After several uses, that problem has disappeared..</li>
            <li> I have a short hair style and love the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel.  The ergonomic handle makes it very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy curling brush works better than any I&#x27;ve used.  My hair is straight and it works really well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to purchase this item in stores around the area and it was to my delight to find on that could replace my 15yo item.</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased this product after getting my hair cut very short. It has fulfilled my expectations and I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the right size curling brush for me.  I have short hair and this is better than other 1/2 inch brushes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to handle and does a good job of softly curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Just the right size &amp; works well</li>
            <li> I love this brush because it heats fast and I can regulate the amount of heat I want. I love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet my need the way I thought it would.  Even though my hair is short it didn&#x27;t curl it like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received my Helen of Troy Gallery Series Mini 1/2 inch curling brush within a week of ordering it.  It came in very good&lt;br /&gt;condition.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a 1/2 inch brush iron anywhere.  I knew that Amazon.com would find one for me and they did.  It is wonderful for short fine hair.  I would recommend it highly to anyone with this type of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these, I think.  Some times the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; get broken of due to my negligence.  I have cannabilized an old one to replace an broken one.  This one has a small barrel and makes nice tight curls that last.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling brush because of the size of the curling brush.  I have short hair and it gives me plenty of curl.  The only thing I was not happy with is the handle.  It is too large around and it is slick.  It needed something to help grip it more easily.  I found myself dropping it as I started to curl.  Otherwise I like it and would tell friends and family to purchase if they need a curling brush.</li>
            <li> This little iron works nicely although I was really looking for an even smaller one.  My only complaint about it is that the cord doesn&#x27;t swivel very well and it gets in the way.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is exactly as shown on Amazon.  It has an ergonomic handle that I find really comfortable to use and the smaller (1/2 inch) size of the barrel/teeth provide tighter curling and it also works best with short hair.  Delivery, packing and all stages of shipping were extremely good.  I will recommend this merchant to anyone who is looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Have looked everywhere for 1/2 curling iron.  I really like it even if it does take awhile to heat up.  It does the perfect job.</li>
            <li> easy to use, compact and could not find one that size anywhere.  Would recommend it for people with short hair</li>
            <li> To be fair - the iron is good, I am limited in using it to its fullest potential because of limited arm use from torn rotator cuff.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I broke my right wrist hoping it would be easy to use. But, it simply does not get hot enough to serve the purpose. I am very disappointed and should have returned it but did not. It was a total waste of money and I do not recommend it. You cannot expect to dry your hair with it since it does not put out enough forced air pressure and does not  get hot enough to dry or curl your hair.. And it does not even give any body. to your hair.  You would have to almost dry your hair completely and then use it but It will note give you curl or enough body.to do any good. It is one of the worst hair care products I have ever purchased. And I cannot think of one good use for it? So, I would not recommend it for anyone,</li>
            <li> Just the right size.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have had this particular curling brush for many years -- it works best for my short hair style.  It is almost&lt;br /&gt;impossible to find it at any local beauty supplly store.  Am always happy to find it online -- thus I bought&lt;br /&gt;two to have an extra on hand.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but cord does not swivel like the old brush does which is a benson iron brush and the tip gets too hot. the teeth on my old brush break off i hope the teeth on this brush doesnt do the same thing. I bought two so far Im ok with this brush except the cord does not SWIVEL @#$%^&amp;*()+  LORI, OF WIS.APRIL 4  2013.  I bought 2 helen of troy gallery series.</li>
            <li> My previous curling brush&#x27;s teeth were not so hard and therefore it was much easier to use.  This will take some adjustment on my part.  Not perfect but it will do.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks of using this, the barrel started spinning and wiggling, making using it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot-- until the plastic teeth become brittle and start breaking off, after only a few months of use!  I&#x27;ve had several of these and they all have done this.  They need to use a better grade of plastic on the teeth so it can withstand the heat.  I wish Conair would make a 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush because I have their larger curling brushes and don&#x27;t have this problem with their products.</li>
            <li> OK, my wife&#x27;s \\&quot;curling iron\\&quot; or whatever burnt out.  Well, anyway, it quit running.  She saw this item advertised somewhere else.  I told her, \\&quot;I bet amazon.com has it cheaper.\\&quot;  They did, so I ordered it for her.  She hasn&#x27;t complained, so this product must be A-OK, or she would have said something, I&#x27;m sure.  I don&#x27;t have any hair.  I&#x27;m bald!!!!</li>
            <li> My hands are becoming numb and I burn my fingers with a regular curling iron. This helps prevent burning because I can feel the tips on the brush iron and touch them lightly.</li>
            <li> The end tip is not long enough and the bristles are also not long enough.  Also wish it had more rows of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Also the swivel cord does not turn easily.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to find a 1/2 inch brush iron.  I used to have a Curlmaster which I loved, it had 6 rows of bristles that were long and also had a nice long end tip.  Too bad they were bought out.</li>
