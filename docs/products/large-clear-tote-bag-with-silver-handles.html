            <li> I liked this bag but..meh..I think if the handles were more..I dunno..maybe metal or some other type handle. I just didn&#x27;t like the way it looked, The bag itself is really nice and I gave it a few days for the creases to come out and I really liked the transparency too..but I think it&#x27;s the handles that made it lose a few stars. I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Great fits the purpose</li>
            <li> I love this bag and would recommend it.  I use it at the pool mainly, but am thinking of taking it to the beach also.</li>
            <li> I have a bit more expensive clear purse that looks nicer, but the cost is higher. This is a good product for the price. I am planning to take it for a beach. It smells a bit of plastic.</li>
            <li> This bag is really cheap looking and it is over seized. I would not recommending to buy this one. Too bad was busy and didn&#x27;t get to  my return it and the return windows had expired otherwise I would return it.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to use it for my greeting card company. I will be using it to carry my work so that they can be easily seen when I am networking</li>
            <li> Perfect for taking to work when everything has to show. I work in a pharmacy and this bag is exactly what I need -- it holds everything, it is sturdy and everything in it can be readily seen. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> So durable, I use it as my beach tote! It fits anywhere, and it NEVER rips. A great deal, and will last for YEARS!!! I love my tote, the best one by FAR!!!</li>
            <li> If you work where you have to show contents of your bag - this is a great item to have.  Large, durable plastic and the handles are very nicely done.</li>
            <li> Product was as described &amp; was a good value for the money. It would have helped if the ad had included all the dimensions.</li>
            <li> I love the bag and the quality is perfect.  I work in a store where we have to carry a clear bag during work hours.  I looked in various stores and couldn&#x27;t find anything acceptable.  When I saw this bag on your site, I ordered the bag immediately and it is perfect for my needs.  The bag is good quality and sturdy to carry all my belongings.  I would recommend the bag.  Thank you, Joan</li>
            <li> These bags were perfect!  We used them as gift bags for all of the bridesmaids.  Then they could use them for the pool party the day after the wedding.  So cute!  Perfect size!</li>
            <li> Nice stylish bag. Shipped on time. I do not think is worth $20, maybe $10., Guess had a nicer one for the $20 on sale. That&#x27;s why I rated a 4 star.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY MOM FOR WORK AND SHE LOVES IT</li>
            <li> Great bag! Perfect for beach or pool! Very stylish and chic!</li>
            <li> The bag&#x27;s exterior and style are great.  But even with &amp;#34;light use&amp;#34;  the handles slid to expose ugly red, purple and yellow fabric under the sleek silver exterior.  Owned the bag and used it for 20 days...returning now..:(</li>
            <li> GREAT BAG AND LOTS OF ROOM</li>
            <li> Perfect for my retail job. Fits all my must haves, including another pair of shoes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold everything that I need.  I would caution not to leave in the sun as it will get very hot.  But it&#x27;s a nice tote!</li>
            <li> I love this bag. And this from someone who owns about 45 purses/totes/backpacks/rolling briefcases, etc.! After calculating that i must be spending an hour a week digging through my old bags looking for stuff, i decided to get this tote. I don&#x27;t have to search for stuff any longer! I bought this with a small bag organizer (also clear) to create some compartments. The handles in this bag have a cushiony feel so that when carrying a heavier load, my shoulders are not in discomfort. I am buying another one to gift to my mom.</li>
