            <li>This more than met my expectations .</li>

            <li>Great for the summer evenings and for cozy warm Winter nights snuggled up with your sweetie!</li>
            <li>I like more original scents.</li>
            <li>To my nose, it&#x27;s a lovely blend of sweet leather and incense notes and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>the wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li>However after I ordered the highly concentrated perfume one, I say it&#x27;s way better than the eau de toilette spray.</li>

            <li>FIRST TIME I GOT BURNED ON AMAZON!</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Normally I get it from duty free shop when I take a trip.  </li>
            <li>Be advised that this is a strong kind of heavy scent that might remind you of good old times of when your grandma was a teenager, which I personally like</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it is not for me.</li>
            <li>fast service !</li>
            <li>Long lasting and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in addition to a .25oz pure parfume.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a soft powdery flower scent!</li>
            <li>Says it still has the same classic scent of the orginal.  </li>
            <li>I can see why others may love it due to its long lasting power</li>
            <li>It is much stronger than French made and didn&#x27;t smell the same.  </li>
            <li>iam sorry to say I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance at all it made me choke not my kind of sent</li>
            <li>Too strong and not unique enough, it reminded me of other fragrances that have the baby powder in it.</li>

            <li> Bal A Versailles EdT has much less skank than the EdP.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not something you would want to wear on a first date unless you want to use it as a repellant to drive away annoying dudes</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve worn the wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, very happy Amazon sells it. Will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Thi is a long lasting perfume. It&#x27;s been said Michael Jackson used to wear it however, not my type of scent at all. Too strong and not unique enough, it reminded me of other fragrances that have the baby powder in it. I like more original scents. The delivery was good, quick  and well packaged. I can see why others may love it due to its long lasting power but unfortunately it is not for me. I will give it 3 stars because it is a well made perfume and the delivery was very good.</li>

            <li> I have been using this perfume for awhile.  Normally I get it from duty free shop when I take a trip.  I was happy to find this on Amazon.com.  I was very disappointed.  this bottle was made in U.S.  It is much stronger than French made and didn&#x27;t smell the same.  Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> fast service ! smells good but maybe not for me .. allergies act up .</li>
            <li> Gift for my mother who used it in the 50&#x27;s.  Says it still has the same classic scent of the orginal.  She was thrilled.</li>
