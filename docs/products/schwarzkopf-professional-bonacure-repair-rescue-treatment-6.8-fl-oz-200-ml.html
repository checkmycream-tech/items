            <li>I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for over a week, and I am excited about the results.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive but an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry hairs.</li>
            <li>love all the Schwarzkopf products and really wish I had found them before I put myself at the mercy of a hair stylist, who put a 40 volume bleach on my hair for 40 minutes twice in one day.</li>
            <li>I take as good of care of my hair as possible with all the blow drying, straightening, and coloring</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and more manageable than it has been in quite some time.  </li>
            <li>love this for my hair use the whole line</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair, so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>This product is so gentle to the hair and after applying the straightener on my hair it makes it more straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely the best I have ever used and won&#x27;t search for any other</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer use it every other day.  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY FAST.</li>
            <li>/color my hair religiously every 6 weeks and after so many years of doing this damage has started to take a toll.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair twice when I first used the product.</li>
            <li>This does nothing more than the regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This its one of my first treatment my my hair regimen</li>
            <li>For the price I expected a more intense treatment.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>can really highly recommend those product!</li>
            <li>Wonde if it&#x27;s a replica &amp; not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>, i just moved to a very desert-dry place so my hair is still adjusting to it.</li>
            <li>In that, it has performed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in a 2:1 ratio - 2 parts BCRR to 1 part 30 volume &#x3D; 10 volume developer, which I mixed with the Bonacure blue bleach and processed to a beautiful light blonde without damaging my hair b/c of the deep conditioner mixed right in with the developer and bleach.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deep conditioner, my hair is very dry because of color,hilites, flat iron, so I do this treatment a couple of times a week!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high ...</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Try not to use it more than a few times a month because it does have a tendancy to build up.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>After putting it in my hair for about an hour or 2 under a heated cap it leaves my hair soo soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It made my hair stonger and it looks so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now (can&#x27;t remember how long), and I think much higher of it than before.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m now giving Schwarzkopf Professional Bonacure Repair Rescue Treatment five stars.</li>
            <li>It helps so much to give the shine back.</li>
            <li>I have coarse  relaxed hair and when I wash my hair it get very tangle</li>
            <li>Schwarzkopf Professional Bonacure products</li>
            <li>Result is still TBC, maybe a bit of improvement but not enough to justify price tag, will give it few more weeks</li>
            <li>This product rocks, I use it once a week with my hair steamer for 15 minutes (use distilled water for optimal steam), let my scalp cool down</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the sweet smel of it, but I came back from vacation with my hair a bit dry after sun and salt.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I paid for it anymore, or how long I&#x27;ve had it, but I&#x27;m very grateful for it&#x27;s de-tangling properties.</li>
            <li>I am carefully restoring/ lifting/ and toning a little at a time, but am sure to condition with this product in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these but not sure it&#x27;s like the original</li>
            <li>And although my hair is not really fixable this stuff really helped calm it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since my hair became very dry after a perm and too much bleach.</li>
            <li>I am African American with type 3b/c hair and when ever my hair feels dry or starts to shed more than usual</li>
            <li>the first time I felt a little bit of a difference but</li>

            <li> but I needed something to repair the dry damage.  </li>
            <li> It is not as dry and brittle as it was before.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly/wavy, dry (like &amp;#34;could</li>
            <li> ; dry), and of course frizzy -</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I expected to have the hair of Rapunzel; however, when I got done with the treatment -- it was still just plain old me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price stop you from purchasing, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moderately thicker, but no better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hardest thing is to use a VERY small amount - I found that about a 1/8&amp;#34; layer on the pad of one finger is enough for the entirety my ~4&amp;#34; long hair.</li>
            <li> hair was getting dry from my highlighting it every few months, so I ran to this product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and moisturized, but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have been using the BC products and the Blonde Me products for past couple of weeks after a disastrous $250 process at the salon that left me with long neon orange hair.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap either.</li>
            <li> It has rescued my hair several times when other products failed.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say a big fat waste of money - put your money in another product.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve gone 6 months without a haircut and my hair has hardly any split ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I took one star off is because it stinks horribly, like some kind of cologne.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience and my hair was dead from a straightener!</li>
            <li> Very bad product.</li>
            <li> I got very bad reaction.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product, leaves my colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioner, my hair is very dry because of color,hilites, flat iron, so I do this treatment a couple of times a week! after I leave it on for about 5 min. and rinse off, my hair feels so good, I love this brand very much</li>
            <li> Not the best conditioner for the price. I&#x27;ll stick with my AG Hair reconstruct mask. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sweet smel of it, but I came back from vacation with my hair a bit dry after sun and salt. Used it once instead of conditioner and noticed that my hair became softer, more manageable.</li>
            <li> I had a hair disaster and this product is helping me recover my hair. It is not a miracle thing of one day...but you will see the differences after each treatment.</li>
            <li> Very bad product. I got very bad reaction. I am not using it any more.</li>
            <li> I have been using the BC products and the Blonde Me products for past couple of weeks after a disastrous $250 process at the salon that left me with long neon orange hair.  I am carefully restoring/ lifting/ and toning a little at a time, but am sure to condition with this product in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used BC Repair Rescue (BCRR) to decrease the volume of the BC developer from 30 Volume to 10 Volume by mixing this product with 30 vol. in a 2:1 ratio - 2 parts BCRR to 1 part 30 volume &#x3D; 10 volume developer, which I mixed with the Bonacure blue bleach and processed to a beautiful light blonde without damaging my hair b/c of the deep conditioner mixed right in with the developer and bleach.  I also used the conditioner after washing the bleach out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the Schwarzkopf products and really wish I had found them before I put myself at the mercy of a hair stylist, who put a 40 volume bleach on my hair for 40 minutes twice in one day.</li>
            <li> Great treatment. I have thick hair and it works amazingly well. This and &amp;#34;Repair Rescue Sealed Ends&amp;#34; are awesome combination!</li>
            <li> There are two different products with the same name on the market; keep getting the inferior one from asap.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND. I LOVE BONACURE. MY REPAIR RESGATE ARRIVED AT MOMENT CORRECT. IT IS VERY FAST. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s a amazing mask. My hair become shine and bright. The size of packing is great, specially for some trips.</li>
            <li> my hair is getting healthier every time I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I bought thie repair rescue in combination with the BC repair leave in cream and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I highlight/color my hair religiously every 6 weeks and after so many years of doing this damage has started to take a toll.  I take as good of care of my hair as possible with all the blow drying, straightening, and coloring but I needed something to repair the dry damage.  Ive been using this for over a week, and I am excited about the results.  My hair is much softer and more manageable than it has been in quite some time.  For anyone that lightens or colors their hair I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels after using this product.  It is not as dry and brittle as it was before.  Love to combine it with Semi di Lino by Alpaparf product!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best conditioner on the market for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a leave in for about 10 minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy deliver, item just as described. Love the smell and the texture it gives my hair. Best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product to help repair my hair after surgery.  The medication that was used during and after the surgery did a job on my hair.  The product is making my hair feel better and I will keep my fingers crossed that it will repair the damage that all of the medication has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> Repair Rescue for sure!  This product is definitely the best I have ever used and won&#x27;t search for any other and I LOVE the smell of it too!</li>
            <li> Most amazing product I have ever used on my hair!  My hair was so damaged from styling and coloring that it would literally break off in my hands when I touched it.  Could tell a difference within one use of this product.  Within a week I had healthy hair once again.  Slept with this in my hair the 2nd day I used it &amp; washed it out the next morning.  This probably gave it a good boost.  Amazing product!  Amazing value!</li>
            <li> I am African American with type 3b/c hair and when ever my hair feels dry or starts to shed more than usual I use the rescue repair treatment. After putting it in my hair for about an hour or 2 under a heated cap it leaves my hair soo soft and manageable. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> this product feels like royal treatment every time i use it. Result is still TBC, maybe a bit of improvement but not enough to justify price tag, will give it few more weeks</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Schwartzkopf is my go-to company for good hair Rx. This product rocks, I use it once a week with my hair steamer for 15 minutes (use distilled water for optimal steam), let my scalp cool down and then it rinse in warm water. I have waist-long hair and I am very pleased to report that  Bonacure keeps my hair nicely elastic and strengthens the ends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It made my hair stonger and it looks so soft. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Works good. Just heads up tho... The smell is very strong!!! I had to wash my hair twice when I first used the product. The scent was So over welhming. I now only apply to ends of my hair, to also help reduce the intensity of the scent.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive but an awesome product. I would recommend it if you&#x27;re hair is processed with color or flat ironed</li>
            <li> Great product!  Good moisturizer use it every other day.  Doesn&#x27;t build up.  Would highly recommend this product for everyone. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love Schwarzkopf products, and this one is another winner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was getting dry from my highlighting it every few months, so I ran to this product.  I also use their leave in conditioner (BC spray...leave in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had remarkable results and my hair is so much softer, more manageable and just looks a lot better, and just feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I can really highly recommend those product!</li>
            <li> Very good product! Delivered on time, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I use it once a week or on special occasions and my hair looks amazing for days. Try not to use it more than a few times a month because it does have a tendancy to build up. Mix it up with cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say a big fat waste of money - put your money in another product.  I don&#x27;t have anything nice to say about this one.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to my hair and as much as I use it helps with the double ends. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a very good conditioner. It leaves my hair shiny and moisturized, but not weighed down. And it doesn&#x27;t take forever to rinse it out of my hair. I would leave it on for the recommended time period.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience and my hair was dead from a straightener! Don&#x27;t know how it happened but I bought this stuff. And although my hair is not really fixable this stuff really helped calm it down. The rest of my hair is great and I will keep buying this over and over again</li>
            <li> Great product! I died my hair ombre and it basically fryed! so a friend recomended me this product and I&#x27;m amazed how great it worked for my hair! in just 1 use my hair felt healthy again... my holy grail!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these but not sure it&#x27;s like the original I 1st bought at the beauty shop.  Seems more&lt;br /&gt;Gooey &amp;  not as smooth &amp; silky.  Wonde if it&#x27;s a replica &amp; not the real thing.  So kind of disappointed&lt;br /&gt;In this purchase.  Not cheap either.</li>
            <li> love this for my hair use the whole line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my hair became very dry after a perm and too much bleach. This is an excellent product that I have now been using for more than 5 yrs. Don&#x27;t let the price stop you from purchasing, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help my hair to be honest...the first time I felt a little bit of a difference but after that, I stopped noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I expected to have the hair of Rapunzel; however, when I got done with the treatment -- it was still just plain old me. Maybe my expectations were too high ... but then, so was the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now (can&#x27;t remember how long), and I think much higher of it than before. It is the one product that will get the tangles out of my long wavy hair when nothing else will. It does leave my hair very soft. I don&#x27;t know what I paid for it anymore, or how long I&#x27;ve had it, but I&#x27;m very grateful for it&#x27;s de-tangling properties. So, I&#x27;m now giving Schwarzkopf Professional Bonacure Repair Rescue Treatment five stars. It has rescued my hair several times when other products failed.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product !&lt;br /&gt;As well as for the pricing :)</li>
            <li> i love this product! it is perfect to my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really makes my hair soft and shiny. For use once a month or so keeps my hair perfect.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  It was actually more frizzy.  I do like the Repair Rescue Sealed Ends and Q10 plus shampoo, just not fond of their conditioners. Loreal EverSleek shampoo and conditioner work best for me.</li>
            <li> amazing!!!! everyone with colored hair should own this</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for my hair. I love the way it leaves my hair, so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> very good I love it! My hair looks like salon day hair! so much in love with this product wow!</li>
            <li> This does nothing more than the regular conditioner.  It&#x27;s moderately thicker, but no better.  Skip it... Your hair won&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hairs. It helps so much to give the shine back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say well enough yet, i just moved to a very desert-dry place so my hair is still adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> This product is so gentle to the hair and after applying the straightener on my hair it makes it more straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes that it would be similar to what my hair stylist uses that makes my hair so silky and manageable, even after she had washed it twice. In that, it has performed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest thing is to use a VERY small amount - I found that about a 1/8&amp;#34; layer on the pad of one finger is enough for the entirety my ~4&amp;#34; long hair. Also, apply to towel-dried hair, while it is still damp - it helps to evenly distribute the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took one star off is because it stinks horribly, like some kind of cologne. It wears off fairly quickly, but having to bear the stink is not in any way pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - using this and Argan oil (obvi), I&#x27;ve gone 6 months without a haircut and my hair has hardly any split ends. My hair is curly/wavy, dry (like &amp;#34;could go 3 weeks without a shower and no one would know&amp;#34; dry), and of course frizzy - but this helps manage it wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have coarse  relaxed hair and when I wash my hair it get very tangle but as soon i used this treatment my hair its more manageable.  This its one of my first treatment my my hair regimen and I can see the different how my hair looks before I started using this line love Schwarzkopf Professional Bonacure products</li>
            <li> Not deep enough conditioning for me to consider a hair repair &amp;#34;rescue&amp;#34;.  For the price I expected a more intense treatment.</li>
