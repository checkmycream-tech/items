            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that this is what I am buying today but will continue to search for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>and this has been the best product we have tried yet.  </li>
            <li>After 7 years of trying potion after potion - this is a good one!!</li>
            <li>KMF is the best!</li>
            <li>This lotion is very good lotion.  </li>
            <li>Their paraben-free and phthalate-free products are great.  </li>
            <li>Although this moisturizer absorbs into the skin wonderfully, I feel like I smell like my grandmother.  :-)</li>
            <li>A&amp;E is good for your hands too and neck.</li>
            <li>My Face moisturizer with water to make it easier to work with, and was delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>The result is an ultra-rich formula that ensures maximum moisture and healthy, beautiful skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>(Or I use organic virgin unpressed coconut oil in a jar, the kind you can eat, too, which is amazing if you have any breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, just great, not greasy and skin is always smooth</li>
            <li>the room\\&quot; kind of distance</li>
            <li>Feels like a nice protection barrier.</li>
            <li>Organic, good, light years ahead of anything else i&#x27;ve ever spend my money on.anic, good, light years ahead of anything else i&#x27;ve ever spend my money on.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>which is why I love it for the moisture, and then use their Almost Butter after which does have oils to seal in the A&amp;E.</li>
            <li>I just love A&amp;E</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>But, I still love the Kiss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for many years for myself, and never had problems with it.</li>
            <li>You always want to have a nice smooth feeling skin.</li>
            <li>Use it mostly in the winter, for 2 years now, and I love how it absorbs into face, arms, legs.</li>
            <li>Being vegetarian doesn’t make for a better product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming so it doesn&#x27;t ruin the product by any means.</li>
            <li>I did a quick google search of the company and was impressed at the offerings and promises of &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;small family business&amp;#34;, so I purchased and</li>
            <li>and I feel confident that its ingredients are safe and accurate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a heavy lotion user, but after over 65 years of living, I can honestly say that this is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin A, which helps prevent dryness and loss of elasticity, and Vitamin E, the anti-oxidant and healing nutrient said to prevent and reduce scars, are the nutrients most important to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Trying to go paraben free this year and finding a lotion that fit this description was somewhat challenging.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, overpowering smell and</li>
            <li>Pleasant, very modest, scent.  </li>
            <li>So if you have very dry skin, this product is very good for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be able to find this product on Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It’s just a selling point that many people love the idea of “fresh from the farm” and “totally natural and contains healthy ingredients”.</li>
            <li>Then you need to seal water/mositure in with some kind of oil - like the sebum your skin would naturally produce.</li>
            <li>all I can say is at the full asking price (36.54 tax included for 3 bottles)</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to be fine, but after about a week the lotion caused a breakout all over my chest and neck--an issue I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>it got super watery</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not going to give them super kudos.  </li>
            <li>Lotion absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Its my new favorite lotion to purchase online</li>
            <li>Actually aids healing of minor scrapes and cuts, as well as being wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In truth, is product is touted to be all natural and made by vegetarians which I don’t understand why this is featured so strongly on their website and in their story of their company.</li>
            <li>It is also much more convenient to have it regularly shipped to my house.</li>
            <li>Forget about turning a doorknob without wiping the grease off your hands first.  </li>
            <li>Please, Kiss My Face, go back to your original formula!</li>
            <li>So rich, so creamy and effective, intense enough for dry elbows and heels, too.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product works well for me.</li>
            <li>makes it seem as though this moisturizer contains a large amount of those antioxidant vitamins.</li>
            <li>I really like the Kiss</li>
            <li>what I really like is it&#x27;s not greasy or excessivly oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and know that it works very well .  </li>
            <li>No how matter how much your rub, it just doesn’t absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is ok... not great but ok when compared to the hundreds of products I have sampled and purchased in my lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m sure you’ll see several items that aren’t all natural, but man made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just want my hands to be soft for a reasonable amount of money.  </li>
            <li>and my face felt real soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>only this one and this is a Classic product, their first moisturizer, or one of them, I believe.</li>
            <li>Also, the pump can really provide some distance on a squirt of lotion when my kids push the top too hard.  </li>
            <li>But I also worked for eight years as a massage therapist, and when I started my practice I really didn&#x27;t want to use standard massage oils, which I found really greasy and which stained the massage sheets.</li>
            <li>Due to this I headed to my local big box store since they are starting to carry more paraben free items under their store brand.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars out of 5 because I really wish that they would come out with a vitamin E moisturizer that had a different fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, look for another product.  </li>
            <li>In eight years of working with clients, most of whom were regulars, I never got one complaint from anyone developing skin problems from this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality goes these are our results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>- A&amp;E is natural and totally non greasy -</li>
            <li>I wanted to update that this lotion is not absorbing quite as well as I had hoped when applying to my daughter&#x27;s slim legs so she is not liking it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>several items that aren’t all natural, but man made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera</li>
            <li>These tiny pimples are like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen on my skin, and even after discontinuing use for several days, it looks like it will take another week or two for them to completely clear up.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lotion and one small dab goes a long way</li>
            <li>vitamin A &amp; E moisturizer contains standard emollients for dry skin but note that this has an unusually greasy texture that is not suited for dry skin that’s prone to breakouts.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the Kiss My Face products.  Their paraben-free and phthalate-free products are great.  I gave this product 4 stars out of 5 because I really wish that they would come out with a vitamin E moisturizer that had a different fragrance. Although this moisturizer absorbs into the skin wonderfully, I feel like I smell like my grandmother.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using A&amp;E for about 5 months. I absolutely LOVE it. I use it on my face. I have eczema and dry skin. It never makes it worse. It doesn&#x27;t sting. After I rub it in I then use Kiss My Face&#x27;s \\&quot;Almost Butter\\&quot; to seal it in. (Or I use organic virgin unpressed coconut oil in a jar, the kind you can eat, too, which is amazing if you have any breakouts at all. It will reduce them by morning drastically over night because it&#x27;s anti-bacterial and anti-viral and reduces inflamation. My teenage daughters slather their faces or pimples with it when they break out. Works amazingly. which is weird because coconut oil is obviously and oil, but no matter it works. Sorry, digressing here...) Back to A&amp;E. I think I would faint if they quit making it. All those high-priced moisturizers are useless, full of chemicals and scents and supposed &#x27;technology&#x27; that never works for me - A&amp;E is natural and totally non greasy - which is why I love it for the moisture, and then use their Almost Butter after which does have oils to seal in the A&amp;E. I use them together as a two-part system. If I don&#x27;t use the Almost Butter after A&amp;E i use the virgin organic coconut oil. I usually alternate, Almost Butter one day, then Coconut Oil the next. All a moisturizer is doing is plumping your skin with water, basically. Then you need to seal water/mositure in with some kind of oil - like the sebum your skin would naturally produce. I just love A&amp;E and I don&#x27;t know what on earth I would do If they stopped making it. Every single other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried makes my skin freak out or hurts or dry or whatever horror. This stuff my face loves. Especially after the shower, I slather it on. A&amp;E is good for your hands too and neck. I just love it. Get it and Almost Butter and you&#x27;ll never need another moistuizing system again. I haven&#x27;t tried Kiss My Face&#x27;s other moisturizers only this one and this is a Classic product, their first moisturizer, or one of them, I believe. Total satisfaction for me. Organic, good, light years ahead of anything else i&#x27;ve ever spend my money on.anic, good, light years ahead of anything else i&#x27;ve ever spend my money on.</li>
            <li> I have never written an online review for a product, but my experience with this lotion has made me want to caution potential customers.  I was looking for something cruelty/paraben/mineral oil-free so I decided to purchase Kiss My Face.  At first it seemed to be fine, but after about a week the lotion caused a breakout all over my chest and neck--an issue I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager.  When the breakout began I thought it was related to other factors, but as I continued to use the lotion the problem got worse. If you have sensitive skin, look for another product.  These tiny pimples are like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen on my skin, and even after discontinuing use for several days, it looks like it will take another week or two for them to completely clear up.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with lotion and I am forever in search of what solves the problem without feeling greasy, sticky, watery, thick or just plain weird.  You know what I mean.  I want it to moisturize when I put it on and I want to feel relief for a period of time after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I do not want to smell like anything!  I just want my hands to be soft for a reasonable amount of money.  WHY is this so difficult?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy Suave cucumber &amp; melon at target until all of a sudden it got super watery (yes i tried a few different bottles).  I then hopped on amazon and started buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to give them super kudos.  This product is ok... not great but ok when compared to the hundreds of products I have sampled and purchased in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this is what I am buying today but will continue to search for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Its my new favorite lotion to purchase online and I love the smell.  Trying to go paraben free this year and finding a lotion that fit this description was somewhat challenging.  I wanted to update that this lotion is not absorbing quite as well as I had hoped when applying to my daughter&#x27;s slim legs so she is not liking it as much as I do.  Also, the pump can really provide some distance on a squirt of lotion when my kids push the top too hard.  By this I mean \\&quot;across the room\\&quot; kind of distance and I ended up with it in my hair today.  Due to this I headed to my local big box store since they are starting to carry more paraben free items under their store brand.  I found that their lotion does not have these issues which makes it easier for my kids to use.  But, I still love the Kiss My Face brand and I feel confident that its ingredients are safe and accurate.  It is also much more convenient to have it regularly shipped to my house.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion and one small dab goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a heavy lotion user, but after over 65 years of living, I can honestly say that this is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  A little pricey, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> After 20 years, this is the hand lotion I&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 or so.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, overpowering smell and what I really like is it&#x27;s not greasy or excessivly oily.  I use it ay night before bed.</li>
            <li> My sympathies to lalalark, who said that the Kiss My Face A&amp;E moisturizer caused a skin outbreak. Having read that review, though, I felt I needed to give my experience. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for many years for myself, and never had problems with it. But I also worked for eight years as a massage therapist, and when I started my practice I really didn&#x27;t want to use standard massage oils, which I found really greasy and which stained the massage sheets. I tried diluting the Kiss My Face moisturizer with water to make it easier to work with, and was delighted with the results. The manufacturer used to sell it in gallons, which is how I bought it for my massage practice. In eight years of working with clients, most of whom were regulars, I never got one complaint from anyone developing skin problems from this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to be able to find this product on Amazon and at a reasonable price. I have super sensitive skin and this product works well for me.</li>
            <li> My husband has extremely dry skin and this has been the best product we have tried yet.  After 7 years of trying potion after potion - this is a good one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and know that it works very well .  It&#x27;s not watery like some we have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, just great, not greasy and skin is always smooth</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good lotion.  I shall tell you a story about it.  I bought just 1 bottle from the supermarket and I tried it and my face felt real soft and silky.  Then I got snowed in so I looked up Amazon and found out that they sold it, and so I ordered enough so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it.  So if you have very dry skin, this product is very good for it.  Because that is one thing I hate to have is dry skin especially on my face. You always want to have a nice smooth feeling skin. Especially on your face and this is the lotion to have for that purpose.</li>
            <li> KMF is the best! Been using it for decades. Thank you, KMF!</li>
            <li> LOVE this moisturizer! Use it mostly in the winter, for 2 years now, and I love how it absorbs into face, arms, legs. Was worried it would make my face greasy (I&#x27;m a guy), but it doesn&#x27;t. Feels like a nice protection barrier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife due to a reduced price offered by Amazon. I did a quick google search of the company and was impressed at the offerings and promises of &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;small family business&amp;#34;, so I purchased and all I can say is at the full asking price (36.54 tax included for 3 bottles) this product is way over priced. As far as the quality goes these are our results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin A &amp; E moisturizer contains standard emollients for dry skin but note that this has an unusually greasy texture that is not suited for dry skin that’s prone to breakouts. Actually, given the problematic plant extracts this contains, it’s a poor choice for any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The International Units of vitamins A and E referred to in the claims makes it seem as though this moisturizer contains a large amount of those antioxidant vitamins. In truth, it contains roughly the same amount as countless other moisturizers boasting of the vitamins they contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims: Vitamin A, which helps prevent dryness and loss of elasticity, and Vitamin E, the anti-oxidant and healing nutrient said to prevent and reduce scars, are the nutrients most important to healthy skin. We&#x27;ve combined 25,000 International Units of Vitamin A, 5,000 I.U. of Vitamin E, moisture-rich Olive Oil and Aloe Vera, the &amp;#34;healing plant&amp;#34; with selected herbs and flowers, like Jasmine, Iris and Carrot to further soften and nourish. The result is an ultra-rich formula that ensures maximum moisture and healthy, beautiful skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, is product is touted to be all natural and made by vegetarians which I don’t understand why this is featured so strongly on their website and in their story of their company. Being vegetarian doesn’t make for a better product. It’s just a selling point that many people love the idea of “fresh from the farm” and “totally natural and contains healthy ingredients”. If you look at the ingredient list I’m sure you’ll see several items that aren’t all natural, but man made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Squalane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millifolium (Yarrow) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract, Foeniculum Vulgare (Fennel) Fruit Extract, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance, Tromethamine, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acidsee several items that aren’t all natural, but man made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Squalane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millifolium (Yarrow) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract, Foeniculum Vulgare (Fennel) Fruit Extract, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance, Tromethamine, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face, a while back, had been my “go-to” for years.  So rich, so creamy and effective, intense enough for dry elbows and heels, too.  Sad to say, they’ve messed with perfection and ruined it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now so greasy my hands shine after an application, and it requires constant use to have any lasting effect.  Forget about turning a doorknob without wiping the grease off your hands first.  A glass will go slip-sliding away after use.&lt;br /&gt;I brought mine to work to get rid of it, rather than throwing it away.  Every unsuspecting victim has commented, “Geez, this stuff is greasy.”  No how matter how much your rub, it just doesn’t absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt’s Bees has done something similar with their shampoo lately, to its detriment.  Why oh why must companies fix what ain’t broken?  Please, Kiss My Face, go back to your original formula!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works wonders. I can tell a difference in my skin after a couple months of using it. The only thing I would change is the scent. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming so it doesn&#x27;t ruin the product by any means. But that&#x27;s my reason for 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it.  Not greasy.  Lotion absorbs quickly.  Pleasant, very modest, scent.  Actually aids healing of minor scrapes and cuts, as well as being wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
