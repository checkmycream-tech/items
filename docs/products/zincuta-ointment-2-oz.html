    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I came across your product via the Internet. This is probably only my 3rd time I have reviewed a product. I thought the product sounded too good to be true. I am now on my 2nd tin. It works so much better than Zinc Ointment or other messy creams. A+ to the texture and quality. It has a soothing quality to it. A thin film each night before bed. I saw initial results within 2-3 days. 1x per day. No side effects. I.E.-Rash. Other creams/ointments specify many more times per day without the benefit I receive from Zincuta. Excellent product. Please continue to make this excellent product that really works.</li>
            <li> The tin brings back memories of a childhood ointment....the smell reminds me a little bit of rootbeer...the cool thing is it is a natural remedy for just about any skin problem. Give it a try! (I think I&#x27;ll get some for stocking stuffers!)</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son has had eczema since he was 6 months old. At times his skin has been infected because of the scratching and open wounds. I tried all different perscribed lotions from the Dr but wanted a natural product. He has been using Zincuta since June 2011 and his skin looks almost perfect !!! We are so excited about this product. As with most natural products give it some time it will work.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream -- good for all skin ailments.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I saw a taped piece on News Channel 12 about Zincuta Ointment and because I was at my whits end with my dog Jacks\\&quot; skin allergies, who was a Shelter rescue and came with very little history I decided to order it. I had already tried conventional remedy through the Vet who prescribed antibiotics and steroids which temporarily masked the condition and then it came back with avengeance and so that didn&#x27;t work. I knew it wasn&#x27;t his diet as I feed him a totally Organic diet right down to cooking his wet food myself and give him supplements such as Total Body Flora, Black Walnut and Aller Caps just to name a few. The Zincuta Ointment arrived yesterday 6/30/11 at 1pm. My son and I read directions and proceeded to rub the salve all over he affected areas and while you are instructed to cover the affected areas we could not do that with Jack as it was not practical. Jack did not flinch or wine as we did this and almost seemed to be soothed and comforted by the aroma. Later the same night at around 7:30 pm we again applied the Zincuta Ointment went to bed and hoped for the best. WOW. to our pleasure and amazement this morning his skin is 75% percent healed and he  finally came out from hiding under the futon and on the road back to his previous self. By the way Jack is a Jack Russell Terrier and anyone who knows the breed knows how highly energetic try are. Zincuta Ointment is now going to become a permanent staple in my Firstaide Box.Thank-you to The Apotheca of Southold, New York, Dr.Joseph C. Case for originating the Zincuta Ointment and for Donna Penny continuing to make this product available to BOTH Humans and Animals!</li>
            <li> definately works but i wish it had another way to apply it besides your fingers. the ointment in the tin becomes a little dirty sometimes. maybe an applicator like a speed stick deodorant so that you don&#x27;t have to touch already irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Son Nicholas he has extreme dry and cracked skin nothing works and he&#x27;s EXTREMELY happy with Zincuta&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Perkins</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of a save my Grandmother used to get when I was little for all our scrapes and bug bites...very soothing...</li>
            <li> My friend has had a lifetime of painful, cracking heels in the winter.  Your ointment is the ONLY medication that works and has given her welcome relief. Since she will need to use it for a long time, we are wondering if we can purchase some in bulk.  Zincuta ointment is wonderful, and lives up to all the testimonials. Thank you!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine at work told me about this ointment, and we are both from Long Island, NY and I was very curious about it, because I have eczema and during the winter, by knuckles crack and I get very annoying symptoms and itchy skin.    Usually I do not like creams and ointments because you seemingly need to use them forever and they tend to smear all over everything.  Well, Zincuta absorbs easily into the skin and the beeswax forms a barrier and a little really does seem to go a long way and it after a few minutes you are good to go with little or no smearing.    The can is easy to carry around in my pocket. My wife uses it on her lips. She gets cold sores easily and this seems to really help her.    I had a split lip a few weeks ago and this cured it within a  day or two.    It has an old time quality to it, yet also seems very natural and modern at the same time.   I got several tins and keep one in my pocket, one at work, one on my night stand and my wife keeps one in her purse and one in the kitchen for after she does the dishes or gets a burn or cut.    I highly recommend it!    Joe F.  Mineola NY</li>
            <li> I have Raynaud&#x27;s Disease which means that my hands and feet are like ice cubes covered by dry, sensitive skin. When my dear friend (thank you Cara) gave me this tin I had no idea what an amazing gift she was giving me! THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS, PEOPLE! I rub in a thin layer before bed every night and my skin seems to be healing. If I ever see the woman who makes this I am giving her a HUGE HUG (oh and I am so not a huggy person)and my only complaint is that the tin is too small because I need more!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best psoriasis treatment I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Nothing else even comes close! Works fast too, provides immediate relief from itching and pain, and skin looks much better within a few days.</li>
            <li> My child develops seasonal eczema every year and scratches his itchy skin from October through May.  The constant scratching causes abrasion to his skin to such a degree that any cream we apply causes his skin to sting to the point that he refuses to let us apply anything.  We have tried over the counter moisturizers, holistic remedies from Whole Foods and prescription treatments from the allergist, but nothing really worked and everything caused pain and stinging to his skin.  My husband read reviews about Zincuta, including its positive results in treating eczema, so we decided to give it a try.  The cost for the tin, plus shipping and tax, exceeded $20, but we ordered it anyway.  When the package arrived, we were dismayed at the size of the tiny tin.  However, we began to apply Zincuta to the worst of his rash and within a couple of days, his skin looked markedly better.  More important, the Zincuta did not sting his skin, so he didn&#x27;t object to using it.  We are very pleased with this product.  At this point, his skin is clear and we are able to keep the eczema in check with an inexpensive over the counter moisturizer.  When the rash reappeared in spots on his legs, we again applied Zincuta and the rash disappeared.  The only negative is the tiny size of the container.  We are using it sparingly, but it is half gone at this point and it&#x27;s only December.  Likely we will need another container before the end of the cold weather.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth tin of this product. I used to buy it at a store that closed in the fall so I ordered my last tin off Amazon. The recipe seemed off, hardly any zinc at all (very translucent and easily melted). I&#x27;ve had great results with Zincuta before, as others say, I&#x27;ve used it for everything. But this time it&#x27;s just as effective as Vaseline or any other oily product. Moisturizing but not healing.I will go through this tin and order another one after to give it on more chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS AN EDIT: The zinc had settled to the bottom in the previous tin I reviewed. I had given it 3 stars but now I have it back to 5 where it belongs. After stirring the formula was the normal one. Just purchased another tin as I used the last one treating my dog&#x27;s hot spots (and worked faster than the vet&#x27;s antibiotic/anti fungal!). Currently I am using Zincuta to treat redness on my face, which is a side effect of a Retinoid cream. This product is wonderful</li>
            <li> good stuff - not certain how it would compare to zinc oxide</li>
            <li> Really has helped diminish my psoriasis!</li>
            <li> Very useful.  It soothes the skin and is easily absorbed.  It is effective multi purpose and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Best ointment I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I came across zincuta on vacation at a tiny farmers market in Shelter Island, NY.  My son is prone to eczema and after trying way too many products on the market, it was worth a shot.  Everything she told me about her product is true.  His eczema clears up very quickly and he feels relief right away.  The little tin lasted us a few months.  We love it because it works.  My son&#x27;s review is, \\&quot;I feel really good\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Use it regularly for rough skin, small cuts and bruises.  Works fine!</li>
            <li> Excellent job; really helps with eczema.</li>
            <li> good on all kinds of abrasions and insect bites</li>
            <li> Use it all the time instead of cortisone cream on skin ailments - have re-ordered</li>
