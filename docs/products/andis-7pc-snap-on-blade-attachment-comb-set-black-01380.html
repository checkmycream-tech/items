            <li>well packaged &amp; well pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li>these attachments fit perfect on our clippers and they work great</li>
            <li>It is good for Andis clippers.</li>
            <li>but I do know good quality merchandise when I see it</li>
            <li>They fit my husband&#x27;s Andis great!</li>
            <li>The comb worked wonderfully the first two times.  </li>
            <li>I would buy these again, as I am sure he will break the attachments again!</li>
            <li>Anyway, my husband, who is very picky, is quite impressed by them.</li>
            <li>The wife catch my own hair and she says she wish she had this years ago</li>
            <li>but I actually love them, they are made of great plastic material that dnt bend are break as well, which the olds ones did break easily.</li>
            <li>These are the best combs I&#x27;ve had thus far.</li>
            <li>They do not make a good fit with the buzzer</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t his favorite Barber that very important day of his life.</li>
            <li>No sooner did I put the #8 comb on and after hearing the clicking noise indicating it had locked in place, I ran it over the top of my head, and it fell off.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok but they don&#x27;t stay on my clippers that well.  </li>
            <li>In addition, he swears they make the clippers work better.</li>
            <li>From most of the reviews I&#x60;ve read</li>
            <li>, I would have to say I think the andis magnetic guards are better</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Better quality than anything you&#x27;d get from, for example:</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the fine print</li>
            <li>It came rather quick as well!</li>
            <li>I ordered these combs expecting to get the ones in the picture with the metal clip that holds them and instead got the cheap plastic ones I find at the stores now.  </li>
            <li>Yes the set works fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>They are the cheap all plastic guards NOT</li>
            <li>It went from light fade to crew cut.  </li>
            <li>The combs I received don&#x27;t fit the clippers I bought them for, though the description led me to think they would.  </li>
            <li>and I have had many clips pop right off the buzzer while I&#x27;m trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li>ON IS SUPER DURABLE AND STRONG, EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>Get for that price its worth it!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should and is cleanly labeled for each size.  </li>
            <li>They fit super snug and are huge and bulky, sharp at the tips and look like cheaply molded plastic.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I had bough a generic version before, but they didn&#x27;t fit and were not labeled.</li>
            <li>While shaving my son&#x27;s head it popped off causing me to make a whole in his hair</li>
            <li>These guards are much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>because they&#x60;re more sleeker in design and snap into place quick and easy but they&#x60;re more expensive with less combs as well 0-4 in sizes</li>
            <li>Very durable and high quality.</li>

            <li> Very durable and high quality.</li>
            <li> they were like every other comb attachment I have ever seen which has a spring loaded clip to snap onto your clippers.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using other clips and not wasting your money.</li>
            <li> .. this photo is of the OLD style combs, with the little metal clip on the back..  but what was sent to us is the NEW style all plastic comb with the big fat chunky base</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li> These clips are down right dangerous because they pop off with just the tiniest bit of pressure on the clip.  </li>
            <li> My mistake was misplacing these little combs and now I have to purchase another set, so do urself a favor and invest in a case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little scared about getting these after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered them was because I wanted the original ones with the metal clips not the crap they sale in stores now.</li>
            <li> These are hard plastic and do not fit over the clipper blade.</li>
            <li> considering there were very few options.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt have bought these if i knew that they were going to be thick bulky plastic.</li>
            <li> They are bulky but not in a bad way will last you for ever,</li>
            <li> false advertising.</li>
            <li> sad sad come on Amazon</li>
            <li> &gt;  -cutting hair since 06</li>
            <li> Time number three it continued to pop off while cutting.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was convinced these would be bad quality and flimsy</li>
            <li> Caution do not be stupid and buy these like I did..</li>

            <li> It is good for Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> These guards suck! No sooner did I put the #8 comb on and after hearing the clicking noise indicating it had locked in place, I ran it over the top of my head, and it fell off. Time for Andis to bring back some quality to its products!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.. CLIP ON IS SUPER DURABLE AND STRONG, EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok but they don&#x27;t stay on my clippers that well.  Saving money to purchase magnetic ones</li>
            <li> I ordered these combs expecting to get the ones in the picture with the metal clip that holds them and instead got the cheap plastic ones I find at the stores now.  The reason I ordered them was because I wanted the original ones with the metal clips not the crap they sale in stores now.</li>
            <li> GREAT!! Arrived on time...well packaged &amp; well pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was convinced these would be bad quality and flimsy but I ordered them anyway considering there were very few options. Anyway, my husband, who is very picky, is quite impressed by them. They are stronger than the combs that came with the clippers! In addition, he swears they make the clippers work better. They were as pictured and we couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great product if youre the DIY type. My mistake was misplacing these little combs and now I have to purchase another set, so do urself a favor and invest in a case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -cutting hair since 06</li>
            <li> Get for that price its worth it! fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> From most of the reviews I&#x60;ve read people are not liking these combs but I actually love them, they are made of great plastic material that dnt bend are break as well, which the olds ones did break easily. They are bulky but not in a bad way will last you for ever, what they&#x60;re complaining about I dnt know but I do know good quality merchandise when I see it and these are it, I would have to say I think the andis magnetic guards are better because they&#x60;re more sleeker in design and snap into place quick and easy but they&#x60;re more expensive with less combs as well 0-4 in sizes but this comes with size 0-8 with the exception of the 5 &amp; 7 guards.Great buy will buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes the set works fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> The wife catch my own hair and she says she wish she had this years ago these attachments fit perfect on our clippers and they work great</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should and is cleanly labeled for each size.  I had bough a generic version before, but they didn&#x27;t fit and were not labeled.</li>
            <li> Not the ones in the picture.  They are the cheap all plastic guards NOT the ones with the metal clip.</li>
            <li> Item sent is nothing like ones shown in the pic. They fit super snug and are huge and bulky, sharp at the tips and look like cheaply molded plastic. Caution do not be stupid and buy these like I did..sad sad come on Amazon is there no way to regulate this?!?! It&#x27;s a shame..these sellers are permitted to do business this way...ugh..the search goes on for the PROPER clipper guards which are pictured but are defiantly NOT the ones I received.</li>
            <li> The comb worked wonderfully the first two times.  Time number three it continued to pop off while cutting.  While shaving my son&#x27;s head it popped off causing me to make a whole in his hair cut.  It went from light fade to crew cut.  I wasn&#x27;t his favorite Barber that very important day of his life.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared about getting these after reading some of the reviews. These guards are much better than I expected! I love them. Very durable and high quality. Better quality than anything you&#x27;d get from, for example: Wahl clippers at Wal-Mart. These are the best combs I&#x27;ve had thus far. I&#x27;m happy I purchased them to go with my Andis Master! Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> the combs that were sent does not match the picture. false advertising. i wouldnt have bought these if i knew that they were going to be thick bulky plastic.</li>
            <li> .. this photo is of the OLD style combs, with the little metal clip on the back..  but what was sent to us is the NEW style all plastic comb with the big fat chunky base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---  update your photo and I can update this review</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were like every other comb attachment I have ever seen which has a spring loaded clip to snap onto your clippers. These are hard plastic and do not fit over the clipper blade. I have never seen anything like this. Maybe it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the fine print but in my 10 years of dog grooming I have never had to with a product like this....buy with caution...definitely retuning!</li>
            <li> The combs I received don&#x27;t fit the clippers I bought them for, though the description led me to think they would.  I am trying to figure out how to return them!</li>
            <li> They fit my husband&#x27;s Andis great! It came rather quick as well! I would buy these again, as I am sure he will break the attachments again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth purchasing.  They do not make a good fit with the buzzer and I have had many clips pop right off the buzzer while I&#x27;m trimming my hair.  These clips are down right dangerous because they pop off with just the tiniest bit of pressure on the clip.  I would suggest using other clips and not wasting your money.</li>
