    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>(but it smelled so incredible, I didn&#x27;t mind!!)  </li>
            <li>Very good shampoo in every respect.</li>
            <li>but I have nothing but good things to say about this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great every day shampoo.</li>
            <li>Christophe doesn&#x27;t work so great in that</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product felt 100% cohesive from packaging to fragrance to performance, something that isn&#x27;t often successfully done.</li>
            <li>I thought for a shampoo this was a fairly good conditioner, and it smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>scent on this shampoo is pleasant, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great and my hair is noticeably more shiny now!  </li>
            <li>I get a really good head of lather with one application and never feel the need to do it twice.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>, so maybe I&#x27;m not giving it a fair shake.</li>
            <li>Cristophe lathered beautifully and my hair felt very clean.</li>
            <li>For all these somewhat negatives, however, I am very pleased with the shampoo for what it achieves with my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful (bright, citrus-y, and clean) and has a very clean feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and does seem to leave hair more shiny.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that this shampoo did a splendid job of removing sweat, dirt, woodchips and chainsaw oil from my hair, and left it with splendid shine and body too!</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I found it produced some wonderful suds while treating my hair gently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Smells nice</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to use a conditioner because I wanted to see how the shampoo would do on its own, but because of all the tangles I had to use one.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant sweet orange scent that does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li>This is a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li>But then no shampoo is magic, is it?</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients in Cristophe that aren&#x27;t some kind of compound are fragrance, some of which sound exotic (gardenia is one).</li>
            <li>It smells like something Michael Kors would design, something I&#x27;d love anyway since I have a lot of his perfumes.</li>
            <li>I only mention this because the marketing department of this product picked THE perfect color for this packaging.</li>
            <li>When it fell off my shower ledge, it never leaked all over like many do.</li>
            <li>Top rate quality</li>
            <li>When it fell off my shower ledge, it never leaked all over like many do.</li>
            <li>Top rate quality</li>
            <li>I figure that the results might be even better using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying Cristophe Glossing Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>which is something it&#x27;s nice to agree on, if you don&#x27;t particularly enjoy tripping over product every time you get in the shower).  </li>
            <li>healthier, moister hair holds a shine better...</li>
            <li>you do buy this, make sure you have conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it did have some results, which is something, and I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>It did many things for me, I felt it help to coat my hair follicles to help them from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>my hair more manageable&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also want to add that this shampoo has a nice mild scent that is so lacking in so many products these days.</li>
            <li>I can definitely recommend this shampoo because it is very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was pretty good</li>
            <li>All in all, a good shampoo that will cost you a bit more for the name, and will get your hair clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, smells great and is easy to style</li>
            <li>I love the rich and substantial lather you get out of about a quarter sized squeeze.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it strips all the oils from the hair, making it easily tangled.</li>
            <li>This smells pretty, and lathers up like laundry detergent--which is rather worrying!--and looks nice in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I need something to give my hair volume and for whatever reason my fine hair just didn&#x27;t perform well with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, not too strong yet fresh and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe the pure pleasure and bliss of the amazing scent this shampoo has.</li>
            <li>I can tell which hairs are gray under the color by the texture and the amazing ability of sticking straight up like a</li>
            <li>This is an excellent gentle shampoo that does what it says--my hair is definitely shinier when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine, but nothing special...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, competent shampoo, I think you&#x27;ll like this one fine.  </li>
            <li>After several uses of the Cristophe (of Loreal fame) Professional Glossing Shampoo, I am not that impressed.  </li>
            <li>The Cristophe professional glossing shampoo did leave my hair very shiny, though a bit frizzy and fly away.</li>
            <li>It also feels clean and full after use.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has done nothing special for my hair</li>
            <li>smell, nice lather, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I can get the full effect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a mild shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first I didn&#x27;t notice much glossiness; but after more uses I&#x27;d have to say that my hair does appear shinier.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and manageable, far better and softer than many salon-style shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo enough that I added the Conditioner to my purchase-basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have problems with stripped out hair or dry/tight skin, I would say this stuff is worth a buy.  </li>
            <li>There is not much else to say except, that I would buy this shampoo if I could find it at a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Cristophe Professional Glossing Shampoo did a nice job gently cleansing my hair</li>
            <li>A small amount produces a nice lather and it rinses easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I have oily hair, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product that can get rid of dirt without stripping down the oils so much that my body produces more oil.</li>
            <li>I think it would work better with dry or fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine and naturally curly, which means it puffs up like a marshmallow in humid weather.</li>
            <li>all that special for a dude with short hair, but my wife seemed to think it was just fine too (</li>
            <li>My teen daughter and I both tried this shampoo and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Pours consistently and does not run about before you apply it.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this shampoo at just the right time, as I had been in the process of removing a large maple tree with a chainsaw.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t hugely noticeable, and I do get better results with other products (mainly Biolage and Garnier).</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels great after using it, but not dramatically different than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it has stripped my hair of natural oils, even though it apparently contains \\&quot;Exotic Argan and Monoi</li>
            <li>None, really.</li>
            <li>The Cristophe also didn&#x27;t fare very well on hair that had substantial hairstyling product buildup; it took two shampoos to get that residue out.</li>
            <li>It looked, smelled, and felt like a very high-end product.  </li>
            <li>went back to my Pureology because nothing beats that for my hair, but I admit to cheating on my pepperminty shampoo every once in awhile to enjoy the wicked lather of this Christophe shampoo, and the heavenly scent of it.</li>
            <li>went back to my Pureology because nothing beats that for my hair, but I admit to cheating on my pepperminty shampoo every once in awhile to enjoy the wicked lather of this Christophe shampoo, and the heavenly scent of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this shampoo as a gift for someone, like it that much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really buy the marketing about \\&quot;gloss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>kinda like Flex or something else non-offensive, nor is it much in the way of aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this shampoo, but I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Not too foamy and leaves hair clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was a well rounded shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My color treated hair has gotten much, much drier</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with other, high-end smoothing shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>The main thing I got was that it was gentle.  </li>
            <li>hair was soft and I could tell a difference from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I still need a conditioner if I&#x27;ve been driving with the windows down (more as a detangler I guess), but I DON&#x27;T need a conditioner every day.  </li>
            <li>This gives a smooth dry finish.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t ensure your social success, help find your soulmate, quick-start your supermodeling career, or change caterpillars into butterflies.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any particular \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; when I was done.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li>the older I get.  </li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t seem like  a watery mess like many shampoos.  </li>
            <li>In high wind I look like a troll doll.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s a bit on the soft side, so it really needs shampoos that boost it up a bit and help give it texture.</li>
            <li>One benefit may be that one can use a lot less of this shampoo than other shampoos, thus resulting in infrequent purchasing of this Cristophe shampoos - this may make it a good value, despite the somewhat high purchase price (compared to drugstore shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And it rinses out pretty cleanly with no residue or dried out feeling.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well with very little applied and has a lovely, fruity fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty middle of the road</li>
            <li>It would be a solid five stars if my hair looked really shiny!</li>
            <li>When I follow up with a basic conditioner, my hair is left feeling really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>have used inexpensive shampoos in the past that have worked better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>not sure if I&#x27;d also had the companion conditioner it would have worked better, something that&#x27;s often the case</li>
            <li>My long, fine hair didn&#x27;t appear to have any extra shine.  </li>
            <li>Little goes a long way - nice lather</li>
            <li>I will buy again because it is pleasant to use and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>I guess the condition of my hair is so bad that it will take more than a bottle of shampoo to work magic, but I had high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li>first I thought it was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s very concentrated so that I think cost-wise it&#x27;s on par with the Pantene I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little more difficult to say how effective the &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; quality is, hence the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because of the Cristophe name and because it is supposed to be a professional quality \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With using both of these I get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Every time I have used it since my hair is soft and there is a shine that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li>Possibly not a great choice if your hair is already on the oily side, but good for normal and dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean, but not squeaky and dried</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how gentle this shampoo actually was on my hair, normally I get a dry feeling</li>
            <li>All I want any shampoo to do is lather well, rinse out cleanly, not hurt or discolor my hair, and leave my hair ready for whatever I (or Mother Nature) wants to do with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from keratin shampoos to deep conditioners, yet nothing really has a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much about tangles (which I often get at the ends after wearing my hair straight for a few days), and my Pureology does.</li>
            <li>but it left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I simply want to wash my hair and enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Minimal scent, won&#x27;t compete with other products or overwhelm the user in use.</li>
            <li>and I really find it average.  </li>
            <li>Because it makes my dry over-processed middle-aged hair soft, which is quite a</li>
            <li>GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;+ Makes my dry hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I have long middle of my back, thick and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My normal shampoo is sulfate-free Pureology Hydrate; something I can&#x27;t imagine ever leaving in preference to any other shampoo product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have oily hair, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product that can get rid of dirt without stripping down the oils so much that my body produces more oil.</li>
            <li> I think it would work better with dry or fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and naturally curly, which means it puffs up like a marshmallow in humid weather.</li>
            <li> all that special for a dude with short hair, but my wife seemed to think it was just fine too (</li>
            <li> My teen daughter and I both tried this shampoo and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Pours consistently and does not run about before you apply it.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this shampoo at just the right time, as I had been in the process of removing a large maple tree with a chainsaw.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hugely noticeable, and I do get better results with other products (mainly Biolage and Garnier).</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great after using it, but not dramatically different than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it has stripped my hair of natural oils, even though it apparently contains \\&quot;Exotic Argan and Monoi</li>
            <li> None, really.</li>
            <li> The Cristophe also didn&#x27;t fare very well on hair that had substantial hairstyling product buildup; it took two shampoos to get that residue out.</li>
            <li> It looked, smelled, and felt like a very high-end product.  </li>
            <li> went back to my Pureology because nothing beats that for my hair, but I admit to cheating on my pepperminty shampoo every once in awhile to enjoy the wicked lather of this Christophe shampoo, and the heavenly scent of it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d buy this shampoo as a gift for someone, like it that much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really buy the marketing about \\&quot;gloss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> kinda like Flex or something else non-offensive, nor is it much in the way of aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this shampoo, but I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not too foamy and leaves hair clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was a well rounded shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My color treated hair has gotten much, much drier</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with other, high-end smoothing shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> The main thing I got was that it was gentle.  </li>
            <li> hair was soft and I could tell a difference from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I still need a conditioner if I&#x27;ve been driving with the windows down (more as a detangler I guess), but I DON&#x27;T need a conditioner every day.  </li>
            <li> This gives a smooth dry finish.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t ensure your social success, help find your soulmate, quick-start your supermodeling career, or change caterpillars into butterflies.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any particular \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; when I was done.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li> the older I get.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t seem like  a watery mess like many shampoos.  </li>
            <li> In high wind I look like a troll doll.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s a bit on the soft side, so it really needs shampoos that boost it up a bit and help give it texture.</li>
            <li> One benefit may be that one can use a lot less of this shampoo than other shampoos, thus resulting in infrequent purchasing of this Cristophe shampoos - this may make it a good value, despite the somewhat high purchase price (compared to drugstore shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And it rinses out pretty cleanly with no residue or dried out feeling.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well with very little applied and has a lovely, fruity fragrance.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty middle of the road</li>
            <li> It would be a solid five stars if my hair looked really shiny!</li>

            <li> not sure if I&#x27;d also had the companion conditioner it would have worked better, something that&#x27;s often the case</li>
            <li> My long, fine hair didn&#x27;t appear to have any extra shine.  </li>
            <li> Little goes a long way - nice lather</li>
            <li> I will buy again because it is pleasant to use and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I guess the condition of my hair is so bad that it will take more than a bottle of shampoo to work magic, but I had high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li> first I thought it was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s very concentrated so that I think cost-wise it&#x27;s on par with the Pantene I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little more difficult to say how effective the &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; quality is, hence the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because of the Cristophe name and because it is supposed to be a professional quality \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With using both of these I get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> Every time I have used it since my hair is soft and there is a shine that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li> Possibly not a great choice if your hair is already on the oily side, but good for normal and dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp felt clean, but not squeaky and dried</li>

            <li> I have tried everything from keratin shampoos to deep conditioners, yet nothing really has a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much about tangles (which I often get at the ends after wearing my hair straight for a few days), and my Pureology does.</li>

            <li> Frankly, when it comes to shampoos and things like that, I have a hard time telling one from another. All I want any shampoo to do is lather well, rinse out cleanly, not hurt or discolor my hair, and leave my hair ready for whatever I (or Mother Nature) wants to do with it. I don&#x27;t care about brand names or celebrity endorsements or advertisements. I simply want to wash my hair and enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Minimal scent, won&#x27;t compete with other products or overwhelm the user in use. Luxurious lather. Rinses out without leaving residue. Leaves hair shiny -- and, if my observations were correct, perhaps somewhat straighter than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None, really. This is a worthwhile product. It won&#x27;t ensure your social success, help find your soulmate, quick-start your supermodeling career, or change caterpillars into butterflies. It&#x27;s just shampoo. Not magic. But then no shampoo is magic, is it?</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the nicer ones I&#x27;ve tried. It lathers well with very little applied and has a lovely, fruity fragrance. It leaves my hair very soft and manageable, far better and softer than many salon-style shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. A possible downside: out of curiousity I counted the ingredients, which came out to a whopping 43; a bit excessive, especially the ones I cannot even pronounce, much less spell (in counting the ingredients in one of Whole Foods&#x27; in-house shampoos, there were about half that number). Most of the ingredients in Cristophe that aren&#x27;t some kind of compound are fragrance, some of which sound exotic (gardenia is one). It also cautions not to contact the eyes, so I&#x27;m guessing they aren&#x27;t going to be making any no-animal-testing claims. For all these somewhat negatives, however, I am very pleased with the shampoo for what it achieves with my hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a difference after using this product for a month since I have been plagued with dull, lifeless and frizzy hair for over a year and a half now.  I have tried everything from keratin shampoos to deep conditioners, yet nothing really has a lasting effect.  I tried this because of the Cristophe name and because it is supposed to be a professional quality \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; shampoo.  I love the scent, not too strong yet fresh and fragrant.  I love the rich and substantial lather you get out of about a quarter sized squeeze.  And it rinses out pretty cleanly with no residue or dried out feeling.  Once I blew my hair dry, the scent was activated again so this was a plus, but the overall look was not at all glossy or even shiny.  I guess the condition of my hair is so bad that it will take more than a bottle of shampoo to work magic, but I had high hopes for this one.  All in all, a good shampoo that will cost you a bit more for the name, and will get your hair clean and smelling fresh.  Look elsewhere for a glossy mane.</li>
            <li> After several uses of the Cristophe (of Loreal fame) Professional Glossing Shampoo, I am not that impressed.  My long, fine hair didn&#x27;t appear to have any extra shine.  I think pairing with a Glossing Conditioner from Cristophe might help but I didn&#x27;t have access to one.  I have had better luck with other, high-end smoothing shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> My normal shampoo is sulfate-free Pureology Hydrate; something I can&#x27;t imagine ever leaving in preference to any other shampoo product. But...the SMELL of this Cristophe shampoo gave me a SHAMPOO EXPERIENCE! I can&#x27;t even describe the pure pleasure and bliss of the amazing scent this shampoo has. It smells like something Michael Kors would design, something I&#x27;d love anyway since I have a lot of his perfumes. This shampoo just for the scent, makes it irresistable. Even as delectable as the fragrance is, it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair very long so it won&#x27;t compete with any fragrance you may wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lathers like a typical sulfate-containing shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair like one. I was surprised at how gentle this shampoo actually was on my hair, normally I get a dry feeling but it left it soft and shiny. It didn&#x27;t do much about tangles (which I often get at the ends after wearing my hair straight for a few days), and my Pureology does. The Cristophe also didn&#x27;t fare very well on hair that had substantial hairstyling product buildup; it took two shampoos to get that residue out. (but it smelled so incredible, I didn&#x27;t mind!!)  My coarse, curly hair dried into bouncy shiny corkscrews when I let it air-dry without any additives, only a little bit of frizz compared to normal sulfate shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is orange, making the bottle seem tinted orange. I only mention this because the marketing department of this product picked THE perfect color for this packaging. The bottle LOOKS like the fragrance smells. I know this is such a petty thing, but a blue/green/purple bottle would not have been the same. This product felt 100% cohesive from packaging to fragrance to performance, something that isn&#x27;t often successfully done. It looked, smelled, and felt like a very high-end product.  The bottle is also above-average in quality, I like a rocker cap on my products. It&#x27;s hard for me to fight with a cap in the shower, and this one opened and closed with the lightest touch of a finger. When it fell off my shower ledge, it never leaked all over like many do. Top rate quality packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my Pureology because nothing beats that for my hair, but I admit to cheating on my pepperminty shampoo every once in awhile to enjoy the wicked lather of this Christophe shampoo, and the heavenly scent of it. If I could find a shower gel in this fragrance, I would buy it over and over. I&#x27;d buy this shampoo as a gift for someone, like it that much.d closed with the lightest touch of a finger.

            <li> This shampoo is great and my hair is noticeably more shiny now!  The price is pretty middle of the road but I have nothing but good things to say about this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have the wrong hair type for this- I think it would work better with dry or fine hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any particular \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; when I was done. Other than that it&#x27;s a since, serviceable shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent gentle shampoo that does what it says--my hair is definitely shinier when I use this product.  I liked it so well I got the conditioner too.  With using both of these I get soft shiny hair.  It has a pleasant sweet orange scent that does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> What can you say? It does the job. I get a really good head of lather with one application and never feel the need to do it twice. So it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> The Cristophe professional glossing shampoo did leave my hair very shiny, though a bit frizzy and fly away. The scent is very light and wonderful. Cristophe lathered beautifully and my hair felt very clean. I did have to put product on it after drying because of the frizzy bits.</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo enough that I added the Conditioner to my purchase-basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s very concentrated so that I think cost-wise it&#x27;s on par with the Pantene I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about the &#x27;glossing&#x27; component.  The first I didn&#x27;t notice much glossiness; but after more uses I&#x27;d have to say that my hair does appear shinier.  And it&#x27;s this result that got me curious about the conditioner in this line.  I figure that the results might be even better using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like trying different shampoos definitely check this one out.  I found it produced some wonderful suds while treating my hair gently.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter and I both tried this shampoo and enjoyed it. It has a pleasant smell and does seem to leave hair more shiny. Possibly not a great choice if your hair is already on the oily side, but good for normal and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying Cristophe Glossing Shampoo.  My hair feels soft, smells great and is easy to style but I&#x27;m not seeing an increase in shine/gloss as the name implies.  It would be a solid five stars if my hair looked really shiny!</li>
            <li> This shampoo purports to make hair glossy and shiny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks and I note no difference at all in the shininess of my hair.  Why 4 stars then?  Because it makes my dry over-processed middle-aged hair soft, which is quite a feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;+ Makes my dry hair soft.  I still need a conditioner if I&#x27;ve been driving with the windows down (more as a detangler I guess), but I DON&#x27;T need a conditioner every day.  And that&#x27;s a huge deal with my damaged nasty hair.&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;+ Little goes a long way - nice lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MEH:&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t really buy the marketing about \\&quot;gloss\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, nice lather, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I can definitely recommend this shampoo because it is very pleasant to use.  It smells wonderful (bright, citrus-y, and clean) and has a very clean feel.  A small amount produces a nice lather and it rinses easily and cleanly.  It is a little more difficult to say how effective the &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; quality is, hence the 4 stars.  My hair looks and feels great after using it, but not dramatically different than other shampoos.  I will buy again because it is pleasant to use and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a super-smelly, perfumed, super-lathered salon shampoo, this isn&#x27;t for you.  The smell is fine, but nothing special...kinda like Flex or something else non-offensive, nor is it much in the way of aroma therapy.  I detected no tea tree oil or peppermint stuff.  It&#x27;s just a mild shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, competent shampoo, I think you&#x27;ll like this one fine.  I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s anything all that special for a dude with short hair, but my wife seemed to think it was just fine too (which is something it&#x27;s nice to agree on, if you don&#x27;t particularly enjoy tripping over product every time you get in the shower).  The main thing I got was that it was gentle.  My hair and scalp felt clean, but not squeaky and dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the beauty of this shampoo was this gentleness that made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t traumatizing my hair and skin in the process of cleaning them.  If you have problems with stripped out hair or dry/tight skin, I would say this stuff is worth a buy.  I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;glossing shampoo\\&quot; is supposed to do, but I&#x27;m just going to assume healthier, moister hair holds a shine better...but I&#x27;m no expert.</li>
            <li> Is my hair shinier?  One bottle later, I see no big change.  This smells pretty, and lathers up like laundry detergent--which is rather worrying!--and looks nice in the bottle.  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company about the provenance of the glycerin, I was informed that it&#x27;s plant based, and kosher certified. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this shampoo is pleasant, but not overpowering. I have oily hair, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product that can get rid of dirt without stripping down the oils so much that my body produces more oil. I also live in New York, NY, which means that there is a lot of stray dust, pollution, and random stuff that ends up in my hair. When I follow up with a basic conditioner, my hair is left feeling really smooth and soft. After a week of using the product (once every other day; I don&#x27;t shampoo daily if I can help it), my hair is smoother and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has done nothing special for my hair and I really find it average.  It feels like it has stripped my hair of natural oils, even though it apparently contains \\&quot;Exotic Argan and Monoi oils\\&quot;.  I did not find it to \\&quot;provides instant shine\\&quot; or make my hair silky, as it claims. It also made my hair rough and tangle-y when wet - I definitely needed to use a conditioner with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one stand-out feature of this product is its extreme lather.  Even tiny amounts of shampoo generate tons of lather and it seems to spread throughout the hair well.  This amount of lather is totally  unnecessary to me, but some may find it \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot;.  One benefit may be that one can use a lot less of this shampoo than other shampoos, thus resulting in infrequent purchasing of this Cristophe shampoos - this may make it a good value, despite the somewhat high purchase price (compared to drugstore shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used inexpensive shampoos in the past that have worked better for my hair.  This shampoo may work for others, depending on hair type.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this shampoo, but I can tell a difference.  I have long middle of my back, thick and fine hair.  I simply don&#x27;t have the shine that I once had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was soft and I could tell a difference from the first time I used it.  Every time I have used it since my hair is soft and there is a shine that I did not have before.  It is not a bright shine, but if you are looking for a little more shine and softer hair this will do it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  My hair does look glossy after using this product.  It also feels clean and full after use.  I need to get some other products in this line so I can get the full effect.  I also want to add that this shampoo has a nice mild scent that is so lacking in so many products these days.</li>
            <li> With a name like \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; shampoo, I expected my hair to be sleek and shiny after washing.  My hair was a tangly mess after I shampooed.  I wasn&#x27;t going to use a conditioner because I wanted to see how the shampoo would do on its own, but because of all the tangles I had to use one.  My hair is shoulder length, thick and wavy.  I used this shampoo for a week and didn&#x27;t notice any difference from using the Suave creme shampoo.  Sorry!!&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this, make sure you have conditioner.  It feels like it strips all the oils from the hair, making it easily tangled.</li>
            <li> This gives a smooth dry finish. No yummy feel in your hair after. Pours consistently and does not run about before you apply it. Semi gel semi liquid.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this shampoo at just the right time, as I had been in the process of removing a large maple tree with a chainsaw.  I can tell you that this shampoo did a splendid job of removing sweat, dirt, woodchips and chainsaw oil from my hair, and left it with splendid shine and body too!</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo. It has a very nice, clean scent. Over the use of one bottle, I did notice an improvement in hair shine. It wasn&#x27;t hugely noticeable, and I do get better results with other products (mainly Biolage and Garnier). For reference, I have very curly, coarse, wiry hair that is susceptible to frizzing and very difficult to smooth out, so that undoubtedly accounts for the somewhat lackluster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it did have some results, which is something, and I really enjoyed the smell. I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo in every respect. Not too foamy and leaves hair clean but not dry.There is not much else to say except, that I would buy this shampoo if I could find it at a good price.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was a well rounded shampoo.  It did many things for me, I felt it help to coat my hair follicles to help them from frizzing.  I thought for a shampoo this was a fairly good conditioner, and it smells very nice.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t seem like  a watery mess like many shampoos.  My hair is colored this shampoo did not strip out the color from my hair.  I think this is a great every day shampoo.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  My color treated hair has gotten much, much drier the older I get.  I can tell which hairs are gray under the color by the texture and the amazing ability of sticking straight up like a wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy [[ASIN:B001GTK9SC Sebastian Drench Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Set 33.8 Ounces/1L]].  The price is comparative to this glossing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I used it for two weeks.  He used every other day and I shampooed everyday. We used it alone, with its&#x27; matching conditioner, alternated days of using this and the Drench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I didn&#x27;t see any other difference in my hair.  That&#x27;s not to say that it didn&#x27;t work--it worked just as well as the Sebastian products.  You still need to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smell was great&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t need to use a lot per shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair more manageable&lt;br /&gt;Price was pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I have problem hair. It&#x27;s fine and naturally curly, which means it puffs up like a marshmallow in humid weather. In high wind I look like a troll doll. So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products to help me tame my mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Cristophe Professional Glossing Shampoo did a nice job gently cleansing my hair and it just so happened I ran out of conditioner the same week, so it had the responsibility of standing alone, too (though I had to scramble to find a leave-in comb through product to get a brush through my hair). So, it performed well. Not exceptionally but well. My hair&#x27;s a bit on the soft side, so it really needs shampoos that boost it up a bit and help give it texture. Christophe doesn&#x27;t work so great in that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d also had the companion conditioner it would have worked better, something that&#x27;s often the case, so maybe I&#x27;m not giving it a fair shake. That could well be. All in all, I like the shampoo but probably wouldn&#x27;t gravitate toward it in the future. I need something to give my hair volume and for whatever reason my fine hair just didn&#x27;t perform well with this product.</li>
