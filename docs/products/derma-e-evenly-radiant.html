    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Once again a great product by Derma-E!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look bright!</li>
            <li>the smell is not so pleasant</li>
            <li>but this one doesn&#x27;t feel good and</li>
            <li>I like the way my skin looks and the fact that theses products are made with good ingredients.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s just like having a good skin day every day.</li>
            <li>Good summer cream, but not as moisture as I would like in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the derma e bb cream and loved it, so I was stoked to try this product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very light and pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>I love Derma e&#x27;s night cream</li>
            <li>I use this every day, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so I assume they are both making my skin soft/skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this brand before and really liked it, so maybe it&#x27;s just this particular product.  </li>
            <li>Also, i wish the spf level was higher as i need more protection.</li>
            <li>Paired with the other products I use, it works great.  </li>
            <li>It goes into the skin quickly, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in redness as a result; however the product smells just like Tang to me.</li>
            <li>I received this sample in a Birchbox and this product is the first full size item I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like consistency at first, but got used to it.</li>
            <li>It’s definitely not my Boots No. 7 day cream that I usually use, but for anyone who loves thicker moisturizer it would be wonderful.</li>
            <li>Have had positive comments about my skin since using.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I used it in the winter and didn&#x27;t really have an issue</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on reviews but even after waiting 10 minutes after serum application this product didn&#x27;t go on very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb on the skin very well, you have to massage it in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it really absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, but what is there is a bit off-putting.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the perfect product I&#x27;d given up on ever finding: moisturizers just enough, not loaded with chemicals (scores well on EWG skin deep database, for those who care about such things), broad spectrum SPF, AND doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out.</li>
            <li>I have other lotions by Derma-e that I love and have no problems with.</li>
            <li>It is rich enough for my older skin.</li>
            <li>(I live in NYC).</li>
            <li>I got more immediate results to fade dark spots with two Jessner peels but used this daily before and after.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, not sticky, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>And it is not heavy feeling like alot of moisturizers with SPF in them.</li>
            <li>It has a grapefruit like soft fragrance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream is kinda pasty and it doesnt absorb too well. I love Derma e&#x27;s night cream but this one doesn&#x27;t feel good and it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, and I love it.  Paired with the other products I use, it works great.  Not heavy, not sticky, not greasy.  Very light and pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like consistency at first, but got used to it. Have had positive comments about my skin since using. Has zinc in it, which is a healing ingredient. Just ordered a second jar.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using dermae products. I like the way my skin looks and the fact that theses products are made with good ingredients. This goes on thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product. I must say it is a bit heavy and the smell is not so pleasant but it does get the job done. I noticed a visible difference.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the perfect product I&#x27;d given up on ever finding: moisturizers just enough, not loaded with chemicals (scores well on EWG skin deep database, for those who care about such things), broad spectrum SPF, AND doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out. It&#x27;s perfect. I can&#x27;t even feel it once it&#x27;s on; it&#x27;s just like having a good skin day every day. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Works gradually if you use it every day.  I got more immediate results to fade dark spots with two Jessner peels but used this daily before and after.  Also like that this creme has sunscreen and can use morning under makeup as well as at night.</li>
            <li> Once again a great product by Derma-E!  My skin loves these products  Highly recommended! I use it everyday and my skin is so soft and even.</li>
            <li> This cream is wayyyyy to sticky for the summer months (I live in NYC). I used it in the winter and didn&#x27;t really have an issue but now that its warming up and getting humid it began making my skin oily during the day. Also, i wish the spf level was higher as i need more protection. I wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  I tend to veer away from &amp;#34;Cremes&amp;#34; because i have oily skin.  I received this sample in a Birchbox and this product is the first full size item I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this cream is amazing! Not greasy at all. I really love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Makes your skin look bright!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews but even after waiting 10 minutes after serum application this product didn&#x27;t go on very well. It doesn&#x27;t absorb on the skin very well, you have to massage it in.</li>
            <li> I’ve only been using this for a few days and with the weather changing I cannot really give a conclusive answer on it but I am not a huge fan.  It’s thicker than I like and has a slightly aroma of sunscreen.  Putting on makeup afterwards is tricky because it&#x27;s so sticky and thick.  I don&#x27;t feel like it really absorbs into my skin.  It’s definitely not my Boots No. 7 day cream that I usually use, but for anyone who loves thicker moisturizer it would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good summer cream, but not as moisture as I would like in the winter. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, but what is there is a bit off-putting.</li>
            <li> I am using the moisturizer with this so I assume they are both making my skin soft/skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> This has an odd texture. It&#x27;s goopy in the jar, but then dries immediately on my face -- to the point that it does not feel moisturizing; it makes my skin feel dried out. Not exactly what one looks for in a moisturizer! I&#x27;ve tried this brand before and really liked it, so maybe it&#x27;s just this particular product.  Also, I don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; about it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It is rich enough for my older skin. And does not feel greasy at all. And it is not heavy feeling like alot of moisturizers with SPF in them. It has a grapefruit like soft fragrance. I plan to reorder it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the derma e bb cream and loved it, so I was stoked to try this product. It works well. It goes into the skin quickly, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in redness as a result; however the product smells just like Tang to me. And I&#x27;m not a big fan of that oddly artificial orange smell, especially on my face. I intend to use the rest of it, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Even in small amounts, this lotion stays feeling greasy and sticky throughout the day. My skin breaks out each time I use it. I have other lotions by Derma-e that I love and have no problems with. But this one is not for me.</li>
